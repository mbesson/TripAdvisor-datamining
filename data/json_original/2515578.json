We came back in the right time and got our room. It was clean, reasonably equipped and that is it. The 2 TVs are outdated. The elevator smells really bad (maybe because of the hot weather and the woodfloor). The internet was slow during good part of the night, even just for reading e-mails. The swimming pool is small and the complimentary breakfast is poor (but good). Besides that, I don`t know why to call this hotel a resort. Our choice was misguided because on TripAdvisor Wyndham on April 2012 was 23 out 281 hotels in Vegas (+500 reviews) but Desert Rose was 7 out of 281 (+2400 reviews). My first thought: Rose would be even better(!), but no way. It helped to remind me TripAdvisor must be used as one of the sources of opinions and I should always double check how many stars the resort (hotel) really have before booking it. I didn`t write this review because I was upset with my own choice, but to put Desert Rose in the right place.

As always, it was clean and comfortable. I love that there is a separate bedroom from the living room/dining area. The full kitchen with refrigerator and stove and microwave makes it so much easier to bring back those large Vegas portions from the restaurants and heat up leftovers, which is also a big money saver! The pool was busy with families and since it's not that big we didn't dip in, but will most likely when we come back in the summer. It really is like having your own apartment and since we'd been to Vegas many times before we weren't in a big rush to hit the casinos and did spend some quality time just lounging around the place. The free wi-fi connection was excellent and free HBO kept me amused while I caught up on movies. The front desk is very professional and courteous. Another huge plus is the free breakfast buffet which is open later on weekends. Hot scrambled eggs, ham slices, make your own toast, plus a big selection of cereals and coffees and fruit. Another big money saver. You can eat at the tables set up in the lobby or pile up your plate and go back to your room and enjoy it on your balcony!

There is a store a little ways down Tropicana ( they have the address listed on the refrigerator) and if you want you can go pick up supplies to prepare your own meals and save money. We only picked up a couple of necessities there because we liked trying the different restaurants in town but we had a fridge to store leftovers when our eyes were bigger than our stomachs.

If you have a vehicle, this is a great place, as you can park right outside your balcony. Rooms are spacious and comfortable, with couch, table, kitchen and a bathroom for each master bedroom. Our little problem we had with the resort was getting services to empty garbage and replenish supplies, the idea of the eco program is your linens would be changed on the fourth day. After talking with the front desk 2 times about supplies and garbage, I needed to go directly to the manager. We discussed the problems I was having with housekeeping and resolved the situation. Breakfast is in the main lobby every morning with eggs, cereal, toast,coffee and juice. Nice to get this as it can be very pricey finding breakfast and the high price of the smorgs at the hotels Nice size pool and 2 hot tubs. The proximity of the airport was not an issue for noise at all. We would definitely book again at this resort in Las Vegas", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cNice place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Bet711", "ReviewID": "UR125800144", "Content": "Needing a little updating, but there are many things that make this a great place to stay.

My 10 year old son loved the tv in the living room and my daughter and I watched in the bedroom. The decor was cheery and warm and the place was immaculate! The couch was comfortable and so were the beds. I was able to cook a few times and found the kitchen working perfectly. There are no casino slot machines so there was no smoking which was a huge plus! It was within walking distance of the MGM Grand where we ate dinner. The breakfast at the hotel was pretty good...dissapointed that there were no pastry or bagels, just toast. However, the coffee was Starbucks...piping hot! The pool area was great. Only complaint was that the inside rooms are dark so ask for one facing the outside or the pool, NOT the inner courtyard area which was a bit depressing staring at hotel walls and walkways.

Bad bugs?\u201d", "Author": "Boriski", "ReviewID": "UR125262459", "Content": "We stayed four nights (ave.$54/night incl. tax), and returned for another following a road trip to the Grand Canyon. Before booking accommodation in Vegas, you have to decide what type of stay you want, and get a feel for the different styles. If you want a party-hard, hangover place, this isn\u2019t it. We found Desert Rose to be a peaceful and welcome place to return to each evening, after the trashy, noisy Strip. Overall: It\u2019s fantastic value-for-money in a large suite with kitchen facilities. Unlike most hotels in Las Vegas, there are no surprise, exhorbitant resort fees charged. Best for families or those wanting a quieter non-casino experience a reasonable walk from The Strip. What\u2019s good: This was our 22nd hotel stay in fifteen weeks across North America, and one of the best value for money and largest rooms so far. We had a one-bedroom suite with balcony and full kitchen (microwave, refrigerator, stove). We booked the night before our stay on hotels.com for an average rate of $54/night (incl. tax & breakfast) for three nights. It\u2019s a 15 minute walk through Hooters and Tropicana Hotel carparks to the start of the strip at MGM Hotel/Casino. Our first stay was in a third floor room (facing the internal courtyard), and a third floor room facing a carpark our second stay. Beds were comfortable and the room and bathroom were clean. Free wifi worked well our first stay, but a bit unrealiable and patchy our second. Staff were enthusiastic, friendly, efficient and polite. Plenty of free carparks available. There\u2019s a tiny shop onsite with limited snacks and toiletries, and a guest laundry available (small fee). A bonus free beer, softdrinks and limited snacks are provided for guests for a few hours in the evening Monday through Thursday. Breakfast was included in our rate, and was standard hotel continental (cereals, yoghurt, bagels, toast, juice, coffee and bulk-style scrambled egg & mini sausage). Free coffee available 24/7 in the foyer. Two colour tvs in our suite, with a reasonable selection of channels. In-room safe also available. Potential showstoppers: My partner had 17 bed bug bites, 24 hours after our second stay here. Whilst we can\u2019t guarantee the bites were from here (we stayed in two other hotels within two weeks), and everyone reacts differently (some people take up to 9 days to show a bite, and others don\u2019t react at all), I\u2019d recommend you inspect mattresses, around the bed and furniture & fixtures thoroughly for any bed bug signs (as with all hotels) After our stay, we found two entries (dated 2011) for this hotel, on the bed bug registry website. Minor annoyances: (there weren\u2019t many). Both stays were reasonably quiet but staff can sometimes be a bit loud, yelling and chatting to each other as they work around rooms. Transport: we caught the Westcliff Airport Express bus (WAX) from the airport ($1.50pp) \u2013 it\u2019s an approx. 10 minute walk from the stop at E. Tropicana Avenue (after Kovan Lane) to the resort, but is do-able providing your luggage is small. Bus passes for the gold, double-decker Duece Strip bus are cheaper if purchased off strip. The Duece Strip bus stops nearby the resort (around the corner on the Boulevard, outside the Tropicana carpark) and can take you along the strip and back. Safety/Security: The side exit gates to the facility can be inadvertently left unclosed by exiting guests (staff need to regularly check), as gates have a dampner on them on don\u2019t quite close properly if left to swing shut. This puts guests at risk for uninvited visitors in the resort compound. We witnessed a young man chased by a security guard, attempting to gain entry to the resort through one of these side gates. Also, avoid betting on sidewalk \u2018spot the marble under the cup\u2019 games \u2013 they\u2019re a scam. We watched a guy running one of these ask the watching crowd for a $100 bet to pick where the marble was. A $100 note held up by an audience member was quickly snatched and the guy did a runner.

Breakfast each morning was terrific and getting the evening started with wine and beer served in the main building around the fire place was incredible as well. I like the touch of music that was selected each evening by our server. This gave us a nice chance to visit with other patrons and enjoy the start of great evenings to come. I still can't get over how each employee approached us to make sure our stay was going well. With replies like \"Yes mylady\" and \"yes sir\" made your fill almost like a bit of royalty. We were there over Super Bowl weekend, yet everything was so smooth. You can't beat the location, right off the strip. Walking distance, or short cab rides. We asked the front desk for limo service and within minutes our driver G'Day was transporting us up and around Las Vegas. (Def check out Fremont Experience. AMAZING) We found it cheaper to pay for a limo and not feel rushed taking a cab. After a busy night on the strip, it felt so nice to come back to the Desert Rose, to a welcoming staff and an awesome room. Drinks on the balcony each night gave us the chance to sit and take in Vegas. We brought along a party of 5, and had plenty of room and comfort just a quick hop of the strip. We can't wait to come back and bring the whole family in just a couple of months. Oh, once you get to the Desert Rose, def take time to 'stop and smell the roses.' Several different rose plants around the property are worth checking out. Thank you to all the staff of the Desert Rose who made sure our trip was Unforgettable, and still checks on us to see how we are doing.

Avoid 4322 (and possibly all corner 2 br units), looking old and a very bad room layout. 4322 is better, more on that later. Decent breakfast. Hot food but very basic. Eggs, sausage or bacon, cereal ,breads. Handy to fuel up and included in price is always nice. Seating is a big problem though, although common in hotels, they are very short on tables. Pretty good location, you can get to the MGM quick, especially if you hop the back wall. If you have to walk around Hooters, it can be a bit more of a walk. No courtesy shuttle. The Bad: Looks and feels it's age. Exterior and interior wall surfaces are very 1980 and it ages the facility. They've done quite a bit of updating but age is very apparent. Things like old tube tv's make it look very old as well. The beds are not comfortable at all. Very hard. We didn't sleep well at all and my back felt horrible in the mornings. Maintenance seems to be an issue, our heat didn't work (thus the move to another room on the 2nd day), ice maker didn't work (or was just empty) for all 3 days(this is a pain, there is only 1 icemaker per building, on the bottom floor.) We had to walk to another building which required no less than 4 key swipes and a good bit of walking. Not as clean as i expected. Caulking in the bathroom was mildewed, corners were dirty etc etc. Not horrible but very noticeable. We had to call in maintenance issues no less than 3 times, I don't think i've called maintenance 3 times total in my life.

And this year it has even improved by offering a FREE hot breakfast. Imagine how much money that is going to save you, especially if you are a big family. From the friendly, helpful and welcoming reception to check out there was never a problem. The resort cleaning staff are charming, friendly and helpful. The rooms are incredibly comfortable and don\u2019t be fooled by pictures, they are a lot bigger in real life, at least twice the size of a hotel room if not three. Comfortable, clean and decorated tastefully. A full kitchen with everything you need and then some. The king sized bed is awesome and we slept extremely well. The price is unbelievable for what you actually get. You can pay top dollar and just get a room in a hotel on the strip or pay LESS and get a full on apartment. It is quite and so close to the strip it is almost on it.. Tucked in behind Hooters and the Tropicana and a stones throw away from the MGM. It is in a safe neighbourhood and enough security around to ensure it remains that way. Free internet and breakfast was a great way to start the long days out in Las Vegas. A lovely pool and grounds with ample FREE parking - no valet charges or tipping!. Along with the free breakfast there is free drinks and snacks in the afternoon. There is menu's in the room of nearby local restaurants that delivery at more than reasonable prices. This place will actually save you money staying there. This is certainly a gem of a place.

We checked Tripadvisor and in 7th spot was the Desert Rose, with many glowing reviews, and it was cheap - always a good reason. We finally arrived (29 hour delay in Philadelphia due to delays and fog) to be greeted by a very helpful young lady. She informed us our booking had been cancelled by Expedia as we hadn't turned up. \"Not to worry\", she said and with a few deft clicks of her keyboard and with a sincere and warming smile she handed us our key. We set off out and along the corridor. This was our first impression, which was soon completely obliterated. Those passages are starting to need a very light touch up, which a lick of paint and the the repair / replacement of some of the edges of the carpet would resolve (and I'm being very very picky here). We also passed a couple of the other residents and I must admit I pre-judged them (using the TV stereo-typing of certain cultures) and we wondered what sort of establishment we'd booked ourselves into. These fears were quoshed once we'd walked into our room. It was spotlessly clean, very well appointed with everything from a free safe through to a huge fridge, cooker, dishwasher, and even the essentials of a toaster, microwave, coffee maker (with free coffee bags, sugar & creamer), even a bottle opener. The bed in out one bed suite was what us Brits call a Super King Size (6 foot across), and was very comfy with as many or as little a number of pillows as you'd like. There was even a big TV in the bedroom with HBO & other well known channel on it. The bathroom had everything you needed, including shampoo and conditioner. In the lounge was a big l-shaped settee, which was big enough to sleep on by itself, but very quickly and easily converted into a pull out metal action bed. There was all the bedding, including more pillows in a big cupboard / wardrobe in the lounge area. Finally there was a dining table with 4 chairs around it, that was a mere dumping ground for us. To say we were pleased was an understatement. Next morning we woke early for the breakfast. There's a choice of 4 cereals, plus a granola and yoghurt, 2 choices of milk, 3 choices of fruit juice, you can even have a soft drink if you so desire. There is white and wholemeal bread, 3 catering sized toasters, margarines and a nice choice in jams (or jelly's as the Americans call them). You get scrambled eggs and either some superb skinless lincolnshire-type sausages or bacon as well. Finally, you can get genuine Starbucks coffee - which is available any time of the day. Hint - get there early as it does get packed, although if the weather's nice there is additional seating outside, and on one morning the very popular (and rightly so) sausages disappeared within an hour and due to the unfortunate timing of their next delivery, they had no more left. That was my only very very slight complaint about the breakfast. Best of all, you can load everything up on the polystyrene plates and take it back to your room. 4 evenings a week there is a managers special this included free beer and wine and nibbles. We only managed to see this one evening and the nibbles consisted of dips and vegetables, etc. We were on our way out for a steak and didn't want to spoil our appetite. Outside is a pool (we didn't check to see if it was heated but never heard anyone scream when they got in.) The loungers are very sturdy and comfortable, as my wife fell asleep on them. There are even 2 huge gas barbeques out there for anyone to use. The location is very good. Out the front and turn right and you'll head straight to the Luxor and adjacent Mandalay Bay or Excalibur Hotels in a matter of minutes. Turn left and you walk across the back of Hooters. As you get to main road you can go across to get to the MGM Monorail, left to the junction of the Tropicana, MGM, New York hotels, or right takes you a few steps to Coco's Restaurant & Bakery (I'll do a review of this later). Hint, if you're gonna use the buses catch one here on Tropicana and get a day ticket for $5. If you get one on the strip it's $7. And finally to the staff. I have never met as friendly, courteous and helpful a group of staff outside of a top 5 star hotel. The overall chain owns the Hyatt group and that sort of quality shines through in everything. So, the big questions. Out of a score of 10, what would I give it? - 9.9 (and that's being as picky as a picky thing that's very very picky !!!) Would I recommend this to a friend? Since I returned over a week ago this has been done quite a few times already.

Just returned from Las Vegas and a seven night stay at the Desert Rose Resort. Our party consisted of my husband, two daughters, (21 and 23) and myself. This was a treat for the kids and we needed accommodation that would allow us all privacy. Having done a lot of research I happened upon the Desert Rose which offered two bedroomed apartment with two en-suite bathrooms, ideal for our needs and a fantastic rate for the week, via booking .com. Price included breakfast and managers happy hour for the duration of our stay. Upon our earlier than expected arrival (10.00am) the staff very kindly allowed us to access our suite and we commenced our holiday by time spent by the pool. Reception staff welcoming and pleasant. The suite was well equipped with everything needed for a self contained stay. Beds very comfortable, housekeeping attentive with service every day if required. Pool, reception and communal areas always appeared spotless. Sports/gym room functional and adequate if needed. Block away from the strip, a real pleasure not to be in a casino hotel. Breakfast and the pool facilities do get busy, but fantastic value as all included. (Breakfast didn't change whilst we were there, but there was always plenty of it with staff on hand to replenish if short) Good advice from the concierge re shows and attractions. Regarding comments re helicopters, there are a significant number of flights, we didn't find the noise intrusive and it would impact on a considerable number of other prestigious hotels as they are flying down the strip! The only moan, and it's a very small one: some of the suite furnishings and pool furniture is looking a bit \"tired\" and dated, a refurbish of certain items would not go amiss but overall we had a fantastic time, made very special by being able to return to a clean, well equipped and friendly resort which came at a fantastic price compared to similar properties on the strip.

A tip for those travelling from the UK - you will probably arrive at lunchtime but check-in is not until 4pm - we had to wait around and then got a room at about 3.30pm - we sat by the pool whilst we were waiting so it is a good idea to keep items that you'll need on this first afternoon at the top of your case or in your hand luggage.

We were not disappointed. Check in and check out was painless. We arrived a bit early, so they stored our bags and we were off to explore until check in time. We were on the 2nd floor , of building 2 , in a very spacious one BR suite , it was more like a small apartment ! Large walk-in closet , spacious bathroom vanity(with drawers for extra storage). Add'l closet with in-room safe in the dining area. Super clean , and a VERY comfy bed. Didn't use the kitchen , but it lacked nothing if anyone was inclined to cook ..full size fridge, stove, microwave, coffee maker, toaster , and dishwasher..with cutlery, dishes, glasses, bowls, etc. Complimentary parking, hot buffet breakfast and manager's reception Mon-Thurs 5-7 all the wine and beer you could muster in two hours :-) , Breakfast was crowded, but not if you went early . We often took it back to our suite , and ate there. Suggest you bring along a small tray to do this , as there are none available at the buffet. The coffee cups are small ( with lids available) (Starbucks coffee btw , yum!) ..but we used to take the larger coffee mugs from our kitchen for our morning caffeine fix..or better again , bring along a travel coffee mug to fill up. Many restaurants along the strip , the best bargain was right next door at the Hooters Hotel , a restaurant called the Mad Onion , $9.95 Prime Rib dinner , was excellent as was their chicken & rib dinner , also $9.95. They had 0.25 cent wings after 12 ..and $1.50 Bud products ..and the most awesome server Mikki ..she was a laugh ! The Desert Rose is not too far from the strip , take the shortcut across Hooters back lot . Its approx a $15 cab fare from the airport , be sure to pay cash or they charge an add'l $3 to pay with credit card. We loved the location , and the fact that there was no smoke filled casino to walk through to get to our rooms. Staff were very friendly and accomodating . We arrived about 10 mins too late for breakfast one morning , but one of the ladies who was cleaning up said not to worry she would get me something from the kitchen and came back with two plates of breakfast for hubby and I. Doubt if we'd get that kind of service at a huger property on the strip. The pool area was really nice , get there early to claim a chair if you plan on spending a few hrs in the AM sun . They open @ 7 AM. They also have two hot tubs which are really nice, and a gym ..that we never used .

While the decor was somewhat dated, it was well maintained and surprisingly clean. There is a fully equipped laundry room in every block of suites.

I could've had a good price at one of those hotels too. However, my husband and I were not alone on this trip. It was important for us to be away from smoke, have a kitchen and not have to walk a mile or two just to find our room. My parents were with us and they are in their late 70's and our children are 12 and 8. Not the typical Vegas crowd, huh? We stayed here for 2 nights as part of a 2 week vacation starting at Seattle, and ending at Phoenix (Grand Canyon.) We really liked this resort. We had a 2 bedroom, 2 bath and the kids slept on the sofa bed. We cooked dinner one night after getting groceries at a nearby Wal-mart. (We have dietary restrictions and it was nice to save money too. We had 2 weeks of restaurants....) Everything was extremely nice, clean and felt like home. No need for bed bug spray here. The only reason I didn't give it 5/5 was that the pool was very small and the breakfast below average. My husband didn't let the kids in the pool. We have a pool at home, and he felt it had too many people crowded in it and he was worried about not enough chemicals doing their job. We really didn't have time for it anyway. In 2 days we saw SOME of Vegas, but not anywhere close to everything we wanted to see without wearing out the family. The breakfast was free. We checked it out the first morning along with LOTS of other people. It was extremely crowded with not enough seats. Get there EARLY to avoid that. We cooked oatmeal with fresh fruit in our kitchen instead the next morning. That was way more enjoyable. I had read a lot of reviews about credit card numbers getting stolen after staying here. I can't prove anything, but my credit card number was just stolen this past month. It was the one that I used to secure the reservation online many months ago. My mother used her card to pay the balance upon arrival (only paid one night to hold reservation) and so far hers hasn't been stolen. So watch out. We walked to the Luxor from the hotel and it wasn't much of a walk, even for G'pa. We then walked to the Excalibur, New York New York then across the street to MGM, then back to the Desert Rose. Then G'ma and G'pa stayed in the room for the rest of the day while the four of us ventured out to the Venetian and more doing valet parking with the rental car.

Yes there is free breakfast however its a bit low rent as is the night time 'drinks party' -lots of people filling up, eating as much as they can, in an atmosphere where 'quality' is a dirty word.

At first I wanted to book a large, brash, typical Vegas hotel right on the strip, but I stumbled upon the Desert Rose and as it was reasonably priced with such good review here on tripadvisor, I took the plunge and am so glad I did! The Desert Rose is a smaller, quieter building down at the bottom end of the strip, near MGM Grand & New York New York. Unlike these other hotels which have 1000's of room's with restaurants, shops, casino's & nightclubs all inside, The Desert Rose is basically a large reception area with 4 blocks just behind it. Each block only has 3 floors and besides a small gym & a pool there is little else here. At first I was concerned that by staying at such a smaller venue I was somehow \"missing out\" on the full Vegas experience, but I needn't have worried; after spending a day walking through all the other hotels in the area it was kinda nice to come back to the peace & tranquility of the Desert Rose. The room was very spacious and comfortable, even if the decor was a little dark. Upon checking in I avoided using my credit card (after reading some of the negative reviews on here that all seem to complain about card cloning!) and simply put $100 deposit down which was fully refunded on leaving. (There was no problem doing this and reception didn't seem to mind) There are a couple of things just have stopped me from giving a full 5 stars; a) No Bar; this is the first hotel I have stopped at where there is no bar. Not the end of the world I know but it would be nice mid-afternoon to be able to grab a beer or soda without having to go on a sponsered walk to a nearby bar. b) Repetitive breakfast; The Desert Rose is one of the few (only?) hotels to provide breakfast free of charge, so at first it might sound a bit ungrateful to complain, but by the end of the week I was sick of it and wanted a change. The choice each morning was a selection of cereal, drinks (which included fruit juice or tea/coffee) toast, and 2 hot cooked items. The problem is the hot choices never change; it is scrambled eggs EVERY SINGLE DAY plus the other choice alternates between either bacon or sausgaes. In a week I had scramled eggs & bacon 4 times and scrambled eggs & sausages 3 times. Would it have killed them to throw in some baked beans once in a while? or fried eggs for a change? Also they stop serving just after 9am weekdays so no lie in if you want breakfast here! c) Mon-Thurs 5m-7pm they have a \"happy hour\"; basically there is a little serving hatch that they open where they will give you a plastic beaker of Miller beer, or house red or white wine, so again, not much variety or choice. They also switch on the soft drinks machines from breakfast so you can get juice or cola. It also says \"bar snacks\" but this turned out to simply be a big bowl of pretzels. d) small(ish) pool means fighting for sunbeds. This is a common problem at most hotels, and despite signs stating \"sunbeds cannot be reserved\" there is no enforcement of this rule, and it was not uncommon to see towels reserving sunbeds at 6am in the morning. Despite these minor quibbles it was a very enjoyable stay and I would come again without hesitation!", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cvery comfortable and friendly\u201d", "Author": "Michelle B", "ReviewID": "UR117869962", "Content": "We are Shell Owners and this was our first visit to this property.

I reccommend grabbing a pool seat when you go to breakfast, as like at all Vegas hotels, they fill up quickly. The pool is very clean (I'm a stickler for that) and they provide plenty of towels. The room looked new, clean, and spacious. We could dry our towels and bathing suits out on the patio. We had a view of an air conditioner, but that was no big deal.

This was by far the best deal there was for hotels. Desert Rose only has suites--one bedroom and two bedrooms. Since there were three of us we decided to stick with the one bedroom, and we had a great deal to go along with it! We got the fourth night for a penny deal, which initially had me a bit skeptical about the quality of this hotel (also, because it was off of the strip). When we arrived our feelings quickly changed. The entrance to the hotel is simple, but beautiful and the attendees at the front desk were quick to assist us with checking in. Upon entering our room, we were greeted by a large living room in front of us and to our right, a fully equipped kitchen. It wasn't like many hotels with the tiny refrigerator; this room had an apartment/house size fridge, along with a dishwasher, sink, stove, microwave, plenty of plateware and utensils. We didn't plan on doing much cooking, but to have it available just in case we did was very convenient; in addition to having ample room for leftovers from restaurants and bottles of alcohol. Enough about the kitchen! The living room had a L shaped sofa, television, plus a stereo system with a subwoofer. Very spacious with plenty of room for pre-game dancing. (I do wish they had an ipod/mp3 adapter to go with it, but the radio did it's job.) My friends and I entered the bedroom to find a king size bed facing another television. The room was slightly smaller than an average size hotel room, but average hotel rooms don't have a living room and a kitchen! The bathroom had a huge counter, which is very convenient for girls who need plenty of room for makeup, jewelry and straighteners. The toilet and the shower were in a seperate room from the counter and sink, which prevented any fighting over taking too long in the bathroom. I was very much pleased. Accomodations: Room service brought towels every day, changed the garbage, and washed our dishes in the dishwasher. Monday thru Thursday, there was free wine in the lobby/breakfast area until about 7 or 8 (Can't remember.) The host poured us wine glasses filled to the top of semi-good wine. Breakfast was until 9 or 10 every morning, a little early if you're up until 6 in the morning BUT i got up to get bacon/sausage, toast, and eggs. Distance from Strip: Since we went during one of the hottest months of the year, walking to the strip wasn't very fun, but only about a five minute walk. The walk brings you near the MGM hotel and the New York New York hotel. I would've taken less taxis if it weren't 110 degrees!! Anyway, not too far. Crowd: It was an older crowd. It seemed to be people there on vacation with children or there for business. It did make it a little awkward/funny to walk in from the club at 6 in the morning and see all the older people awake for breakfast already. My one problem was the taxi service! The first two nights(Thurs & Friday) were fine, taxis came within minutes. However, the last two nights and the morning we left, it took nearly a half an hour for the cab to come! I'm from New York so there isn't much patients for slow cabs. All in all, I had a wonderful time in Vegas and Desert Rose was part of such an incredible experience. I would stay here again because of the service and the room. If you feel uncomfortable with passing by a crowd that isn't around you're age (21-30; here for partying) then I would say pass on this hotel. But! if you want a great deal on a room that is more like a one bedroom fully-equipped apartment and you don't mind a 5min walk to the strip, this is definitely the place foryou! I'm 21 and I did not mind the quick glances of the older crowd or the \"you are gorgeous\" comments from the older men. haha. it made vegas that much more fun!!", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cLarge apartment, in good location.\u201d", "Author": "Jojohodgson", "ReviewID": "UR117743098", "Content": "Stayed here for 5 nights and it was great.

When we looked at trip advisor at the time of booking it was number 3 in all hotels in Las Vegas so that pretty much decided our choice. The hotel is located just of the strip, at the same end as the MGM Grand and the tropicana hotels. The resort is set out into several blocks very European holiday style, you enter into a large reception area which doubles up as the breakfast area and general relaxation zone. The doors at the end of this lead direct onto the pool area via a swipe card and into the various accom blocks. The rooms are massive and the kitchen is bigger than most peoples back here in the UK, it has everything you would think of and loads more. A massive USA fridge freezer, and also a coffee maker and they provide the coffee. the seating area and dinner table are good quality and a small balcony off the living room, The bedroom is large with ample wardrobe space both inside the bedroom and also in the living area, the only thing that may put some off is that the bathroom (which has a large dressing area with sink before the loo and the bath) is directly off the bedroom, this could be awkward if you are sharing with someone sleeping on the double pull out in the living room. As part of the price for the room you also got breakfast which is unusual for the US this was ample and of good quality, got very busy though and most people were getting it and taking it to their rooms as very few places to sit and eat it. you also got free drinks in the evenings midweek i think, of beer and wine and some nibbles, this was a nice touch and we did use this a few times. The walk from the hotel felt very safe at night and it took about 10 mins to get to the strip on foot, you could walk past the tropicana and get to the bus stop to catch the deuce in minutes. One point to remember is they don't charge your card until you check out also I did hear one of the reception staff commenting that they would check if one guest had left negative feedback about them on trip advisor.

It is near perfect and a bargain at that. The hotel is located just behind Hooters Casino about a block and a half from the MGM grand. With good weather it takes about 7 minutes brisk walking to reach the MGM grand and you can take a short cut through the MGM and exit on the strip.

Otherwise its fine and nicely located allowing easy access to the strip. In the nights it\u2019s a breeze. The great plus with this hotel is that it provides a reasonable breakfast, which is rare even for most hotels in Las Vegas. Of course you would want to sample some of the sumptuous buffets at the casino hotels from time to time, but a free breakfast helps to cut costs and gives you the power of choice. The other plus is that there is no resort fee charged which can amount to about $20 dollars per room per night at the other casino hotels. The most notable thing about the rooms is that the standard room is 650 square feet!. That's right, with separate living dining and kitchen areas and a patio to boot! In that respect it is very similar to the other all suite hotels that you may be familiar with e.g. Residence Inn, Fairfield Inn and Suites, Springhill Suites and others. You get all amenities e.g. fridge, stove, microwave, toaster, plates, cups, glasses, cooking utensils etc. I was fortunate to book in the summer and the promotion running offered the fourth night for a penny.

It includes a small room with a toilet and tub/shower. The sink is in a good-sized vanity area just outside the bathroom. The bedroom also had a fairly good sized closet.

Also, on our second night there, so \"heavy-walkers\" moved in upstairs and thumped around until the wee hours. But while it's not particularly sound proof between floors, we rarely heard any noise from outside of the building or from our adjoining neighbours. I'd suggest making sure you have a decent idea of where this resort is before you land, if you're taking a taxi. We had to pull over at a gas station and use a tourist book to give our cabbie directions. Also, while anyone who's been to Vegas knows there's a lot of walking involved, that extra jaunt to get from the Strip to the Desert Rose is worth preparing for.

The pool is very small and crowded, but it was too hot to use it anyway during the day. The free breakfast was average, good assortment of cold cereals, usual eggs and toast, one kind of whole fruit; the coffee was very good. Get there early as it gets very crowded. We passed on the manager's wine/soda in the afternoon after seeing the crowds (and the only appetizer was a few cauliflower). On the one hand, this hotel was too far to walk to the strip on a 100+ degree July day, ~15+ minutes (we did it a few times, but it was tiring), but it was really nice to get away from the noisy (!) strip and huge crowds at the end of a day. In cooler weather it would be a very easy walk. Taxis were readily available for the few minutes drive to the beginning of the strip, or the 15 minute drive to the end of the strip (~$20-$25). A bus pass is available for $7 for one twenty-four hour period up and down the strip, but the wait in the heat is brutal in summer (the bus is $5 for one single trip). The hotel is a $12 ride from the airport, very convenient. We stayed for the beginning of a rafting trip and it was very convenient and clean, but in retrospect should have switched after our trip to a more upscale hotel on the strip for the ease of sightseeing and resting midday in a nice spot. (Be warned: There are NO benches or chairs in the ENTIRE city of Las Vegas, unless in front of a slot machine!) The concierge was enthusiastic but disorganized and the wait was long to talk to her, she seemed to be often talking to friends instead of the customer. The one computer was very slow and again the wait to use it could be very long, but that was fine. Overall good for an inexpensive and quiet option near the airport and fairly close to, but not on, the strip.

Being close to MGM Grand, it's walking distance from the Vegas Monorail. Crossing the busy intersection was dicey at first, but once you know where to go, it's easy and safe. One thing my husband and I loved was that this \"resort\" is NOT a casino. There are no gambling halls, slots, or anything on the property to make it crazy and noisy at night. However, it's convenient to gaming and Hooter's is right next door, so that's an accessible place whenever you're wanting some gaming. It's also VERY secure. You'll need an access/room key-card to get from place to place in the building. Drawbacks: the ONLY ones? We did have a leaky shower faucet. We reported it, and it still leaked the next day. Breakfast (which is delicious & complimentary) was the same both days, without variety. However, most Vegas resorts don't even offer comp. breakfast, so we were still pleased with both the hot and cold offerings. The sausages were especially yummy. Lastly, getting to the strip for the first time on foot is daunting. Be sure to ask staff to show/explain the safest way to go. I highly recommend Desert Rose.

I have created an extensive Trip Advisor 'Trip List' which details the numerous significant attractions I visited/the places I stayed in enroute and includes a tour map and (hopefully) lots of helpful information/Internet/Trip Advisor links. Trip Advisor haven't (yet ?) properly integrated it for direct access: to get to it you start by doing the required action to see my individual TA reviews/photos/videos (which I hope you will !) by mouse-clicking my profile 'name' located in the top-left corner of this review, below my profile picture of the Giza Pyramids, then mouse-clicking the blue 'Reviews' link from the resulting pop-up window. As well now being able to see my reviews, you can then access my Trip List by looking in the left-hand 'Contributions list (there you can also see my photos/videos direct) and select 'Trip List' - it is entitled 'Las Vegas + South Utah National Parks + Monument Valley, Arizona - May 2011'; click the title link and away you go - easy, NOT ! (TA admin please note !) For accommodation my price range was $50-$60incl/night (occasionally up to $90incl due to local 'inflation'), for non-smoking rooms in establishments which were best located for visiting the nearby venue (sometimes for several days), that were TA reviewed as quiet/clean and should be well-equipped (eg fridge, wi-fi); I was not too bothered about what eateries etc were in the local area, nor if there were things like a swimming pool, as my days were maximised for visiting the associated National Park/hiking etc, the room being used to reflect on the day/'unwind'/sleep in ! ------------- The Desert Rose was the first place I stayed in, on arrival in the USA landing @ McCarran - $14 for a taxi from there to the hotel. Booked via Expedia at $60incl/weekday night for a 'One Bedroom Suite - 650 sqft'. Pre-paid with Expedia also meant I didn't have to deal with credit cards, considering the recent problems the DR has had with details being illegally accessed and used for fraudulent transactions with your card account..... As expected, the location WAS excellent for accessing the LV 'strip' and also public transport as there were stops less than 5mins walk away. The hotel setting is remarkably quiet considering the location, but even from a 1st floor room don't expect any outside views of anything other than the sides of adjacent buildings or hotel rooftops. So my balcony was fairly pointless, but I could see that ground floor rooms which face inwards could offer the opportunity of a central 'courtyard' view - except you have zero privacy from other rooms and residents walking by. The check-in staff were efficient and courteous, the centrally-located reception also houses a concierge-type desk corner with tourist pamphlets and useful maps and the adjacent seating/serving area for breakfast. The room was quite outstanding; the fully-equipped kitchen is perhaps a bit overkill, but you have a very handy dining table, spacious TV lounge and bedroom with hand basin area + en-suite bath/shower room with WC. It was 90 degrees+ outside and the integrated aircon worked very effectively. Everything was clean, smart and tidy and pleasantly soundproofed - no complaints at all and no bed bugs (I have never had them in ANY bed in ANY hotel and am of the opinion that reviews which mention them are malicious !). Breakfast was surprisingly good, offering scrambled eggs/sausage, fresh fruit, yoghurts as well the usual toast etc and the staff were quick to re-supply and tidy up; polystyrene plates/cups and plastic cutlery (yuk !), but you can't have everything I suppose ! You have the option of eating outside near to the pool area, which makes for a pleasant start to the day and keeps you away from the hiatus around those busy food serving areas... I've had little remarkable to say about the hotel or room itself as there is not much to quibble about and everything is so good. For a comfortable and clean hotel, very well located in the happening area of LV which is also reasonably priced you can't really go wrong with the Desert Rose. Add quiet surroundings, a well furnished room, a better than average breakfast and good access to public transport and it seals the deal !", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ponca City, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place for Families!\u201d", "Author": "jandk1", "ReviewID": "UR113513452", "Content": "1st place we stayed when arriving in Las Vegas.

Cant to compare, because of different sizes, different services (casino, entertaining, etc...) and so on. Hotel is situated right next to Hooters or Tropicana or MGM (few yards away). Somebody told me that is not possible to go there by walk and I need to use a car, but thats not true. You just need to cross the highway using crosswalks... so its not that complicated. Duke Ellington street is probably the quietest location on the strip, or just close to the strip (if meaning by monorail stations). So you are not disturbed by a noisy casinos and other typical attractions. Desert Rose Complex is big enough to get lost while trying to find your apartment. But its not a big deal as the huge MGM. Next to the reception desk is the small shop with some amenities and snacks for a long night - big surprise - its really cheap. As usual, you need to put your credit/debit card or cash as a deposit. Early this year there was a problem with some credit card scams, so I ask for a cash deposit - without any problem. Dont know if its solved now, so Im not sure if to recommend to do the same thing as i did. Apartment is big enough except a really tiny bathroom. Resort is offering toiletries for free, so you dont need to bring yours. Kitchen is also fully equipped. I dont know if my apartment was sanitized, but it smelled like an antibacterial solution (windows opening was not helpfull). The other thing is, that furniture should be refurbished (its a bit worn). Resort is fully equipped with internet, but aware of speed restrictions when its fully loaded - same as MGM or other hotels.

Cutlery and crockery is all plastic. The 2 bed suites have an ensuite shower room and a bathroom with shower over the bath. Pool area gets very busy especially if hot, they could do with a few more shady areas or umbrellas. If you are walking then the quickest way to the strip is to go towards Hooters but then walk along the back of Hooters along the back wall of the DRose i.e. left out of the car park. You can then cross the Tropicana car park and round to the front of the Tropicana. If you intend using the Duece bus (7$ for 24 hours) the bus stop outside the Tropicana is much easier as the next stop up at the MGM can get very busy - the Tropicana stop bus ticket payment doesn't take cash so either pay on the Duece though you must have right money or pay by card in the machine. If going back on the bus then get off at the excalibur and cross over the footbridge. Don't bother with the monorail as it runs behinds the hotels and at $5 for one trip is expensive.

There was nothing I would really consider a 'con', but I will add some 'be aware's: * Yes, it is within walking distance from the strip (took us a good 7-10 minutes to get to the MGM) but I would highly recommend having a car. Wouldn't want to, and didn't, make the trek more than once. I love walking and enjoyed our 'stroll' (LOL) from the Venetian to the MGM, but didn't like the walk from the MGM to the Desert Rose, and am not sure that I'd feel safe making that walk without my husband.

It's adjacent to Hooters hotel/casino and a very short walk to the Tropicana, Luxor, Mandalay, and MGM. There is a Coco's eatery, AM/PM gas station, and Motel 6 also nearby, and it was about a 10-15 minute drive from the airport. It's a 3 story property made of up 4 buildings, and each building has its own parking lot and laundry facility ($1.25 wash/75 cent dry). The pool area is shared by all 4 buildings and was always packed each time we walked by. They also offer a free breakfast, but for most people it's barely more than a snack. The selection is limited to eggs, sausage, bread, cereal, and bananas/apples and yogurt, plus juice. They offer the breakfast from 6-9am in the lobby and it's a pretty small area to have so many people. We noticed a ton of kids and teens at the property, and a few convention types; not a great place for singles, honeymooners, or seniors. On the plus side, this is like having your own apartment; each apartment comes with a fully stocked kitchen, with stove, microwave, blender, coffee pot, hand mixer, utensils, etc, and cookware. You can literally bake a cake here or any other fancy meal, which we did to save money. The downside is that you'd need a car to make use of the kitchen and go buy groceries - there isn't a grocery store nearby. The rooms and bathrooms (with tub) are very spacious and there is ample closet space and lighting. Each unit has two or more televisions, and also a sleeper sofa in the 1-bedroom unit. The noise level was fair - at night we could hear some walking/heavy footsteps but nothing too bad. You can definitely hear kids running through the halls and suitcases being dragged around because the corridors are tile and carpet. The corridors are also open-air so during the summer I imagine it'd get very hot walking to/from your room. The workout room had 4 treadmills, a bike, an elliptical, weight machines, and some towels/water. I was there early morning and there were always 2 or 3 people with me. The only thing this hotel lacked was a solid Internet connection. It's a wireless connection on your room or the lobby, but it was always down because of too much user traffic.

They never were - after repeatedly calling them for 3 days in a row (I was getting answers ranging from \"you should get the emails in 10 min\" to \"our email system is down\"), I was finally told to go online and get the updates myself. With that accomplished, I felt that we were all set. However, the changes were not communicated from the central reservations to the hotel! So people had problems checking in because in the hotel system, the \"old\" names still appeared. That was quite an aggravation. It seems baffling that the two systems are not linked. So I recommend this hotel, but with reservations. (My ratings are based on the experience with my reservations - took some points off). If you have to change your reservations, call both the central reservations and the hotel to confirm.", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent stay for the family\u201d", "Author": "JimCalgary_Canada", "ReviewID": "UR103289986", "Content": "Like the other reviews we enjoined the hotel,, pool, breakfast.

Friendly workers, friendly front desk, concierge. Internet wi fi and also a computer for guest use in lobby, plus printer. It was not working the morning of our departure home, so the staff at front desk cheerfully printed our airport boarding passes and even helped my husband change our seats on the flight, plus pay online for our checked bag! Especially if you have a car, this place is great. You can leave the hustle & bustle of the Strip (which is a 1minute car ride). Easy parking practically right at your front door. Felt very safe, key swipe to get into hotel area. Only 3 floors so elevators came immediately when you pushed the button. All the casino hotels have FREE parking so easy to go back and forth when going to the Strip. I would not stay anywhere else!!! If you are looking for excitement the second you step out of your room, however, you might want to be in one of the casino/strip hotels. If you don't want a million people within in view of your hotel doorway, then Desert Rose is a GREAT choice! And very close to the airport, so no worries about getting there on time due to traffic. The only drawback is occasional noise from the airport but it did not bother us. Pool area was nice, clean and there were plenty of towels available in that area. Breakfast was very adequate, something for everyone. If I am back in Vegas anytime soon, I would definitely stay here.", "Date": "March 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay anywhere else!\u201d", "Author": "sashaann", "ReviewID": "UR99652576", "Content": "My one problem with the hotel was where we were located. I had made the reservation around 9mths before arrival and requested an upper floor room partly for security and partly so as not to be disturbed by people above. However on arrival we were allocated a room on a noisy corner (we had young children) on the ground floor and I did feel that this was in part maybe because we were \"naieve brits\". However it was a quiet time of year and apart from a couple of nights there was no one staying in the room above. If we were to return I would make the point about the room allocation. On to the positive :-) We had a two bed quite which was perfect with the children and gave us lots of space. It was really comfortable and more than met our needs ( a shower cap would be nice though ;-) ) and we had no problems. Breakfast was fab and more than met our needs and the managers drinks were a really nice extra. The staff were lovely, really friendly and helpful and fully approachable but not overbearing. The hotel is only a few minutes walk to MGM and from there straight on to the strip, the monorail runs to MGM and if driving then very easy to access and you can easily avoid the strip (although we found traffic flowed well whenever we drove down there). It was great to avoid the casino hotels and get away from the hustle and bustle of the strip and I would most definitely stay there again, I would not even consider anywhere else - particularly with the children. As a whole we found Vegas was a great place to take the children and all my previous concerns that it may not be the best place for a family trip vanished very quickly. Would recommend having a car as there are some great trips you can do in to the desert and DRR makes a great base for visiting Vegas and the surrounding areas.

Every time they were very courteous and answered all my questions. I didn't want to leave my credit card with them because of their history of the credit card fraud. The hotel requires a credit card at the time of check in. So I bought one of those credit 'gift' card. Since they don't accept debit cards, VISA and MASTERCARDS do say debit card on the card, so I didn't buy them, instead I bought an American Express Gift Card for $100. They require $100 for any breakage for the hotel. Since I was using a $100 gift card, I was then required to pay for my stay upfront. I paid in cash. They accepted. At check-out, I was given my deposit of $100 back in cash. Because I told them to keep the $100 from the gift card (too much hassle to get the credit back on the card). Everything worked out perfectly! They totally understood of the precaution I was taking. They said that it was something they had no control over that it was the credit card network. We stayed for 2 nights and the service was GREAT! They say, they have a Continental Breakfast, (I was thinking coffee and donuts) it's so MUCH MORE. Starbucks coffee, bagels, juice, cereal, fruit. You'd think it's the same every morning but the 2nd morning, they had waffles! We were very impressed! Overall, it is too bad that such a great hotel had this mishap but I think the hotel itself is a victim. I feel bad for those people too, because it's a pain to have restore your credit card.

Instead of fixing their system, they are putting their wellbeing (insisting on a credit card for 'security') over their customers. They did not even mention this risk to us on checking in. They do not care, and would rather have your credit card charged thousands of dollars in fraud purchases so long as they can have your details on system for 'security' in case you steal one of their (cheap!) pillows or towels or whatever it else it is they feel they need to protect. Please reconsider staying here, and read reviews carefully - there are many 4 and 5 star reviews for the Desert Rose on this site but if you read them, you will see that these customers (including myself) have had their credit card details stolen from this hotel. The hotel has even acknowledged responsibility on tripadvisor. I imagine there are many more cases, with people not realising that this hotel is the source of the copying, or even those who have left positive reviews before seeing the fraud charges on their cards. Yes this place is cheap. The location is not too far from the strip, and a free breakfast is always nice, but is this worth it in exchange for having your card and identity stolen? Stop and think about the hassle involved before you book. I had my credit card copied from this hotel (as confirmed by tracing by the bank). It made the rest of my trip terrible as I couldn't book further hotels/buses/flights online without a card. I also had to spend a lot of money and time on contacting banks and police. I now have the trouble of going home and dealing with my mobile phone service which has been cut off, in addition to switching over details to my new card for internet services, and everything else. I spoke to the Manager of this 'institution' which dares to call itself a 'Resort' and yet he was completely unapologetic and seemingly completely uninterested in rectifying this problem in the long term other than claiming he had 'forensics' working on the system. The bottom line is that they have a problem, have not done anything to fix it, have continuted to swipe credit cards, and will not do anything to protect your details and money.

We stayed for a week and were not disappointed. The hotel is located near McCarran International Airport and the southern end of the strip and within easy walking distance of MGM Grande, Hooters, Tropicana, Luxor, Mandalay Bay and others. The Las Vegas Outlet Center with some very reasonably priced designer shops is only about 5 minutes drive past the airport. There are plenty of different eating places nearby. When we arrived at the hotel, the check-in was quick and we were offered a choice of a number of one-bedroom suites. We settled for one on the 3rd floor facing the inside courtyard as we were told that would be quieter. It was definitely quieter considering that the hotel is very near the airport and the strip. There was a lift to all floors. There is free parking for guests and access to the hotel is through doors/gates by using your room keys. The accommodation was very clean, spacious and well furnished. Included in the accommodation was a balcony, a living/dining room which had large sofa and large couch which could be used as a single bed, large TV and a radio receiver with sound system (including a subwoofer), large cupboard with an iron and an ironing board, fully fitted kitchen with all cutlery and utensils provided down to paper kitchen towel, scourer and washing up liquid. Also included, a coffee maker, toaster, jug blender, huge fridge freezer, 5-hob halogen cooker with large oven, large wall mounted microwave oven and a dish washer! What else could one want? The bathroom was large enough with a bath which included a shower. The shower was very powerful and invigorating. The bedroom was large and had the second TV, plenty of drawers for storage and a cupboard with ample hangers and hanging space. There was a personal safe in the cupboard.The bed was very comfortable, one of the best I have slept in. It was made up daily and towels changed when requested. The service provided by the maid was excellent. A laundry room is located in each of the blocks on the ground floor and very cheap ($1.75 for a wash and $0.50 for 66 minutes drying). Continental breakfast is included and although not huge by American standards, it was more than adequate with a choice of sliced bread, muffins, bagels, butter and jam, cheese, boiled eggs, fruit, tea, Starbucks coffee, fruit juice and sodas. You can eat in the lobby or take the food up to your room. 5pm to 7pm every Monday to Thursday was Manager\u2019s Happy Hour with complimentary snacks and drinks (beer, wine, tea coffee, soft drinks etc.) There is free wi-fi and a stand-alone computer in the lobby with complimentary printer for guest use and a small shop for essentials. There is a gym, swimming pool and a hot tub but we did not use any of these. The service from all the staff was excellent.

When we checked in, we were led to a room on the first floor. All seemed fine, so we left to wander the Strip. When we returned at about 8:30pm, I noticed that there was a radio playing somewhere in the apartment. To my horror, realized that it wasn't playing in our room, but in the bedroom above us, and playing so loudly that we could hear the DJ's commentary from our room. Okay, so at 8:30, I'm not going to say anything, but at 10:30 we had had enough. I called the front desk, they sent some security guy to first listen in our bedroom (my husband was in bed...it was ridiculous) and then we think he went upstairs. We don't know what happened for sure because the radio sounded exactly the same, if not louder after he supposedly went up there. I called the front desk, and seeing how the hotel seemed not nearly at capacity, asked to be moved to another room. This was accomplished pretty quickly. We settled in for the night around 11:30. At 2 am, we were awoken by the sounds of people stomping in the room above us. The ceiling makes this horrible crackly sound (which I've only heard one other time, at a Holiday Inn in Niagara Falls, but that's another story). That wasn't the worst part. When our upstairs neighbors went into their bathroom, you could hear the sounds of EVERYTHING they did in there (use your imagination, I'm sure it's sufficient). This stomping and bathroom activity went on until 5:30am, or the time we had to get up for our flight. When we complained at the front desk, \"unhelpful\" would be an apt phrase to describe the reaction. Never again. To make a long story short, I know a lot of people come to Vegas to NOT sleep. But when you stay at a non-casino, off the beaten path hotel that advertises as the Desert Rose does, you don't expect to be kept up all night by cheap construction and inconsiderate guests.

For the down side we were happy how close it was to the trip, within walking distance, but after walking to the strip and back at least once a day we were very tired of walking and if we stayed here again would probably only do so with having rented a car.

In fact a number of those attending liked not having to walk through the noisy casinos to get places & the ease of having a car parked close to the room plus no charge for parking. Other plusses are; 1. Very clean 2. Great to have a living room area and furnished kitchen 3. Full length mirror in the bedroom 4. Has a safe 5. Very nice area by the pool where you can barbecue & relax. The staff was helpful in getting us (about 15 of us) situated. 6. Extremely helpful staff 7. Helpful concierge who recommended getting discount show tickets at TIX4 Tonite offices. TIX does have great deals. 8. Good healthy free breakfast! Foods included hard boiled eggs, cereals, several choices of fruit including fresh fruit, toast, toaster waffles, cottage cheese, juices, coffee and tea. It was more than a simple continental breakfast. If you want cooked eggs to order, fancy omelets, pancakes, etc., you'll need to go out. 9. Free internet. 10. It is not far from the strip - about 2 blocks from MGM. 11. Rooms were quiet. My cons are 1. The lights could be brighter over the sink in the bathroom. 2. The lobby could use a 2nd computer - possibly designated to help those who want to do online airline check ins. There is only 1 for guests & some people were not abiding by the 15 min. rule.

Rated #4 in Vegas? Don't believe it. It certainly wasn't a good experience for us. We had a 2 bedroom suite. We should have rented 2 adjoining rooms in a hotel on the strip for the same price. Many of the hotels are running good deals. Go there instead. Carpet layers started in our building at 8 a.m. The noise sounded like someone was pounding on our bedroom walls. If we had been warned, we never would have stayed here. The new carpet was definitely needed. The carpet was very worn and shabby in the hallways, so so in the rooms. I could not take a decent shower. It was impossible to adjust the water temperature. With 1/8\" adjustments I finally got the water from hot to very warm. The next 1/8\" would make it cold. I finally settled for a little too hot and stood out of the flow of water to wash. Then mid-way through my shower it went to ice cold. Other irritations: remote for TV didn't work, light bulb burned out, loose electrical plate in kitchen that sparked when I unplugged the toaster, broken shade in the bedroom, no room for any personal items in bathrooms. (They looked nice but were not very functional) sparse breakfast ended at 9 during the week (Come on, this is Vegas for heaven sakes.) I reported all our problems to the front desk in person about an hour before we checked out and asked the rep to check with the manager for a reduced rate. This was my error. I should have spoken to the manager directly. When we checked out I was told the rate was not reduced because we were already paying much less than everyone else. I asked why we had such a good rate and they didn't know. They claimed everyone else was paying almost twice as much. I had booked through the hotel so I don't believe for one minute I had such a great rate. In fact, I just called to check their rates and they are the same as what I paid. They did offer to extend our check out. Hello, the car is packed and at the curb, we are leaving. The rep at the desk asked if I knew how to get to the 15. He indicated I could take Tropicana and stay in the left lane. You can't turn left on Tropicana and you can't make U- turns when you go right. They couldn't even direct me out of there correctly.

Having seen reviews, I thought this place must have some shortcomings. I was wrong. After arriving from Australia via LAX on an early morning flight, we arrived at DRR at about 9am, hoping to check in. No you can't check in till 4pm, (which I knew, but it never hurts to try). They stored our bags and we wandered up to the strip (10 - 15 min leasurely walk). As this was our 1st ever trip to LV we were excited to be in Sin City. After walking the streets we got back about 6pm and checked into our room. We had a courtyard room that had a view of Hooters and MGM in the distance. Over the next 10 nights, my wife and I searched for faults with DRR. We even played the \"Let's find a grumpy staff member\" game and lost. Even at 5am everybody was cheerful...front counter staff, cleaners etc. I would recommend anyone to stay here, unless you want a casino, then you wouldn't stay here anyway. Only a short walk to MGM monorail station across Tropicana Blvd. We missed breakfast most days, but we had a couple, basic but thats all you need as you eat yourself stupid on the strip anyway. Pool was great, as was the hot tub, perfect for the long walks we did. We were in LV for a wedding at the Bellagio with friends who stayed there and at the Jockey Club, and looking at DRR we got the best value. $1100 for 10 nights for a room with full cooking facilities and seperate bedroom - what more could you as for. Problems? Picking at straws here - well our A/C was a bit noisy, but as soon as you stepped outside into 90-100 degrees, you did not care. After 1 night the AC was bearable and did not intrude as we set it to low (70degrees).

One word of warning about the third bed / matress / torture device under the setee - don't use it unless you are prepared to bend yourself into a shape that nature didn't intend so you avoid getting springs stuck in your back.

The rooms were clean (and trust me, we checked after hearing about all the nasty insect infestations out in the east, such as New York city). Sure the carpets are older and the TV's are older, but that we absolutely the last concern we had! The bed was super comfy with plenty of bedding and enough pillows for six people, let alone just the two of us! The room had a coffee maker (unheard of in the hotels), a full kitchen, a dinette, mounted wall safe, super comfy couch, fantastic balcony (again unheard of in most hotels), great bathroom area (shower pressure was great!) and a TV in the living room area and one in the bedroom. The cleaning staff were excellent, and we loved the front desk group. We didn't like our initial room, and since we were there for 11 days, we wanted a pool view room. We only had to wait a day, and they were able to accomodate us. The pool by the way was great. Very clean, and warm. The only downside was that there could be more lounge chairs (and there were two that were not in great shape. The location of this resort is fantastic! It's right behind the Hooter's Hotel (and we heard NO noise from there) but the bonus was that the Hooter's security guards rode around on their bikes all day and night, so we felt 100% walking to and from the Strip. Also, the Strip is maybe a 10 minute walk from the resort (and if you cross the street, and there are walk lights, you can be inside the MGM in probably less than 10 minutes). We'd like to thank everyone on Trip Advisor who recommended this resort! We are more than pleased and will stay again! We did take advantage the continental breakfast, but were always away during the wine and beer complimentary get together! We'll have to come back soon and check that out!

Parking free, easy to access and in front of the hotel. We found it was only around a 10 min flat walk to the strip. Vons supermarket with plenty of parking is about a 5-10 min drive away and there is a Del Taco right beside. We didn't take advantage of the included breakfast as it finished to early for us at 9am. When you work all year the last thing you want to do is get up early, shower and get ready to go to breakfast when on holiday! It would be great if the time was extended to say 10.30am as in several other places we have stayed. Our only complaint really is there were 3 of us staying - myself, husband and adult daughter and they always only left 2 sets of clean towels each day. We had to ring every day to get another set of towels. I would have thought the housekeepers would have a note of how many guests are staying in each suite. The suite was very quiet apart from a loud humming in the bedroom wall which we think may have been the air con thru out the building as it would come and go. I noted with interest other guests comments about their credit cards being used fraudulently while staying at around the same time we were there. Our stay was prepaid but our card was swiped by the hotel. We had 10000.00 Yuan charged on our card a few days later and had never used our credit card at all in the USA, nor bought anything overseas so don't know where our card was 'hacked' as it didn't leave our possession or sight.

It's incredibly quiet, considering you're located behind the Tropicana and next to Hooters. The staff is wonderful, free breakfast is ok...a little heavy in the bread area, but what the heck, it's free. We only made it to happy hour once, which wasn't much of a big deal for us. The real issue came on our return trip. At this point we had stayed in five different hotels in that many cities, and were happy to be back at the Desert Rose - our favorite of all. Upon arrival to our room (we were in a different building than the first visit), I immediately noticed the carpet looked filthy and worn. As we walked through the suite, the sofa was also very heavily worn, frayed and appeared to be quite dirty. Needless to say, we were quite surprised, and disappointed, considering what our original suite was like. Since we were so exhausted, and didn't want to move again, we decided to just deal with it. We knew we wouldn't be spending much time in the room, and aside from the carpet, the bed appeared to be fine.

Free wi-fi is a must for us, which they had, but morning connection was sporadic, guess there were too many people trying to access it. The location was great for us, we had a rental car but only used it to go buy groceries. Of course, on the Vegas strip you're going to walk and walk no matter where you are.

It was a quiet location, which we loved, and we never felt unsafe in the area even walking late at night.

Room was really nice, it was no Bellagio but we were really happy it was modern, had two separate bathrooms. The large fridge was very welcomed. A previous review mentioned pigeons etc. yes there were some around but it seems the resort has put up wiring to try and keep them off the balconies - they weren't an issue. I am not a fan of housecleaning and put up 'do not disturb' signs so cant comment on that. The smallish pool wasn't too overcrowded or noisy, many 30+ people there and a couple of kids. Spa/whirlpool was small but hot and not many people in it. Continental breakfast was average. I was happy sticking to the toast and fruit loops each day, you wouldn't 'feast up' there. During the week (mon - thurs) they had complimentary beer/soda which was great to bring into the pool and relax. sleep was fantastic, beds were very clean and fresh/well made and pillows were highend pillows. Some mornings at say ?7am? you could hear a noisy truck with reverse beepers but I guess we should have been up to maximise our days anyway. There was a slight smell outside around the Hooters/Desert Rose front street. You couldn't smell this at the pool or inside the resort, it was not a dealbreaker. I would estimate a 10min walk to the strip, but considering the strips size it would be maybe 30min walk to where all the happening stuff is (Bellagio fountains). Alternatively you could just pop over to MGM next door which is the last stop for the monorail and pay $12 for a 24hr pass. I would recommend this place to people wanting to escape the noise and save a bit of money esp. for larger groups such as ours (2 couples). Check-in was quick (1 person in queue). Given the amount of walking required this is not the place to stay if you want to do multiple trips to the strip in a day. It is great if you want to go out once and come back once in a day. I would definitely come back here again if was trying to save money with my friends, but if i wanted a glitzy, easy accessible, high end place for a romantic get away and was prepared to pay 50% more I would stay at Paris.

However, our taxi driver didn\u2019t know the place by name, so you can tell them it is near the Hooters Hotel and give them the address and they should be able to find it. \u2022 The lobby and check-in area are quite spacious and nice to park yourself for a while if you get there a bit early before your check-in time. \u2022 Staff offered to check us in early once the room opened up, which was nice since we got there at about 11AM (the only flight we could take to Las Vegas directly from Cincinnati.) \u2022 Continental breakfast was included, but I found it a bit lacking knowing that I could get a full buffet breakfast at other hotels\u2014even if I had to pay. \u2022 The facilities seemed a bit old and tired overall (my son often made fun of the squeaking elevator doors). \u2022 While the number of people staying at the hotel, I found the pool small and crowded and the water rather dirty (you can\u2019t see very far underwater even with goggles on). \u2022 Rooms were spacious but were a bit noisy with a constant irritating hum of the air conditioner. \u2022 Speaking of which, the air conditioners to the bedrooms were a bit weak but the main living room was okay. \u2022 The TVs were old and still \u201cstandard\u201d and not widescreen or even HD. The channel selection was good, though, including Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network for those with kids. \u2022 Internet connection to our iPod Touches and iPhone was slow and unreliable. We had to manually reconnect any time we turned our devices on from sleep. \u2022 Not very convenient if you want to walk to a local store to buy groceries, especially if you don\u2019t have a car. \u2022 Not a good location if you just want to set out to have a quick drink or bit to eat. You\u2019ll need to walk a bit to one of the hotels. Being that the resort is supposed to be more of a \u201cresidence\u201d, I would say this is probably not high on the list of someone staying at this resort, but something to keep in mind nonetheless. \u2022 On one day, when we came back to our room at 2:30 in the afternoon noon, housekeeping still was not there to make up our rooms. When I called housekeeping, I was told that rooms are cleaned \u201crandomly\u201d and that I had best schedule a time. I found this quite odd. \u2022 When I gave my feedback on the above areas that needed improvements to the staff checking me out, all I was told was that they would relay the comments to the manager. I\u2019ve yet to hear from him or her! Overall, I would give Desert Rose a miss unless your priority is space (as long as the air conditioner has been well-oiled!) and you need nothing much else, especially if you don\u2019t have a car where you can go out and pick up some food and drinks for your family. If you are coming with kids and need a want to be in walking distance of restaurants or a few drinks, then best to go to one of the more popular hotels on the main strip. You\u2019ll enjoy yourself a lot more with the convenience and just have to sacrifice a bit of space.", "Date": "September 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oakville", "Title": "\u201cThe best\u201d", "Author": "Adelard1", "ReviewID": "UR81084149", "Content": "This was exactly what we expected and much more.

Firstly I would definitely recommend this hotel, so please continue reading, even though it was the worst check-in experience I've ever had in my life. We were to have a reunion with our daughter and her fiance at the hotel. We hadn't seen them in 12 months as they live in Canada and we in Australia. My husband and I arrived late in the evening from our flight, around 10.30pm. After being taken the long way to the hotel by taxi, we arrived, only to be told we couldn't check in as my daughter had made the booking in her name through a travel booking site. She needed to be present for us to be able to check in. She had booked a 2 bedroom apartment for 4 people. It was hot, around 35 degrees outside and we were looking forward to a shower before seeing our daughter. The manager point blank refused to allow us to check in. Nothing I could say would make him change his mind. Our daughter has the same surname and I had the confirmation email from her but he still didn't budge. He offered us the use of the fitness centre showers, so we took our heavy suitcases into the fitness centre. It was empty at that stage, and I was disgusted to find a small amount of faeces on the floor and toilet seat in the combined shower/toilet cubicle. (Probably from a child but it was a fitness centre so who knows). We showered and changed, and I mentioned the faeces to the manager who apologised and said he would get housekeeping onto it immediately. I tried again to get us into the room but to no avail. So we settled into the lobby and waited for our daughter. The manager then came up to us and said he had passed the information onto the night manager as he was finishing for the night. He was very apologetic but said he couldn't do anything. 5 minutes later he came back and I again showed him the email confirmation that was forwarded onto me by my daughter. This time he read it more thoroughly and finally allowed us to check into our room, even though he was very hesitant and said he shouldn't be letting us in He did mention that they had been successfully sued before by letting people into a room which was booked by their friends. When my daughter arrived an hour later, the receptionist was clearly relieved when she said that we had arrived and were in the room and my daughter was happy about that. I think they were expecting my daughter to object! Make sure if you're booking accommodation and people will be arriving at different times, that the booking lists all names, otherwise you may not be allowed to check in. Now for the good part! The room was fabulous. We had a two bedroom apartment and we each had a bathroom. There was a fully equipped kitchen, dining table, lounge, 3 televisions, and plenty of much needed air conditioning. The rooms were spotless. A very good complimentary continental breakfast was provided. Even though the check in was a disaster, the rest of our stay was very good. The location was a little out of the way, around a 10 minute walk to the strip and buses. It's located next to Hooters and a 5 minute walk to MGM Grand.

We did not have breakfast though. It was a complete scrum but it did not concern us too much as it is easy and cheap enough to get breakfast elsewhere or to provide our own. in the room. Our only other negative would be the pool, it looked lovely but there were towels on the loungers from 7.00am although no bodies in sight so we did not get to use it. having said that there is so much else to do it wasnt a problem. Although it is not on the strip it is a short walk away and only across the road from the MGM. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wanted to stay in a quieter hotel in Vegas.

After reading all the positive reviews on tripadvisor, we decided to book our 10-day family holiday at DRR. What a fantastic place that my husband, teenage son and I all enjoyed. The hotel is about a 5-6 minute walk to the MGM Grand so it's very easy access to the strip, to take the monorail, or the bus (the Deuce). However, as a side note, we found that busses only ran every 25-35 minutes despite their advertised \"every 12 minutes\", and the monorail was the much better and reliable choice to travel up and down the strip. We stayed in a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom suite at DRR, with full kitchen, separate living room and dining room, plenty of closet space and a nice balcony. Given the length of our stay, we wanted to have more space than a typical hotel room to come back to after full days of sightseeing and this was certainly the perfect place. We used the pool a number of times and although it's not huge, we found it was just fine and very refreshing after the 106F weather! We had the included breakfast most mornings which offered toast, muffins, cereals, hard boiled eggs, cottage cheese, fresh fruits, juices, coffee, etc. Certainly enough to get you going in the morning. It does get busy in the dining area, so we took our plates up to the room, toasted our bread there instead of waiting in line, and enjoyed our breakfast in the privacy of our suite. In addition, the DRR offers free WiFi in your suite and throughout the hotel and does not charge a daily resort fee, unlike the big hotels on the strip. The only thing that was disappointing about DRR was the Concierge Services. Firstly, there is no concierge for 2-3 days per week, and although the front desk staff were always helpful, it's not their job (nor do they have the knowledge) to help with typical concierge requests. Secondly, when the concierge was on duty, she either wasn't at her desk, or when we finally spoke with her, she had very little to offer. We inquired about two different shows and her response was to go to the casino where the shows were playing and buy tickets at their ticket office - she had no way of getting discounts or assisting in obtaining the tickets. Essentially, she can tell you where to catch the bus (which we had already figured out since she wasn't working for our first 3 days at DRR).

The location was good for us. A 15 minute walk to New York New York, and that was with a stroller! For the price and location this place is great.

I travel to Vegas at least twice a year and let me tell you, you don't usually get free breakfast, much less free wine and beer at any of the other places, unless of course you have lost alot of money gambling. The pool is not very big, but nice. People, don't pay full price for anything!. Get your show tickets through Travel Zoo web sight and you will save alot of money, I got show tickets for B lue Man Group at a huge discount, also got tickets to see Ka at the MGM through this web sight. Just get on the websight, then call the hotel and give them the promotion code or tell them if you can get the Travel Zoo price. Different shows come up on this websight so if what you want to go see isn't available just keep checking. When I checked they had discount prices for Lion King, Blue Man Group, mystere, KA, Jersey Boys, Tony nad Tina's Wedding and a couple of others I can't remember. Also get coupons for dining at restaurant.com websight, just print out your coupon and take it with you. Expedia gave us a great price for the room. We went to madame tussaund wax museum and also got a great discount through their websight.

Not my cup of tea as the English say. However the Desert Rose was an excellant bargain at less than $100 a night and I would highly recommend it to anyone traveling to that otherwise pricey desert city who does not need or want to stay in one of the casino hotels. As advertised, Desert Rose is several blocks off of the strip or in terms of time about a 10 minute walk via the Hooters parking lot Speaking of Hooters, they advertise a prime rib dinner for about $10 which we tried. I recommend it as a good bargain dinner and don't worry about half naked waitresses. There weren't any and the female workers who were dressed in the Hooters shorts and shirts looked modest compared to what one sees on the streets in many US and European cities. By contrast, we also ate at the Italian restaurant in New York/New York and for close to $100 got tasteless, bland food that I would have been ashamed to serve at home. I have one strong warning about Las Vegas. Several of the casino hotels have booths where sales people bribe visitors to take a tour of the Grand View Resort which is several miles away on the fringe of Las Vegas. The bribe consists of free food during the tour and free show tickets. You will be told that the tour last 2-3 hours. This is a lie. They take you by bus to Grand View from Excalibur and five hours lapsed from the time we arrived at Excalibur to the time we returned. Others spent 3 or 4 hours even thjoug they had babies with them. At Grand View they subject you to a varieity of .sales pitches that seemed to be blend of tactics used by used car salesmen (e.g., constantly changing figures scribbled on the scraps of paper) and the KGB (changing interrigators and fatigue inducement). Unless you are 100% certain that you are truly interested in a Grand View time share DO NOT FALL SUBJECT YOURSELF, YOUR SPOUSE, OR FAMILY TO THIS ORDEAL. You would be better off doing nothing at Desert Rose for 4 or 5 hours than suffering at Grand View. Incidently we chose the Kings Tournement (?) show in Excalbur as our bribe. While the show was somewhat appealing to children and adolescents, the standard food served everyone was bad and NOBODY at more than half of it.", "Date": "June 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Country Victoria, Australia", "Title": "\u201cA pleasant change from High rise hotels also close to the main attractions\u201d", "Author": "Hitchiker_bear", "ReviewID": "UR67661363", "Content": "Our 1 bedroom apartment had a huge fridge, full kitchen; a blend of Tuscan and Mexican decor, quality furnishings and fittings.

The service was outstanding and everyone seems to really enjoy their jobs. The free breakfast was way better then I thought it would be. Of course it gets a bit crowded, becuase its free. If you go at around 730 am then its not bad, go right before it closes and there will be more people there because they slept in a bit. They really do serve free beer and wine in the afternoons on weekdays which I didnt believe until I tried it. No problem, drank free beer and talked to some other guests, great time. My room had the best a/c of any room i have stayed at in Vegas. You can turn it down to 40f but once it hits about 58f I wcouldnt take it anymore and had to turn it up. The free internet was actually a bit faster then I thought it would be. Its not the worlds fastest but for the price it was great, i was connected the whole time. I left my laptop, mp3 player, camera out the whole time and they were right where I left them when I got back every time. The pool is nice for families. Its not a giant thing with hardbodies everywhere but I liked it better then those places because the big ones can be intimidating. I took beers with me and there was no one to say anything about it. You dont need to get up early to get a lounger either. very cool. If you are walking to the strip the easiest way is to go straight towards MGM and start there. Its about a 1 beer walk and I drink beer pretty fast. I cant wait for my next trip so I can stay here again. I would strongly recommend it for people who like things a bit more laid back.

I was excited to see the resort after reading all of the reviews. It sounded too good to be true. I found it to be very average. The best thing about it was the fact that we had a two-room suite. Travelling with teenagers, this was a very nice feature. But I didn't find anything attractive about the suite at all. It was not cleaned either day we were there although the person checking us in circled on the room registration that we would be getting daily cleaning. I'm used to a hotel room being freshened up daily. We had to call for clean towels. Also, the internet was not working when we got there, and we couldn't even make an outgoing call from our room to ask about it. My husband had to use his cell phone to call the front desk and they gave him a number to call about the internet. He had to talk to the 3rd party provider, just as if we were at home dealing with a household problem. He spent probably 30 minutes of our first evening dealing with THEIR internet problems for them, because we soon found out from the provider that NOBODY at the resort had wireless and it had not been reported. We didn't find the beds comfortable, and it was noisy. The first night we had lots of noise coming from the suite below us--guess a few guys came in after gambling/drinking, whatever, about 3 and were very loud for over an hour before they passed out. I could hear every word of their conversation. The second night, we heard helicopters for several hours after we went to bed. I found the employees working the desk a bit rude, not friendly at all. I witnessed two of them rolling their eyes at a guest who came down in a panic, complaining that she had just been stuck in their elevator for over ten minutes. Breakfast was fine. Not alot of choices, but plenty, and for the most part, healthy. They always had some protein choices along with the usual toast, cereal, and bagels or muffins and fruit.

The balcony and chairs of the third non-courtyard room #1314 was covered with pigeon droppings from pigeons living in a pine tree right in front of the balcony and they were sitting on the balcony railings and lights when I walked in the room. Based on the tremendous accumulation of droppings it was apparent the balcony had not been cleaned in some time and there was a cigarette butt in the ashtray. I wasn't expecting any great views at this hotel, but those courtyard rooms offer no privacy whatsoever, and after seeing the third room I decided to cut my time lost and used the free WiFi to book myself at another hotel. I subsequently spoke with the on duty manager and he informed me that most of the one bedrooms are in this configuration and that generally the rooms facing outward were two bedrooms. He then proceeded to charge me a half a nights cancellation fee (past the 48 hour deadline) even though I never used any room and had checked in on time with every intention of staying had a suitable room been available. I would also note that I encountered other guests trying to change rooms during my extended time in the lobby.", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cWill definitely return.\u201d", "Author": "lcwtourist", "ReviewID": "UR65948376", "Content": "I live in Phoenix so I have been to Vegas many times.

The pool area was not huge but the right size for the hotel and unlike other Vegas hotels that have very limited pool opening hours this one was open from 0800 to 2300.. fab to take a dip after a hard days sightseeing! Breakfast is included and had plenty of choice, no problem if you prefered to take your food/drinks back to your room to eat and no restrictions on how much you could have.. The Managers drinks and snacks Mon-Thu 1700-1900 was a lovely extra too.. again as much as you'd like!! The staff were very friendly and helpful throughout my stay, taxis would arrive very quickly when I asked for one. The front desk staff were great too, my request for a late check-out was handled with no problems too.. Whilst the hotel is off strip slightly it does mean you get a quieter area to stay in which can be nice after the busy strip.. It is a bit of a walk but I felt perfectly safe returning late at night.. It's about a 10 minute walk to the strip and the bus stops are near the junction.. It's close to the rear of the MGM Grand where the Monorail starts from so more convenient than other hotels! I would definately stay here on any future Vegas trips as there is no bad thing to say about the Desert Rose!! Taxi from the airport was about $15 and the return trip was about $9, so a winner there too!!

If you wanted to cater for yourself, the kitchens in the suites were well equipped, and there were two barbecues near the pool which guests could use. Not sure where the nearest supermarket was. Slight drawback was that as there were six of us we needed to have two taxis to go anywhere, as five is the maximum the cabs will take, and on the odd occasion there were five of us we had to walk up to Hooters or MGM Grand to get a five seater taxi as the company the hotel deal with only have three this size, and the wait was long. Las Vegas is a great place to visit, but we wouldn\u2019t have wanted to stay in one of the Strip casino hotels \u2013 imagine coming down to breakfast every day and being faced with all those slot machines and gaming tables! Desert Rose was just far enough back to be a quiet haven, but near enough to walk to the sights. We appreciated the pool on warm days, and the comfort of our living rooms on cooler days. The hotel also had free wifi access, great to be able to keep in touch with the male members of the family left behind! Would recommend a helicopter trip to the Grand Canyon \u2013 we went with Maverick Helicopters, and had a thirty minutes stop in the canyon with fizz and snacks.

It is small compared to the strip hotels, but as a result is friendly with a quiet bustle. The pool was great to sit around for a week and a godsend for the kids (10+12) who made friends easily. The staff are all so friendly and helpful, calling out hellos and when we needed them to quieten down a group of young lads in the room above (one night, and the ONLY loud group we came across in 12 days) they were great and the result instant after a simple call to reception. The rooms are wonderful - large, en-suite, kitchen, dining, lounge area and bigger than the suites at the high end hotel on the strip we'd stayed at earlier. Bed was wonderfully comfortable. The kitchen was invaluable when we needed to keep the costs down (there are supermarkets close-ish by, but need a bus ride, or a hire car). The front desk have take-away menus for pizza/chinese/chicken/burgers etc which can be delivered to the room. There are even two large barbeques in a section close to the pool which we used several times. Great for communal eating or a more private meal at any time. The complimentary drinks (wine and beer-as many as you like/need/want) from 5-7 every weekday are a wonderful touch and the breakfast will set you up for the day (cereal, bagels,toast,fruit,muffins,yoghurt...and lots of hard boiled eggs!). And complimentary newspapers. We met some wonderful people, many of whom were stranded Brits and who prove that the Dunkirk spirit is alive and well, and the Americans that this type of hotel attracts were all really special too. If you want a quiet base to enjoy this wonderful place, close enough to the fizz of the MGM and its neon associates (and even Hooters next door for fun and a good value for money meal) the Desert Rose is the place.

We liked it so much that I chose it for my business trip I just returned from. First, the lobby area is very comfortable and welcoming. I arrived on a Saturday morning and the fireplace was going (being from Minnesota, I thought this was strange in the morning in Las Vegas -- but I realize there are people who probably thought it was cool morning and probably appreciated the fire). The staff was friendly. I got to my room and it looked the way I remembered from August (a different room). They accommodated my request for a grab bar in the tub. Everything seemed the same. Then I started unpacking (so it would feel more like home -- I always do this) and noticed little things. Obviously, this room has been used a lot (like most rooms in Vegas). But I hadn't noticed this kind of use during my previous stay. Mostly it was fine, just little things: Refrigerator sat crooked in its space, the lower part of the sofa (where your legs sit against when you feet are on the floor) was filthy -- lots of body oils have rubbed up against there, there were permanent spots on the wall and carpet by the bathroom vanity (it looked like someone might have dyed their hair and didn't tidy up and housekeeping got to it too late), the faucet in the tub was mounted on the wall a little cockeyed. Like I said, just little things -- and nothing that hindered me from enjoying my stay. It's just been really used. One thing I missed as compared with my previous stay: there was a basket on the bed with two robes and two pair of slippers for my husband and I. We used them and got to keep the slippers. There was no robe and slippers in my recent stay. Again -- just a little thing. I made it to breakfast twice. Typical hotel continental breakfast. I didn't make it to the Manager's Reception. Overall, I really enjoy the Desert Rose Resort. With a car, it's in a great location. Without a car, the Strip is just a short walk, and both monorail stations are virtually across the street (free one via Excaliber and the longer, pay one at MGM). They'll take you from Mandalay Bay on the south end up to the Hilton on the north end. Great to have nearby. This is a \"vacation ownership\" type hotel, but they've never asked or approached me to listen to their \"speil\" on ownership (and I've seen a lot of those, especially in Las Vegas).

The three-room suite is roomy and comfortable. It comes with a complete kitchen so you can save $ by dining in. There's even a dishwasher! It had a completely separate bedroom, which was a sleep-saver for me as my brother snores like a locomotive. He slept in the living room on a full size pull-out sofa bed (he said it was very comfortable). I took the bedroom and, with the door closed, slept like a log. The suite I was in had a tiny bathtub/toilet area. That's the only negative comment I have about the resort. I'm certain there are other room configurations which offer more bathroom space. The weather was a little bit chilly for me to enjoy the pool, but I saw some children having fun there. I poked my nose into the Fitness Center one day. I'm not the workout type, but there were several weight training machines, some stationary bikes, free weights and balls. I would consider the Fitness Center well-equipped. The complimentary breakfast each morning included freshly-brewed Starbuck's coffee plus a variety of cold cereals, fruit juices, breads for toasting, fruit, eggs, soda and hot drinks. I drove to Las Vegas, but my brother flew in. I could bring everything with me that I would need during my stay, while he was limited to one small carry-on bag. Fortunately, the resort provides coin-operated washers and dryers on site. The Desert Rose Resort has concierge service to help you find and book show tickets, arrange transportation, and point out local areas of interest. That's how I found out about the Atomic Testing Museum - and got 15% off at M&M's World. Located on the south end of the Strip (Las Vegas Blvd.), Desert Rose is a short block from the Tropicana and Hooter's Casinos. It's a longer block to the entrance to MGM Grand, but it's doable.

The ONLY negative thing I can say about the experience is that there is LITERALLY no counter space in the bathrooms. The sinks are pedestal sinks, so no counters there, and there is only a small shelf over the toilet (about 4\" deep and 2 feet long). This was a little inconvenient because anything you'd normally keep in the bathroom had to be kept in the bedroom. But, other than that, this was a wonderful stay. The six of us had two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a nice sized living room, and a fully stocked, fully equipped kitchen for about $75 a night!!!!! The breakfast was basic but good. It was very crowded, but you could always take things back to your room. We ate there a few mornings, and other mornings we went around the corner to Coco's. Fantastic breakfasts there for an extremely reasonable price. The walk to the strip was extremely manageable. None of us are in the greatest shape, believe me, but we certainly had no problem taking the 10-15 minute walk to the strip. If you have a problem with that, how do you expect to do the MILES of walking you're going to do once you are there?? We took a nice loop with the kids in the stroller from the Luxor up as far as the M&M factory, had lunch at the Rainforest Cafe in MGM, and back \"home.\" Nice day! We did drive and park to go up to the strip near Caesar's Palace, but we would have done this if staying at a strip hotel down at our end, anyway. We again did a nice loop from Bellagio up to Venetian and back. Everywhere is stroller accessible, and there is plenty for the kids to see and enjoy. The hotel had a very nice pool (heated, but too cold for us) and a nice hottub (perfect temperature) that we relaxed in almost every day.

The check-in and check-out were fast, and the staff courteous. We had a blown fuse, and they had it fixed very quickly. The continental breakfast was efficiently run. They even had a happy hour while we were there. Unlike most mega-hotels in Vegas, you get to park next to this hotel. It was very quiet inside the hotel. It was maybe an 8-minute walk to the MGM Grand entrance. Cons: I realize the following are not really \"cons\" per se, but traits associated with all but the most expensive hotels. The first thing I noticed upon entering our suite was the smell: the familiar, chemical smell of almost all economy hotels. It didn't really bother me once I settled in, but it just reminded me that I was not in a Four Seasons. The plant in the living room was a plastic one, and the furniture didn't exactly have style. At night, I could hear the people upstairs get out of bed, walk to the bathroom with a squeaking floor, and flush their toilet. Who it's for: If you plan to drive to Vegas and stay multiple days with family/friends in a quiet place with good value and want to prepare some of your own meals, this is almost the perfect place (book with the hotel directly for the lowest rates). If you want to be closer to action or luxury, you'd better shell out more for some of the other higher-end places.

Outdoor hot tub is HOT. All Staff, from front desk to the cleaning lady, were friendly, with smiles and hellos. Technically, you can walk (a longish block) to the strip, but we were glad to have our cheapy econo car for trips outside the city, like Red Rocks. Only downside? No stairs. You can only access your room via elevator, which makes a quick run to the ice machine in February a bit brisk.

We are now getting a bit fed up since we had been up since 2:00 a.m. eastern time (11:00 p.m. the night before.) Finally we get a room and were very happy with it. It was spacious and clean. It rained Sun. - Thurs. and on Tues. night I heard a dripping sound coming from the master bedroom. Found water literally pooring out of the window and pooling on the window sil and then dripping onto the carpet. I put towels down that night twice as the water was coming in so heavy. On Wed. I called maint. and they came to check things out and said they would report the situation to management. We got a message Thur. evening after being out all day to call management, and we did. We told them we didn't want to move for the last 2 nights and that we could just tolerate the towels in the window. I didn't want to have to move my toddler and disabled brother out, the rooms were nice enough and spacious enough that the water would not be problem for 2 more nights but they insisted we move. They moved us two doors down, and when we went into inspect it we found a totally different suite from the first. This suite had two rooms but it was cramped dingy and dirty. My husband spoke to management and they apologized for the space saying it was an end unit, and that it had been renovated at the same time as the other suite and should be just fine. Well it was terrible, there was an overall feeling of dirt and dingyness. I have posted pictures, but I still don't think that they can convey how dirty and run down the room was.", "Date": "January 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay in every way!\u201d", "Author": "IFrodo", "ReviewID": "UR54555372", "Content": "We travelled from New Zealand and stayed almost two weeks at the Desert Rose and found this resort to be a really great place to stay.

There is also no door closing the building in so if you're on the first floor which we were, your room gets extremely cold because there is no barrier to the outside of the building (the building apparently opens onto the patio). Lastly, even though we'd leave our room at about 10:30 am every day and return around 4:00 pm, our room was rarely cleaned during that period. There were a couple of times when the cleaning staff knocked our door at 5:00 pm asking if they could clean our room. Why can't they clean between 11 am and 4 pm like all of the other hotels in the world. It was very inconvenient to say the least. In our opinion, it was not a good place to stay and we won't be coming back to this hotel in the future.", "Date": "January 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Enterprise, AL", "Title": "\u201cLove staying here and will continue to stay during my trips to Vegas\u201d", "Author": "jareyno1", "ReviewID": "UR52670586", "Content": "I have stayed at this hotel more than once.

There was a nice fireplace burning upon our arrival at night, which added a nice touch, and the lobby is open, clean and cheerful. Our one bedroom condo/suite had a full kitchen with all appliances, all of which were clean and in working order. Nice, comfortable, clean accomodations. Comfortable bed with nice linens. There were 2 large t.v.s ..... one in the bedroom and one in the living room. Breakfast in the a.m. in the lobby was a nice, continental style breakfast with the many cereals, fresh fruits, and the usual. That is what we expected, and it was fine for our needs. We used the outdoor pool (heated to 80F) and the hot-tub in the a.m. and it was fine for us as we are from the North-East where it is much colder than Vegas; it was a real treat for me to take a swim in the pool and then use the hot-tub. Most resorts in Vegas do not even bother to keep their outdoor pools open in the winter months from what I understand, so I was quite pleasantly surprised that their pool is open year round. The Desert Rose is in easy walking distance of Hooters and the MGM, and would not be an uncomfortable walk to Tropicana for most people. You would probably need to have a car or use public transportation to get to the \"main\" portion of The Strip (which I think is in the Bellagio, Bally's, Paris area). However, if you have a car and drive to Bellagio you can park for free and be right in that area. Bottom line - I would definitely recommend The Desert Rose, especially if you can get a great rate like we did. It is a very quiet, well-kept property and we felt comfortable and safe there.

The resort is actually a cluster of four small peach-colored buildings with a pool in the middle. The buildings look kind of like adobe houses. The front desk staff made a very good first impression with their welcoming attitude, and also by accommodating us almost immediately even though we arrived about an hour before our scheduled check-in time. Our room was a cute one-bedroom suite with a full kitchen. There isn\u2019t a grocery store on-site, but the resort does have a little convenience store in the lobby with chips and other snacks, as well as a place to get coffee, water and juice 24/7. Continental breakfast is also offered daily. Anyway, back to the room. It was decorated in warm south-westerny colors and the bed was super comfortable. The kitchen was fully equipped with dishes, pots, pans, etc. and the room offered plenty of closet and drawer space for our clothes and stuff. The only negatives would probably be that the TV didn\u2019t have much in the way of channel selection, and the balcony was tiny and provided a lovely view of the parking lot and dumpsters. Then again, we didn\u2019t exactly go to Vegas to just watch TV and sit on the porch, either. The Desert Rose Resort has an ideal location. An easy walk to the strip, you\u2019re close enough to all the action when you want it, but just far enough away when it starts to wear thin. There is not a casino or actual restaurant at this resort, but again, everything is close-by. If you don\u2019t feel like walking, the monorail station at MGM Grand is practically across the street. One of the best things about the Desert Rose Resort is the staff, especially Dixye, the concierge. She was extremely helpful during our stay. For example, when we decided we wanted to see a show spur-of-the-moment, she helped us with that. When I was trying to figure out how to get groceries (we didn\u2019t rent a car) she called around and found out how to get them delivered. The employees were all great, from check-in \u2018til check-out.

Although the walk isn't very interesting and is longer than it looks, one could walk to MGM, Luxor and Excalibur.

The toilet/tub area of the bathroom is cramped but the rest is very spacious. For a great price, you get a simple breakfast, daily newspaper, and cocktail party in the late afternoon. The breakfast area was crowded every morning I was there, and finding a seat wasn't easy. I made a point of returning to the resort for the cocktail party one day, and it wasn't really worth it.

Located just south of the main strip and MGM, the hotel was a quick and easy taxi ride from the airport. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to the strip at MGM or Excalibur and right next door to Hooters. On check-in we were given an automatic upgrade to a 2 bed apartment as they seemed fairly quiet. The room was very spacious and had a good size kitchen and lounge/dining area. There wasa small balcony although the view was of the car park and away from the lights of the strip. The included breakfast was basic but was good to fill up on before heading out for the day. The buffet included juices, coffee, a chice of cereals, toast, bagels and preserves and occasionally eggs. On weeknight evenings (mon-Fri I think) the hotel offered a happy hour between 5-7 where they had a free bar offering complimentary beer, wines and soft drinks and snacks. We found this a great way to get a few drinks down before heading out and paying strip prices. If / when you get sick of paying strip prices for food and drink, there is a 24 hour mini-mart a short walk away and a 7/11 liquor store. Pizza and other restaurants will deliver to the hotel room no problem. The only drawbacks to the hotel was that the cleaners, although they did come in every day, didn't actually do much cleaning. it was only on the final day (tips day!) that they did a good job of cleaning and replacing the coffee satchets etc. Anybody with problems walking or paying through the nose for taxis might be better off staying directly on the strip instead of off it, although of course all the strip hotels you still walk through miles of casino to get to the rooms.

As seems to be usual in Las Vegas, most of the housekeeping staff is non-English speaking. Even though they say \"OK\" they really haven't understood you. I would recommend calling housekeeping, to resolve issues. The pool is great... check-in was delayed only a little, as they were full the night before and thus we waited until the official check-in time of 4:00 until the room was ready. Since this hotel gets such great ratings, I would imagine it is always full, and so you should plan to get there around 4:00. The pool was excellent. It was clean, well-kept also, and there were chairs and towels easily available. The continental breakfast was a lovely addition.

Weather was very good (a few degrees higher than seasonal norm - mid 80's most days). Flight - Arrived mid afternoon after the direct Virgin flight from Gatwick and room was waiting for us. The flight is great as it's direct but the downside of this is that everyone is going to Vegas so a) it's full so don't expect any spare seats and b) some of the passengers took too much advantage of the free drink so it felt a bit like a rowdy all-inclusive resort. Also the seat pitch in economy is poor - much worse than other airlines to the US and Carribean. Rooms - The rooms are in three storey blocks around the swimming pool and are fantastic. Plenty of space and loads of cupboard / storage space. We had a one bedroom apartment which has a lounge /kitchen diner and then a large bedroom with bathroom. Both rooms have a Phillips TV which have loads of US news and sports channels but also HBO and TNT so you can always find a film to watch. The kitchen is extremely well equipped with everything your kitchen at home - holiday places in the UK could certainly learn a lot (i,.e. salt and pepper / washing up liquid supplied) so you don't need to buy any of that when you arrive. Some takeaway/delivery leaflets were also supplied which we used once and was very good. The bed was very comfortable. Pool - The pool got quite busy and on certain days it was a rush to get a bed - again you get the usual inconsiderate ones who bag the bed then go off for the morning - but to the resort's credit the manager came round and removed the towels! The water was not to bad - OK once you got in. The jaccuzzi was very good and very warm. Breakfast - an added bonus was the continental breakfast and free coffee throughout the day. Basic but you don't really need a full breakfast with the ginormous portions you get when you go out to eat! Manager's drinks - this was a nice addition from 5-7 pm Mon-Thurs (not sure why they don't do it at the weekend - perhaps they were worried about all the people from the Virgin flight drinking them out of house and home!). Beer and wine - but good quality. Most people gave a dollar per round as a tip. It was a good way for a lot of people to meet others staying at the resort. Location - as most people have said the resort is a block from the Strip so takes a about 10 mins to walk. You can also go in the back of the MGM (valet and check in) which is handy for the monorail. The only downside is that unless you have a car there are not any decent grocery stores nearby. There are a couple of convenience stores so you can get drinks, snacks etc but no fresh meats, salads bits etc. The only one suggestion I would make to the management is to open a snack bar by the pool for lunches / drinks and they would make a fortune. Overall - a brilliant resort away from the madness of the Strip.

The resort has the potential to be great but many little things all accumulated to leave me annoyed and in the whole dissapointed. On arrival at midnight we were told that due to a maintenance issue they never had a room for us and were told to go to the bluegreen hotel for 1 night and they would have a room available the next morning for us (very suspicious as there was a big fight across at Mgm that night so draw your own conclusions!!!!!!). This hotel was another 5 mins drive away from the strip and on arrival we had planned to dump our luggage and walk round the corner to the strip for a drink or two(this ended up costing us $12 in a taxi each way from the bluegreen hotel. The check in at bluegreen was not simple as the receptionist on the front desk said that desert rose had not made the reservation on line for us so she had to go and make it manually herself. The next day we got an awful room with balcony overlooking a tree (no sun) and a roof with extractor units and no apology from the staff at desert rose. I complained and they moved us to another room which on inspection looked ok. We later realised the balcony was infested with cockroaches and covered in bird droppings. I complained again and advised them i wanted it cleaned when we were out which was dealt with. On arrival back to the room we both lay down to sleep and then a constant vibrating noise started which we could not pinpoint, this was so bad we called reception and was met with the reponse \"well what do you want us to do about this in the middle of the night\". I went straight to reception the next morning and they admitted that it was the air-con units on the roof above the 3rd floor and it can vibrate. Eventually we got given our final room which had no major problems until the hairdryer stopped working so we thought after calling maintenance(silly me it just tripped). After all the issues i had i thought it was time i spoke to the manager who i found to be friendly approachable and understanding which has certainly improved my opinion on the property. On the positive side the rooms were spacious and the managers complimentary bar between 5&7 weekdays and the daily complimentary breakfasts were a nice touch. The 1 free internet terminal needs to have a time limit on it as most hotels now do this. Certain individuals spent way too long on it and were ignorant to the fact others needed on it.

Rooms are nice and comfortable, no complaints about that, but public corridors are old, not renovated (like an old Motel 6), and open, so during hot summer days it is very unpleasant.

I usually stay at one of the Strip hotels or South Point (see my review for that property; still my favorite hotel overall in Vegas), but when I read TA's reviews and noted its very high ranking (no. 4 when I booked last week) for DRR -- and then found a great rate on Expedia ($46/night for a prepaid booking) -- I decided to try something different. I'm glad I did. DRR lives up to the high praise from fellow TA reviewers: its location, suites, and amenities are all excellent; and if you can get anything close to the rate I paid (or close to, say, $100/night on weekends; I usually avoid Vegas on weekends, though), I highly recommend the property. I asked for -- and got -- a nice one-bedroom suite on the third floor of a building on the back side (i.e. closest to the Strip) of the property. (DRR is a garden-apartment style resort, with three-story buildings arranged in a square around the central pool and reception areas.) Checking in and parking couldn't be easier: the process took 2 minutes, and I was off with my room keys and map to park around back, right next to my building. All the gates to the buildings and main facilities are locked and accessible only with one's room key, which worked every time I used it. My suite was just fine: as promised, full kitchen, granite countertops, separate bedroom. The decor and furnishings are very similar to those at the South Point Hotel, so much so -- especially in the bathroom -- that I think DRR used the same company for its makeover. I had two TVs -- they were large CRT units, rather than the promised flatscreens, but that wasn't an issue, as I don't use TVs much in Vegas hotels. Both TVs worked and provided plenty of free channels, and it was handy having one in the living room and one in the bedroom. As some other reviewers have noted, the suites have good, strong A/C (70s/80s-style lever thermostat but works fine), but the temperature in my bedroom was always a few degrees warmer than that in the living area. No matter; I just kept the thermostat low, and the BR was sufficiently cool. I didn't partake of the free continental breakfast, but I appreciated the Starbucks coffee available throughout the day and early evening in the lobby, as well as the free beer and wine from 5 to 7 p.m. Again, a nice touch that sets the DRR apart from most other Vegas hotels. One of the best features of DRR is its location. Las Vegas, which is rarely free of traffic problems, has become particularly unfriendly to the automobile as of late, especially on the surface roads just east of the Strip. Many of the most heavily used roads, including Koval, Harmon, Flamingo, and Tropicana, are undergoing major, traffic jam-inducing reroutings and repairs. Fortunately, DRR is easy to get to, even with the upheaval taking place on Tropicana, and it's a very short drive or walk to the Strip. (The hotel is also accessible from Reno Rd., which is free of construction and leads right to the Strip.) Parking is a dream; you park right next to your building, and that's it. DRR is not very big, either, which adds to its human feel. While I'm a solo traveler, I noticed lots of families with kids at DRR, and I can see why: it's an outstanding value for families, and it really is an attractive, user-friendly property. The full kitchens, decent (though only adequate) pool, and other family-friendly facilities make DRR an excellent choice for most travelers. At night, the property is very quiet, and when in my room, I heard no noise from other guests. If you've been to Vegas before, you know what a rare treat that is. The free wireless internet, which I found to be fast and reliable, is also a great touch and one that you don't find in most Vegas hotels. Unlike some properties that give one limited free wifi in, say, their lobbies or pool areas, DRR's free wifi is available everywhere on the property, including in your suite. While I'll probably stay at one of my favorite regular hotels (S. Point or THEHotel) next time -- I do like the buzz of the bigger hotels -- I'm sure I'll stay again at DRR at some point in the future, and I highly recommend it if you're looking for a great lodging value in Las Vegas.", "Date": "July 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Juan.

There was even a balcony with two chairs on it where our one smoker was able to sit just off of the living room and smoke.

Check-in was a breeze. Once we got to the suite, the kids instantly decided that they loved the room with the queen bed and the couch. My wife and I woke early the next morning and hit the limited breakfast (that was because service started a bit later on weekends). We made a trip down Tropicana to Vons in order to pick up some supplies for the rest of the week. I even had a little time after breakfast to walk down to the Strip with the two (under 10 minutes to get to the bridge between the Tropicana and Excalibur) before we had to head to the airport for our 3-day rafting trip. My wife was on her own for the next two nights, and the concierge (who was fantastic) helped her decide the best ways to hit the Strip and see some shows at night. The hotel is also very close to the airport (an easy cab ride) but we didn\u2019t hear any noise from the busy airport. One common question on the forums is whether it's safe to walk back to the hotel at night, and my wife (who doesn't like big cities) said that she never felt uncomfortable. What are some of the negatives about this hotel? The rooms will probably be a letdown for anyone that thinks they are going to a top-of-the-line resort that\u2019s just off the strip, based on the stellar rating on TA. That is not the case, and to the Desert Rose\u2019s credit, they are only billed as a 3-star hotel on TA. I\u2019ve found that bathrooms say a lot about a hotel. The ones in our room left a lot to be desired, especially the one of the master bedroom, which was tiny. The resort also had a very crowded feeling at times, such as the peak times for the breakfasts/receptions, any time that the pool was in demand, or even when trying to find a parking space for the night. One other thing our teenagers commented on was the odor we were hit with when we walked down to the Strip through the Hooters lot. That\u2019s nothing that the Desert Rose can control this, but it did make a lasting impression on our kids. Bottom line: would I stay here again? Maybe, if I were going on the same sort of trip where I needed a place for room our full family of four to stretch out for two nights, and one that was close enough to the strip that my wife could walk to some of the shows on the two nights that three of us were gone. But I'd probably pick somewhere else if walking to the strip was not a consideration, since it is very easy to drive from other parts of town to some of the casinos, if needed. And I also would suggest against the hotel for anyone who is interested in being in the hustle and bustle of some of the four or five star casino resorts in Vegas -- the Desert Rose would not fit their desires. I also think it's a bit of a stretch to call the hotel a \"Resort\", since it is just a quality 3-star hotel a block off the strip. I knocked my overall rating down a notch because of that, since the hotel does seem to be a bit overrated on TA. I also rounded down because of the followup email that the Shell Hospitality group sent out with a link to the TA review, since that probably contributes to overrating problem on TA.", "Date": "July 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "boston", "Title": "\u201cGreat place - great value and location, and family-friendly\u201d", "Author": "hensyl", "ReviewID": "UR35416245", "Content": "This is a comfortable, clean, convenient no-casino hotel with a great free weekday happy hour with beer, wine and snacks and a nice lobby to hang out with friends.

There were plenty of chairs around the pool. The location was excellent....two blocks from Luxor and MGM. We had a car and usually drove to a hotel / casino and used the valet to park there ($3 tip). It was so hot that this worked out great (though the valet lots were sometimes full, in which case we self-parked in the lot). However, it is an easy walk from the hotel to Luxor, MGM, and Hooters from the hotel (10-15 minutes). I highly recommend this wonderful hotel.

I know a lot of people complained about the walking but I don't know how you can see Vegas without a lot of walking. To go into the Venetian and walk up and down the \"Grand Canal\" takes longer than it does to walk from the Desert Rose to the MGM. We had to return our rental car at the airport and didn't want to deal with our luggage so we arrived at the Desert Rose at 11:30am. Our room wasn't ready but they happily stored our luggage. We measured the distance to the car rental return (3.3 miles) and decided to walk back. (I told you we were hikers!) By the time we got back (after a stop at Mandalay Bay), the Desert Rose had called our cell phone to let us know that a room was ready. Great service! Our two room suite was spotless, tastefully decorated, and very comfortable. There is a manager's reception during the week with beer, wine, soft drinks and snacks. The \"continental plus\" breakfast is decent and includes hard boiled eggs, which made me happy. There is Starbucks coffee available in the lobby 24 hours, I guess to keep you awake if you are out late gambling. :-) My only complaint is that the pool seemed very crowded but it was hot and all of the pools at the big hotels were crowded too. I don't think you can avoid that in Vegas in May. It was so nice to come back to the quiet of the Desert Rose after spending a day on the noisey, busy strip. We couldn't believe how long the lines were at check-in at some of the big hotels on the strip and how people had to walk through the casino with their luggage to find their rooms! No thank you! Give me the nice, personable Desert Rose any day. We plan to go hiking in Utah again and will probably fly in and out of Vegas again. When we do, we will definitely stay at the Desert Rose Resort.", "Date": "May 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC", "Title": "\u201cLarge, Nice Rooms for a fraction of the price\u201d", "Author": "Erinkbailey", "ReviewID": "UR30789726", "Content": "I am never staying on the strip again.

Not enjoying it one little bit so it's difficult to know where to start with my comments. Firstly I would like to warn anyone staying here of the telephone charges. I made three calls to the UK on the room phone for 3 mins 20 seconds, 3 mins 59 seconds and 4 mins 35 seconds - the charges for these calls were $53, $46 and $53 respectively. Obviously I'd expect a call from a hotel phone to be something like $10 for a few minutes but that is ridiculous. When I complained to the manager they simply had no explanation but agreed that their charges are 'extortionate'. Thanks guys. Secondly, the place is infested with moths. To a massive extent. I have just killed three of these in the last hour and they have plagued the week I have spent here. I have had them crawling on me, flapping in my ear while I was asleep, everywhere. Disgusting. Thirdly, there is a roach problem, although I have only caught 2 or 3 in my actual room, the corridors and outdoors are really bad and other guests have complained about their rooms being worse. And they're big ones too. Fourthly, although the place looks close to the big hotels when you look on a map or Google Earth, the walk is really terrible - the sewers in this block smell absolutely disgusting - to the extent that I wretched repeatedly, and there is no proper lighting. My girlfriend was approached in a car during the late afternoon and since there is virtually no one around the area and it backs onto the testosterone-fueled-moronic-whoop-fest which is Hooters Hotel it was a worry. Fifthly, forget about the pool. There are 144 large condos in this development. with I suppose an average of 3 people staying in each. There are approx 35 sunbeds. You do the maths, but even in Vegas people do like to use the pool and this one is woefully inadequate. It's not that great either. For the last four days we have been walking the mile or so to the Luxor to pay $10 to use their pool - didn't expect to have to do that but there is literally no choice. Sixthly, it's the noisiest place I've stayed since I last went to Ibiza aged 18. I didn't come to Vegas for the peace and quiet but when I put the do-not-disturb sign on the door (that incidentally says \"Shhhh... I'm sleeping\") I don't really expect housekeeping to slam their trolleys relentlessly against the walls and constantly SHOUT at each other. That was really bad. Other guests were loud idiots too, but I'm not blaming that on the hotel (oh, okay, go on then I will). Finally, far be it for me to be a snob but the clientele that this place attracts are very hit and miss. The breakfast buffet is like feeding time at the zoo. I't's held right in the middle of the lobby, the food is shocking and in order to reduce costs (I guess) the management provide nowhere to eat properly, no trays and flimsy plastic plates. I saw someone with a bowl of bran flakes with a hard boiled egg balanced in the middle while they poured milk on them. Another elderly lady was perched on an easy chair in her nightdress, she had clearly walked directly from bed to the buffet bypassing every sink, hairbrush and item of everyday clothing. A pink nightie with no underwear, shoes or socks was just the ticket for her mealtime - and just the thing to put me off eating. I only went to the buffet once although I did get some jam on my clothes when I sat down in the lobby another day (does that count?). I'm a well travelled chap and I'm very reasonable and give credit where it's due. The hotel was good about calling taxis to get us from A to B. The concierge booked a nice restaurant for my birthday and generally the place is spacious. The staff were on the whole functional but not particularly friendly or exceptional. I'm quite reluctant to say this is a bad hotel, because I did a lot of homework before I booked this trip and virtually everywhere I looked said this place was great. But in all honestly it's not. It's pretty damn bad. And I hate to admit I picked the wrong place but I did. But please don't stay here unless you get a knock-out cheap rate. There are way better places to stay in Vegas and some hotels have real bargain rates at the moment. If you do stay here don't make any phone calls, don't expect to use the pool, enjoy your breakfast, have any peace and quiet or a pleasant stroll to the strip. And bring a nose clip unless you like the smell of sewage. Oh, and ear plugs to drown out the noise of the outdated air-con. Do bring a microscope because the bugs and crawlies could make excellent study projects for the kids.", "Date": "May 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Louis", "Title": "\u201cHey, I'm not easy to impress. This was a wonderful place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "DIW2KStLouis", "ReviewID": "UR30542711", "Content": "My daughter and I stayed 05/17 thru 05/21 of '09. Total for 4 nights (plus tax) was $533.96. Hey, I'm not easy to impress and am the first to complain if something isn't just right. But, for our time there at least, I have to say this was a wonderful place to stay. Maybe I didn't get a bargain basement price but I've paid a lot more for a lot less at other places. The top 10 reasons for staying at the Desert Rose ... or ... What we got for the money: 1) A very clean 2 bedrooms, 2 baths, kitchen, dining area, living room and balcony. (Kitchen has fridge, microwave, dishes, utensils, blender, coffee pot, toaster, etc). The bed was possibly the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in. They even provided pillows of different sizes and fill just so you'd have a choice of what you'd like best to sleep with. I've never seen anyone else do that. 2) The baths had the deepest tubs I'd ever seen in a hotel. The shower had instant (and I mean INSTANT) hot water. I don't even get that at home! 3) There were TV's in the living room and in each bedroom. 4) The air conditioning was wonderful and there was no AC or 'hotel smell' (i.e. people or chemicals). The air was very clean. 4) Pool (we were too busy to ever use but saw others did and never heard a complaint) 5) Very friendly and helpful staff. The only time I was ever 'bothered' was when the cleaning staff actually called on the phone once to ask if I was sure I didn't want the room cleaned even though I had posted a 'do not disturb' sign on the door so I could grab a nap. I wondered then if they would have ignored the posted note if I hadn't answered the phone. Hmmmm. 6) Continental breakfast (served until 9 AM) that was more than adequate (cereal, bagels, hard boiled eggs, deli ham, fruit, etc.) No, not the very best I've ever had but close and still nicer than what most places term a 'Continental breakfast' . Besides, do you really want to 'load up' or weigh yourself down before hitting the Vegas strip? Even if you have a car or are just going to use the monorail, there is still a lot of walking around involved with your seeing Vegas. 7) There was some sort of free drinks (cocktails?) and snacks thing in the afternoon (A Complimentary Manager's Reception was the official name) that we never attended but thought you should know about. 8) Free Wi-Fi. We never used it but mention it here anyway. 9) We never had a problem with noise at the hotel even though our room was one story above the parking lot. I never heard the people in the hall or in the rooms next to us - no voices, no footsteps, nothing. 10) There is no gambling at the Desert Rose. Whew! Returning 'home' to the hotel each night after being inundated with the noises of machines and people, I really appreciated there not being a hint of it waiting for me when I was ready to rest up for the next day. Final note: I'm not a world traveler but have stayed in a lot of nice hotels the last half century. Some of them thought a lot better of themselves than I did. This one, though, was a real find. The hotel claims \"...this three-story, all-suites hotel is just one block from the Las Vegas Strip, yet miles away in ambience\". That statement of what to expect is spot on. I regret not taking photos of the rooms to share. I meant to as the one's supplied by the hotel don't do it justice - don't even come close. Also, if you are staying in Vegas for a few days without a car, consider getting a multi-day pass for the monorail (around $25). We had 102 and 103 degree days during our stay, the monorail helped avoid a lot of walking in the heat (and I don't care who starts in about it being a 'dry heat'. A hair dryer is a dry heat. It doesn't help when you turn the setting on high and stick it in your face. It is still HOT, people!", "Date": "May 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Alberta", "Title": "\u201cBest Place for Families\u201d", "Author": "edmice14", "ReviewID": "UR30478334", "Content": "We've just returned from staying at the Desert Rose - May 13 - 19/09.

After walking through many of the casinos on the strip, I was very happy to be staying at the Desert Rose. I can't imagine staying in one of the large hotels and having to trek your belongings 20 minutes to find your room. The pool was very nice and a good size. My husband had breakfast and his coffee poolside every morning and found it very relaxing. The teenagers loved jumping into the water after a long day of walking in the sun. And yes the pool is not heated, but being Canadian we didn't mind! A cool pool after walking in 37C temperatures is nice. Staff were ever helpful.

Also, the bathroom is rather small and off the Master bedroom, so people sleeping in the living room will have to walk through the bedroom. Luckily, sink and mirror are separate from the shower/toilet. Kitchen is really nicely equipped but the free (cold) breakfast was sufficient for us in the morning. It is nice to have a fridge to store leftovers and drinks, etc. The Pool area is clean and rather large but on most days there were not enough chairs and towels for all guests. The cocktail reception at 5pm is nice and filled us up until we got out for the night. The fitness room is smallish but has nice equipment. All staff is very helpful at all times. Generous parking for guests available if you rent a car (recommended if you want to go back to the hotel during the day to change or relax before nightlife, as commuting takes up a lot of time and its hot out there!). Walking distance to the Luxor is 8 minutes. From there you can catch a train (5 USD/trip). From the hotel, taxi cab to the airport is approx. 10 USD, so for 2 it is cheaper than the shuttle bus which has to be reserved 24 hours in advance. Supermarkets are approx. 2 miles away from the hotel in each direction - the nicer option here is a nicely designed strip mall (Town Square) with Whole Foods, upscale shopping and some good clubs/restaurants (Claim Jumper). Desert Rose is a nice, quite place if you dont need to be in the middle of constant party and action. Really good choice for longer stays. The guests are a mixed crowd, all ages, also some kids.

In this case we found both. We booked a 2 bedroom suite (these are timeshare condo's, actually) because there were no one bedrooms available on the nights we wanted. No matter - only $108/night didn't break the bank. After travelling for several weeks in Holiday Inns, Hiltons, etc we expected a nice but standard box. However this was indeed a complete 2 bedroom apartment, each bedroom ensuite, a full kitchen with utensils, wine glasses etc. Our unit must have been upgraded in the last couple of years so everything was modern and worked well. Other reviews indicate some plumbing problems so perhaps our unit was special - the 5 nozzle massage shower was really nice, for example. Also, the three TV's seemed a bit much, but it didn't stop there. The breakfast was reasonable but not extravagant. However the free wine and cheese (and a veggie platter) at 5pm was certainly an unexpected perk. It was really nice to have a chance to socialize around the pool in the central courtyard with other guests. Furthermore, my misgivings about security of our vehicle were allayed by the rather obvious 24 hour security guard in the lot. The Vegas strip is about a block and a half away, and the airport closer still. One would expect a lot of noise, but somehow the whole resort seems to be very quiet - as if its floating in its own bubble of silence. The friendly desk staff and concierge were very good at answering all our questions. If I go back to Vegas I would certainly recommend this resort to a friend - but there was so much space in that suite that my wife and I rattled around. I imagine it would be completely adequate for up to 4 people without any element of crowding.", "Date": "May 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheshire, UK", "Title": "\u201cDesert Rose with Thomas Cook\u201d", "Author": "spikey", "ReviewID": "UR29650103", "Content": "Travelled direct from Manchester with Thomas Cook in economy, dreadful outgoing flight people crossing the aisle in extra leg room seats in row 9 even after being asked not to on four occassions by cabin crew.

There was a nasty lady checking in before me, she was beyond rude, she was incredibly hateful and condescending when the front desk help was overly helpful and very nice and kind. The way they handled her with a smile was impressive. Along with everyone else, everyone was nice, said hello, and had a smile it was pleasant! The room was spacious and clean. We had 2 bedrooms, one was a king bed and the other was a queen. The beds had lots of pillows, and extra for the sofa sleeper. The beds were comfortable. The master bedroom had a full bathroom with a tub, the other bath was a 3/4 bath with a huge shower. The bathrooms had shampoo, conditioner, bar soap, each had a hair drier and there was even extra towels enough for our whole family. The kitchen is always a great additon to our travels. It was a full kitchen with a full sized fridge and freezer, there was a dishwasher they provide dishwasher detergent, full size oven and stove top, full sized sunken sink and they provide dish soap, also plenty of dishes, bowls, cups, wine glasses, can openers, and pots and pans, and utinsils. There was also a small balcony with couple of chairs and small table a nice place to drink coffee in the morning. We did go down during breakfast what caios! The people putting the food out where very busy, and did a good job considering it was like a mad house. However, there were a lot of people I didn't see anyone standing in a long line waiting (like at a lot of places we have eaten continental breakfast), we were down there at all different times from 6 to 9:30. There was a good variety of cereals, bagels, bread, fruit, usually a danish or muffins, hard boiled eggs, cheese, an either turkey or ham. There was coffee, juice, soda and tea. We did go down and took our breakfast back to our room (more relaxing). It was nice not to have to worry about breakfast. The hotel even had free internet if you brought your lap top, wahoo!!!

Instead of paying $250 a night and being herded through check-in like cattle, you'll pay a fraction and will be treated as an individual. Instead of having to stumble through the casino first thing in the morning to fork over $5 for a Starbucks coffee, you'll have AN ENTIRE KITCHEN, complete with full-sized refrigerator, coffee maker, range, microwave, toaster, and even a blender available to you. Instead of your group of four being forced to pony up for two overpriced rooms or a suite that costs as much as your mortgage payment, you can stay comfortably in one two-bedroom, two-bathroom Desert Rose apartment. Three of us stayed at the Rose in March for the first two rounds of the NCAA basketball tournament. We stayed there last year, but this year was even better because we got a better deal and a room with a better view. I called ahead and asked that we be accommodated on the top floor, and when we checked in, I spoke with the person who entered that request in the computer. That's service you won't find across the street at the huge MGM Grand. And don't put too much stock in the reviews saying how much walking there is. It's a five-minute walk to MGM, ten minutes to Mandalay, and maybe ten to NY-NY. Plus, Hooter's is right next door. The Desert Rose is extremely convenient, and most people walk up and down The Strip all day anyway. If you don't want to walk, head next door to MGM and catch the Monorail, or walk the block to the Deuce (bus) stop. The Desert Rose is a quiet respite from overdone Vegas, yet it's so close to all the action. You don't have to walk through all the slot noise just to get to your room after a long night of fun, and you're not assaulted by bright lights and ridiculous props. Plus, it's probably half the price and three times the value of any other Vegas property. The three stayed comfortably (one in each bedroom and one on the sofa bed) for four nights for the same price that we could have booked a big-property room for two nights. And because we had the full kitchen, we stopped at the store for \"provisions.\" We loaded the fridge with our own beer, milk, and OJ, and even bought and ate a frozen pizza one day. Where else could you save money by doing that? And here's the best tip: When coming from the airport, tell the cabbie to take Swenson to Tropicana. You'll need to turn left to go to the Rose, but if you turn right, you'll hit a Von's (Safeway brand) grocery store in about a mile. Load up with everything you need while the cabbie waits, and you won't go wanting your entire Vegas stay. You'll also save a ton of dough because you'll spend the same amount for a 12 pack at the store that you'll pay for two beers at any bar. The staff was superfriendly and accommodating, and we had everything we needed. The two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartments are great for large groups of friends or families; by staying here you can save your money for all the Vegas fun. We'll stay at the Rose for any future trips, and I encourage anyone to give this property a shot.", "Date": "April 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cYour next home away from home.\u201d", "Author": "bccc9914", "ReviewID": "UR27674834", "Content": "Located just a block off the \"strip\" this Hotel/Suites has everything available you could ever need.

Another review has commented on people wiping out the continental breakfast to hoard food.

One note - the MGM Grand is just across Tropicana, and if you want to use the Monorail's southern terminus (I recommend it for getting up and down the Strip, especially at night) you HAVE to access it through the Grand - it LOOKS like you can get to the monorail down the south side of the hotel, but pedestrians are not allowed and those are emergency exits that look like accesses.", "Date": "April 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGreat Accommodation Except for View\u201d", "Author": "jlinvill4", "ReviewID": "UR27545316", "Content": "This hotel is part of a time share property so it caters to its members but treats rental guests very well.

Before I booked I called and lady said 99.00, I advised her website said 59.40 and honored that. This is only my oppinion, But the room reminds me of an old apartment. The couch in the living room was very very outdated and dirty. All the other guests i saw like 90% were pretty scurvy looking. I definately didnt want to walk outside and go to other casinos. That just didnt sound like a great idea. On the positive side the bed was amazingly comfortable. The staff was friendly. Thats why i say its a tough review. Because 60.00 for a very large condo/apartment, with continental breakfeast. If you are poor or hurting for money, This is the absolute best deal. But im not poor and I wouldnt stay at Desert Rose again, sorry. Also one reviewer above wrote walls thin, thats very verty true! at 200am kids came running down hall. woke me up thats how thin walls are. Also room was hard to find and gate to go toyuor room, I saw people constantly letting other guests in.

The breakfast area was well stocked and well staffed so there was always ample food and a clean area. Unfortunately, you could see lots of guests taking advantage of the situation and loading up tons of food to stock their fridges and be used for lunches etc.. Honestly don't know how the Desert Rose can afford to run the breakfast with the amount of food that walks out the door! The pool area was clean and quiet. As it was too chilly to use the unheated pool, we did enjoy the use of the hot tub. The location is a quick 10 minutes walk to the Strip and a welcome oasis from all the activity of the Strip. About the only negative I can say is that some areas look a little tired. The first unit we were given was definitely more worn and used than the second unit.

The location allowed for easy (10-15 minute) walks to the MGM, NYNY, and Tropicana casinos. Having no casino on the property made it very family friendly. The pool was very cold (I'd estimate about 70-75 deg.) ; It would be nice if it was heated to a warmer temperature. We had a few sunny warm days where the kids would have liked to swim. The floorplan had one drawback in that the only bathroom could only be accessed off of the master bedroom. Children sleeping in the pull-out couch had to come through the bedroom to use the facilities. The kitchen was well appointed and modern. There is a safe in each room for valuables. The internet is extra ($10 per day) and beware, though it is wireless, it is only valid on one computer. As we had two laptops this was a bit bothersome as we expected both to be able to access the internet for one $10 fee.

Salespeople used the cocktail reception and other means to lure prospective buyers, however, they were not aggressive and left us alone.

There was a nice size living room and dining area as well. Our room was on the ground floor right beside the exit door which for us proved great.

For a 2 bedroom suite we paid $135 a night, and that did include free breakfast and free cocktail hour drinks. But you have to understand that this place is not a \"resort\", it's on par with a Super 8 or a Days Inn. It's a motel and nothing more. It's all \"motel\" style outside entrances, and the rooms are run down. In their defense, we were told that the building we were in has not been updated and the others have, but who knows? Our room was in rough shape - the carpets, the furnishings, etc...just looked worn. The free breakfast was a feeding frenzy of budet travelers looking to stock their in room fridges with enough food for a week. People were actually bringing mixing bowls and pans from their rooms and loading them with food from the buffet. One morning, the man in line in front of my husband cleared out the fruit bowl - including taking probably 6 to 8 bananas - all that were left in the bowl. When my husband asked if he could have just one banana for our two year old son, the man snapped \"NO\" at him. That was the mentality among the guests - it was this weird, survival like attitude as though these people hadn't eaten for weeks, snatching up everything in their paths. But the worst problem were the ants. The first morning following our check-in the night before we woke up to find ants in the kitchen, crawling out of a crack in the wall and heading to the garbage can. We had not left out food or anything that would have attracted them, and they seemed after something in the garbage. We promptly called the desk only to be told that it was an engineering problem and that engineering wouldn't be in until later. We asked if they could just send up a can of raid, ant traps or at least a new garbage can, and we were told that someone would be up later in the day. No one ever came up, even after multiple phone calls. By the following morning, the ants were worse, and still no one had been up to the room - so we decided to check out. THEN...we got a hassle about checking out early when we had booked four nights. We explained about the ants and told them we had tried to call multiple times, and the person at the desk told us we were required to go directly to the desk and speak with management if we had a complaint, and that we would have to pay for the two nights we weren't staying. After a lot of arguing, we were able to get out of those two nights, but they were extremely unpleasant about it, and not once did we receive an apology for the ant issue. We checked in to the Signature at $89 a night for a junior suite. We should have done so in the first place, but based on the reviews we tried the Desert Rose.

We had a two bedroom unit with two full bathrooms, fully equipped kitchen, a nice living room area with pull-out couch, a small dining area and three large screen TV's. Everything was in good condition and nicely maintained. Staff was friendly and helpful. Rates were an excellent value compared to hotel rates. Proximity to all hotels, convention activities and restaurants was excellent. Rates included a continental breakfast and full maid service once during our stay. Negatives: Our full maid service never happened. The only housekeeping service we received were daily replacement of towels and washcloths for bathrooms. No other cleaning services or change of bed linens was provided. Area for breakfast was off main lobby and space to eat was very limited and crowded. Food offerings were adequate but skimpy compared to other national chains offering continental breakfasts. Paper plates supplied were barely large enough to fit a piece of bread, necessitating the use of multiple plates for just a few small items to eat. Beverage cups were also small. After 2 or 3 tries at breakfast, we decided to find someplace more \"user friendly\" for the balance of our stay. Overall - a fairly good experience and a very good value for the size and scope of the accomodations. No housekeeping service, in spite of several calls, was a big negative.

We arrived almost two hours before the 4pm check in so was worried we may have to wait before we could check in and get onto exploring the strip, this was not the case and we was in our room within 10minutes, The staff on reception were very friendly, and were happy to answer any questions we had. Our room (or should I say suite) was lovely and incredibly clean, the kitchen was positively glistening; fully stocked with everything you could possibly need (blender, huge oven, even bigger fridge/freezer, plenty of plates, bowls etc, cooking utensils....) lovely big sofa in lounge with nice big TV and plenty of channels to choose from (this came in very handy for passing the time while I waited for my girlfriend to get herself ready to leave the room) the bedroom had plenty of space and storage for clothes, bed incredibly comfortable and dressing area nice, bath and shower had great water pressure and there was always enough hot water, You could also make free local calls from your room so long as it was under 60mins, this was very handy as we had friends staying in another hotel so this made it easy to arrange meeting up. The resort also had a nice pool with 24hr hot tub and a fully stocked gym with showers location was great also, we didn\u2019t have a car so relied upon the monorail (situated by mgm grand which is five minutes walk away, runs 21 hours of the day and is every 5 minutes) we both purchased a 3 day pass for $28 each, this gave us unlimited rides up and down the strip as far up as the stratosphere and is very good value when you consider one cab ride up to the strat will set you back $25 plus. The complementary breakfast from 7am till 9am was good, no hot food but nice array of bagels, different breads, ham, cheeses, jams, yogurt, bananas, apples and oranges, fruit juices and carbonated drinks and a Doule Egbert\u2019s hot drinks machine, also available was a good choice of cereals and some very tasty mini Danishes in their own packets (very handy for stocking up on for little snacks during the day) The Desert Rose also has a managers reception from 5pm till 7pm most days with a cheesy keyboard player playing lounge music, some cold pasta ( not to my girlfriends taste but very much to mine, cheeses, crisps (or chips depending on where you are from) a big bowl of dipping sauce and drinks (wines and beer, juices, sodas and hot stuff) even though the keyboard guy was on the cheesy side it made for a very nice start to the evening and he didn\u2019t seem to take himself too seriously and actually did his job to a very good standard although not quite Sinatra.... All in all myself and my better half had a fantastic time and really did not want to leave (kind of wished someone had approached us about a time share as we most likely would've bought the whole apartment, all staff were very helpful except for one guy who could not understand my English accent but he kept on smiling regardless and I just made sure I got seen by someone else. The concierge ladies where all also very helpful and helped us choose our grand canyon helicopter package (of which there are millions) if you have the funds we advise you do it, was absolutely amazing ESPECIALLY THE RETURN OVER THE STRIP AT SUNSET and just added to the already amazing memories we have brought back with us.

The DR is a short 2-3 minute walk to the MGM Grand, Hooters etc. The apartment was meticulously maintained, and lacked for nothing. The beds were comfortable, the bathrooms spick and span and the internet connection was fast. The rate included an American breakfast which was more than appreciated by all in our party. One evening, we were able to attend the Manager's reception for about 20 minutes, and noticed how happy everyone around us were. The airport is a short 5-7 minute drive away too. The best part was that it was away from all the noise and crowds that Vegas is famous for. We then stayed at the MGM Grand for two nights, and that is a whole different ball game -- our room in the west wing, was no way as comfortable as the one in DR, no breakfast, and tons of walking to and from our room to the elevators, reception desk, restaurants, parking you name it. We kept wishing we could go back to the DR. The housekeeping staff too were very very friendly at the DR.

Every staff member we met, from the reception staff to the cleaning staff were polite, friendly, courteous and eager to help us as much as they could. They didn't even get grumpy when we decided to book in for an extra night and then changed our minds about which night that would be...twice! (We were originally going to tack an extra night on to the end of our initial stay but then decided to have the extra night after we got back from our 2 nights in Death Valley) Our suite (standard king) was spacious, clean, well maintained, quiet and homely, the bed large and comfortable and everything we could have possibly needed in the kitchen (other than food, obviously) was provided for us. It really did feel like a home from home. The cleaning staff were prompt and efficient, every evening we returned to a clean and tidy set of rooms, they even put our dirty coffee mugs in the dishwasher on the one occassion we left them out. We had heard poor reviews of the breakfast buffet so avoided it for our first two mornings but on the third day we decided to give it a go, my boyfriend sallied forth and returned to our room with seeded bagels, ham, hard boiled eggs, cream cheese & mayonnaise, we then used our own facilities to toast the bagels and make them up ourselves. These were so tasty and such a resounding success that this is what we did every morning for the rest of our stay so I have to say that we disagree with the other reviewers about the breakfast, although admittedly we did not try and sit in the lobby and eat it. So maybe a top tip for people staying at the Desert Rose would be to collect breakfast from the buffet and take it back to the comfort of your suite to eat it! The walk to the Strip is very short, less than 5 minutes and you're at the MGM Grand or NYNY, we didn't find it a problem at all to walk this little extra distance.

A hotel shuttle service would be a great addition - even though it isn't too far to get to the strip, the bus stop or the tram.

It also means that you can be at the hotel really quickly and don't have to leave too early to get there to go home! The staff were also really friendly and helpful. We'd definitely stay there again and recommend it to friends.

We were in Vegas for a vacation, and had booked the hotel (through an online travel site) after reading such great reviews about it here on TA. We stayed in a 1 BR suite. I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed with our stay. After checking in after midnight, we arrived at our room to discover the following; - the TV didn't work - a few hairs were found in the bed - that they had placed us in a 'loud' location, despite requesting via email and phone that we be in a quiet location I called the front desk the next morning to report the problems, and to inquire about upgrading to a 2 bedroom room. We were willing to pay more for the upgrade, but were hoping to get somewhat of a deal due to our problems. The manager on duty advised me that a 2BR suite went for $400/night, but that she could do me a 'favour' and give it to me for $139/night. As we had booked through a third party, and had gotten 'such a low rate', our credit card would be charged $70/night to make up the difference between the rooms. I advised her that I had checked online, and that a 2BD suite did not go for $400/night (the rate of extremely highend Vegas resorts), and that i felt she was trying to take advantage of us. She became quite defensive upon hearing this, and implied that she was offering this rate at great personal risk to her! Needless to say, we didn't take her up on her offer. We payed approx. $510 CAN. for our 5 night stay, which at the time of the booking (two months in advance) would have meant that we were paying approx. $90US/night (our dollar was quite high when we booked). At the time of our stay, hotel rooms in Vegas were being heavily discounted due to the poor economy (on the day we left I even read a piece in USA Today about the Bellagio offering $300 rooms for $149/night due to high vacancy). SInce returning home, I've checked out the Desert Rose website and have seen 2BR suites offered for as low as $88/night, evidence that they've also reduced their rates contrary to what the manager implied. I'm disapointed that the manager tried to take advantage of our situation, and i have to say it left me with a bad taste in my mouth about the resort. But I guess I learned a valuable lesson - booking through a third party makes it extremely difficult to renegotiate your rate if the economy takes a downturn. Pros; - adequate breakfast, although the layout of the items made no sense - comfy beds - good water pressure in shower - spacious rooms - friendly staff otherwise - no casino, so no associated noise/smoke Cons: - dishonest management - poor quality toiletries - bring your own if you have sensitive skin - shower stall leaked all over the bathroom floor no matter how firmly you 'closed' the curtain - inadequate counter space in sink area - 5-10min. walk to strip", "Date": "October 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Stay at the Desert Rose\u201d", "Author": "clairelou123", "ReviewID": "UR21228455", "Content": "My Husband and I stayed at the Desert Rose Resort during September 2008.

We arrived very early (due to changed flight) 9am and guy at reception was very accomodating and said they could check us in immediately. Showed us two rooms - first had 2 Queen beds, was clean, tidy and on ground floor. We wanted second room to have twin beds so they showed us another room but this seemed old and drab, also on ground floor with door to roadway which did not have any deadbolts or other than standard ranchslider bolts so I went back and reiterated we would rather wait a couple of hours and get an upper floor room. The guy at reception seemed very unimpressed with my request and looked very annoyed, even though I was extremely polite which was a bit upsetting. I think he sensed he had upset me and calmed down and offered to have a room overlooking strip on second floor made up and ready by 12 but we couldn't get twin beds in the second room as they have hardly any rooms like that. We went to the strip and returned at 4pm. No room had been put aside for us and new receptionist apologised and let us look at a room on 3rd floor with view of strip (as far away from lobby and pool as possible), but it was very nice and clean and we could see Excalibur, Luxor, MGM, Tropicana from our balcony. After that it was great. Room was clean, tidy - the beds were fabulous (this was the third hotel in our trip and by far best beds and pillows). We had two room condo with two bathrooms, three televisions, full kitchen, and dining. My daughter slept on the sofa which was hugely comfortable and all was well. The breakfast in the morning is from 6am to 9am. The earlier you went the better table you got however we went about 7.30am every day and had no problem. We had cereals, toast, bagels, cold boiled eggs, danishes, coffees, hot chocolate and other drinks. Brilliant for free! We went to the mix and mingle drinks and nibbles one evening and it was very pleasant and we talked to people from UK so that was lovely. Pool was small and we didn't use it... every day by 9am all of the deck chairs are taken as people put their towels on them whilst they have breakfast and then sunbathe all day. Hotel is very handy to strip - 10 mins walk maximum to Excalibur, Luxor, MGM and 5 mins to Hooters, Tropicana. We used the $5 each all day bus pass and rode up and down the strip - good value for money but don't expect to get up and down too fast as it stops continuously but cheap sightseeing tour and it goes to the outlet malls too! I would stay here again as excellent large apartments for families compared to hotel rooms. Do NOT use the phone in your room though. I made a 4 minute call to NZ which should have cost about $10 and it cost $42USD. I queried this on checkout and the receptionist told me that the hotel charge about $20 just to dial out an international call and then charge quite a lot per minute and they usually \"warn\" their customers about this on checkin.

We stayed for 4 nights from 12th-16th October and booked way back in January for an amazing price of \u00a336 per night for the room through Expedia. When we arrived it had been a busy weekend so rooms weren't going to be available until the stated time of 4 pm. We left our bags in the secured storage and went for a walk , an hour later our room was available, block 3 top floor, though there are only 3 floors in each block. It was so nice to be able to arrive at the hotel and be in your room within a few minutes without having to traipse through a casino, especially if you had forgotten something !! It has been said many times in previous reviews that the rooms are great, they are, everything is provided even down to a small bottle of washing up liquid, and pan scrubber !!! The fridge was huge and typically American in size with automatic ice making facility. Everything was spotless in the kitchen. The living room area was large , there was some staining on the lounging furniture where drinks had been spilled but didn't detract from how homely it all felt. We had a one bedroom unit and it had a walk in closet with an electronic safe which was free to use. The only negative thing was the actual bath and loo area was tiny, anyone of a larger than average size would have to squeeze around the door to close it before using the facilities . The manager's cocktail reception ( 5-7pm ) each evening was a nice touch, there was live music provided by a guy singing with a keyboard, some people actually got up dancing they were having so much fun. Snacks were also provided. Breakfast was appreciated in the lobby but could have gone on a little later than 9am, we only managed to make it on one morning out of the 4 which is what I suppose the hotel relies on !! It was very busy . You can take the food back to your room though . Pool area was nice but small and there were several selfish lounge chair hoggers during our stay. We witnessed towels and personal items left on loungers in the best spots for hours with no one arriving to claim them. I hope those people lost lots of money in the casinos!!! The jacuzzi was extremely hot but very good. I can understand not wanting to heat the main pool but felt that the toddlers pool should at least be heated as there were one or two little ones that wanted to go swimming but the pool was too cold for them. If you turn right instead of left towards MGM/ Tropicana when you get to the main road there is a restaurant called Coco's next to Motel 6 . It is open 24 hours and does breakfast specials as well as a senior ( age 55+) menu. We had a meal here and it was very good , We also went to Ellis island for their $6.99 filet steak special which includes a beer !! WORD OF WARNING- we have stayed all over the world and visited the USA many times but this was the first time this has happened to us. Our room was already paid for in full and we registered our credit card for incidentals which is standard procedure. When we went out the first night we found out our credit card had been blocked after trying to purchase show tickets. The girl told me that hotels put blocks on cards to ensure their bills are paid. I had heard of this but it had never happened to us before. To say I was fuming is putting it mildly. I queried this with reception and they insisted it was our credit card company. I found out at the airport that this was a lie as I was able to use my credit card to purchase perfume, I hadn't contacted my UK credit card company as we were able to use another card during our Vegas stay so it was the hotel who lifted the block when we checked out. The girl on the airport perfume counter was very helpful and gave me some good advice for our next hotel in San Francisco.", "Date": "October 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful place to stay\u201d", "Author": "MeijiCollector", "ReviewID": "UR21150412", "Content": "Just stayed there for 8 days.

Bed was comfortable and en-suite was good, vanity area was handy given the small size of the actual \"bathroom\", but it was more than enough. Also the in room safe was very handy. The free breakfast was good, ham, cereal, bread, bagels, fruit, yougurt, danish, tea/coffee and soft drinks ( bring one of the big cups from the room, styrofoam cups are way to small). The pool was good, gets busy early though and the bbq's are really good too. The resort itself is right next to Hooters casino, which has cheap table games and is no where near as tacky as I thought it would be.

They now include their complimentary cocktail service on Fridays for 5-7pm. It used to only be Sun-Thurs. Not sure if that is temporary. Breakfast is decent too. It won't \"wow\" you but it is a great option and it is free! The only problem I encountered on this trip was the refrigerator was warm when we got there and it took nearly a day to cool down. The freezer was cold though. I think they may turn them off to save electricity when nobody is using the room. I think I'll call ahead next time and ask them to check on it before I arrive to get a head start on the cooling process. Other than that, Desert Rose is right behind Hooters and Tropicana. The walk to MGM is maybe 10 minutes at the most. Not bad but it can be grueling in the summer heat. But that can't be avoided in Vegas. Oh and the rooms are much nicer than they were 2 or 3 years ago. The renovated them since I was first there about 4 or 5 years ago. It is like being at an apartment there. Much more confortable than a regular hotel room. And a full kitchen may not be necessary but it can come in hand.

All staff we encountered were very helpful and did their best to ensure we had a first class stay. Our suite was exceptionally well equipped with everything we could have needed for a stay of several weeks, including all crockery and cutlery, a full size cooker and microwave, together with fridge/freezer and dish washer. There was a very good full cold buffet breakfast, which was a little crowded on 2 of the 5 mornings we ate there, but we were always able to find a table to eat at. It was a delight to return to the hotel at the end of the day as, although it was only 2 blocks off the Strip, it felt so relaxed. We were concerned that it was close to the airport, but we didn't so much as hear a plane go overhead. This is an excellent hotel which is well managed and offers great value for money.

We arrived late at night, but were greeted by a lovely lady at the front desk. She processed everything in a timely matter, provided us each with a door/room key, and gave us an information sheet about the hotel. The lobby is a separate building with the outdoor pool in the middle of the all the surrounding buildings. There are doors that are key activated on each building as well as the outside gates. This key also opens your room door. Elevators are provided if you are on the second or third floor of your building. The room was very spacious. We had the two bedroom suite. Each had their own bathroom. One bath had a tub/shower combo, while the other had a huge walk-in shower with multiple shower heads. One room has a king bed while the other is a queen. The sectional sofa in the living room also folds out to a queen. The kitchen is very nice with updated appliances, granite coutertops and all the utensils and kitchen supplies you could possibly need. A small dining room is located just off the kitchen area. A small balcony is off the living room. Our room had a view of Mandalay Bay and surrounding area, but some rooms had a courtyard view only. A continental breakfast is provided every morning. Fresh fruit, bagels, cereal, and packaged danishes are just a few things offered. Many people chose to eat in the lobby or outside patio. Our group opted to make a few selections and take them back to our room. There is a concierge service in the lobby if you are needing assistance. The front desk will also call a cab for you if you need one as there is not a cab station. We found it easier to walk about a block to Hooters or the MGM for a cab. There is also a small diner and food mart about 2 or 3 blocks from the hotel on Tropicana Ave. The hotel provided happy hour on the weekend with prize drawings and karaoke. Make sure you keep your key card away from your other credit cards and cell phone as they will deactivate.

The free continetal breakfast was more than ample with a very wide variety to choose from, there was snacks & cold drinks throught out the day and every evening there was a \"manager's special\" which was beer,wine & snacks all of which was FREE ( there is no bar though but dont let this put you off ) It was less than a 5 minute walk to the strip and if you walked onto the strip you could get a \"deuce\" bus which ran 24hrs a day and was only $5 for a 24hr ticket, very good if you wanted to get on and off at various hotel's/casino's on the strip ( will say that it isn't the quickest mode of transport though so if you in a hurry or need to be somewhere for a certain time do not use ) Best place for steak has got to be \"Outback\" ( next to M&M world ) you will not be disappointed trust me !! Must see's whilst there is \"The Secret Garden\" inside the Mirage ( dolphins & white lion's & tigers ) the top of the Straitaphere Tower is a must aswell and if you feeling brave then go on all 3 ride's on the top of the tower they are fantastic !! Go down town if you have time as Freemont Street is amazing, especially the light show's above you.....Don't bother going to circus circus \"adventure dome \" as it is a waste of money and it takes less than an hour to go on all the ride's.

This hotel is not on the strip, but it is very close - a couple blocks from the luxor, (you can walk through the back lot of MGM), although I don't think I would recommend anyone doing this at night unless your with a large group. The lay out of the hotel is also a little annoying. Our first night there we had to circle around the block to find an entrance way as a chain would be put up towards the side we were located (Building 3) at night and we would have to park our rental car near the first entrance and walk around the building to get to our room. The room layout was pretty nice though. Every room has a fridge, stove, microwave, and other kitchen amenities which was nice if you want to save some money on food. The continental breakfast is pretty decent , although this was packed with people every single day and we were amazed to see so many kids here. The front desk staff was very helpful and so was housekeeping. I would recommend this place for families with kids under 18 only.

I've seen better at your basic hotel than the one offered here. They clean everyday which I wasn't sure of because of the property being a time share, but they don't do a really great job.

I\u2019d checked out the property on a previous trip to Las Vegas, and I\u2019d red numerous Tripadvisor reviews, so I felt good about our choice. My son was attending a week-long event at the Mirage, but their rooms are too expensive for us, plus we liked the idea of having more space, including a full kitchen. We paid less than $700 for the 8-night stay. The hotel is arranged in four buildings, each of which houses a quarter of the 200 guest rooms. I believe that only one of the buildings is accessible directly through the lobby. With the others (such as ours), you use your room key to open either a security gate or an outside door, and then you can get to any of the rooms in that building. (Note: if you\u2019re traveling with a large group, it will definitely be more convenient if you\u2019re all in the same building. Well, of course, that\u2019s assuming you like the group.) Within a building, the rooms are arranged on three floors, with a sort of a central courtyard, but the courtyard is just gravel and a few bushes, i.e., not very interesting. There are concrete hallways to get to some of the rooms, leading to carpeted hallways to get to others, but even the carpeted hallways are more or less open-air. I believe that all of the rooms have small balconies, each with a couple of chairs and a small table, but since the view from ours was of the tiny courtyard (and of everyone else\u2019s balcony), we didn\u2019t really use it. We arrived at about four-thirty in the afternoon, but the line was short and check-in was quick. The check-in clerk noticed our request for no down bedding (I am allergic to feathers); she put us in a room on the third floor of building 2, and asked housekeeping to replace the bedding. By the time we got to the room (maybe five minutes later), the housekeeping staff was already there to take care of the change; I was impressed at their efficiency. My son absolutely loved our room, which was basically like a little apartment. The kitchen was well-provided with cookware, utensils, glassware, plates, etc. Appliances included a toaster, a blender, a coffee-maker, and a mixer (that\u2019s in a drawer), as well as full-sized fridge, oven/cooktop, dishwasher and microwave. All rooms, except for the toilet/shower room, were of a good size, and well-appointed. There is an anteroom to the toilet/shower room that has a sink, huge mirror, and maybe six square feet of counter space \u2013 plenty of room. I ended up setting up my laptop computer on the bathroom vanity, where it was convenient but out of the way, and had a small bench seat that tucked into a knee-hole. I believe there is just one smallish elevator in each of the four buildings, but since there are only about 50 rooms per building, with a third of them on the ground floor anyway, there was never much of a wait for the elevator. We bought groceries for the week (we had a rental car, without which this would have been difficult). When we put the cold stuff into the fridge, we found that the fridge door wouldn\u2019t stay shut (it didn\u2019t close well when the fridge was empty, and the problem was worse when the fridge door had stuff on its shelves). We phoned maintenance and a man came up immediately to fix it. So again, the housekeeping/maintenance folks were efficient. Our maid tended to forget to replenish both the dishwasher detergent and the bath gel, and she seldom left us any hand-towels. I think she even forgot to vacuum for several days. When I called down for dishwasher detergent, they sent some right up; I didn\u2019t bother with the other issues. We had a couple of maintenance problems (e.g., the toaster didn\u2019t work, and the drawers on the TV stand really wanted to slide open), but in general, anything that wasn\u2019t just right was put right immediately upon reporting it. I must say that we did find the hotel to be a bit noisy, especially at night. I don\u2019t think the sound insulation was very good, as we could frequently hear other guests moving around, running in the corridors, or even, in one case, greeting one another loudly, from their balconies, at midnight. My son slept in the living room, and the noise of the air conditioner going on and off kept him awake the first couple of nights, but then he got used to it. The hotel is quite close to the airport, but we weren\u2019t really troubled by airport noise. I used earplugs to shut out the noise of the other guests, and that worked well. Breakfast was fine. You could take it back to your room to eat (as we did), but please note that they don\u2019t provide trays for that. (I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s to discourage folks from taking enough to feed the neighborhood.) We\u2019d brought a couple of small plastic trays from home, so after the first morning, I just brought a tray with me when I went to pick up breakfast. They consistently offered boiled eggs, yogurt, bagels and cream cheese, bread, butter, jam, cereals and packaged pastries. They usually also had rolled slices of ham, along with mustard and mayo packets. One morning, they had lox. The coffee machine made cappuccinos and lattes (regular and decaf). There were also tea bags available. The crowd at breakfast was usually not too big for the area, except for one day, when, for some reason, there was a real mob. We did go down to the little happy hour a few times, but it wasn\u2019t anything to write home about. One night, the snacks were tortilla chips, salsa and cheese cubes; on another night, there was a large bowl of pasta salad and another of crackers. The pasta salad wasn\u2019t really anything you could take away as you wandered toward the strip, but I think maybe that was the point, as the \u201chappy hour\u201d appears to be somehow tied in to the timeshare thing (they wanted you to hang around in the lobby so they could try to sell you a timeshare). They served alcohol (I\u2019m assuming just beer and wine) from a service window in the lobby, and the soft drink machine was turned on during happy hour, so you could help yourself to that. And there was a guy playing a keyboard, singing, and telling very tired jokes. In another review, the writer complained about being bothered by messages from the concierge about picking up their \u201cwelcome packet,\u201d and how, when they finally went down to get the packet, it was just a bunch of brochures. We had a message from the concierge every morning, giving the weather forecast and reminding us that we could stop by for our packet. It was clearly just a group voicemail, so I listened to the forecast and blew off the rest. There were also occasional concierge messages to remind us of the evening happy hour; in that one, there was generally some mention of a raffle to give away a trip. I didn\u2019t want to get roped into a timeshare hard-sell, so I didn\u2019t check it out. There is a guest laundry room in building 2. I think it\u2019s the only one on the property, but I\u2019m not sure. The washer and the dryer each required 3 quarters. (Note: there was no change machine in the laundry room, but you can get change at the front desk.) I brought laundry detergent and dryer sheets with me (again, due to allergies), but a sign did indicate that laundry detergent was available in the tiny convenience store in the lobby. The wash took maybe 30 minutes, and the dry maybe 40. The room and machines were clean and in good condition. The hotel apparently contracts with an outside company to provide wireless internet service. It costs $9.95 per day, and I think the day ends at 4:00 pm. The service, provided by Wayport, worked fine. I\u2019d be giving the Desert Rose a 5 if it weren\u2019t for the maid service and the noise.", "Date": "July 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ca", "Title": "\u201cLuv!!! the Desert Rose Resort\u201d", "Author": "naughtymama", "ReviewID": "UR18023953", "Content": "Absolutely Fabulous.

Von's (Safeway-so bring your card to get the discounts) is 6km down Trop ave. In the hot summer months like July I would ask for a 2-3rd floor room. There were crickets all over the grounds.

Our room was beautiful (two-bedroom, two-bathroom) with one king bed and two twins. The kitchen was nice-- we could keep cold drinks, etc. in the refrigerator, and even cook if we wanted to. The continental breakfast was a great added feature-- we didn't need to go out and find somewhere to eat and it was enough to hold us until lunchtime or later. The room was nice and quiet, the staff was very friendly and helpful. The bed and pillows were super comfortable. The parking was great-- not a hike to the car like in the big hotels. We just loved the Desert Rose and will be returning with our husbands next time!", "Date": "July 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Resort!\u201d", "Author": "Ridingfun", "ReviewID": "UR17856366", "Content": "This is a wonderful resort for those looking to have a top notch room with benefits an amenities not found with strip resorts.

It is is a Las Vegas oasis! When we entered our room, it was clean, cool and inviting. After our 7 night stay, it was confirmed what a restful experience we had. After visiting every hotel on The Strip, the casinos all begin to look the same, and the crowds were quite encroaching over the July 4th weekend. We were always able to park close to our room with our rental car, or rest quietly between walkabouts. The continental breakfast was approximately the same every day, which after about 5 days had my husband longing for some bacon and scrambled eggs. I, on the other hand think the Desert Rose breakfast offering to be perfect for starting a fast paced day; there was plenty of cereals, milk, boiled eggs, bagels, luncheon meats, instant oatmeal, pastry, yogurt, fresh fruit, coffee, juice, soda, toast... I thought the selection was copious, light, and incredible. My advice is to go early, and enjoy relaxing at a table. Whenever we came in closer to closing time, it appeared more hectic, but we never experienced a crowed at 6:30 or 7 AM. All this for the cost of our room, which saved us A LOT on our food budget. The front desk staff was accessible and polite. The concierge appeared to be doing more than just being helpful; I think they also sell Shell Vacation Memberships, although I didn't sense a lot of pressure, as you sometimes do on The Strip, to listen to their sales pitch. We were able to have our airline boarding pass printed at the concierge desk, and were very appreciative of that.

We stayed for 8 days. This Resort was excellent for our family of five. The suite had: a kitchen with stove, refrigerator, microwave, all cooking necessities, dishwasher, even a garbage disposal; dining area for at least six people to sit and eat meals; nice living room off of the kitchen area with a pull-out couch; a small bedroom with a double bed; a master bedroom with a king size bed and its own bathroom including a large stall shower; a separate bathroom in the hallway; also I think this suite had more closet space than my house! Generally, the hotel was very low key. NO gambling at all - not even a slot machine. Breakfast was included every morning which consisted of the following: mini bagels, toasting bread, apples, oranges, mini danishes, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, cold cereal, slices of ham, juices and coffee. The breakfast hours were quick and crowded - get there early - seating was minimal. The lobby contained a small convenience store that sold items like soda, water, laundry detergent and boxes of chicken you could stick in the oven. There was a very nice fitness center right off the pool. The pool was small but proportionate to the resort. I don't believe the water was heated but our stay was in July so the cooler water was refreshing for us. There was a ping pong table near the pool too. Also a very tiny kiddy pool that we mistook for a jacuzzi. Then we found the actual jacuzzi - little too hot for July though! There were two very nice BBQ's for your use in the pool area as well. The location of this resort was great. It's a short walk to MGM, Luxor, Excalibur, New York, New York and the Showcase Mall. It's located directly behind the Hooteers Hotel/Casino and it's easy to find and get to. Our stay at Desert Rose was perfect for our family. In contrast to the big hotel/casinos, we loved this resort. We would have been lost had we stayed at the Luxor or the Bellagio. We didn't have to walk 20 minutes or use GPS to get to the pool and we didn't have to spend $30 on breakfast every day. If we had to choose one thing that we didn't like about this hotel it was the concierge. They were not really helpful. Of course, this is a time share so they did want to pitch their properties. That part wasn't the problem. They were actually very low key about that. Their incentive was, \"spend 90 minutes with us and we'll give you $100 in Hooters money and ?? slot machine money\". For us, we actually went to Hooters the first night we arrived and it was absolutely horrible so $100 in Hooters money was not worth our time. The other incentive was not worth it either, believe me. But just about every piece of information the concierge handed out to us didn't really pan out. They told us fireworks would be 9pm on the strip on the 4th of July - well, there were NO FIREWORKS on the 4th of July in Vegas!! You would think the concierge would know that! They gave us outdated instructions to Red Rock Canyon - we figured it out though. They weren't responsible for the brochures in the lobby which ran out mid-week or the internet computer and printer which ran out of toner just as I was printing my boarding passes. These things were located right in front of their desk. This was a bit frustrating!

From the MGM you have access via Monorail to any hotel on the strip. The rooms at the Desert Rose are brilliant, a large lounge and bedroom with a handy kitchen, it's also nice to have a bit of out door space with a balcony - something you won't get with the majority of the strip hotels!

We also found buying food to prepare quite expensive, with the good \u00a3 against the $ at the moment we were expecting food to be bit a lot cheaper, but it wasn't! I'd suggest eating out.... a much less expensive option in the long run.

We stayed from Saturday May 31st through Thursday June 5th, and had a wonderful time! Each of us (couples) had a wonderfully decorated one bedroom suite... My hubby and I were on the 3rd floor with a slight view of the pool and the Tropicana Hotel. Housekeeping did a great job at keeping our suite tidy and spotless daily, and the kitchen was fully stocked with all the utensils one would need for their stay. All in all, we had an excellent stay at The Desert Rose. It was a very laid back and quiet place, which was a lovely change from the \"chaos\" of the strip. The hotel is located just southeast of the Tropicana, and directly behind the Hooters Casino (the old San Remo Hotel), so we found the walking distance to the strip was very easy (about 10 minutes at the very most). The MGM Grand was a quick 5 minute walk, and it gave us easy access to the Monorail system. The pool area was lovely and clean, and the pool itself was cool and refreshing after our hot days out on the strip. The hotel grounds were also kept very nice and clean, and you felt more so like you were in a resort instead of just a hotel off the strip. Every morning there was a basic continental breakfast with cereals, mini bagels, toast, boiled eggs, and various coffees and juices. It was nothing special, but certainly made for a good start to your day. Overall, it we had a fantastic time at the Desert Rose.

(but don't try to ring anyone about it!)\u201d", "Author": "BrainOfMorbius", "ReviewID": "UR16720386", "Content": "First impressions of the rooms at the Desert Rose Resort were fine. There were three of us on this trip and there was more than enough space in the room for all of us. In block 1 on the ground floor, the room came with two TV's, a king-size bed and both the fridge and microwave big enough to store a fully-grown racehorse, so we were all fairly pleased on arrival with what we'd booked. But, after only one full day, things took their first bad turn. After travelling from England the time difference took a day or two to acclimatise to, consequently I was up early during the second night of our stay and was greeted in the kitchen by a bug bigger than my thumb, scuttling around in one of the kitchen cupboards. Both me and my wife saw a similar beastie in our bedroom in the morning and reported this problem at the desk. Fair play to the guy at the desk who gave us a new room immediately on the third floor in block 3. So we packed our gear and moved room. A great start eh? Maybe they\u2019re just on the first floor\u2026 My wife decided to call her mother back home to tell her how we were doing. She hadn't bought a phone card yet so she knew the call would have to be a quickie. She was on the phone for 5 minutes (according to the desk staff). We were charged $39 for this call. $39 FOR 5 MINUTES. I still can't believe it now. We found out the charge for this call through a feature on the TV and my wife went off to the desk to query the extreme cost of the call. To be honest, the response and attitude of the staff were nothing short of staggering. Firstly, they pleaded the hotel's absolute innocence by saying that the phone charges were nothing to do with them as the room phones were handled by an external contractor. Secondly, my wife was told, according to the disclaimer, that international rates may vary. I don't know what their idea of variance is but $8 per minute isn't mine. The lady behind the desk also had the nerve to tell my wife that she should consider herself lucky (!?) as an American chap who was checking out at that very time had a phone bill of approximately $300. My wife asked for the contact details of the phone company so she could address them directly - but guess what? The phone company's 'privacy had to respected'. What about the rights of their guests to get a fair deal out their holiday package? The hotel's attitude over this debacle bordered on ignorance and showed utter contempt to those of us footing these extortionate bills. Surely it can't all be bad, or can it...? Well, a kitchen cupboard door fell off in my wife's hands, almost taking her head off. The hotel did send someone to fix the door quickly so fair play there. Another bad point came during the second week of our stay; I've never stayed at a hotel where the staff will not cash a traveller's cheque for their guests, so you know what's coming next. Yes, we were told to go to the hotel next door (Hooter's). I started to think that I was not really in a hotel but in some American TV prank show with hidden cameras. With only two days left of our stay the final nail was thrust into our coffin. Ants, and lots of them, had decided to lodge with us without our consent. What\u2019s worse is that they had decided to use the kitchen as their lodgings. The kitchen cupboards were crawling with them, along with the floor and benches. They did have one thing going for them; at least they were clean. I could tell by the fact they had begun to occupy the bathroom too. The hotel sent a guy to spray the room to rid us of our horde of tiny squatters, and also a cleaner to tidy up the plethora of ant -corpses. She remarked that the whole of block 3 had the same problem, which only served to mystify me as to why something more stringent, and on a larger scale, hadn\u2019t been done earlier to solve this problem that the staff were apparently aware of. I wouldn\u2019t come back to the Desert Rose as I genuinely think that my money would be better spent at another establishment. The good thing is that the poor quality of the hotel didn\u2019t ruin my stay as Las Vegas is such a great place for a holiday.", "Date": "June 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Formby, England", "Title": "\u201cWebtours\u201d", "Author": "webtours26", "ReviewID": "UR16699994", "Content": "We are a English couple of 50 yrs plus and found the Desert Rose to be excellent for what we paid for 8 nights.

I was overwhelmed by the size \u2013 almost too big for me to stay in by myself! Bed was extremely comfortable. Fantastic facilities and 2 tvs. Unfortunately like a previous reviewer has said, the TV remotes would hardly work \u2013 possibly a battery problem but I am not sure. \u2022 One of the cleanest rooms (and hotels on that count) I have ever stayed in. The staff: \u2022 Fantastic really, very friendly. Fast checkin Now for my list of annoyances: \u2022 On the fist night I arrived, my plane was majorly delayed, so didn\u2019t step inside the room till 11PM. Went out quickly and got a bite to eat, only to come back and find I could not get back in my room! My key card swiped OK, but there was a problem with the electronic door lock and it would just not open. They even tried the master key and that failed. So I waited about 75mins for my door to be opened\u2026. I finally got in about 1.30AM. Let me just say, the security guy, and onsite engineer were fantastic people, very friendly and helped as quickly as they could \u2013 thankyou. The guy at the front desk was also great as he let me have a free snack. Now I wouldn\u2019t normally comment on such a thing (because these things happen), but the other annoyances I had, forced me to include this. \u2022 I went to use the ATM machine beside the concierge the next night and it simply didn\u2019t work - the screen was frozen. They restarted it, and still the same. After trying again the next morning I gave up, and had to walk all the way up to the next hotel to use theirs. \u2022 What is it with this hotel \u2013 everything is breaking down!!! As reported in the last review, the breakfast facilities were closed due to health regulations \u2013 fair enough. But the whole situation could have been handled much better by the staff. I was given an $8 voucher on arrival to use the next morning at Hooters. The next night I had to go back and get another voucher \u2013 only this time they said they could not issue them till after 7AM. I went to the front desk at about 10.15AM (knowing that Hooters breakfast went till 11AM), thinking there would not be a problem, and they told me I could not have one, because the \u2018desert rose hotel\u2019 only served breakfast till 10AM. So even though Hooters served till 11, they still wouldn\u2019t give me one. And why didn\u2019t I get told of this picky rule earlier!!! So I had to buy my own breakfast. I talked to the manager the next morning and I said my breakfast should be refunded to me. She said ok, but I needed a receipt\u2026. silly me, didn\u2019t obtain a receipt from the breakfast \u2013 so no refund!! Personally this was just not good enough \u2013 this is false advertising, you cannot advertise a complimentary breakfast and not give it. \u2022 And my last gripe is that management told me the credit card I gave them on checkin, would not be charged and I would be given the opportunity to pay cash for any in-room charges on checkout. On checkout, it was too late, my credit card had already been charged the day before. Normally such a little thing wouldn\u2019t bother me, but my card is a foreign one and a number of fees get put onto it for overseas purchases. The reason staff gave me for this problem was their systems were playing up and not working properly. They offered me no refund and NO option to pay in cash like I wanted to. Argghhh, is anything electronic in this hotel working!! Very disappointed. I had a lot of frustrations when this was meant to be a very comfortable stay. And I know the management will respond to this report\u2026. you need to clean up all these little nuisances.", "Date": "May 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cHighly Recommended\u201d", "Author": "summergs", "ReviewID": "UR15613674", "Content": "GENERAL- 3 Stars - Upon arrival I was a little nervous as the exterior and lobby were dated circa 70's.

The problem is Wayport charges $10 per 24/hr period and the rediculous part of it is that the 24hour period is not determined by the time you sign up, rather, the 24hr period is from 4pm-4pm. Which means if you sign up at 2pm you only get 2hrs worth of service. RIP OFF!! Try calling the Wayport Tech Support Number, GOOD LUCK!!

I got an apartment instead of a room, a better price, a nice walk to the monorail, friendly service. It was super clean and even had recorded jazz in the lobby. It was close to the action, but you could still rest in the hot tub and enjoy the desert breeze before bed.

Our room was very clean and the bed was probably the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in. However, we arrived on Thursday evening and was not told there would be no complimentary breakfast because the Health Dept had come in and shut them down due to no hot water in the kitchen. We found this out when we came in the next morning at 7:00 AM. I asked if they offered any kind of voucher for a nearby restaurant, and they gave me $20 in Hooters Bucks (Hooters is right next door). It would have been nicer if I didn't have to ask for them, it made me wonder how many other people were entitled to them but didn't get them because they didn't know to ask. So it went the entire stay, every morning I had to go to the lobby to request my Hooters Bucks. As stated before, the pool is not heated and even though the days were in the 80s, it still wasn't enough to make the pool warm enough to swim in. The hot tub was very nice and relaxing, though.There is construction going on at the hotel, and Friday morning I heard noise outside my bedroom and peaked out the slider to find a construction worker sneaking a cigarette outside my window. The kitchen was very well stocked with pots, pans, utensils and dinnerware. One thing we could have used was a baking sheet...no bigger, I just flipped the roasting pan over. They only supplied 2 napkins, that was kind of strange. I guess my biggest disappointment was with housekeeping. They didn't replenish anything! We had to go to the lobby to request more soap, more shampoo, more dishwashing soap, even more towels! They didn't do anything but make the beds and empty the garbage cans in our room. The shower and sinks were not cleaned the whole 4 days we were there. I know this is a timeshare property, and if I was there using my timeshare points, I would have been very unhappy. I've stayed in timeshares before that were much nicer, in fact, just a block or so away is the Wyndam Grand Desert and it is much nicer than the Desert Rose.

We had planned on a players' suite at a strip hotel but they been booked by the time we had chosen our trip dates. As an alternative, we found this all-suite hotel just off the Strip (4 nights at $555 total including continental breakfast) and with a 9 year old, we didn't mind avoiding the casino crowds. We arrived Friday evening and quickly picked up our rental car at the Las Vegas Rental Car center which is located off-airport property. The rental shuttle was well-marked and left quickly with little to no delay from the airport to arrive at the rental car center. Once at the rental car center, we were able to do our paperwork quickly and was out the door with a md-size car of our choice for only $89/four days rate from Dollar Rental Company. I would recommend obtaining a car in Las Vegas since the rates are so reasonable and ALL of the hotels located both on the Strip and the Downtown area have free parking available. This car was also handy to make quick trips to the local supermarket for food essentials. As you exit the rental car facility, you take an immediate right and then another immediate right which should then be the Las Vegas Strip. To arrive at Desert Rose, just travel down the strip until you see the lights of Excalibur, Tropicana, New York New York and the MGM Grand which is the intersection of Las Vegas Strip and Tropicana Blvd. At this intersection, take a right and just after Hooters, take your immediate right onto Duke Ellington Way which is where the Desert Rose is located. You are literally one-half block from the MGM Grand Lobby and the Monorail and just one-half block south of the Strip. It is an ideal location to traverse Las Vegas. Now, sign-in was no problem; however your choice of buildings could be. Our original building was building #4 which is in the northeast location of the property. Our room had a very noisy A/C unit and since I am a light sleeper, I could hear it come on and off. Also, you need to be careful as to not be on the hallway where all the maids meet in the morning to start their rounds. You can definitely hear them and I do think the room's walls were somewhat thin. After one restless night, we requested and received a move to a different room which was located in Building #2 (southeast corner of the property) which we were informed had been newly renovated with the flat-screen TVs. The room was just as pleasant as the other and certainly a bit quieter than the old room. The rooms are standard Marriott/Shell timeshare quality with your fully-equipped kitchens and bathrooms. We had a nice size king-size bed/bath on one side with a living area/kitchen/dining area on the other. The pull-out bed was comfortable with pillows/sheets and comforter provided. No issues as to room quality or convenience were noted. There was 2 TV's with pay-per-view movies as well as a room safe. The included breakfast was nothing special but ample - lox/cream cheese/bagels, cereals, yogurt, fresh fruit, hard-boiled eggs, and milk, coffees, juices, and teas. There was also happy hours with free beer/wine/snacks that we didn't partake since we were always out sight -seeing. Vonn's Supermarket is easy to find - just continue south down Tropicana Blvd. and it is on your right about two miles pass Duke Ellington Road. And the airport is also just down the street from the hotel off of Tropicana Blvd. but surprisingly, you don't hear any of the planes. Now as to Las Vegas itself, you are a short walk/drive to any of the number of casinos. With a young child, we tried to find as many child -friendly locations as possible. We first went to Excalibur. Their arcade area was labeled \"lame\" by our experienced 9-year old so off to New York-New York arcade area which was rated the best by our child rater. He had a good time winning coupons which he traded for cheap, typical arcade fun items. From an adult standpoint, the Excalibur Casino was well-used/worn and the New York-New York was newer/better in quality. We also visited the MGM Grand across the street and enjoyed the lion exhibit. The MGM was on the same quality level as New York-New York. There are lots of eateries in the MGM ranging in price from expensive to very inexpensive (McDonald's as an example). From our other casino exploration, we found that Circus Circus was the lowest in quality/ ambiance (we felt that all of Central America had declared this to be the only spot to visit in Las Vegas) and it was certainly showed its worn spots both in the Casino and the Adventuredome area. My child hated the arcade and rides so that will tell you something about the quality found there. We also took side trips to Caesar's Palace which has held up well although you could tell it was older. The Mirage was still beautiful having the most extensive foliage that we saw. Now we didn't visit the new Venetian and Wynn but there were certainly gorgeous from the Strip. The Luxor Hotel/Casino was definitely worn and looked old and their arcade area was being closed permanently as of 4/19/08 so adjust your plans accordingly if you had included that in your lodging activities. Finally, Mandalay Bay was nice and could be a good location on the Strip with its extensive pool areas. They only had a shark exhibit for children and again, after Sea World, this was not really satisfying to a child who has seen and petted real dolphins and penguins. For activities, we took a side trip to the downtown hotels and there is free parking (you have to join one of the downtown hotels players club and show that you played $ in their machines to receive the free parking validation). The downtown casinos were interesting and from what I was told, has the best payouts in slots. They had a few of the older style machines if you preferred to hear the coins coming out (which I do!) but you had to search to find them! We were told that \"Lots of Slots\" which is located in front of Circus Circus on the Strip had lots of the older machines and also had better payouts if you wanted the \"old\" slots experience. But regardless, any of the machines will take your money gladly and not return it! So, the odds have not improved with the technology and in fact, have probably gotten worse on the slots. So, just enjoy the \"noise\" for the entertainment value on the old slots. The new slots just don't have the same effect/pleasure as seeing lots of nickels/quarters falling since all you get is a number counter changing digits and you have to sit there until it does its thing. As to other activities, we highly recommend a helicopter tour of the Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam (we took Maverick Company tour which has an excellent safety record). The cost is high so do your comparison of what tour to take. The more flight time, the better the deal. We can also recommend the \"sunset\" tour since the Las Vegas lights at dusk are beautiful. And we drove to the Hoover Dam and took the full tour offered by the Park Service at the new Tourist/Guest Center. Do be careful with the advertised Hoover Dam tours. They charge you just for the bus ride and many of them do not include the tour fees that are levied by the Park Service. From the Park Service, we opted for the Dam/Electricity Plant tours which for 2 adults/1 child was approx. $90. Remember that this park tour cost IS NOT normally in the bus fares just to get to the Hoover Dam and make sure that aspect is covered before paying someone $50 just to take you to the Dam! That is why a car is so much more reasonable. There is a small parking fee at the Hoover Dam Tour center but certainly well-worth it. The drive is only 45-60 minutes from Las Vegas and the view heading back to Vegas is nice! For children, the only worthwhile arcade experience was at New York- New York and do choose your strip casino carefully since many of them are showing their age (Excalibur, Circus Circus, Luxor as examples). And for any of the night shows, you can easily get there by using the free parking options in the casinos so don't think you need to stay at a hotel just to be near their shows! It really is cheaper to have a car to travel where you want to go. The monorail was expensive with $5/each way and $11 unlimited day and the stops are not as convenient to the Strip as you may think. For 3 people, it is cheaper to rent the car! And it is so easy to get around Las Vegas (the maps are clear and you can't get lost since it is such a compact area and you can always orientate yourself by the Strip lights or views).

It is very similar in style to a lot of other shell properties, decent kitchen with granite counters, all full size appliances, and even a toaster and blender for those in room cocktails. Living room had nice sectional sofa with chaise, TV and dining room. Bedroom had a very comfortable matress and the bathroom had plenty of counter and cabinet space to be able to hold all the necessities. The grounds are small, but the have a nice pool area with hot tub and grills, nice comfy outdoor furniture. The pool was too cold to swim, but the hot tub was lovely. The great thing I think is to be able to park right near your room, no walking down endless hallways and the casino to get to your car. The building has locked gates so it feels pretty secure. There is no casino here but it is directly behind the Tropicana and across the street from MGM. Hooters is right next door, but that isn't our scene so we have never been there, I hear it is going to be under new ownership soon, so it will be nice because it is really close by.

I slept there for a total of five nights. Yes, the bed was comfy (after I dislodged the sheets from underneath the mattress, which until I did, made it impossible to have my feet upright while laying in bed to watch tv). I arrived very early in the morning, and was able to check into my room without a hitch. The front desk staff was very pleasant, and out of the three of them, two spoke fluent English. I liked that they did NOT speak the room number, there was a crowd around, and my luggage mostly contained computers and camera equipment. The only complaint I have checking in, and in no way is it the front desk worker's fault, was that they had my reservation arriving one day earlier then I did, and checking out one day earlier. I showed them my confirmation supplied by the trade show I was attending, (which showed the proper dates), and they had no problem correcting their system. Off to my room. I was on the third floor of Bldg 3. HERE IS A HINT if you arein Bldg 3. Take the first hall to your right after going through the door near the pool to get to the elevator. Why am I telling you this, because there are no signs directing you to the elevator. NONE of the buildings I was in visiting friends had signs showing you to the elevator. First place in my life, and I was all but born in a hotel room, have I not seen even an icon sign towards the elevator. One feature of the hotel is that some rooms are in a carpeted hallway, and some are in a deep grooved tile hall. You know all those susie cream cheese flight attendant bags that people use with the wheels, well, due to the way this place is laid out, you can hear them from ANYWHERE in your room, if your door is on the tiled section. Immediate impressions, If your room in bldg 3 ends in an 11 or 13 your view will be of the doors across the public area, or the back side of the elevator. YOUR VEGAS VIEW WILL BE A WALL OR HALL. All other rooms from what I could tell, have some decent type of view out the window. Open the door, and the heat was on full blast. The temp had been set to 90 degrees. What the heck is that about? Called the front desk to let them know what housekeeping is doing, and their reply was that it is cold right now, and they are trying to keep the rooms toasty. The furniture in my room looked used, because I am sure it had been, dings, burn marks, etc. The kitchen appliances were all clean, and new. Silverware was dishwasher clean. Plates, glasses, etc, all were sparkling clean. TV worked with good picture on both sets. Bathroom, cramped. The throne is next to the door, so if someone were to open the doors, your knees to thighs would be impacted. In my room the door NEVER stayed open, which was not fun when as a guy were standing to do our business. Shower: Showerheads like yester-year, very high pressure flow type. Hot water lasted forever, multiple baths within 30 minutes or each other and water never changed temps. Tyr that at a home, let one person take a hot bath, stew in it for about 10-15 minutes, empty the bath, and then start a new one, betcha the second person will have luke warm by the middle of the fill, and we are talking regular sized tubs. Towels: The were way too small, but then they had one multiple folded towel that once unfolded, was almost, but not quite a bath sheet. That came close to me not wishing to have brough my bath robe. Security issue: During our stay the hotel was working on new walls, and decor, but portions of the heavy security fencing had to be removed to work in the area. ANYONE could enter the grounds. All they had to do was walk through the fenceless area. Each night I saw kids, teens, etc, walking in (teens, or people that looked like teens) carry beer to the pool and hot tub. They would be gone with 15 minutes of me informing the front desk. Off to the monorail: The hotel will tell you it is a short 5 minute walk to the monorail. Plan on 10 to 15 minutes. I walk extremely fast, and I have no idea who could do the walk, as laid out by the front desk in 5 minutes. First you wak through the Hooter's Casino parking lot, then cross a major intersection. BTW, if you want to cross quicker, hit the traffic buttons on the pole. in LV they actually do work at stopping the traffic quicker. Then you have to walk through the lobby of the MGM Grand, then follow the signs tot he monorail. You will not be walking through the casino. If you are walking through the casino, you went too far down the sidewalk. Enjoy the day/night in Vegas. Back at the Desert Rose, they have afternoon drinks, wine or light beer. One day the beer tap froze solid, so they handed out 7oz bottles of Corona. Each day they either day chips and dip, bags of chips, etc. No problem getting refills on drinks, and the days that the tap was frozen, they handed you multiple beers to take back to your room. Enjoy more of Vegas. In the morning, pay attention to when the bagel trough is closed. Do not think you can show up five minutes before the closing time, and get fed. AT EXACTLY THE CLOSING TIME, the hired help starts demolishing the buffet line. The first thing to go is the bagels in individually wrapped plastic bags, and then the sliced lox. That is as fancy as it gets here, lox on the buffet. Then the coffee machine and toasters are turned off. In order for you to get the hint to leave, if you have been lucky enough to get some food (which they also provide cereal, bread, yogurt, fruit, etc) the janitors start sweeping everywhere, and as I was chewing my food, his put his dusting thing NEXT to my plate, literally next to my plate. \"STUFF\" got on to my cream cheese. I was a tad bit unhappy, but not as unhappy when I asked to get another bagel (the trashed on one had two bits out of it) I was promptly informed that breakfast was over, and I needed to get here earlier. When I told them what happened, they VERY SLOWLY brought me a bagel. When asked to get it toasted, they said the toaster was put away. I knew which door they put the toaster in, so I went and retrieved it. They told me not to, and I repeated to them why I was doing it. They asked me to please not remove the toaster, which was already out of the cabinet by now, and I asked them to go get the manager. He came out, and after I explained what happened, he let me use the toaster, and asked if I want anything else to eat. He brought me a huge serving of lox, and four cream cheeses packs. When checking out, I was handed the wrong bill, correct room number, wrong bill. They had me there for seven nights, and a large phone bill. After I showed them my airline schedule, I asked them to show me a video tape of me checking in on the date they said I checked in on. I then showed them my monorail receipt for the tickets I had bought. I then asked if the rate I had, was for a limited time frame, which it was. I checked in on the first day of that rate's time period. They finally realized they had made a mistake, and the correct bill was given to me. Here it is a few days later, and I have to ask, when we go back to Vegas for another trade show in a few months, this time with my wife and kids, will we stay here. I doubt it for one huge reason, the monorail. Would I stay here if traveling with just my wife and I, maybe. Now, the thing I have not mentioned to this point, is that I have stayed at the Desert Rose over the past few years, maybe a decade, when other companies were paying for it, and never had issues like I did this trip. For the price, (less then 120 a night) most likely can not be beat. The not being a casino is a non-issue for me and my family. Were there drunkards at this place, every night, in the pool area. Were they loud, you betcha. Were they there or still loud after the front desk was called, Not that I saw.

You can walk from Desert Rose down the strip, but if you want to enjoy walking through all the hotels along the way you get pretty tired! The bus was a slow way to travel, but got us more directly to our destination. The monorail is fast and easy, but only runs on the east side of the strip, so walking through the hotels and to the other side can be far (especially if you are dressed up for a show). The staff is excellent at the Desert Rose, and we were never even asked to go to a timeshare presentation the way we usually are at RCI resorts. There is construction across the street which can be loud, but there is construction EVERYWHERE in Vegas right now. Ask for a room inside the resort....our room faced the front of the resort, directly across from the construction site.

I had choosen the Desert Rose, because of the price and location. I was unwilling to pay 300 USD/night for a strip hotel and I had good experience (Summer Bay) with another 2nd row hotel two years ago. This time I wanted to try something new and the desert rose has some remarkable good reviews. The hotel is easy to find, close to the Hooters and the Tropicana at the south end of the strip in second row. The location is also close to the airport, even though I was suprised that this was not disturbing as I expected - actually quite. A lot of construction is going on in Vegas right now, so in this Resort as well. Everywhere were people maintaining and renovating parts of the hotel. I can not even say that the suite I have been in was just to be renovated or already finished. At least it looked ok - about clean, the maintenance of the room was only ok, and I had to ask to the engineer to get the lighs and the toilet working. After this the room was fine. Not very big though but nicely equipped and with a real full kitchen (even if I only used the fridge). Around the hotel what they call the resort is actually very small: a pool area. the water was very refreshing (it was cold) and the pool in excellent condition, probably newly plastered and well maintened. But that's about the whole facility. If you expect a big pool area, forget about it. One thing I liked was, that even it was quite full on the pool deck, it was very quite. Beside this lets talk about the staff. The checkin counter is typically the first impression what you get from a hotel - and this one was the bad experience, as well as check-in als also on checking-out: is it that difficult to smile and be friendly, instead: \"name?\" - \"here you are ...\" - \"no we don't\" ... terrible unfriendly without a reason, two people actually waiting for guests. The other point is that if a hotel ask for special preferences than they should know about it when I check-in and not answer with a \" what? no available\" (because we don't want to bother about this preferences, makes working so difficult ...?). On Check-out the same story, unfriendly, and not a word too much. It looked to me as simply unmotivated front-desk people. Lets talk about something else: this hotel offers a complimentary breakfast. Complementary menas it is included in my rate, but it was treated as for giving it away for free ... the difference is in my understanding I pay for it, so I would like to see happy people presenting what is there (and the quality and the richness is ok so fare, not great but enough). But what it is is that sombody pushes food outside and you see it more \"take it for free ...\" -like, if you understand what I mean. The presentation should reflect a hotel and the people should feal happy in what they are doing. And this is the missing point in this hotel. As mentined before there is nothing to complain about the breakfast, its simple - no cooked food except cold boiled eggs - but functional. My last issue I would like to mention is the \"wireless internet\" what attracted my attention when I booked this hotel. On my reservation it said \" ... room, breakfast, wireless internet\" - so I though I will have complementary internet service. Wrong: it only tells you that it is available for 10 USD/day no discounts if you need it for a week. Advertising this in this way is not ok in my understanding - so be aware, even when they promise something does not mean you get it without extra charge. Always the question to me whom I can recommend this hotel to? If you are looking for a functional small suite as a single or max. a couple without needing the facy stuff around then it is ok for you. In less than 10 minutes you arrive at the strip, even though at the south end - means better have a car. Don't expect a real resort with many animities - its not there and there is absolutly nothing for kids. Would I go there again? Its not bad, its ok, so I might go there again, but there are more hotels of this kind around in Vegas, so I probably will try something else on my next trip - may be with friendly staff.", "Date": "September 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, B.C., Canada", "Title": "\u201cDesert Rose is a great place to stay\u201d", "Author": "BrianM55", "ReviewID": "UR10003012", "Content": "My wife and I spent 7 nights at the Desert Rose, Sept. 9 - 16.

Our interactions with the staff were limited, but any time we had any questions of the front counter staff, they were more than willing to assist. The Desert Rose is situated an easy 10 minute walk from the Strip. It is a great place to stay as you can experience the Strip, but escape back to the Desert Rose to get away from it all.

The pool area was lovely and really needed in the hot weather, not too overcrowded with children either.

We had a phone call from the manager 2 hours after arriving to see if everything was alright, but were not bothered again. The room turned out to be spacious, spotlessly clean, with a big TV that had the usual channels, plus pay per view films, the bedroom was a good size, with a big bed, the bathroom was an adequate size, and the kitchen was very well equipped with everything you need, tip, if you have transport and want to purchase food etc, take a right out of the resort on to E Reno Ave, drive the short distance to the Strip, make a left there, and drive south until you come to the Cancun hotel on the right, there is a large Food4Less on the opposite side of the road, with all your needs. The car park, stretches all the way round the resort, with close access to any room, making unloading easy and quick, the electronic room keys are needed to entrance the resort area. As has been said in other reviews, Hooters is the nearest casino, and only a couple of minutes walk, they do great all you can eat ribs for $16. The Tropicano is a little further, as is the MGM, where you can catch the monorail. To catch a bus along the Strip, take a right out of the resort, and right onto Reno, and it's just a short walk to the bus stop at the end of the road. We didn't eat at the complimentary continental breakfast, but the ones who did said it was good, we preferred to have a cooked one in our room. The pool area was not too busy, a good place to cool off. The elevator was quick when called, as there are only 3 floors, so you only spend seconds in there, the housekeeping staff we met on there, were always cheerful and friendly. I have to add, this wasn't our first choice place to stay in Vegas, we had booked a room in a moderate hotel/casino on the strip, but had the Desert Rose resort recommended to us by friends, and booked direct with them via their website, that saved us $70 compared to the price at the other hotel, this is where we will be staying on all our visits to Las Vegas.", "Date": "July 15, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Desert Rose Resort", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d217598-Reviews-Desert_Rose_Resort-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html", "Price": "$86 - $238*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">5051 Duke Ellington Way</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Las Vegas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NV</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">89119</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515578", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/d0/1b/d01b467500fdec92f3e2694e0c5b1c855large.jpg"}}
