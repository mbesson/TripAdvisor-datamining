Based on this hotel, however, I would have to say that Ritz-Carlton has dropped, not one but several notches down that scale. I give it three stars because \"poor\" is an unfair rating. The hotel is new- just two years old, I was told - and very clean. They're marketing it as a \"boutique\" hotel, which to me is another way of saying they charge luxury rates for a cosmetically souped-up Hilton Garden Inn. I had reserved a Deluxe King room with my Platinum Amex, which guarantees an upgrade if available. No upgrade was offered at check-in so I asked and was immediately offered an Executive King room, but it seemed like an oversight that they didn't offer it automatically. The room required an elevator transfer, which underscored the somewhat wonky layout of this hotel. When I walked in the door to my room, I was truly (and not happily) surprised. The first thing I saw was a hideously cheap-looking light fixture:a prison-cell bulb suspended in a metal cylinder so rickity that it rattles continuously back and forth from the draft created by room's circulating air fan. The \"drapes\" are cafe rod curtains so flimsy that no matter how hard you try they cannot be drawn completely closed. They've basically used a minimalist Asian-inspired design motif as an excuse to cut every imaginable corner. I usually call Housekeeping to request turndown before I leave my hotel room for dinner, just to be sure the job gets done. There was no Housekeeping phone extension provided,so I just hoped for the best. Bad plan; no turndown service occurred. Is it possible that it's not even offered here? Trying to be fair, so a few redeeming features: the bathroom was ample and nicely designed. Soaking tub and walk-in shower share a nicely-designed enclosed space. Very nice and well-designed make-up mirror, and yes, to some of us, that matters. Complimentary Internet, which tells me they are trying to be relevant. And each staff member I encountered was truly genial and eager to please. They try, and almost succeed, to make up in service what this facility lacks in other areas. I was awakened at 6 am by a blaring alarm clock apparently set by some previous guest which was kind of a final straw/camel'sbackbreaker. This property shares a building with the Marriott and something tells me that I would find a better value there if I were to return.

With the exception of the club floor conciereges the hotel is not up to Ritz Carlton standards. The staff is not polished, cohesive or detail oriented and I would rate this hotel on par with a Marriott at best (probably not even a JW). Cold and uninterested in the guest is probably the best way to sum up two visits. Again, the Club Lounge was the exception. Rooms are \"ok\". Beds extremely comfortable and terriric. A lot of design glitches, particularly in bathroom. For example, although the \"wet room\" is a great concept, the shower cannot be turned on without being covered from cold water from the rain shower head above while waiting for hot water (which is just luke warm at best). Also, the bathroom sinks will splash your clothing even when turned on low. We had 2 rooms under 2 separate names booked. When our friends arrived at the hotel they walked into our room with the bellman and were actually assigned to our room even though we had already checked in and advised we were waiting for our friends! They were told my wife and I had not checked in when we had 1/2 hour prior with the same desk clerk and advised we were waiting for people. Not the end of the world, but just one example of lack of attention to simple details where this pseudo Ritz Carlton misses the mark. I would stay at this hotel again due to convenience to downtown venues and it is the best hotel in the area. However, I would advise management to polish the game quite a bit to be worthy of being part of the Ritz Carlton family and meeting the expectation and mark that Ritz Carlton guests have come to expcect. The hotel is gorgeous.

There are two chairs, a concierge desk and the two person check-in desk. There was no champagne or pampered atmosphere as stated in other reviews. I was greeted by a front desk person who explained that my room was not ready, which I understood, as I was there at 10:00 am, however he was not at all accommodating. He asked for my method of payment, even though he was not checking me in (strange), and seemed inconvenienced when I asked to have my bags checked. I asked at that time if it was possible to get a pass to the concierge lounge, he corrected me by saying \"We don't have a concierge lounge at the Ritz - we do however have a Club Room which you can be upgraded to when you check in\". I found this to be very condescending and arrogant. It may be that I was dressed in workout gear as I was in town for a Fitness Convention, and that may have not fit in with the \"LA Ritz\" requirements. I often stay at 5-star hotels, and have never been treated so poorly. At that time, I asked that they call me when a room was available and left my phone number. He stated that they would put a rush on the room for me, which made me feel a little better. After checking my bags, I realized that I left my convention badge in my backpack, so I want back 5 minutes later and asked if they could grab my backpack so that I could get my badge out. The front desk person informed me that I would have to wait for the bellman to come up to the front to get it. When he checked my bag, the bellman did not check it, the front desk person did, and I assisted him with bringing it to the room directly behind the desk. There was no one in the lobby, so I asked if he could just grab my one small backpack, and he begrudgingly completed the task, which took less than 30-seconds. I thanked him and remedied him to let me know as soon as a room was available. I waited for a call to confirm my room was ready for 5 hours, and never received a call. So much for rushing the room for me. Either way, when I checked in, I was greeted by a more pleasant front desk person, who apologized for not calling me when my room was ready and proceeded to check me in. Again, he asked for my method of payment, and I informed him that I had already provided it. He apologized and said that it was not put into the system and that he had to take it again, making me wonder why the first person needed it. Check in went well (still no champagne), and I went to my room. The room was very well appointed, modern and clean. It was a fantastic room overlooking the swimming pool. This is what I was expecting from the Ritz! I have no complaints about the room at all. The walk-in shower, the amazingly comfortable bed, etc. all were up to 5-start standards! My group of 7 had dinner that night at Wolfgang Puck's 24, in the Hotel, which was amazing. The food was delicious, the service was impeccable and the view was beautiful. We secured a very private table, and enjoyed an amazing dinning experience. Upon getting ready to check-out, I called down to ask if transport was available to the hotel, and informed them that I needed a car for 6. They said no problem, just come down to the concierge and she will take care of it. When I came down, the concierge told me that it would be 45 minutes to get a limo. I told her that I would just call the Limo that I took in from the Airport as it was only $110 and they said they could pick me up with less than 30-minutes notice. She then told me that they had an Escalade available immediately and that it could easily take 6. I wound up waiting for 20 minutes for the Escalade, which did work fine for our group. When the driver dropped me off at the airport, I gave him my card to charge the ride on, and he stated that it was billed to my room. I asked if he knew what the rate was and he stated that he did not. To my surprise, I found that they charged my room $190 for the ride. $80 more than the limo I was going to get. I have no problem paying the expected amount for service, but I felt that this was very deceptive and the price should have been stated in advance, especially when I told her the rate we paid coming in. I feel that this Ritz is pretentious, and the service is not up to the standards set by the Ritz or other 5-star hotels.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel worth a visit\u201d", "Author": "dhaigh", "ReviewID": "UR125370887", "Content": "Great hotel, good location next to staples centre, Good rooms, Cant fault it.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cVery cool place with some limitations\u201d", "Author": "fidelrobert", "ReviewID": "UR124557086", "Content": "One wonders: this hotel property is so connected with the GW Marriott, and with the GW Marriott being the Marriott name's top-of-the-line, why not just stay at the GW Marriott and pocket the difference?

At 10 am I called again and was told that they attempted delivery but our \"quiet\" sign was out so they couldn't deliver, but tried to call. I told the woman, that clearly I wanted to be bothered if I ordered in-room dining and I think it should be specified upon ordering to be sure to remove your do not disturb sign if this will affect delivery. They then delivered our food around 10:15. We had ordered one pot of decaf and one pot of regular coffee. The pots were exactly alike and there was no indication of which was which. I had to call AGAIN to find out how to tell the difference. In my mind this was way to much effort to have an enjoyable relaxing breakfast and we should have just gotten dressed and gone to the club room. The rooms were lovely and the bathrooms were divine. I would probably not choose to stay here again, however, as service has been better at other hotels (especially for what you are paying).", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel - Excellent Service\u201d", "Author": "Clinton S", "ReviewID": "UR114849694", "Content": "I was a little concerned about a 300 room Ritz-Carlton adjacent to the Staples Center and the JW Marriott, a 1000 room hotel.

Kinks are to be expected from any business - I think since that time, their front line staff must have gotten a hang of their roles. I found the service was great and what you would normally expect from a 5 star hotel. One thing that previous guests have discussed before that cannot changed is the layout of the property. It is connected to the JW Marriot which is sprawling in comparison. Their lobby is grand and filled with attendants. In fact, my taxi dropped my off at JW's lobby, I guess they think the two properties are synonymous with each other? If you do get dropped off at the JW, you will need to walk through a tiny little hallway on the left hand side to get to the Ritz. The lobby there is very small in comparison but cozy. You can already see from all the other travellers photos the decor - Very new, modern and top notch - is true to life, so I won't comment on it. I will have to say that the washrooms are EXCELLENT. The washroom is split in 2 so It has a separate toilet and bath area - perfect for couples who need room to each do their own thing :) The shower area features a rain shower and SUPER CLEAN tub. There are rarely any hotels that have tubs clean enough for a bath for my standards but this has got to be one of them so that says a lot about the cleanliness of this property. It's right next to the Nokia and Staples Centre. Immediately downstairs you will find many mid-price eateries to grab a bite. Most are your typical bar-food. They also offer an In-House DRIVER and towncar which will take you out within the local area - but no returns back to the hotel. They don't take reservations but you can simply call the front desk and ask if the car is available and they will let you know when is a good time to go down to the lobby to wait for the drivers return. For quick cheap eats nearby I would give it a 4/5 For washroom cleanliness I would give it a 5/5", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange County, California", "Title": "\u201cAnother Wonderful Ritz Carlton Property\u201d", "Author": "SarahInSoCal", "ReviewID": "UR113546506", "Content": "I had the pleasure of staying at the Ritz for a business meeting. If you are going to be staying in downtown Los Angeles, I highly recommend the hotel. I only gave the location 4 stars because I am not a huge fan of the downtown area but if you are going to be downtown, this is the place! The hotel is right in the middle of the LA Live complex. It shares the building with JW Marriott (the JWM has the first 20 or so floors, the Ritz is something like 22-25 and the top floors are residences). As others have commented, the Ritz seems to be very much a business hotel. The lobby is small though more than adequate but there was no bar or lounge that I saw (other than the Club Lounge described below). The room was very nicely laid out. We had a king bed which was very comfortable. Given that the room was not huge, I was impressed with the amount of furniture it had without it feeling at all cramped. If you had to stay for more than a few days there is plenty of storage. There was always complimentary water left by housekeeping and even a Nespresso machine. The bath was small but had double sinks and a separate shower and tub. The TV built into the mirror was very unique. The hotel is very new and was very slick (without being cold). The pool area was very nice though it was too overcast while we were there to take advantage. The gym was also extremely nice. We had the good fortune of having access to the Club Lounge which I cannot recommend enough. It is a wonderful place to relax and unwind. The meal services make your day very easy and complimentary drinks are included. If you stay at the hotel, definitely do the Club. Above and beyond, the Club Lounge employees are super attentive. Most address you by name and are always eager to help. Notwithstanding the Club, we did pry ourselves away and had appetizers and drinks at WP24 which was very nice. The only complaint was that there was some confusion upon arrival. We were to have Club access but upon arrival I asked her to confirm. The response I got was \"No.\" Period. Not, \"I'm sorry, but we don't show that. Do you have more information?\" Just \"No\". It became my responsibility to track down our event coordinator so she could address the issue. Granted, we were with a large group and I'm sure it was confusing. We felt that the person who checked us in could benefit from some coaching on handling an issue with some degree of warmth and customer service. The Assistant Manager did follow up to apologize and make sure everything was ok which we appreciated.

It's on the 24th floor, thus the name, with spectacular views of downtown LA skyscrapers. The food was imaginative and consisted of tasty chinese and other asian dishes. Both the decor and menu made dinner at WP24 a memorable nice experience. LA Live itself is a new downtown location surrounded by many different entertainment venues. There are restaurants, an ice skating rink for the holiday season, The Nokia Theatre and The Grammy Museum which had very interesting exhibits featuring John Lennon, Janis Joplin and The Doors among many others.

NOT! I will say, the exterior building is phenomenal! What a work of modern art! Okay, I know that the number of upscale 5 star hotels in downtown Los Angeles is minimal and perhaps totally non-existant. So, the addition of the Ritz in Downtown LA is very welcome, indeed. First of all, downtown LA is seedy and creepy and usually dead at night and weekends - except for this new LA Live Complex. I personally, would never stay Downtown. For business travelers this hotel will work great. For familys though, they will be disappointed. While the connecting brand new JW Marriott has an impressive mammoth modern lobby, the Ritz has a teeny tiny shoebox for a lobby. When I entered the lobby, I was stunned, disappointed, under-whelmed, crippled, angry and bewildered. Who designed this place? This Ritz has NO lobby. What a joke! It reminded me of a small little NYC 3 star hotel sized lobby. While it was new and sleek, it was very bland and devoid of ANY character or warmth. I mean it. What were the owners thinking??? If you were to see the Ritz Lobby compared to the JW's, you would fall over. Big mistake Ritz Carlton! The exterior does not represent the insides of this hotel. The pool areas were stark and okay. The 4th Floor outdoor bar was nice and windy. Noisy from the LA Live mall below. Not soo L.A. chic as it wants to be or should be for a Ritz. The views are not that great as you end up looking at a lot of dumpy buildings. The rooms are comfortable and a little on the basic boring side.

We had to cancel our first reservation back then, but for the July 4 weekend, rates were the lowest we've seen. The Ritz and the adjacent, connected JW Marriott (the hierarchy of hotels in the Marriott group is Ritz Carlton, then JW Marriott, then Marriott) are 2 hotels in the LA Live \"campus\"--a dining and entertainment complex adjacent to the LA Convention Center, Staples Center (home of the LA Lakers and other sports teams, plus a concert venue), and the Nokia Theatre, a smaller venue for live performances. It is not unlike Citywalk at Universal Studios. The LA Live website states the larger Marriott (873 rooms) is geared towards conventioneers and tourists, with the much smaller Ritz (123 rooms) for visiting sports teams, entertainers and their entourages, and executives. The outside hotel signage is a bit misleading. The shorter building is topped with the Marriott sign, while the taller tower says Ritz Carlton and has a rooftop heliport. In fact, both hotels are contained within the first 26 floors of both buildings, with the upper floors of the 54 floor tower housing Ritz Carlton Residences priced at near $900,000 and up. The Marriott occupies floors 4-21, with the Ritz on floors 22-26. The hotels are connected on the first 3 floors. The Marriott's pool deck is on level 4, the Ritz's on floor 26. The Marriott's lobby is of course much larger, with a restaurant, lounges and coffee bar. The Marriott also has many meeting rooms and a huge 3 level ballroom/convention complex. The Ritz's lobby is tiny, with a single sofa and chair and a 2 person counter for front desk and concierge staff. When the Ritz first opened a few months after the Marriott, room rates were well over $100 more costly. Even valet parking was more expensive ($50 vs. $38). For whatever reasons, the Ritz has somewhat reduced its rates, and valet parking now costs the same. Realize rates and availability at both hotels varies considerably based on what's going at the Convention Center and Staples (no rooms were available during the recent NBA finals), but for the July 4 weekend, Ritz's rates were a mere $20 more than Marriott's. This was in spite of a huge Japanese Anime convention being held at the Convention Center as well as the Marriott--tons of costumed young folks everywhere. We fluctuated between booking the I Love LA Live package (includes 10% off all dining and beverage outlets, free valet parking, and 2 free tickets to 2 LA Live venues of your choice--package also available at the Marriott), and getting access to the Club Lounge with its 5 daily food presentations. We opted for the I Love LA package after we were able to secure a pretty coveted dinner reservation for WP24, Wolfgang Puck's newest Asian restaurant and lounge on the 24th floor (I think anytime you can get a discount at a Wolfgang Puck place, it's a good thing). Note that unlike other Ritzes where the Club Level Lounge and rooms are on their own floor, this Ritz has no dedicated club level rooms, since there are only 4 floors of rooms--rather, you pay extra ($70) to get access to the Club Lounge on floor 23. I think everyone is asked at check-in if they want to upgrade, so technically 100% of the guests could have Lounge access. We called ahead to see if early check-in was available, and it was. The valet, bellmen, doormen and front desk staff were all courteous and attentive at all times. We did encounter some inconsistent service primarily when it came to knowing what our package included. When I asked a telephone reservation agent about the package before we booked, she had to put be on hold for so long I had to hang up. One concierge was also unfamiliar with all aspects of the package, and the 10% dining discount was not adjusted off at check-out until we asked. Also, the free valet parking is for one day only--a detail not mentioned previously. The Ritz has a definite water theme and slight Asian theme. We were given a room facing south, with views of the Marriott pool and the LA Live Nokia Plaza and Staples Center. East-facing rooms have similar views, while north-facing rooms overlook the Harbor Freeway and tall downtown LA office buildings. West-facing rooms see Century City office towers in the distance, as well as the Hollywood sign. A room key is needed in the elevators to access room floors and also to access rooms on the 24th floor where WP 24 is. Note that the 25th floor rooms and 26th floor pool deck and fitness center require using a second, separate elevator. The hotels share a business center on the 3rd floor that has daytime hours only and is closed on Sunday. Outside the business center are 3 computers that require a credit card, but Ritz guests can log in a secret access code for complimentary use. The Spa is on the 2nd floor and available to both hotels. The room, a standard Deluxe King, was nicely done, but seemed smaller than its reported 450 square feet (vs. 375 feet at Marriott). The wood paneled carpeted entry way has a sliding wooden door to the bath. Next there is a white lacquered wood floored dressing area with closet, mirror and shelf. You then enter the bedroom, which has a sofa by the window, glass table/desk, flat screen HD TV, DVD player, minibar, espresso maker. The bath had 2 sinks, an enclosed WC, and one of those combination shower-tub rooms that seem to be popular in newly constructed hotels--you walk through the shower to reach the tub. This was our first experience with this design; my first thought was that housekeeping has to clean the tub even if its not used, since using the shower wets the tub. I liked the set-up, since it makes for a roomier shower space than the often cramped shower in traditionally separated showers and tubs. The shower has a rain head and hand-holdable head. WP24 was fabulous. You first pass though the uniquely designed lounge to the smaller, more traditionally designed dining room. Both have great views. The food is Asian, tastes are often familiar, but amped up to the highest level in terms of ingredients, flavour, execution, presentation and service. Some thing are quite spicy. Cocktails delicious. Lee Hefter, original chef at Spago Beverly Hills and now a Managing Partner with the Puck group, was present. I 'm sure he had much input in the restaurant's menu planning, as he has traveled extensively in Asia. WP24 is the Ritz's only restaurant and lounge. The hotel guide in our room says it is open for breakfast and lunch, but this is not the case, nor does it seem feasible. Thus, the Club Lounge is really the only space for the business traveler who must conduct meetings on site. The Marriott has Kerry Simon's LA Market Restaurant that reportedly has a good breakfast buffet, but we did not try it. LA LIVE has scores of dining options as well. We chose to breakfast at a place from our past--The Original Pantry Cafe one block north--a traditional diner open 24 hours since 1924. Besides the LA Live campus, there's not much to do in the immediate vicinity--the attractions of downtown LA are a bit further north, as are numerous hotels, including a traditional Marriott and the historic Biltmore. But this is a good central location from which to travel in any direction.

As others have said, as a business hotel, they are totally unprepared. As a luxury hotel they also fall short compared to either Four Seasons in town. I fully understand fully that this is a very newer property and is no doubt undergoing some opening glitches. However, I could argue that a property like this should be launched only when the staff is 100% up to speed and if that delays an opening by several weeks, so be it. Additionally, I assume that this property was opened with a staff specifically hired and trained for this property. With that in mind I would say our stay was a lot rougher around the edges than I would consider acceptable for a RC. I booked through Platinum American Express (AE) travel services and was told at the time of booking the AE amenities offered by this property. Upon arrival we were taken to the club lounge for check in where the desk person was initially unable to locate our reservation. Once they did there was no mention of any AE-related amenities and when I asked about them, none of the club staff had a clear idea what they were. I recounted what I recalled from my conversation with the AE agent who made my reservation and go a tentative \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that sounds right.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd They made no offer to confirm the specifics and get back to us. To be sure, we later asked at the main desk and were given equally vague answers and in the case of the spa credit, incorrect information that we only discovered upon check out. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I should have to call AE to confirm what my reservation includes. The rest of our stay, from the doormen who never seemed to be near the door, to the indecisive main desk staff who more often then not didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even look up when you passed, or the club level staff who never seemed willing to go \u00e2\u20ac\u0153any\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd let alone that extra mile, lacked the sharp edge I would expect, a result of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not quite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd staff training I suspect. The rooms themselves (we had a corner room on 24) have some issues. As mentioned, there is no desk lamp, rather a ceiling light mounted in the center of the room behind the desk chair 5\u00e2\u20ac\u2122-6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd off the floor that you constantly have to dodge or hit your head on (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m 6\u00e2\u20ac\u2122-1\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) and few and completely ill-placed outlets. Also, maybe it was because it was a new property but the material selection for the wardrobe closet may have been a poor one. The resinous material smelled extremely noxious and chemical-like. This odor would impregnate anything that we hung in it thereby rendering the closet useless, a problem for a 4-night stay. It may dissipate from the piece over time but for now I would call it a problem. Also, I know I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in the minority in this but I am so not loving the new trend in hotel room design of the shower/tub combo room. This RC is not alone in this odd style this one is better than most but it is really neither practical nor functionally IMO. Sorry but to me it is just trendy and awkward. Overall, the hotel presents itself as a Marriott in a tuxedo. The design and style is a notch above a newer Marriott but in this particular property, the extra service that I would expect the staff to deliver that separates a RC from a Marriott is weak or completely missing.", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sioux Falls, South Dakota", "Title": "\u201cDarn Good!\u201d", "Author": "Taceycakes", "ReviewID": "UR68787129", "Content": "The hotel overall was very nice.

It is located directly next door to LA Live, making it very convenient to the Staples Center as well as all of the other shops and amenities in the vicinity. Check-in was very quick and I was given exactly the room I requested. The rooms themselves are modern, large, and generally well appointed. The bathroom is huge, with a unique shower/tub arrangement -- they are separate but right next to each other. The rooms overlook LA LIve and, because they are all on high floors, the views are quite good. The bed was very comfortable. Rooms have a mini-bar, although I was never able to locate a price list. Now, for the negatives. I was traveling on business, so the first thing I wanted to do was plug in my computer at the desk. However, there was no electrical outlet to be found anywhere near the desk. The closest one was more 10' away next to the coffee maker. (There as also no desk lamp and no phone at the desk.) The only other plugs I found in the room were: one right inside the main door and four in the bathroom. When I called the front desk to ask if I simply wasn't seeing the outlet (if it was perhaps located behind a panel, etc.), I was told that no one had ever made this complaint before. I later learned that there were no other accessible outlets in the room. I had some internet connectivity issues. They did offer to send someone to my room but it was late and, ultimately, I told them not to bother given the lateness of the hour. I did look for the ethernet cable (which the guest directory said was available) on the theory that a wired connection might be more \"stable.\" Not only did I never find the cable but, if I had, there was no place in the room in which to plug it. The elevator situation was also a bit annoying. Although the hotel is very tall, most of the floors are filled with condos/apartments. The hotel itself is limited to floors in the lower 20s. However, in order to access your room, you must change elevators on the 22nd (or maybe 21st) floor. I was told by the bellman that the reason for this was so that someone could rent out an entire floor. OK, but there must be a better way to accomplish this than by inconveniencing every other hotel guest -- for example, simply lock out the floor to anyone who doesn't have the proper key. Thus, unsure if the reason I was given was wrong but it was inconvenient to have to use two elevators every time I wanted to enter or exit the hotel. As others have said, the lobby is extremely small and is not a place to congregate. The lounge/bar is on the 24th floor. The lounge (black walls, low lights) is dark with very loud music. It obviously appeals to some but I would not say it is a place to relax. The only restaurant is a Wolfgang Puck Asian-style that I didn't try. However, the hotel is steps from many great restaurants so this isn't an issue. I did ask to take a glass of wine to my room; I was told they would have to give me a plastic cup! This is the very first hotel in which this has ever happened. I must add that I did voice my complaints to hotel management, which was very prompt and dutiful in following up with me, providing a measure of \"compensation,\" and doing their best to address retroactively problems which really couldn't be resolved during my visit. Overall, I would recommend the Ritz if you have a downtown even and want a luxurious place to stay or for a romantic getaway WE. If you need to stay at LA Live for business, don't stay here until they upgrade the rooms to be ready for business travelers. The Marriott next door is not as luxurious, is more of a \"commodity,\" and caters to conventions, but definitely is more geared to the business traveler.", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cSadly disappointed\u201d", "Author": "SFTravellers415", "ReviewID": "UR66486128", "Content": "I really love the Ritz Carlton and was very excited about staying at the Ritz LA. It was surprisingly disappointing. The rooms were nice (but not that much nicer than your average new hotel). But, the reason that I love going to the Ritz isn't their rooms; it's the phenomenal service that you typically get. Unfortunately, we ended up getting bad service. At our favorite Ritz Carltons, the staff (particularly at the Club Level) are incredibly warm and friendly and go out of their way to make you feel special. Even at the average Ritz, the staff are always very professional and take their jobs seriously. But, here, most of the staff weren't friendly or accessible and actually made me feel unwelcome at times. It got so bad that I didn't want to go to the Club level after awhile (and I usually love the Club level). Not sure what's happening with their staffing. A bunch of times, I tried calling the main number and no one would even pick up the phone - not even a voicemail message. Again, very weird. On my last night, the Club manager stopped by the table where I was sitting and asked how things were going. I mentioned that I was disappointed compared with stays at other Ritz Carltons. She seemed really nice and took down my information, promising to email me right away (I gave her my contact information, at her request, because she seemed genuinely interested and concerned). Then, she never emailed - again, really strange. Seems like the hotel may be going through some serious growing pains. Such a shame. I really do love the Ritz .

The building is a very fascinating new addition to the Downtown LA skyline. Overall, we were not disappointed. The Ritz is chic and substantial. It made for a memorable stay and a welcome break. The views are awesome. Location is an urban oasis (albeit almost too new and sterile), very unique for Los Angeles. The pool area is delightful. Definitely a great choice to celebrate a special occasion (in our case, it's our wedding anniversary). Now to the quirks/observations. We realize after we checked-in that the place is still under \"soft\" opening. The real opening is May 17, 2010. Didn't make much difference to us, since we get all the great services & amenities with very few others around. The valet parking fee at the Ritz with in/out privileges is $50 per day. Yikes. It is posted on a sign at the entry and I saw groups of people reading the sign and gawking. Every time we came back the valet will greet us by name as they open the car door. We were persuaded to upgrade to \"Club Lounge\" privileges for $70 per day. It turned out to be the best decision of our stay as the Lounge is not crowded, and had non-stop delicious snacks (rotating daily between morning breakfast, noon light lunch, afternoon hors d'oeuvres, and evening desserts with all the drinks, cheeses, candies, etc. you can eat/drink). The ambience is very relaxed and casual. The staff are attentive and professional. They couldn't wait to customize drinks for us (I loved my decaf soy capuccino... never had it before!). The lox during breakfast is very good quality. Being locals, we were not eager to leave the hotel to see any sights, and between our room, the Lounge, and the pool/fitness center, we were well entertained and nourished. The fitness center is not extremely large, but is nicely equipped and clean. The lobby seems about 1/100 the size of the adjacent JW Marriott lobby (I guess the PC way to call it is \"intimate\"). The room is tastefully chic, as urban \"loft\" hotels should be. Lots of carefully placed items designed to delight the senses. Colors and materials are pleasing. Our room is spaciously laid out at 450 sq ft. Since the room is thermally sealed (obviously the windows are not operable), even with the thermostat set at 70 degrees F, we ended up slow-roasting under the fancy comforter at night. During the semi-consciousness of sleep, we didn't think to look into the closet and bring out the THIN blanket until after 6 am. I think the mattress was a bit flat (not flexible), but the husband didn't seem to mind. The Ritz Carlton hotel is on the 22nd floor to the 26th. Meaning if you look at the building from the outside, the hotel is still part of the \"shorter section\". The floor plan of the entire hotel is a \"T\", same as the JW Marriott below. The north/south tall part of the building that sticks out into the sky is NOT the Ritz hotel, it is all part of the Ritz Carlton Residences/condos. In case you didn't know the Ritz is owned by the Marriott chain. Meaning the Book of Mormons is laying side by side with the Holy Bible in the night stand drawer, and that there is absolutely no adult programming available in the entertainment system. I find that rather quaint and charming. Gives the place some subtle character. The shower has low water pressure, but for once it didn't matter because it is a convincing rain shower that can be diverted to a movable shower head. The only thing that I thought could be improved is that the wood sliding door to the bathroom sticks out too much when it is opened. I keep feeling like I will bump into the giant metal door handles, especially since the room is full of mirrors and glass. All in all the Ritz at LA Live is a welcomed new addition to downtown Los Angeles.
