When we finally arrived in our room, it had a very musty smell. We got ready and went out for the night. When we got back to the room, it smelled like weed. It was horrible, and one of the guests in our party is allergic, so she spent most of the night on the balcony while we tried to air out the room. Called the front desk about the issue and we were told to call back and speak with a manager at another time. One of us twisted our ankle while out that night. When we went to the ice machine, it did not work. Again back to the front desk for a NASTY response of its broken, go to 7-11. The next day we had the do not disturb sign on the door and the maid walked right in and woke us up. This was not appreciated. We went out for the day and again came back to a room smelling of weed. We Were told that the general manager would be in the next morning and to call and ask for him anytime after 8. We went out that night and came back to no parking, which I found odd since I was specifically told that there is one spot for every guest. After walking around the lot for a few minutes I found multiple cars without parking passes, that I was told must be in the car or we will be towed! I went into the office and spoke with Yudi. I explained the situation and asked him to come check the cars and make sure they should be there, because I know they have all of the car info on hand. If they are cars that are not supposed to be there, to please have them towed since I am paying to be here, I would like to be able to park. His response was, \"Can you find somewhere else to park because sometimes our guests have guests and they need a place to park as well.\" Which to me meant I am too lazy to leave this office, please stop bothering me. I called the next morning and tried to remain as calm as possible while talking to the manager, Brooke. I explained to him all of our awful experiences since we had arrived and all he could say was I don't know what to tell you, and that weed is the least of his problems, at least it wasn't heroin or cocaine. After that the other guest went down to the office to talk to him face to face. He lied to her and said I never said that but she was being irrational. He then went on for 10 minutes about how long he has been doing this and how many different states he has worked in. I waited for the relevance in all of this, I am still waiting for it. He told us we can leave, and get a refund for the last night, or he can move us to an ocean front room. I found this odd because I was told they were fully booked for the weekend, another lie. We went to the new room and while it did not smell like weed, the air conditioner barely worked, the towel rack fell off of the wall, and the door had to screws sticking out of the back of it. Three of us cut ourselves on them. I then covered them with bandaids. The three of us will be going to get tetanus shots. If there is anything our insurance doesn't cover, even a co-pay, they can expect a bill. An absolutely vacation ruining experience. I am very upset to have wasted that money.

Over the many years that I've lived in Maryland and visited OC, I've stayed in numerous low end hotels/motels as the higher end (Hilton and others) were too pricey for their location and just a weekend stay. However, the Seabonay takes the cake in low end. First of all, we asked for early check in. They said that we could check in and they would call us when the room was ready. Normal check in is at 3. We arrived at 10, they called us at 2:30. So much for early check in. The place is outdated, the rooms smell musty, the bathroom was dark mustard yellow with mold in the shower. There was sand in my \"just cleaned\" bed and the mattress was half off the box springs when we arrived. They are also the most uncomfortable beds I've ever slept in. The balcony is not private so you can't keep your door open to listen to the ocean without sacrificing your privacy. In addition, they do not have WiFi. Now, there are a few perks to staying at the Seabonay. You are right on the beach and you are within walking distance (one block) of the end of the boardwalk where you can catch the train to the other end of the boardwalk. They also show movies on the beach (during the summer) across from the train station. However, for the price, I expected something a little better than what I got. The room we were in really should have been priced at $50 per night even during peak season. It has obviously not been upgraded since the place was first built.

The rooms were not the cleanest. The bathrooms could really use a scrubbing. The rooms smelled of mold and there was a lot of water damage to the exterior walls of the rooms. The best part of this motel was the veiw of the ocean. Needless to say this will not be our choice in the furture if we decide to visit Ocean City again.", "Date": "July 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cfun vacation\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4319964", "Content": "My boyfriend and i came to seabonay in Aug. 05 When we first got to the motel.. i thought it was what the website showed exactly. The only things i thought we not the best were, the maid service did not do a full cleaning in the rooms everyday. Our mirror had finget prints on it up until the day we left. Also you are supposed to get continental breakfast.. but alls i saw in the lobby was coffee and an apple. Thats it. I would like to see the motel update their breakfast a little more. But other than that.. i loved the motel. When i stayed there it was $69 dollars a night. What do you expect for that cheap. The pool was awesome. Well mantained and kept clean. I wish the hours were longer tho. But the motel is just walking distances to about everything. I really enjoyed staying at Seabonay and i would recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "January 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winchester, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cCharming & Beachy!\u201d", "Author": "JenniLaRue", "ReviewID": "UR3799746", "Content": "The price was right, and I was very happy with the service and staff. Pool was nice. The place is small enough that you get acquainted with your \"fellow beachgoers\" over the 3-night-minumum in peak season. It's RIGHT across from Jolly Roger Waterpark; the location was awesome for us! Beach in the AM, Jolly Roger for 4-7 cheap special! This place is right at the exact end of the boardwalk. It is wise to get the \"Punch pass\" for the tram, which picks up RIGHT there at Seabonet...otherwise it's a loooooong walk to the Purple Moose saloon! Tram quits running at 11pm. I was scared because I read a negative review about Seabonet AFTER it was too late to cancel reservations, but was pleasantly surprised. My 3 boys: 10, 13, 14 all loved it, and so did I! I will DEFINATELY stay here any chance I get, before this and all the cute little $130/night places are torn down and replaced with the huge $400/night places! It was a good move for us to stay here reasonably, so we could afford to parasail, go charter fishing, mini golf, shop, and eat well! I do wish that the pool would have stayed open until 10 pm, though! 8pm was too early. I hope this helps you!", "Date": "August 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201ca nice little place for the money\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3733094", "Content": "this hotel was nothing fancy and the rooms are small but they were clean and the pool was great. the only down side to this hotel is that you have quite a bit of walking ahead of you to get to the boardwalk. i would not recommend this place to anyone who cannot do a great deal of walking. this is an older hotel but if you would rather not spend the majority of you money on a room, then this might be the choice.", "Date": "August 3, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Seabonay Motel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g41298-d571191-Reviews-Seabonay_Motel-Ocean_City_Maryland.html", "Price": "$53 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">28th Street Oceanfront</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Ocean City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MD</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">21842</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "571191", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/69/44/6944a6126fd2d5020cadf2b50bf155a41large.jpg"}}
