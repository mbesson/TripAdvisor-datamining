This did not work-so i rang the office and asked them to sort it out! This in turn ended up with the girls calling him a 'beep beep'for telling them off and slagging me for calling him and my so my husband had to pop out and stick up for me. Not a good night. Day 2 was much the same, people in the hot tub past it's curfew and SLAMMING the gates to get in and out! But the main issue was someone had moved into end room above us and the floor is so thin it honestly sounded like they were purposely stomping around like elephants all night. And this continued on the 3rd night. We are a young couple on a round the world trip for our honeymoon and hd f been driving California so have been choosing cheap accomm for this leg of the trip but I'm not sure being sleep deprived is worth it.

After checking-in, the agent \"buzzes\" you into the central courtyard, where two levels of rooms surround a not-bad pool and spa. The agent advised me to take an upper level room, since the squeaking floors are noisy for those on the lower level. My room had a firm king-size bed adorned with the expected shiny synthetic bedspread. There was a table with two chairs, a small refrigerator and a wall-mount TV with a good-enough selection of cable channels... including HBO. The small bathroom featured a good-sized tiled shower with ample hot water and surprisingly good pressure--actually better than at the 5-star resort I had just come from.

The manager was very friendly; the motel is just a half-block from the Hollywood-Western Metro station (with a Starbucks on the corner), and it's a quick drive to most other points of interest.

The second surprise came when we were handed our TV remote and two key cards, and informed that our bill was being charged $20 for the remote and $10 for each key card, charges which would be refunded if returned at checkout. The third surprise was the \"Visitor's Policy\" statement which was given to us after registering. An abbreviated version follows: 1. $10 plus tax for visitors between midnight and 6 AM 2.All guests and visitors must provide photo ID and visitors must leave the ID at the desk until departure. 3. All visitors and registered guests must be over 18 years of age. 4. Management has the right to refuse admittance of any visitor. Also, Nudity is not allowed within public view whether in or out of your room. (A rule which was obviously not observed in actual practice.) What was good about Coral Sands? Clean bathrooms with an abundance of nice towels. Clean sheets. Attractive bedspread with coordinated drapes. What was bad about Coral Sands? Broken light fixture in bathroom with badly rusted medicine cabinet. Insufficient lighting from lamps that are under-powered and dirty. Pillows so flat (worn out) they barely mattered. Terrible TV with only about 8 channels seriously fuzzy and distorted. Dilapidated Sauna which the night clerk didn't know how to operate. Soiled room carpeting. Minimal breakfast with only black coffee so strong the cream barely cut it. No decaf. Only donuts. All-night cruising and noise on the balcony. Summary: This is a place where men can cruise for partners. A bath house would be more \"efficient.\" As a motel it has serious shortcomings. Coral Sands tries to do both and doesn't do either very well, considering the cost.
