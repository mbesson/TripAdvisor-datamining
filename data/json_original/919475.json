We were a little nervous because we had read a lot of negativ reviews about the distance to City, the Morningbuff\u00e9, the service , busses and places to eat in the evening but but .... everything was absolutely perfeckt ! We had mailed Mara Carouso ( very nice person) to be upgrated to a room with Balcony ( with a great view to Peters Church) and were asked if we wanted a pickup in the Airport so the service was absolutely fine as all the staff in all ! The Morningbuff\u00e9 was very big and good , the busses to the Rome Centrum was 5 min walk away and at least 4 diff busses every 10 th min. so ? We didn\u00b4t try the Restaurant in the evenings but found a Vietnam/ Chineese Restaurant 10 min.walk from the Hotel but the absolut best was Le Vele ( Piazza Pio XL 75) also 10 min from the Hotel , very ,very nice , so nice that we had dinner there twice. An other thing everyone should try at least once is lunch on a plate, payed by weight .warmed served for very little money ( on the right side of the Mainstreet before Peters Church ) We can also recommend a Tour Guide ( we had ordred Tina Montalbano from hoime) and she showed and told us everything in 4 hours and the we could take Openbuss 110 and see the rest of the places in Rome .in our own time Absolutely 4 very good days in Rome", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lewes", "Title": "\u201cGreat family stay\u201d", "Author": "KatiRLewesUK", "ReviewID": "UR127674508", "Content": "I stayed here with my 3 children 7-10.4.2012, and we had a lovely time.

And even my 15-year-old left the table feeling he can cope for a few hours before the next meal... Once you get to know your surroundings the location of the hotel is great: far enough from the centre to be peaceful, but still within walking distance. Rome is all about walking. You wouldn't want to miss a thing. We walked to the centre and usually took a taxi back in the evening (7-12 Euros). Close by is a sweet ice cream place, supermarket, and a lovely family restaurant in a Hotel just behind the Cardinal.

Buy a Roma pass for 30 euros for 2 days and this gets you on all the buses and 2 entries to attratcions. Excellent value. Buy from any tourist information booths. Taxis are expensive. 50 euros for a 20 min drive from airport. Rome is a fantastic place and I would highly recommed using their open top tour buses to hop on hop off at the main tourist places. Excellent. Downside to hotel is that there are no restaurants nearby. A Macdonald's and a Thai place were the best we could find.

Our arrival to the airport in Rome was okay and if you get into a taxi to the hotel it is only a 2 minute drive however we opted for the transport service which was a little cheaper. Unfortunately, as we arrived quite late the METRO was closed and the bus services were a little unhelpful to get us to the hospital. Eventually upon arrival our room was a mess, so we complained and asked to have another room. The second room we were allocated was the same, as in it wasn\u2019t prepared for the new couple arriving there from the previous person/ people who used it. We complained and went up another floor to have a balcony facing the pool outside and a lovely view of St.Peters cathedral. The room was clear and very modern and quite well equipped to be staying there for a couple of nights, as most of our days were going to be spent exploring Rome. We had breakfast included here, it was the same thing everyday which got really boring, along with pastries which there is only so much you can eat. There was also bread for toast, cheese (two kinds) and ham\u2026\u2026\u2026.again no other meats. The hot chocolate was a lovely delight though. We went to Rome around the 16th October 2011 and the weather was quite warm on some days and on other days quite breezy. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t get to use the pool because it was quite cold but the rest of the activities we did take up was absolutely splendid. Rome itself can be extremely expensive, so be well prepared to eat out and do excursions which will cost a fair bit. We used our skills to reduce excursion prices down, but there is only a certain amount they will drop down to. The ice-cream in Rome is gorgeous and whilst I adore Italian food, I did find that there were predominantly more dishes that had pork in it than chicken or lamb/ beef. For that reason we were slightly disappointed. We took up many excursions. The first is St.Peter\u2019s cathedral, that cost about \u00a340 pounds each to do, its basically a whole day event taking up to five house, a guided tour guide who will supply you with headphones to listen to whilst he talks. They cater for all different languages, so you join the language group that suits you. It was a lovely experience but I think it was slightly overpriced for what you do. To then climb the actual cathedral which you must not even think twice about not doing is going to cost you another \u00a310 but that is so worth it. We got some amazing pictures from the top. The Coliseum was another excursion we did. That was much cheaper, it cost about \u00a325 per person, maybe even less I believe and again you get a guided tour which lasts about 40 minutes and then you are left alone for just under an hour to explore it yourself and take pictures. You then get re-join your group to get taking to another place where there are ruins and a great story to go with it. This is all included in the price, it is a must do. We also went shopping in Rome near the Spanish Steps which you must also do. To get there you can take the METRO which is really cheap and quite easy to navigate through like the London underground. Whilst the Spanish steps don\u2019t seem like much it does attract a lot of people and can be very crowded but again you should just climb it for the sake of being there and take some lovely pictures from the top. The Trevi Fountain is a great place, there is basically a wishing waterfall there where you take lovely pictures and make a wish by tossing a coin over your left shoulder. Amazing architecture round the waterfall and just a great experience. Be careful though, there will be people there trying to take Polaroid pictures of you as a couple and then sell it to you at a ridiculous price. There are some great ice-cream shops and restaurants and it tastes amazing\u2026\u2026\u2026.will cost about \u00a35 for three scoops but so worth it. Near the Trevi Fountain there is a huge museum about five minutes away from it, I can\u2019t remember the name but it will look like St. Pauls in London. It\u2019s a must place to take pictures with its huge columns and then to visit inside free of charge.

We found the hotel clean and very nicely furnished. The room we stayed in was very modern and after reading the mixed reviews prior to going, I was very pleasantly surprised. The breakfast was more than adequate with cereals, pastries, meats, bread, fruit etc. The hotel is located in a residential area about 25 mins walk from Vatican City but there are plenty of buses running from around the corner. Our top tips: Buy your bus ticket from the tobacconist directly across the road from McDonalds - the other tobacconist that you come across first after leaving the hotel never seemed to be open. We bought a three day bus pass for 11 euros but you can also buy a 75 minute ticket which can be used for multiple journeys although altogether not to exceed 75 mins. MAKE SURE you stamp the ticket in the machine on the bus as soon as you make your first journey. This validates the ticket and proves when it expires. We were spot checked and would have been fined 50 euros had we not had ticket stamped. Buses 916 and 575 take you to Vatican and beyond. The book called Top Ten Things to Do in Rome has excellent bus information with all the bus numbers you'll need to get to get around the city. Go to the Trastevere area, it's really pretty, lively and a great mixture of restaurants. Bus 916 and then pick up Tram Number 8 which will take you right into the centre of it all! December is an excellent time to visit Rome - no queues for Vatican or Colleseum and the weather was pretty mild. We didn't book any tour guides in advance, there were plenty hanging around the sites. We were very glad that we did use guides, their knowledge brings ancient Rome to life! There was so much to pack into our time there we left the hotel every day no later than ten and didn't return until late at night - great for packing as not many clothes needed!!

Yes, the hotel is 'out of town' but the hotel give you directions to the main sights and we used the bus and Metro services as well as the Roma Christiana hop on, hop off bus - $25 for 3 days unlimited HOHO, Metro, tram and public bus. It's a 5 minute walk to the bus stop into town. The hotel is situated off the main road on a quiet street so traffic noise is not a problem - just other hotel guests coming back in the early hours! The room is an average size room, plenty of storage space, the bathroom very nice and all very clean, nicely presented, usual freebie toilettries and clean bed linen every day. Also a mini bar, TV with BBC24 news and a private safe. We found the room to be sufficiently warm and the bed not too hard at all. The staff on Reception were always pleasant, friendly, smiling and helpful. They made a reservation for us at the restaurant next door which was lovely, but expensive. That said, we really enjoyed it and it was a dining experience - rather than fast food 'eat and go' and we enjoyed chatting to Helena/Eleanor and she was very knowledgeable about what wines go with what food. The hotel breakfast was great and certainly sufficient for us. Fruit, yoghurt, cereals, eggs, continental bacon, cold meats, cheese, jams etc. lovely fresh bread rolls and pastries and toast. Juice, milk and coffee - and yes, the coffee comes from a machine but it is perfectly drinkable and I enjoyed my cappucino. Some people have said that you need to get down to breakfast early as food is not replenished but we saw people coming into breakfast quite late and there was still a full spread and staff were bringing out more platters. We only spent a minimal amount of time in the room as we went out into town early and stayed out until late when we dropped into bed exhausted because of walking round all the sights all day in the fresh air. Rome is a big city and things are spread out (inconvenient for us tourists I know!) and walking is the name of the game despite our use of public transport. I think wherever you stay you will walk miles because that is just the way Rome is. The only bugbear we had was when we were leaving the hotel and we checked about getting a taxi to the airport they quoted us $47 euro (fixed price) which you pay to the hotel and they call the taxi. We had seen signs on taxi ranks round Rome stating it was $30 to Ciampino so we were reluctant to fork out the extra having used the public transport. We checked (twice) with the front desk and the (friendly) guy said we could get the 916 bus to Statzione Terminii. We knew this wasn't right because we'd used this bus before however, we decided to wing it. Roman people are very friendly and just love to help you out and in no time at all we were chatting to locals on the right bus and arrived at Terminii in plently of time to get the Terravision bus to the airport. All in all, we had a fantastic time in Rome, saw an unbelievable amount of tourist sights, met some lovely people and yes, now that we have got to grips with the public transport I would stay at the Cardinal St Peter again. Rome is a beautiful city and the people make it such a pleasant experience - from the people you chat to at bus stops to people in shops, bars and restaurants and the Carabineri who are a fantastic source of knowledge and directions. If you get lost (and you will), just ask someone and they will be very happy to get you on your way.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Essex", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, Friendly Staff, Fab breakfast!\u201d", "Author": "MollyMooEssex", "ReviewID": "UR121088005", "Content": "We stayed here on a 3 night 4 day break. Admittedly the hotel is a good 30min walk to the Vatican City but there are buses and a rail station nearby if needed or you can ask reception to order a cab which was usually about 5 mins wait and approx 10eur into the centre of Rome. Situated in a quiet neighbourhood - mainly residential - the hotel is clean and the rooms are modern with very nice bathrooms. We were booked into a standard room originally but I told the reception guy it was our first time in Rome and the trip was to celebrate a special birthday so asked if it would be possible to have a 'free' upgrade to a balcony room, the guy said 'of course it would' and voila!!! we had a room with a view of the Vatican in the distance. The breakfast is fairly good as others have said, plenty of variety, however the evening meals didn't appeal at all and others we spoke to who did eat there were not impressed. Also the restaurant was very cold, so would advise wearing a jumper to breakfast. We didn't find a great variety of places to eat nearby, there is a Mcdonalds at the junction though and a Chinese restaurant which was about 10 min walk up a side road across from McD's and next to a shoe shop, opposite the Chinese was a small pizzeria. The chinese was an experience in itself, Italian food cooked Chinese style!!! Reasonably priced, a two course meal for 2 with a bottle of Mateus was 30eur. I practised speaking Italian (via an app on my iphone) with the reception staff every day, they always took it in good part and seemed pleased that I at least tried, always helpful and pleasant, no rudeness or attitude at all. I think that you reap what you sow...give out a positive friendly attitude and you get one back. A useful tip we were given by a friend is that the white Palazzo Venezia building in my pics ( its now a museum full of statues, murals etc and was built after the 2nd world war )...is worth a visit, there is a changing of the guard ceremony to see every couple of hours (free entry too). There is a glass lift to the rear which takes you to the roof of the building (this costs 7eur pp) not cheap but so worth the 'birds eye' view of Rome.

It was our first trip to Rome and whilst we wouldn't have necessarily chosen this hotel we won our trip, so it was free. We arrived at the Cardinal St Peter at around 6.30pm and were told that there was a 'problem with the hotel' and that we had been allocated a room next door for one night. We assumed this meant a different part of the hotel, however a then porter took one of our bags and started wheeling it out the door, asking us to follow him. Next thing we knew he'd led us out of the hotel, on to the street and on a c.10 minute walk up a very steep hill to another hotel next door. At this point we were feeling pretty exhausted so we were willing to just roll with it and check in to this new place, that was until we saw the room which was firstly a twin (we wanted a double) and secondly a very basic 2 star standard (we should have guessed because as you checked in to this place you are presented with a key and a remote control for the TV). We called the Hotel Cardinal St Peter and said this wasn't acceptable and that we would return. So followed another walk, dragging our cases up and down the hill. On return to the Cardinal St Peter we were curtly told 'Rome is full' so we wouldn't be able to find another hotel. Then, after some mumbling and sighing the receptionist managed to locate a vacant room. We were shown to a room which was ok, the wardrobe door was broken and didn't slide and there were some marks on the walls but it was clean and comfortable with a good quality bathroom. The next 3 nights were fine, a promised upgrade to a superior room didn't materialize due to the hotel being 'full' (we saw a lot of coach parties arrive and leave) but they did waive the city tax as a gesture which was something. Throughout this experience there was no apology, no explanation and no sense that this hotel cared for their customers in any way whatsoever. I also note that another reviewer had a similar experience so assume that overbooking is a fairly routine occurrence. In terms of the other aspects, the location of the hotel whilst out of the city centre is safe and the hotel is on a quite side street. We took taxi's to and from the city centre which (depending on the wait once ordered) cost between 12 and 17 euro's. The pool and rooftop jacuzzi's looked nice too. We didn't eat here at all so cant rate the restaurant.

Now I realize New Yorker's are pretty negative. Our family of five adults and two small children had a wonderful experience. Our family arrived early (9:30 AM) from an overnight flight from the USA. The usualy check-in is 2:00 PM, and check-out isn't unto noon, so we weren't expecting much. The staff at the front desk was very accommodating and said they would try to clean the rooms as soon as possible and we could leave our luggage with them. They recommended a couple of places to eat and to sightsee while we waited. We were gone a couple of hours and when we returned the rooms were ready. We had two family rooms, so they were larger. The beds are hard, but my son loved them because he has a bad back, so it's really just a matter of preference. The rooms are also extremely clean and the cleaning staff very friendly (they loved the children). The governnment does not allow the hotels to use the air conditioning until May, so you need to open a window. Opening the window worked quicky and I love fresh air. I was surprised that there were no screens on any of the windows. I was more surprised that there were no bugs. We were on the third floor and someone said the bugs don't go that high (LOL) but whether it was because it was late March or some other lucky reason..... we did not have a bug problem. Italians don't think of breakfast the way Americans do, so we shouldn't hold them to a different country's standards. I enjoyed (to my detriment) the stuffed croissants and Cappiccuino each morning. There were scrambled eggs, cereal, milk and fresh or canned fruit for the children. If you want to be in the thick of the activity this is a little out of the way. It's great if you wanted to spend a lot of time at the Vatican or St. Peters. It was only a 20-25 minute walk and we made it several times.

I think the most negative part of this hotel is the location, because it is so far away and the public transportation system isn`t very good either. You have to first take bus to metro stop and then travel to center by metro. The problem is that when you come back, the bus stop isn`t always at the same place where you came out. First we used this alternative, but when going back the bus stop wasn`t at the same place where we went out, and we had to walk to the hotel. Other alternative is to go to center with a bus, but it is a slow alternative and you can spend 30 minutes for waiting and travelling all together. The room was smaller than we expected. I think there is no difference between standard and superior room expect that superior room has a balcony. The room balconies are close to each others and only separated by plants, so you can see and hear other people who stay there at the same time. The room was otherwise quite nice expect the fact that our mini bar did not work and there was mold in it. We told about it 3 times for the hotel staff, but it was never fixed or even cleaned. The broken molded mini bar was also not compensated at any way to us (they did not even offer to give us the internet fee 7 \u20ac for free). The breakfast isn`t very good and the breakfat room is quite uncomfortable and is located in the cellar floor. It looks like some school canteen. The \"bar\" is locted in the same place and you don`t feel like spending time there, because you can`t even go out because cellar can not have a terrance. There is no restaurant in the hotel. There is a possibility ti use internet at the rate 7 \u20ac/day. It was very slow and hard to use if you don`t have your own laptop. The nicest thing in the hotel is the roof where are three jacuzzis. Although we were not able to be there when sun shined, because we spent days in the center. Travelling is so uneasy that we did not feel like going to hotel in the middle of the day to use the pools and then going back to center. There is also one pool on the courtyard. The hotel can arrange trips in Rome or for example to Naples. Day trip to Naples (including lunch and tickets and transportation) via Carrani tours costed 114 \u20ac / person. A shuttle bus picked us at 6.30 from the hotel and drove us to center where we went to bus which left to Naples about 7.30. Overall I would not go back to this hotel if I visit Rome again. We stayed other 4 days in the center, and even though it costed totally almost 230 \u20ac more, it was worth it. I don`t know to whom i could recommend this hotel.
