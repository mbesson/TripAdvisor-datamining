Okay, not that many good things to say about the hotel really, though my friend said that the breakfast was quite good. The really good thing about the hotel was the location! You can walk anywhere, and besides that there's a Spar supermarket just around the corner, which is very handy in an otherwise expensive city. So 3 stars because of the location and the cleanliness.

We asked for a Queen and twin bed and there are three twin beds in our room. The bathroom is tiny with the smallest shower I have ever seen.

Nope. He wanted the deposit and two nights stay! Even after we told him how much it stinks and is dirty and does not look like the brochure at all! We argued with him for a bit, he said he was calling the cops if we didn't pay deposit and two nights, so we gave it to him.

We had to lug our luggage up 3 levels (It seems in Rome that \"level 2\" is always level 3, because the reception area is considered \"level 0.\" ) When you walk in, the first thing you notice is the overwhelming smell of sewage. Very damp, and you had to plug your nose to actually get through the smell. I did not trust the elavator to bring you up to the floor - it appeared to be as old as the Coliseum. Reception area: We checked in with a white haired fella named Marco (I believe that was his name) and he was the only helpful receptionist - every other receptionist was not pleasant. I felt like I was a burden to them. We booked this place because it was moderately cheap (90 Euro) but when we got in and checked in, suddenly it was 100 Euro. We stayed in the Hotel Clarin for 3 nights, before taking off for Florence, Tuscany, etc - our plan was to stay in this place the night before our flight - we cancelled that last night after they tried to charge us 120 Euro for the last night. Rooms: When we booked, we thought \"We are going to be out sightseeing, so all we need is a place to sleep, so let's go cheap, we will never be there anyway.\" - NEVER AGAIN, and I highly suggest that you don't think that way, either. (Pay the extra bucks to get a 3 star, so you can get a moderately good nights' sleep, so you can enjoy the next day) The rooms were appalling - I can't describe how uncomfortable the beds were - I could feel every spring in my back, and every morning I woke up sore, after a sleepless night, whether it was from the \"bed\" or from the 24-7 traffic right outside your window, or the crazies aimlessly wandering around at 3 in the morning making noise, or my personal favorite - every morning about 2 am, a business establishment in the area would decide to throw its day's worth of bottles into the metal garbage can, making a thunderous clatter that woke us up every night. Bathroom: I can sum this up very easy with my shower experience. First off, the shower is something that I could barely fit in, let alone shower adequately. The shower was seriously 24\" x 24\" - and after the first morning, my wife showered, and noticed that the bottom of the shower was filling up, and not draining properly - the next morning, I experienced the same thing, so upon further examination, I took a Q Tip, pried open the drain to expose about 200 years of old nasty hairball that just about made me gag. Summary: This is very easy - STAY AWAY. I have stayed in a lot of hotels, and this place was right at the top as being the worst. Between the nasty smell when you walk in, the unpleasant receptionists, the terrible beds, getting waked up at 3 in the morning by loud clatter and traffic, and then getting our pricing mysteriously increased - Just stay away.

On arrival, the lift did not work and when had to carry our luggage up several flights of stairs. We asked the night manager if the lift ever worked and he said that it didnt. He was unresponsive and at first seemingly rude. We found out the next morning that the lift did in fact work. The room was quite disappointing at first. It was small - we had 5 people staying in one room and there were 3 single beds and one double bed all pushed together so basically, it was a slab of mattresses. The bathroom was similarly small and at one stage our shower did not work. However, the small fan in the room did manage to cool us down quite abit at night and it wasn't very noisy at all even with the window open. The linen and floors were clean even though there was some ants around the room, though those disappeared after our first day there. The main manager was very friendly and helpful. He answered all our questions well and helped arrange a day tour for us. The night manager improved during our stay there. He became quite friendly and jovial as we saw him more. The breakfast left much to be desired - crisp bread and watered down, strange juice isn't much of a meal but it was enough to get us through until lunch time. The best part of this hotel is the location. Buses run along Via Nazionale all day and night and so its only a 1 minute walk home. The bus stops right near the entrance to Via Venezia along Via Nazionale so it is very convenient. It is also a short walk (5-10mins) to the metro. Overall, it was a cheap place to stay.", "Date": "June 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado", "Title": "\u201cScary, but clean\u201d", "Author": "Traveler80401", "ReviewID": "UR3573443", "Content": "Stayed at the Clarin for 1 night in June (booked by a travel agent) as we arrived by train and left the next morning by plane. Hotel is close to Termini, but not when you're dragging several bags. Walking through the front door was an adventure as there is a high step to drag your bags over and a very small elevator to take you and your luggage up to the hotel on the third floor. This was the only 2* I stayed in during my 3 weeks in Italy, so I was surprised by how basic it was. I must say that while the hotel is very hostel-like, at least it was clean. The staff was very helpful, as I called a few days before arriving to schedule 2 early taxis for the airport. The clerk spoke excellent English and the taxis arrived as scheduled. I would suggest that persons not used to a hostel style atmosphere look elsewhere, but the Clarin was adequate for what I needed. I agree with the other reviewers that the breakfast was somewhat lacking.", "Date": "June 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cBad 2star hotels\u201d", "Author": "smilec", "ReviewID": "UR3558495", "Content": "I had been to this hotel 13 days ago.. the so called 2 stars hotel is really really terrible that i never ever seen.

The bed is not comfortable, no blanket as other hotels given, just give u a piece of cloth..wat happen if weather change cold? The bathroom is real small which u shower also feel so narrow. The breakfast was bad!!!!! as the other mentioned just 2 hard breads with some jam, real bad! so called Orange Juice u dun taste orange...waterly. ..disgusting juice. The receptionist is not friendly and helpful at all! I found that Rome is nice for travel but the people is not friendly & helpful at all. sigh......

The breakfast consisted of french toast honey jam and some nutella!!! but there was a really nice breakfast place round the corner serving croissants and a range of drinks very nice!!! The only good thing about this hotel was its location 5 minutes from local metro republica and about 10-15 mins from termini station! i would not reccomend this hotel to anyone You could probably find another nicer hotel for the same price.

Whilst the hotel is basic (as I would expect for a 2* hotel) It was clean and bright. The fan in the room was more than enough for us even in the 36 degree heat of Rome in August. The bathroom had an adequate shower and was again cleaned daily by the friendly staff. The location is excellent and actually a 5-10 minute walk from the station if you find the right way. The staff were all helpful and made every effort to help us. Whilst some of them spoke limited English it is worth remembering that the hotel is in Italy and I'm sure there aren't many Italians who would stay in an English hotel and complain about the lack of Italian speaking staff. I would recommend this hotel to anyone as a base for a holiday exploring the delights Rome has to offer and also reccomend the excellent Pomo D'oro restaurant below the hotel. If, however you are looking to spend your holiday in a luxury suite rather than exploring this wonderful city then the Clarin is not for you.", "Date": "August 21, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Nsw, australia", "Title": "\u201chorrid\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2314087", "Content": "Dingy place, dingy view, lousy breakfast.
