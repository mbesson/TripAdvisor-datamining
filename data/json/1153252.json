It was great to finally find a place where we could all stay together instead of having to get two rooms in a hotel. The property was clean (except a little dusty in certain places only a tall person would notice), spacious and well equipped. There were plenty of little gorcery shops nearby to purchase breakfast and snack items. The downside was that the beds were extremely uncomfortable. I think we could feel every spring in the mattress. My 11 year old opted to sleep on the floor instead of the pull-out sofa. The walls were also paper thin so we could hear everyone around us, especially as they went up and down the stairs. We always try to teach our children to be quiet and respectful in hotels, but apparently not all parents do this. The location is o.k. as long as the weather is good. The nearest metro stops are a good 10 minute walk or more with kids (11, 10 and 8). We chose to ride the Aerobus from and to the airport. To take it back we had to walk all the way to Placa Catalunya dragging two suitcases. We could have taken taxis (need 2 for a family of 5) from the hotel as they were kind enough to offer to call for us, but we chose to walk instead.

Considering all the other glowing reviews, we must have been given the dud apartment. There were no suitable bowls in glass or plastic that I could use for cooking in the microwave. There was no electric toaster. The oven only had one tray/rack (which was the base of a griller tray less its insert) and it had to be used for everything (including toasting bread). The stove top only had 2 burners. They had a coffee making machine and plenty of supplies for it but all I wanted was an electric kettle. When I asked about one upon arrival the lady who showed us to our apartment simply shook her head and said there wasn\u2019t one. I put the coffee machine in a cupboard because it took up too much space on the small bench and used my own stove top jug for the first night. (This small jug is the only \u2018cooking\u2019 utensil I travel with \u2013 anything else I need I have to rely on the apartments we rent.) The next day, upon our return to the apartment, a new electric jug had magically appeared! It took me the full 3 days of our stay to work out how to get the washing machine to work each time I pressed the faulty start button. There was also something wrong with the locking device on the front windows but the shutters work well in keeping out the traffic noise. When we arrived there was a strong air freshener in the lounge area that we found overpowering so placed it in a cupboard. After returning from an all day tour, we noticed the apartment smelt very badly (like decaying garbage) and realised that was why the strong air freshener had been put in the room. We were not able to find out where the foul smell was coming from. The wardrobe in the second bedroom was unusable due to another overpowering unbearable smell. The beds are really firm but we were able to sleep on them. The rooms were clean despite the bad smell. The bathroom was a good size and had a good hair dryer. The TV was huge but the English satellite channels kept dropping out. This did not concern us too much as we didn\u2019t expect to see English programmes on Spanish TV. The reception staff were all very helpful and courteous. We liked having the 24 hour reception which is not always available when you rent apartments instead of hotels. There is free internet access on a computer in the reception area. The small supermarket just around the corner had a good range of products. When I book apartments instead of hotels, it is because I need to use the cooking and washing facilities they provide.
