Think of blasting music travelling through all the bedrooms, drunken people wondering throughout the hotel and bedroom corridors all night, and empty bottles floating on the pool the next day (cigarettes buds, broken glasses in the sauna and jacuzzi). Overall facilities advertised are very misleading (the library is a bookshelf with one chair) and service is rather non existent. Ground floor cafe that is also the lobby shuts down at 11pm (main entrance locked, lights off, chairs up) so on your return from dinner you will be greeted by a security guard, cleaner and all the drunken people having a break from the party. On a more positive note housekeeping service is good and thank you to the young reception lady (never saw a Manager in six days) who upgraded us to a spacious suite on the first night, this from a standard room where the wash basin is not in the bathroom but next to the bed, be aware ...

I needed to extend my stay in Mexico City by a night and I thought I would try this place since everyone seems to rave about the hotels in the group. Upon arrival I was assigned a room with hair in the bathtub, which even otherwise wasn't in a great condition - the original white had become a sort of yellowish brown and the there were bits that had simply chipped off. When I complained, they first sent a maid who wiped down the tub and then cheerily showed it to me even though there were still strands of hair clearly visible. When I called again, they finally moved me to another room, which luckily didn't have a dirty bathroom. It was simply as badly maintained as the previous one. I pointed this out to the staff member who had accompanied me to the new room and he said he would go talk to the manager to figure out a solution and get back to me. I never heard from him again. The room did have a great all-glass wall. However at night I found out that the curtains don't go all the way down to the floor, so that it was the same as if I was sleeping with a light on all night. At 7am, this became more like a bright fluorescent light. The designers also didn't seem to think any sound-proofing was necessary, perhaps because they haven't ever tried to sleep in a room facing a street in Mexico City. At breakfast the next morning, I barely saw any staff and definitely wasn't acknowledged by any of them until one of them came running over as I got up to leave, to make sure I wasn't trying to escape paying for my food. All in all, a pretty miserable experience. Despite the discounted rate that I got on the internet, I felt I overpaid by a lot. I'm sure the place has decent rooms, but the two I saw would be unacceptable even in a three-star hotel.

As a solo female traveler I wanted to be somewhere where I felt safe and where the staff would remember me - thus I chose this hotel with a small number of rooms in a great neighborhood and a great rooftop terrace with views over the city. I was so right! The staff were wonderfully attentive, particularly the staff in the restaurant and everyone was friendly. I would definitely recommend the breakfast here which offers a range of foods from the lighter fruit and yogurt option to amazing hot cakes with syrup to delicious local food. There's a cold buffet at 180 pesos, a hot buffet for 225 pesos but I preferred to order a la carte which in many cases was cheaper and still set me up for walking around the rest of the day. The clientele tends to vary between smart businessmen to more creative industry people and stylish jet set types however I never felt out of place or awkward despite occasionally appearing in a pretty casual skirt and flip flops. The environment is relaxed. The room was clean and the bed extremely comfy with a duvet. The hotel has free wi-fi throughout which is a great plus for keeping in touch with friends and family and the rooms are all fitted with Sony t.v and dvd players with dvds available for rental at the desk. The room has an enclosed balcony for those smokers out there. Be aware- After reading reviews here I decided to bring earplugs and I was totally right to do so as between the noise from traffic in the street or from occasional events at the bar on the roof, you may find it hard to settle to sleep. That said... with earplugs in, I slept like a baby - events ended at midnight and the cleaning staff never bothered me in the morning but patiently waited till I left my room for the day. Another point to note is that the temperature drops quite alot at night in Mexico city so warm PJs are recommended. Taxis were easily arranged for me to head to other parts of town and there is also a hotel car although I didn't use it. The real attraction for me was the rooftop terrace and bar- the terrace was the perfect place to sunbathe throughout the day with a small pool big enough to do laps and cool down. While it was sometimes closed during the day for photoshoots these tended to be over by 2pm which left pleeeenty of time to catch some rays. At night, the rooftop bar projects old movies onto the white wall of a nearby building and serves great light bites and cocktails, it was a great place to take my friends from the city who were also very impressed with the place. Overall- I had a great time, felt really safe and welcome and am very glad that I picked this hotel for my first visit to Mexico city. While I would not recommend this place to families with young children, older couples, light sleepers or people who just want somewhere out of the way and quiet - if you want a cool place to chill by day before sightseeing and then relax in at night, this is a real gem.", "Date": "March 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tiebele, Burkina Faso", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing\u201d", "Author": "y2kmx", "ReviewID": "UR92218384", "Content": "I stayed there for 3 nights in early December, staff where nowhere to find when needed, first day when coming back around noon for a quick nap, I found the whole floor and obviously my room, smelling like varnish and paint, it caused my like vomiting, and as it is all closed, there was no ventilation at all and air conditioning was not working fully...

It was ok. It actually looks a little dated already. The furniture in the main restaurant and lobby is very beautiful, but the bedroom decor is too cold: I am all for minimalism, but found the rooms pretty uninspiring - and kind of a copy of The Standard hotels in the US from about 6 years ago. Overall, however, the experience at Hotel Habita was let down by service and details issues: The reception staff were never at reception, and always in the room off reception, where they took their meals, hung out, worked on computers etc. So you always had to call them, and then they'd break off whatever they were doing and come assist you, whether covered in crumbs from whatever they were eating, or being in the middle of something else which they wanted to get back to. Service in the restaurant was terrible. We had breakfast there 2 of the 3 days we spent at the hotel (we gave up and went elsewhere on Day 3). There was one guy working both mornings. We always had to get up from our table and go ask hum for stuff - he never came near us. The buffet had no clean bowls the first morning. They ran out of food both mornings. On the second morning, we ordered omelettes. After 45 minutes waiting, we gave up and returned to our room. 5 minutes later, we got a call - staff were mystified as to our whereabouts, and explained our food was ready now and we had to go downstairs to eat it. Maid service was very good in terms of cleaning. However, there was quite a random approach to replenishing toiletries. On our first day, we had a full set of Kiehl's products. On Day 2, we were left 2 bottles of conditioner, but no shampoo or body wash. On the third day, we were left one bottle of shampoo from a different brand which I didn't recognise. Random. Do not take the hotel's car service: it is crazy expensive (even by the usual standards). We were charged $10 for a 3 minute ride to Izote restaurant: the walk back to the hotel took 10 minutes. Similarly, we were quoted $150 dollars for a trip to Teotihuacan to see the pyramids: we simply made friends with a cab driver from the rank at Polance metro station who took us for $70. The fitness centre at the hotel is crappy: a couple of old machines, outdoors, by the pool.

The rates were similar, but I chose Habita as I tend to prefer independent boutique hotels, even whilst on business. This hotel is perfectly located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Polanco, close to many boutiques and within walking distance of many nice restaurants (Gaston y Astrid, Peruvian restaurant is a must). Also a 15 minute stroll from Bosque Chapultepec and a few blocks from the metro station. The building is quite unique, and the reception area is dominated by a very cool looking restaurant.

Great place to rub shoulders with the beautiful people of Mexico city. There's also a rather small fitness room, which nevertheless serves its purpose well. My biggest complaint would be the noise from the upstairs bar. You do get loud music until 2-3:00AM, and as my room was directly below the pool, I could hear the banging noise of high heels above my head (there was an event in the hotel, with models using one of the conference room as a make-up/changing room). I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had in-room brakfast and the food was really amazing and plentiful. The downstairs restaurant is a great place for a business breakfast, by the way.

The bar and swimming pool at the top were very cool, but we never went there or used the pool. It was useful to have access to internet on two PCs. We moved onto the W hotel for the last three nights. Although the W is more impressive, we liked the personality of the Habita. It is much smaller and less glamorous but has more heart.

The room (we stayed in a middle-range one) was large by normal standards, well decorated, with an incredibly comfortable huge bed and a well-stocked bathroom. All the service we received was exemplary and the food and drink were good quality without being too crazily priced for a high-end hotel (buffet breakfast is not included in the room price but is US$12 and actually worked out slightly cheaper than eating the same at a local cafe). So we were pretty impressed - until we got our bill which revealed a number of underhand tactics. Firstly, the exchange rate offered is extremely poor even by hotel standards (we were given 11 pesos/dollar when the official rate was 10.2) So if you want to pay your bill by credit card or in pesos cash you end up paying nearly 10% more. The only way of avoiding this is if you pay in US$ cash - but as the rooms are about US$200 you're looking at a carrying a pretty hefty amount of cash around. Not a particularly pleasant prospect in Mexico City (in the end we never felt threatened but had been given loads of warnings about robbery etc before we arrived and hence avoided big wads of cash). Secondly - there are a load of things left out in the bathroom like an Evian atomiser spray and bottled water alongside the sewing kits/shower caps etc. A nice touch we thought, until at check-out we realised the sprays were US$10 each and the water was also chargeable (incidentally, we did check the minibar menu and checked for price tags on all of the items and there was no indication they were not complimentary). And finally, we asked reception to book a tour to Teotihuacan for us as we realised it was going to be tricky getting up there independently. We were given a price, but when we got the bill we found they had charged us a percentage commission on top of the price agreed. This was not mentioned when we booked it, and seemed like a rather odd practice - surely it should be the tour company paying the hotel commission for getting them custom, not the customer? Anyway, to cut a long story short we raised all of this with the manager when we got the bill and he basically said many guests had complained about the underhand charges, admitted it was 'unclear' the items were not free, but despite this would not budge on removing any of them from the bill. So a pretty unsatisfactory outcome.

First, the location: it's located in the posh Polanco area, just a block away from the Polanco subway station. For over-crowded, over-polluted Mexico City, this neighborhood is like an oasis calm in the middle of a huge bazaar. The streets around the hotel are perfectly safe with plenty of shopping and dining options. (We recommend nearby D.O. for a superb Spanish dinner) Facilities: We booked a deluxe corner room. The room itself was clean and well-equipped. My husband particularly liked the in-ceiling stereo system, while I was a fan of the huge shower that doubled up as a steam room. The hotel is wired with free wifi throughout (which we had to pay at the Puerto Vallarta Westin). Terry slippers and bathrobes were provided. The bed was super comfortable as was a wooden chair. Take note though that the decor is absolutely minimalist -- an aesthetic that pleases some but not all. We took a swim the first morning at around 730am. Thinking we would have to plunge into an outdoor pool where the water was cooled overnight, we were pleasantly surprised to find that the hotel heats the pool in the morning. Although the pool and the gym are small, that's well-justified given the number of rooms in the hotel. We hardly saw anyone else at the gym or pool. The sauna was ok. Not hot enough. One needs to call the reception ahead of time to heat it up. Service: Service was friendly and intimate. The receptionist, doorman, and concierge quickly recognized us. We were particularly impressed with the efficiency of the concierge. When we expressed an interest at 9pm for a private tour the next day, the concierge quickly had it arranged. Of course, it is a smaller boutique hotel, so the style of service is not the same as at ritz-carlton. For example, the concierge doubled-up as the bellboy to carry our luggage. We thought that was cool and more personal, but some may find it odd or awkward Overall, we were extremely happy with our stay at the Habita and would definitely recommend to our friends", "Date": "October 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cFunky but great service\u201d", "Author": "Traveleasy", "ReviewID": "UR8236753", "Content": "The Habita is in many ways a typical designer hotel - the facade has a largely opaque glass exterior with steel trims. The small yet adequate lobby has exposed (but painted) concrete ceilings with the Aura restaurant (serves all 3 meals and is open almost all the time) abutting the passageway leading to the front desk. The room itself (I stayed in room 19) is compact with an open area to relieve any build up of claustrophobia. The bed is comfortable but just about adequate for a couple. WiFi service is great in the room but the lack of dressers leaves no room to unpack clothes besides some hanging space. Despite all the high-end designing, functionality is far from perfect as the closet door could not be opened until the bathroom door was open. The hotel also provides only one bathrobe per room despite double occupancy - so ask for one if you are traveling as a couple. The roof top bar has spectacular views and a (too?) lively crowd particularly on Saturday evenings. The swimming pool looks great but is less welcoming to actual swimmers as there is just about one lane for swimming. The gym has one each of a treadmill, a cycle and a elliptical trainer - barely adequate even for a small hotel. There is also a business center with two computers next to the gym which is open 24/7. Food and service in the Aura restaurant is simply outstanding and a table by the window overlooking ave Presidente Masaryk - the street on which the hotel is located - is well worth the very reasonable prices on the menu.

I believe they wish to sell the place as \"design hotel\" but I would better defined it an hotel of poor design.", "Date": "February 10, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, New York", "Title": "\u201cHeaven on Earth Right Here...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1615747", "Content": "I thought I died and went to heaven. The Service is beyond compare. As soon as your wet, they make you dry, when your ready to eat, they serve you only the best. The Pool bows down to you and eases you into a sublime swim. The unique touches, such as the movies run accross from the Cantina and the terrycloth lounge chairs create a illusion of paradise, in Mexico City. I could have a spa experience next to the pool or in my own private oasis. This trip melted away all my tension and left me mellow and relaxed to dream of my next visit. I reccomend this Resort, I have traveled extensively and this by far was the icing on the cake!", "Date": "January 27, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, TX", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Habita\u201d", "Author": "Sagolfer", "ReviewID": "UR1271364", "Content": "What a wonderful Hotel! I stayed at the Habita for a couple of weeks while in Mexico City for business, and I had the most wonderful experience. I was staying at the Nikko, but truth be told, the beds are way too hard for me there. Speaking of beds, I don't think I've ever slept in such comfortable beds as those at the Habita. The comforter, the sheets, the pillows, everything was wonderful. There is overhead progressive music playing, which really adds to the minimalist art-nouveau ambiance. The cafe downstairs is very good, especially for breakfast. If it's nightlife your looking for, go no further than the upstairs loft area. All the pretty people in Ciudad de Mexico, D.F. gather here during the night for socializing. No doubt about it, when I go back, I'm staying here!", "Date": "September 2, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Habita", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d254876-Reviews-Habita-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "Price": "$181 - $344*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Avda Presidente Masaryk 201</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Polanco</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Mexico City</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">11560</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Mexico</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "254876", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/61/22/61228e8eb49284c7c8eed23c451c8e0a1large.jpg"}}
