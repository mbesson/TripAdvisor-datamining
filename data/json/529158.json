Which is crowded with tourist, only a short way until you turn left on to the small alley marked by an @ symbol. And you're there. It took only an hour from deplaning, to get the local bus (5euros), to walk in the front door of the hotel. We were a bit before the checkin at noon, but we were able to leave our luggage, grab a lunch and our room was ready promptly at noon. The proprieters were helpful and friendly, often siting out in the quiet alley at the entrance reading. The lobby is small, but comfortable with free wifi. Our room was small, but normal for Europe. There was ac and a large en suite bathroom with a bidee. The shower was small but clean. There are no lifts, so plan on walking if your on the 3rd floor like us. But you will walk everywhere in Venice! The room was comfortable and quiet opening onto a small balcony looking out to the quaint alley. No view to speak of though. Breakfast is also included and served in the lobby. Typical euro Bfast with cereal, croissants, coffee, and oj, served until 10 for us late risers!
