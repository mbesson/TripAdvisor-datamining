This hotel is between Termini Station (the main train station/ metro/bus) and another station, this makes movement within the city fairly easy. I would recommend taking the leonardo express from FCO to Termini station and then walking to the hotel, it really is that close (this should cost about 28 euro). The hotel is very small and almost all of the staff are extremely helpful and we were delighted with the smiles, the greeting, the travel/sightseeing/dining tips and jokes that we received during our stay from the majority of the staff. However, there is no alarm clock in the room (at least ours), the bathroom smelled of sewer whenever the toilet was flushed, And I have yet to find an english channel, such as BBC America, yet they do have that in the lobby. Breakfast is also a little limited from an American standpoint, however they keep it well stocked and that is much appreciated. Also they only person that truly annoyed me, and this is probably because I'm used to different types of service, was last night about 1am I was trying to call France from the room phone, and the dialing instructions given by the hotel was not working, I went out into the lobby and all the lights were out, the night worker was passed out in the breakfast room on a cot, he woke up to me walking into the lobby and asked what I wanted, I told him and his reply was, the office is closed, ask again in the morning. Maybe this is typical of a European hotel, I'm just used to having 24 hour guest services. So take that tidbit with a grain of salt. As an additional tip, I recommend not getting the Hop on Hop off tour bus sold by the hotel, unless u were to do a single round trip. It's very slow, crowded at times, and this service, Ciao Roma, seems to have the fewest number of Hop on Hop off busses.This bus ticket runs about 31 euro for 48 hours and this tour bus stops by 6pm. I would however recommend getting a metro pass (probably a week long one) which runs 18 euro (alternative a daily pass is available for 4 euro and will last till midnight of that day, the metro system is easy to understand here, it includes all metros, city busses and trams (not the leonardo express to FCO though). The metro stops running at 9pm most days which will leave you on the bus, this is quiet a bit more difficult to understand, always ask the drivers they are also very friendly though you can tell their need for punctual departure. All in all this is a very good hotel for the price in Rome, I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a nice base of operations to see the ruins and who will only be resting/crashing at this hotel. The day staff and night staff as stated above are for the most part very friendly, knowledgeable, talkative, and overall great representatives of Italy.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cwe loved it, helpful staff, close to metro and train station\u201d", "Author": "ru89", "ReviewID": "UR115104865", "Content": "We are family of four with two teenagers.

I have no idea what the other hotel looks like in reality but this hotel was not what we expected at all. The room they gave us was small, which wasnt a problem really, the view was literrally other people's laundry and garbage and the room itself was smelly and full of stains on the walls. In one word DEPRESSING. We asked for another room on another floor (ours was on the ground floor)but nothing came of it. In addition, breakfast was served until 9.30 which is too early. To make a long story short we left after the second night, even though we paid for three. What suprises me the most is that people would chose to stay in such a low standards hotel when in the same price tag can book a room in a better area and with better accomodation standards. To be fair the people at the reception, which seemed to do every work in the hotel, were helpful but this is hardly enough to make up for such a lousy experience.", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver Island, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood location for Termini station\u201d", "Author": "2islandhoppers", "ReviewID": "UR103158902", "Content": "We stayed one night, arriving in Rome late in the afternoon and leaving by train the following morning.

Negative: 1) Unhelpful service desk: This really gets me: We arrive in Rome in the last train late at night. Upon arrival after a long travel/day, we asked whether there was water available -- just a cup suffices given our long walk/day and time of the day: 11pm at night. The staff \"kindly\" offered us a bottle without any words. The next day when we checked out, the hotel charged us $2 euro for this bottle. Stupid service: just tell us that it would be $2 when he didn't want to give us any free cup of water after a long day and late arrival at night, and we will decide ourselves whether to drink this costly water. If not for such poor service, would rate this hotel a bit better. 2) Kinda far if you walk with luggage: had to cross streets not designed for travelers with luggage. 3) TV screen blanked out after 30 min of usage and became essentially a radio. 4) Breakfast is subpar (if I remember correctly, no water for breakfast, either) Given our late arrival, we didn't have much time to evaluate other necessary parts of the hotel amenities, e.g. Internet access. However, the service attitude/snafu with the water is already enough an indicator as to what kind of hotel this is and the kind of service they offer.

Staff absolutely could not have been more helpful. I emailed beforehand to ask whether I could buy my baby's specific formula milk in Rome (as I didn't want to use all my baggage allowance on milk) and they responded immediately to say they'd find out and then emailed the next day to say that one of them had gone to the local pharmacy to find out for me and they gave me all the info (and more) regarding getting the milk. When we were there they couldn't have been more friendly, helpful and lovely to us - with regard to the children and with regard to absolutely everything. The family room was fine - like a UK Travelodge Family Room. The breakfast was fine (I've seen mediocre reviews on this but really, it was all laid out to help yourselves, bread, meats, cheese, pastries, cereal, yoghurt, coffee, tea, juice - what more do you want from a mid-priced hotel?). It wasn't in the centre but was near enough to walk and was typical of any major city area near a main line train station- we were 2 women with 3 children and we felt ok walking about at night.

Sorry to say this, but I think their staff are just awful.

They wasted my time (I sent them 6 e-mails over 2 days to explain my genuine intentions to stay at their hotel and not just use them for just getting a visa) and made me feel utterly humiliated. I understand they've had bad experiences in the past, but I don't think it gives them the right to suspect everybody (who's not a EU citizen and thus needs a visa support letter) of being a fraud.
