When I tried to make a reservation for their promotion package the system block it due to some ongoing events. So again I email Mr Stampe for his assistance and he agreed to let me book under the promo price. When we reach the hotel and went up to our room, about 15mins later our door bell rang and to our surprise a birthday cake was delivered. My wife was very happy by the nice gesture. The cake delivered is not a slice but a whole 6\" cake by chocolate origin. So next time if given a chance we would definitely comes back again for our next staycation.

Our breakfast was included with what we had paid for. While we were not too worried about the overall hotel as we barely were in it for 9 hours, it was disappointing that wifi was not free (even on a limited basis just to check emails/check in to further flights etc, which would be useful to many travellers even those just in transit).

You have a chance to walk around the \u201chousing states\u201d (they do not have the same connotation of American housing projects, Parisian banlieus, or British council states), eat in one of the many local eateries (please note that the hawker center is closed until the end of 2012), and just spend the night like a local. The hotel is one street from the beach, where you can go for a 6km run on a mostly shaded pathway. So, the location did not disappointed. The hotel is what you would expect: business hotel, friendly, clean (with the caveat below), good sized rooms, a very nice shower, overpriced restaurants, overpriced breakfast, and a beautiful pool on the top floor. These are the positives, and they are more than enough for the regular stopover, but there are a few things to consider: 1. Location: It is great, but the shuttle takes its time to get from Airport to Hotel. The free hotel shuttle leaves from T2 and T1. If you arrive on T3, you will need to go to T1. From terminal 1, the shuttle takes 25 minutes to get to the hotel. So, not much quicker than going to town using the metro, if you know your way around. I would suggest taking a taxi to the hotel. (The shuttle took 15 minutes on the way back) 2. If you are a non-smoker, and don't tolerate sleeping on an ash-tray, don't bother. The \u201cnon-smoking\u201d rooms are sprinkled around smoking ones and they smell equally bad. I was given a smoking room by mistake, changed to a non-smoking, and it makes no difference. Room 404 is non-smoking, but rooms 401, 402, 403, 405, and 406 are smoking, so you get the picture: carpet smells, bed-sheets smell ... it is not pleasant. A big chain like this one should be able to make entire floors smoke-free, or, at least make sure that the carpet of non-smoking rooms are washed, and that all the items (towels, pillows, sheets) of non-smoking rooms are separated from the rest. Otherwise, what is the point? 3. $15 for internet access. This is a standard on all hotels from this chain (\u201cFar East Hospitality\u201d). These are good hotels, but for the life of me, I don't get it. Cable and all utilities are absorbed in the room price, it is time wifi is treated as such. To summarize, as much as I enjoy the village and the run on the beach, I would not come back to the hotel. I would much rather stay at the Parc Sovereign, Ibis, or Albert Village, all easily accessible on the Bencolen area, or at the Mercure Roxy, on the East Coast (also near the beach) for a one night stopover.

Being a regular patron and never seen such a room that is not up to expectations, I requested for another room. The staff, Mr Hairul, was very prompt in making the arrangements to ensure that my request was made and a room was quickly made available to me. Although, after checking into the new room for about an hour, we realised there were some problems with the pipe. The staff was very apologetic and made it a point to quickly help us change to a better room. Due to the incoveniences, they gave us an upgrade to a nice room and the staff who served us, Mr Ronald, was very professional when helping us with it. Although we did have hiccups when we first checked in, we feel their professional service made up for all the problems that occured. I had stayed in this hotel many times and love the location which is so near to the beach. My family totally enjoyed the stay.

We were checked into a room that was already occupied. That's the first time I have ever had that happen (and hopefully it is the last!). Me and my girlfriend decided to do a \"stay-cation\" here for one night. We were kind of sick of the typical, downtown Singapore hotel in the CBD or Orchard area so we chanced upon this place. The location is quite nice, peaceful and tranquil with quite lovely views from the top and the pool deck. You definitely feel \"away\" from Singapore. When we arrived, nobody was there to open the door of the taxi and the check-in queue was long with only one staff member on-hand handling check-ins and check-outs it seemed. A second staff member arrived but the check-in process took all of about 10 minutes with lots of waiting. Not a good start. Got our room, proceeded upstairs to the room, inserted the key card and....SHOCK AND HORROR! The room was already occupied; thankfully nobody was there at the time, but the lights were on, there was clothes/laundry hanging from the bathroom and the bed was all messy. It also smelled a bit like smoke even though it was a non-smoking room/floor. The room was also much smaller than what we had booked. We were literally in shock...the look on my girlfriends face was one that I honestly have not seen before (or since). Went back downstairs and were quite angry, its really quite hard to make a mistake like this. Told the staff member what happened...he looked a bit stunned and mumbled \"huh?! oh..ok!\" and then I told him he needed to make up for this somehow. They offered free internet as compensation. Sorry, but that ain't going to cut it; free internet? Are you nuts? I live in Singapore, I have my iphone with me and I can tether the internet...got no use for that and for someone that just checked us in to an already occupied room the best he could do was free internet?!! I told him that wasn't going to work. He paused for a bit, then offered us free breakfast which we accepted. Finally got the new room to which we proceeded to. With a bit of trepidation, we inserted the key card to our new room. *PHEW* nobody was occupying the room. The room was spacious and big, but it felt horribly dirty - dirty carpet, hairs on the ugly yellow leather couch attached to the wall and the work desk had some weird stain on it (like the varnish was removed or something). The bathroom WAS CLEAN thankfully, and the water pressure of the shower was FANTASTIC but it left a sopping mess on the floor of the bathroom. The room overall wasn't as nice as we expected it would be; the photos on the hotel website are a bit misleading in my opinion; I am well aware that hotel photos that are professionally done tend to glitz things up a bit but I just felt like what is portrayed and marketed falls way short of what you actually get. After getting settled, we decided to venture around and down to the pool for some lunch. It's set up nicely against the golf course, and the food is rather decent. We later went up to the pool which is quite honestly the only redeeming quality of the hotel. The rooftop pool offers beautiful views of Pulau Ubin and Malaysia, and of the airport as well which surprisingly wasn't loud at all and didn't wake us once when asleep. The breakfast the next morning wasn't something we would pay for, we woke up a bit tired and sore and after a bit more hanging around, checked out. All-in-all, it was a bad experience from the moment we checked in. Imagine what would have happened if the room we were initially given that was occupied actually had the person inside of it when we flung the door open? That would have been horrible...staff at this place needs some training I think. With all the software these days it is beyond me that they assigned us a room that was already occupied. If they can get their act together and spruce the place up a bit, maybe we will return.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGood value stopover hotel\u201d", "Author": "4rubylou", "ReviewID": "UR126429839", "Content": "We chose to stay overnight here as we were flying out the next day to Tioman Is.

There's an hourly free shuttle bus: leaves the airport at 30 mins past the hour (go to Transport desk for details), leaves the hotel on the hour. Some things to know: 1. The rooftop pool has a good view, if you don't look behind you at the ducting system which could easily be screened if they bothered. The pool is often closed when booked for private functions (locals like to get married next to the pool) so check before you book if the pool is important to you. There is a ground floor pool also but it has a glass wall, hence diners get an underwater view of the swimmers: OK if you don't mind being watched but not me. You can stay after checkout and use the pool if you have a late flight. 2. Get a 'bumboat' nearby to pulau ubin (10-minute ride) and rent a bike and cycle round the island, which is a nature reserve. A good way to enjoy some exercise between long flights. 3. Local shopping is market-stall quality, OK for cheap stuff, but this is not a place for a good shopping stopover. 4.The hotel food's mediocre and the restaurant staff hurry you if you arrive within an hour before closing time: closing time means the time they go home, not last orders.

The reception staff used his walkie-talkie : \"urgent room cleaning of room xxx, expedite\". We were initially impressed, although this turned out to be theatre - the room was not ready until 2 pm anyway. So at 1.30, we swapped for a smoking room. As expected, the flavour of the room was that of a smoker, and this can't be held against the hotel. The odd thing is, the lobby, lifts and restaurants all exude 4- or 5-star atmosphere but the room was dumpy, small, and lacked facilities - no tea or coffee, just two sachets of equal (a fault by housekeeping?) and the toiletries were comical (one small shampoo for two people, no comb). There were blood stains on the carpet. The plan of the hotel is open, so the live music from the lobby wafts up to the fourth floor in the evening without any buffers. We saw quite a few guests or friends of guest sitting in corridors on guest floors at dawn. It gave me the feeling of a student library. I felt this was like a three star hotel with a few facilities added on. The price was $250 SGD.

My one concern is the way they presented a \"new\" package on arrival for a single executive room currently still being promoted on the web. In fairness, they allowed an early check in (which was great since I was tired). However, that's also when they handed me a printout with new (shorter) lounge snack offerings (1800 to 2000h), two complimentary laundry items (non-accumulating) which I was barely able to do since laundry was leaving the hotel as I arrived (prior to 11am), and complimentary local calls. What I did not find out until I inquired later is: no welcome fruit basket was offered, complimentary items from the minibar were now all charged (but still mostly free in the executive lounge), and the Saltwater Cafe breakfast was withdrawn and the executive lounge breakfast offered in its place. I was told management changed but the \"contract\" with Expedia had not been updated. I asked for clarification about the timing of these changes (since my booking was a recent one), the answer was a vague \"earlier this year\". I would (&, in future, will) not consider booking the executive floor package because I found the lounge annoyingly cold. I spoke to the attendant when she came over to my table to ask if everything was OK. \"Well yes, but it is really cold in here.\" \"Sorry I can't do anything about that.\" I found it so uncomfortably cold for the evening cocktail.

One must purchase a coupon or ticket to even be wireless if in the bar or restaurant. This is a step backwards for most guests since most hotels extend wireless coverage for guests throughout the facilities. I strongly recommend that the hotel management reconsider this.

The hotel restaurant breakfast buffet is not open at 6am so I could not take advantage of the breakfast that my company had purchased or included. Strongly recommend management change this as well.

You either have to wait the hour or catch a taxi. Also, it is not located near the MRT. We arrived at the hotel after 11 pm (closer to midnight) and were unpleasantly surprised and irritated at the slowness of their check-in process. There were only two ladies at the counter but several (or so it seemed) bellmen waiting to help carry the guests' luggage to their room. They seemed to sense the annoyance of everyone in line (approximately 6 or 7 individuals / couples) and looked like if they could have they would have jumped in to help any and all of us. We had originally booked online and requested a double bed or larger however when we arrived to the room, there were two twin beds! So we trudged downstairs to get another room with a better bed arrangement. As we were waiting to get another room assignment, we noticed that another couple who were walk-ins was able to get a room at a cheaper price than what was quoted to us online. While we were finally able to get a room with a king-sized bed, the aggrevation of securing it as well as hearing that someone else got a cheaper rate for the night irritated us even more. Although our room was fairly clean and roomy, it was such a big disappointment in that the room and furnishings were old and smacked of cheapness! The wall mounted night stand was about 3 feet from the bed. The \"nightstand\" on the other side of the bed was more like a built in shelf about a foot off the ground and again several feet away from the bed. The bathroom was ok but as much as we tried to situate the shower curtain, water still leaked onto the floor when taking a shower. Even the showerhead couldn't be ointed more towards the inside wall of the tub area probably because it was frozen from the stuck-on lime and gunk of the old shower fixture! We had the breakfast buffet which was marginally acceptable with various selections of average quality food. The only saving grace of the hotel was the exceptional hawker stands across the street on the same side of the street as the Civil Service facility.

We also knew that the hotel was far from the city. But we didn't realize just how long it would take to go to and fro. The hotel shuttle was free and really helped.

I moved to the hotel from downtown because I wanted some chill time before my flight, and to be close to the airport so as to minimise transit time. Getting to the hotel from downtown Singapore cost me about 19 SGD and took 20-25 minutes on a day with little traffic. The other option would be to take the MRT to the airport and then take the shuttle bus to the hotel, but I didn\u2019t want to spend ages transferring with my heavy luggage, especially because the downtown MRT gets pretty crowded. Check-in at the hotel was easy and pleasant, with very friendly check-in staff: in general, service at the hotel was definitely gracious and with a smile, which was welcome. The first room I was assigned was on a non-smoking floor, but reeked of smoke, so I requested to be assigned another room, and this was done quickly \u2013 in a few minutes I was in a new (smoke-free) room. The room I was given was very pleasant, of a good size, modern, and spotlessly clean. The bed was comfortable and the sheets were of good quality cotton. The room came with a small sofa alcove and a good-sized writing desk, with a wall-length window. The usual amenities were present \u2013 coffee and tea, minibar, slippers, shampoos and toiletries \u2013 but no shaving kit, which was surprising. The bathroom was also of a good size, very modern and clean. It featured a bathtub with a showerhead for the bath, and a \u2018rainforest shower\u2019 from the ceiling. My two gripes with the bathroom was the floor was very slippery when wet, and there was no bath mat to prevent slipping in the bathtub; and secondly, there was a window right next to the bath, which is great if you\u2019re having a shower or bath alone, but you can also see the toilet from the room if you look through the window, and if you had a spouse in the bedroom he/she could see the more unpleasant things one does in the bathroom! There is, of course, a blind too, which can be lowered in this eventuality. For me, one of the best features of this hotel is the rooftop pool. The pool was clean and with good views of the sea and of planes on final approach into the airport \u2013 however, the hotel is far enough away that there was no noise from the planes when I was swimming in the pool. I did not try the gym facilities, but looked at the gym and it looked modern and clean. One of the other good features of this hotel is the range of food options nearby \u2013 if you walk out of the hotel and to the right, there are several restaurants serving anything from Malay and Chinese to Western and pan-Asian food, and there are also some bars (but watch out \u2013 expect to pay a sky-high 9 SGD for a glass of beer or a glass of wine in these places, before tax and service charge). The only downside to the Changi Village Hotel was its connection to the airport \u2013 this should be one of the hotel\u2019s strong points, but the truth of it is, this place does not make much of an effort with regards to business travellers. Why? Here are the reasons: 1. The airport shuttle only runs hourly, which is poor for a hotel so close to the airport; 2. As other reviewers have pointed out, there is no shuttle service between 2 and 4am, which is not good for those who fly out on the many early morning flights available at the airport. However, it is easy enough to book yourself a cab \u2013 the desk is happy to do this and to call you when the cab has arrived. 3. The shuttle bus only goes to terminals 1 and 2, not terminal 3, which is inconvenient. 4. The shuttle service is inflexible on timings.

Although the check-in clerk was great and hailed me a cab, helping me also with luggage, I would have expected some customer service by the shuttle and not the explanation I was given (I was told that \u2018shuttles leave on time here\u2019), which sounded somewhat patronising.

So i inform the counter that i did not receive my fruit basket during check out and all he said was sorry bout that. Thats all?????

It was a long checkin at the counter i think the staff is new as he was being coached by another staff.

The hotel runs a free shuttle bus to and from Changi Terminals 1 & 2 to the hotel so we didn't have to queue up for a taxi after our late arrival. The short bus ride and the quick checkin about 10pm was most welcome. The room was clean & neat if not overly large, and as it faced the airport there was a bit of aircraft noise but not enough to prevent a good nights rest. Checkout the following day was just as efficient followed by the free shuttle back to the airport. On our second visit we arrived early in the monring after an overnight flight from India. Due to previous e-mail correspondence with the front office manager Hairul Bin Anis checkin staff we aware of our need for early checkin. Initially, the only room available was a smoking room which we declined. Fortunately another room became available but was one designed for a disabled person. After a long overnight fight without much sleep we didn't care as long as we could get some sleep and have a shower. Later that day my wife used the roof top swimming pool but couldn't remember our room number. When she attended the lobby the staff told her the room number, but then apologised saying that the disabled room was not really suitable for able bodied guests. Within 30 minutes we were moved a luxurious corner room which was nearly twice the size. I had noticed some of the negative comments posted about this hotel on Trip Advisor before booking it for two nights, I don't regret my decision for doing so. For us it was perfect as we didn't want to stay in the city and wanted something better than the transit hotels at the airport.

I had some reservations on booking a hotel with some pretty nasty reviews posted on TripAdvisor. Glad to say, our worries were unfounded! The decor of the hotel is nice and modern, while not being garishly trendy. The facility was up kept nicely and the room was extremely clean, although some furnishing were a little worn out. We weren't expecting a five star facility and this suited our needs perfectly. We didn't eat in the hotel, as there was a local food court less than a hundred meters from the entrance. The food there was much better, in my opinion, than what you can find in the hotel's restaurant (to each his own). The food court (hawker centre) opens at 5:30 AM in the morning, so you can get chow as pretty early in the morning to fuel the excursions into the downtown area. A point of contention with the rest of the reviewers is regarding the airport shuttle. It did its job admirably and took us to the Changi Airport T3 for the underground MRT ride to the rest of the country. The MRT ride is about 20 minutes, although it can get steadily more and more crowded as people are picked up along the way, so grab on to a seat and stick to it! The pool area is nice and is a great way to unwind after a tiresome day exploring the country. Overall, my impression with Changi Village is extremely positive and will unhesitatingly recommend it to anyone who wouldn't mind a short minibus and MRT hop into the city. Cheers! The staff, while being -moderately- indifferent to guests (somewhat expected in most hotels world wide) are ultimately helpful when you get their attention.

The air-con is way too cold even when set to 30 degrees. You can turn it off though, yet it comes on again when you remove the room key from it's slot near the door. Leave a key in there to ensure your room is not an ice-box upon return. Walls are paper-thin, and neighbour's conversations, door closings, crying babies etc are all clearly audible making for a poor night's sleep. Bring earplugs. Swimming pool: The hotel's best feature, boasting a shallow wading pool, 25m or so swimming length in the main pool, a spa section and wonderful 8th floor easterly views over the straights of Malacca, with the passing ships, islands and beach. For the transit passenger this pool really provides ample opportunity to unwind the muscles and catch some sunshine to help adjust to a new time-zone. The pool is sunnier in the morning, more shaded in the afternoon, and the water is tropically warm. Breakfast: A good mix of local dishes, international staples, pastries, fresh fruit and omelettes. It is well worth the price, but won't win any Michelin stars. The tea was nice. Location: Great to get away from it all for a relax. Nowhere near the city, 20mins driving time to the airport, it is an escape rather than a place to base yourself for any other activities. The local food (Hawker) centre and some great restaurants on the main road will keep any serious foodie happy enough, for a fraction of the cost of the hotel's restaurants.

There was not a single decoration the walls either, just this dirty yellow paint. The hotel is huge so the room was extremely far from the elevator. I went back down to the desk and told them that I would not stay in the room. They apologised and gave me another room (5th floor). I also asked about the internet and they said they would wave the fee for my inconvenience (27$ US/ 24h). Apparently they had up graded me to a suite. The room was the size of a normal room, nothing special. It did have a nice big tub and a walk in shower, and the room looked cleaner. Don\u2019t make a decision on what you first see. Turns out the tub faucet did not work (could have filled it using the little shower head but that would have taken hours). The internet was so slow I could not get my e-mails to load. Still no decorations on the walls the same yellow paint that need to be redone. The carpet needed to be cleaned, and it turns out there were these little bugs walking on the work desk. There was a nice big TV in the room; unfortunately there where only a few channels and they had so much snow on them that it made it hard to watch. For some reason, the toilet would flush by itself every 10 minutes or so. That is above the sound of the planes flying over head every few minutes (in the direct flight path of the airport). When I checked out (5:45am) I told them that I had not been able to get the internet to work and that the tub faucet did not work. I also told her about the bugs walking on the work station. She told me that I just did not know how to use the tub. As far as I know it should not be hard, turn the knob and the water comes out? No matter what I tried it would not work. She said they could not be held responsible for the speed of the internet (why not, considering the price it should be able to load e-mails). She told me that she had never heard of there being bug in the hotel and maybe I had been mistaken. Trust me there was no mistake. She did tell me that she would inform somebody so they could fix the problem for the next guest. That did nothing to help me.

On arrival I was put into a non smoking room that smelt strongly of smoke. I had to be moved. When i arrived back to the room at the end of the day, i found the internet connection did not work.

The next morning, i called the service hot line to ask them to look at it during the day but on each occasion it was busy (and for the next 10 minutes). I stopped by the desk on my way to work to ask someone to look at it but was told that it could only be looked at if i was in the room. I mentioned that it didn't seem to be related to my laptop but still no change in the approach. When i returned that evening, the internet connect was not working so asked them to take a look. Another cable change!!! Finally they say that there appears to be a problem with the physical connection in the wall and that they would need to send someone up to do some maintenance. Why couldn't this have been done during the day whilst I was out, I ask? blank responses. I told them not to worry. What else? Too many other things to list but things like there being no remote in the room for the TV so i had to ring down to get one sent up. The people in the room next to me (an interconnecting with the door locked) must have been smoking because during the night the smell of cigarette smoke wafting in. My perception is that there is no-one managing this hotel. To the guest, it appears as though the staff are completely unsupervised.

The rooms are set around an open courtyard, enhancing the light and the airiness. Our room faced the sea, was quite large and was well appointed. Check in was quick and easy as we had prepaid for the room. This is a quiet hotel, used mainly, it seemed to us, by business people. The location of the hotel is near many restaurants and a food court. As well the trail along the shore is easily accessed for nice walks. The hotel pool, located on the roof, is inviting, very clean and cool in the Singapore heat. It would take about one hour to go into Singapore city.

The staff were very busy even though there weren't many people in the line and we waited for quite a while. We were taken to our room where our access cards did not work. The porter said he would get them fixed so we tipped him for his assistance even though we knew we were going to get the 10% service charge anyway. He disappeared with our access cards & never returned. We then decided to go downstairs and get new cards & go for lunch as well. The porter was seen standing outside chatting to his buddies. The lady @ reception had no idea about the cards and she reissued us with a new set. We asked her whether the restaurant was open and she confirmed it was. At the restaurant waiters kept walking past us as if they could not see us as we waited to be seated until I stared one down. She asked whether we would mind ordering ala carte as the buffet was not open. We had no problem with that. They then seated us at the bar , gave us 2 nasty looking drinks menus and left. 25 minutes later, no one had arrived to take our order. We left the restaurant & went up to our room to order room service. On the first attempt, the person put the phone down in my ear. At the second attempt I was told that they were just too busy and I should call back to order later. We decided to take our business elsewhere and took a walk down the road to Subway. The hotel also offered a free shuttle service to the airport which was a hair raising ride with the driver taking corners at break neck speeds. On reaching the airport we found that the service charge of 10% did not include common courtesy of assisting passengers with luggage or wishing them well on their journey.

Hotels were charging treble so it made sense. Hard to find and taxi got lost. This is becase side street. From outside ok and staff rushed to help. When walked in very low light and everything smell like disinfectant. Staff were friendly. Sign in simple then up escalator to room. Well i say room it was more cupboard, but hk same so no problem. Boyfriend angry because internet very very bad. Very slow and he booked for this. Bathroom old and water leaking on floor. and bed lumpy. Ac was good. Hard to sleep as could hear ac from outside wall. Breakfast was not good and we only ate their once. But staff again nice. We complained and most things fixed next night. SO staff good but hotel need remaking or star reduxtion Area was good. Across road little spa- miss Amee, she give good massage and was quite relaxing. I walked round area and Wow. So different from Singapore centre where i was many times. Its like being in India(or how i imagine) Everywhere indian shops restarants,gold shops, silk shops -the smell of incense the music and all the people-really really cool. And not small area was very many streets. I ate in food court and food was great but little spicy for me. And i went to hindu temple but this was same as everywhere. Was nice to see though. Singapore central is big shiny buildings and everything new and modern -but here so so differant I really reccomend looking and seeing.

Our twin room was a comfortable size with two double beds - took a while to work out the lighting but once we had we were set. The wardrobe space was ample, as was the room's seating, the bathroom with tub/shower was sparklingly clean and modern. The restaurant/breakfast room is spacious and the variety of food available is more than you could hope for. We enjoyed a buffet dinner on our last night - ask the dinner staff (some of whom are the chefs) what there is and you will find even more than what you are seeing - we would have stayed just to eat here each night (give your room number to receive a discount on check-out). TIP: try a spoonful/small taste of everything - you won't be sorry!! Enjoy a coffee and a snack in the cafe or a drink in the bar. Business groups and seminars are also catered for. The top of the building houses a health spa and gym and the open air pool and spa has a view to the ocean.

Bedroom was a little on the small side but we were, overall, pleasently, surprised (especially after reading some of the previous tripadvisor reviews). Was a little annoyed that my request for an extra bed (at extra charge) had been overlooked. Reception staff looked almost surprised when I pointed out that we had asked for this - despite it being on my booking confirmation but I was assured that the bed would be set up while we were having our evening meal. Ate from the buffet in the hotel (daughter too tired to venture out!) & have to say it was excellent - good choices, piping hot with dishes constantly refreshed. I note the negative comments re the buffet but we had no complaints (and we are very 'picky' when it comes to food). It was very early, however, so maybe the standards drop later in the evening - I don't know. So far so good. The rest, I'm afraid, is a sorry tale - the extra bed for my daughter turned out to be a complete waste of time as it was so uncomfortable that she actually woke in the middle of the night in pain (we took the sheets off and found an old folding bed with a worn mattress which you could feel every spring through - including some rather nasty sharp points). To cut a long story short we ended up having an almighty row with the young girl at reception the next morning when we asked her to take the cost of the bed from our bill as we were unable to use it. I won't go into details except to say that 'customer service' does not figure here!!!

Second, breakfast at the coffeehouse at the lobby was horrid, having no seats as the place was full of screaming kids and families. It made me wonder why i bothered to pay extra in the first place.

Not far from Changi Airport, it is far removed from the bright lights of the city. There is no MRT station nearby, which means those who want to go shopping in the city need to take a taxi or depend on the bus service. It is the only hotel in Changi village, which is an enclave of Singapore that seems to be wilfully sundered from the rest of the island, not physically but metaphorically. It seems like the shiny development projects that have engulfed most of Singapore have stopped at the threshold of this village. The hotel is a modern structure and really quite out of place in what is otherwise - for Singapore - a fairly quaint setting. An earlier incarnation endowed the hotel with coloured balconies, so that is one of the first things you notice - these pastel coloured glass balconies, as if some artist once passed through here and had a benign hangover when he was decorating the hotel. There are lovely old trees around the hotel. In fact it exudes an atmosphere of peace and quiet, and the verdant surroundings are somewhat at odds with the structure itself. I think the hotel had some problems in trying to characterise themselves, but it now comes across as a contemporary business hotel where it may once have favoured itself as a retreat of sorts. The rooms are done in the sort of pale-wood decor with pretenstions to avant-garde, such as a glass window between the bathroom and the main bedroom, and wicker-lampshades. Overall, the effect is not harmonious. Otherwise the room is quite comfortable if entirely too cold, even with the airconditioning turned off! The gym on the 5th floor is better equipped than you'd expect, but there are too many signs of inconsistent maintenance around the hotel. One of these are the dead plants that coil around wire frames in the inner courtyard, another is chipped paint on some of the feature walls in the lift lobbies. In other ways though, the hotel does distinguish itself; the swimming pool has a glass side and chic patterned blue tiles; the main lounge has sunlight filtering into it from glass panels overhead and the view from the glass-panelled elevators of the overall atrium is cosy, if not impressive. This is a nice hotel to come to to get away from the city, for a retreat of sorts. I think the hotel may have gone through several incarnations, ending up with an odd blend of the mediocre and quite classy, so it's difficult to place it in terms of a star-rating or even of a consistent purpose. Around it is the delightful, or terribly quotidian, depending on your inclination, village itself, with a wet market, shophouse restaurants selling inexpensive food. Nearby are holiday bungalows of the civil service, which goes some way to explain why Changi Village is what it is, and the beach, and an impressive (for Singapore) wooded area, that you quickly realise is an isolated tract preserved to provide the setting to the holiday chalets where Singapore's presumably frazzled civil servants come to unwind. The Changi board walk, which hugs the beach, is a welcome, if entirely too short, distraction, but here, at the Changi Village hotel, it is possible, if for a short while, to forget the burgeoning pressures of 21st century city living.", "Date": "July 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201cMinimalist gone mad\u201d", "Author": "A_TravellerAdelaide", "ReviewID": "UR8224177", "Content": "I stayed at the Changi village hotel for one night en route from the US to Australia.

Yes - it is quite a drive from the airport! When you look at a map, it is close, and in fact you can hear the airplanes taking off! However, the drive is quite long because it appears that while it is close to the airport, the roads to/from the terminal buildings are long - partly on the highway and partly on surface roads. From the airport to the hotel it was 15 minutes, about 12 minutes on the way back. For comparison, a trip from the airport to Suntec City (stayed in that neighborhood a few days prior) was only 15 minutes. The key benefit of the Changi Village, then, compared to those hotels closer to the CBD and tourist areas, is the free shuttle. I was lucky in that I arrived at the information counter about 15-20 minutes before the shuttle arrived, however keep in mind that there is only one shuttle an hour. It leaves from the hotel at the top of the hour, and I guess there really isn't a set time for when the shuttle leaves the airport (my shuttle left ~40 minutes past the hour).

So, we get up to our room, he has put us across from the maid's room! Early the next morning all we here is banging and talking. Probably the noisiest room he could have given us in the whole hotel. The 'free mini bar' consisted of two soft drinks, two beers and a chocolate bar. Wow! Are they kidding? We open our curtains to take a look at our 'nice view' and much to my dismay, he has given us a room looking directly at the tops of the trees! The ocean views were definitely not visable from our room. This guy was an absolute jerk. The next morning, having been woken up at the crack of dawn by the maids banging and crashing, we head down to breakfast. We were not even offered tea and coffee, and when we finally asked for some tea, the water was stone cold. The 'hot' food on the buffet was also cold. The miso soup was as cold as a glass of icy water. Total nightmare. Such a disapointing way to end our amazing holiday. One plus, is that the hotel has been recently renovated and was quite tastefully done. The rooms are definitely not worth $315! I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "June 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cgood option in between flights\u201d", "Author": "J0ey", "ReviewID": "UR7831585", "Content": "This hotel is a good option if you are stopping over in Singapore in between flights.

The reception staff were friendly and efficient and we were able to check in and arrange a wake up call without any delays. We arrived late at night however there seemed to be plenty of activity in near by restaurants and food stalls. The room was modern in design although a little on the small side. This was not a problem as we checked in late and departed very early in the morning. I was pleasantly surprised by the modern bathroom which was clean and well stocked with toiletries and plenty of towels. The only unusual thing was the glass window between the bathroom and the bedroom ! I am not sure what purpose it served however you have the option to pull down a blind if you want to prevent anyone in the bedroom watching you using the bathroom or shower ! Overall our short stay at this hotel was a pleasant experience. Check in and check out was handled smoothly (which is important if you have a flight to catch) and it was easy to obtain a taxi back to the airport. Don't stay here if you are staying in Singapore for more than a night, this hotel is in a residential area and there are many more reasonably priced hotels in the city (which is really where you would want to be if you are a tourist).

Changi Village doesn't have much going for it and in some ways resembles a 70's housing scheme rather than a village. However, try Charlies Corner for a huge selection of international beers and Jacobs Cafe for decent food, both just a stroll from the hotel. The hotel itself was great with incredibly friendly staff and pleasant rooms. The public areas were very impressive and stylish for an out of town hotel. There are two very nice pools, one on the roof which is great to watch the planes coming into the airport. We had this pool to ourselves for most of the afternoon. Breakfast was fine and the free shuttle to the airport was an added bonus. Our only criticism was that we booked an upgraded room on the internet but on return, having looked at their website again, I think we just got a standard room. Since we were only there one night we didn't bother complaining.

A truly massive bathtub, easily can fit two(!), seperate rainforest shower, double sinks etc. The hotel has an lovely rooftop pool - where relaxing and staring at the sea can be combined with plane watching (better than it sounds). Gym is not bad - serves its purpose well enough for a short stay. There is a superb value Japanese restaurant on the ground floor. Otherwise plenty of cheap eats to be had in Changi Village itself.

The room is bright and airy and so is the bathroom. One thing about the bathtub and you try to take a shower standing up.

I was dropped off by my client just after midnight after over 21 hrs in flights in 24 hours. So, coming through the front doors of the hotel it was wonderful to be greeted by such friendly front desk staff. The room was very neat, clean and up to-date. I very much enjoyed being able to control the A/C with three fan speeds and a very large temperature range from warm through cool to near freezer temps. The complimentary bottled water in the room was a nice touch. In 35C heat bottled water for day trips is a must to take with you. The out door pool on the roof top has to have one of the most stunning of any hotel I've stayed at. The outdoor pool on the ground floor with a glass side is a great to swim in and visually stunning later in the evening while enjoying the out door dining and BBQ. Plus the quite garden on the sixth floor with the pond, fish and trees is great place to start your day during sunrise. Then there is the staff! Yasmin on the front desk is so professional and upbeat to deal with, Gerald in food and beverage and his team provide a wide selection of food types at ever meal for the buffet. The hostess (with the mostest~ as I teased her) is first rate with her uplifting hello every day and after only twice knew my name! If I could only extend the same back to her. The gentlemen on the front door helped me effortlessly unload and reload my clients printing supplies (more than once) with nothing but sincere smiles and upbeat attitudes. Others on this site have talked about how far away it is from the airport. They offer a free shuttle service to and from the airport on the hour. Not fast enough? For less than $15.00 S$ $ you can take a cab to the hotel. Then there is the it's a long way to downtown. Well every major US city and most major Canadian cities I've stayed at are not only $16.50 to the downtown Singapore city core for this quality of stay. Plus your only minutes from the beach, the famous Changi Prison museum, several outdoor restaurants, a cotton and silk clothing merchant just down the road where for less than $ 200.00 S dollars I brought home several great gifts pieces for my spouse, mother and nieces. In all the Changi Village in Singapore offered a very fair price, excellent food and beverage service and product, and I had a great staff experience in all sectors of the hotel.

Hotels.com website misleads you in believing this hotel is close to Orchard Rochard but in actuality they are miles away in a very inconvenient location. They apparently have another property (associated with the Le Meridien?) which is close to Orchard Road but that is not this hotel. You may feel this hotel is a good deal but the inconvenience of getting to and fro is NOT at all worth it. You can pay S$ 20-40 more and get a lovely hotel on Orchard Road itself. If your plan is to just spend some time in a hotel I would recommend this hotel. If your plans are to visit town and get around Singapore I would not stay at this hotel at all. You can get around easier by taxi but the cost will offset any savings on hotel price. It takes 40-60 minutes each way (no joke) to get to Orchard Road or anywhere around town by MRT and or bus. The hotel otherwise is very nice and the staff are extremely helpful. The rooftop pool is lovely with a gorgeous panaromic view. The overall hotel, the rooms and bathrooms are very new and would appeal to anybody. But their way-off location negates these other positives. If you are used to eating at small but yummy \"hawker-style\" restaurants in South East Asia, there is a strip of restaurants right next door. We love most Asian food and loved the food here. It is truly open 24 hours. The hotel is located in a residential area and as with most places in S'pore it appeared safe. The hotel's free shuttle to the airport was helpful.

I don't know if it was because of the change in management, but we have never had so many problems with a hotel. The only good thing is we were upgraded to a better room than we paid for and had a nice view of the water. But the key cards are incredibly sensitive, and at different times we had to pull the key card out really fast and another time had to pull it out really slow for it to work. We saw lots of other travelers struggling to get into their rooms. Also, the rooms are very high tech but as a result it was frustrating to try to figure out how things worked when we were in a daze from traveling. For instance, the shower was unlike any shower we have ever seen, and an errant twist of the faucet left my husband simultaneously scalded and freezing (from different showerheads), and if you hit the wrong light switch in the middle of the night, a whole chorus of clicking sounds and lights goes off which is quite disconcerting to the person remaining in bed! Also, trying to get a drink at the bar proved to be an exercise in frustration because there were two brand-new, albeit well meaning bartenders who were overwhelmed even though there were hardly any customers.
