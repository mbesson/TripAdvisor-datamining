Check in was efficient and the room assigned (404) was perfect for the two of us. Rooms were clean and well maintained. The only issue I had was with the shower - being American I still can't get used to the half glass shower curtain - had same type when in Paris last year. Perhaps I just need to get used to it. The hotel was perfectly situated in Sultanahmet and was a quick 5 minute walk to change currency, the Blue Mosque and other attractions. There's a 'restaurant row' just a block from the hotel which is where we ate every night. A great, great place filled with great restaurants. The breakfast by the hotel was decent.

Rooms are clean and spacios enough (I think the room sizes are comparable to ones in 3* hotels in US). Other neighboring hotels I checked had rooms equal or smaller by size. I have two complains though. First, a refrigerator in my room did not work, and it was not fixed during my stay for 10 days in that room. I need to say I did not insist on fixing though. Second, sound isolation is not up to par. If your neighbour is noisy you might feel involved in their activity. Room and hotel service is pretty good. Personal is very friendly and ready to help. There are several people I wanted to say \"thanks\" for making my stay a pleasant experience: two pals by the same name Ugur, receptionists Guzin and Okan.

A lot of fruit, burek (we loved it) and biscuits and jams. For us, a good coffee in a foreign country is essential to begin the day. Deluxe rooms with ottoman style furniture are useless, unless a service at the same level. One point: we booked a double room trough Venere, then I wrote directly to the manager to ask for a twin bed room. He repleid I will be given the kind of room I have booked trhrough Internet. Than I call to delete my reservation, becouse I wasn't satisfied of the answer of the manager. I was told by a receptionist that the boss wasn't in the office, but.. After a few seconds I received a new email, confirming a twinbed room. At the check in, no twinbed room, but free upgrade to topfloor room with jacuzzi. The day after, I was told the bathroom was broken, so myroom should be changed to a superior room (standard one). Obviously, no twinbed room available. Again. In conclusion, the hotel is nice and cosy, the people worlking there are friendly, smiling and professional. But: what the hell you are doing with guest preferences? To give the topfloor room with jacuzzi just for the first night sounds like a bad trick, that is to be said. Change room is always disappointing for guests.

Firstly, the location is excellent...a five minute walk to the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofya, the Grand Bizarre, the tram, a number of fantastic restaurants and Turkish baths, and also within very easy reach of the Bosphorous Sea. In fact, the bridge that connects the European side of Istanbul to the Asian side is a twenty minute walk tops (although the tram will get you there in five). I'm very widely travelled, and have stayed at hotels in Asia, Australia, the United States, and all over Europe. I can honestly say that the staff at the Sumengen Hotel are some of the friendliest I have ever met. The level of customer service is what you would expect to receive in a 5* plus hotel. The manager, Okan, couldn't do enough to ensure that my stay was comfortable and pleasant. He's very professional, and his attitude filters down to his staff. The porter, Ugur, is that enthusiastic about customer satisfaction that he really should go into management. The receptionist was lovely. I was literally gobsmacked when I was showed to my room.......the standard is 5*, easily. The bed was super-comfortable, the decorations and furnishing luxurious, and the bathroom even had heated floor tiles. It really was the last word in comfort. Quiet and clean, and guaranteed to provide a sound nights sleep (most important! ). The hotels restaurant provides an incredible buffet-style breakfast....you name it, they've got it. Scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, omlettes, cooked meats, yoghurts, fruit, cereals, fish, pastries and cakes, coffee and a variety of teas, ......the list goes on. You can eat as much as you want, and the food never runs out....the chef always pops in every five minutes to replenish the buffet. To close, don't even consider going to another hotel if you are staying in the Sultanhamet district.......you WILL NOT find a better deal than this......that's a promise.", "Date": "January 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fabriano, Italy", "Title": "\u201cThank you very much\u201d", "Author": "ricugoli", "ReviewID": "UR92405461", "Content": "With my family we stayed in this hotel from December 27 to January 1.

The first thing we noticed when we reach the hotel was how closed it is to attractions like Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia, which are minutes away on foot. The lobby though small was lovely decorated and had a welcoming feel. We were received by Burhan who really made our stay there a memorable experience. He helped us with our queries about Istanbul which was really useful. As the hotel is on a hill and the entrance is on upper side, the lobby is on the 5th floor while our rooms are on the 2nd, as were most of the other rooms. If this is weird to you then you may want to find another hotel. Also, senior citizen may have problems climbing up and down the slope if they intend to explore the area by foot. Our superior rooms was not huge but there's enough space for the two of us without feeling squeezy. My wife love the looks of the room with its furnishing and decorations. Bathroom is pretty normal and comes with a bathtub. The window faces a small garden surrounded by other buildings. One of them was under renovation which kind of spoils the overall nice view. It may not be fantastic but better than facing a vent or something. What matters most is that the rooms are clean and we didn't feel icky throughout our stay. There's a pretty fast wireless Internet access if you bring your mobile devices along or you can use the common PC in the lobby. They also have cake and lovely fruity tea on the house every evening at the lobby which we use to chat with Burhan through the night. The breakfast on the terrace with its view is just lovely and became the motivation for us to not skip it even though we would love to sleep through the morning after a tiring day before. We were glad that they had an English breakfast spread, which was good by the way, as we can be adventurous with Turkish food on our own. I would definitely come back again unless I found another better deal. Great service, nice staff, clean room and location makes it a no brainer. I have one complaint though.

This neighborhood is packed full of hotels, and after spending an afternoon with my husband exploring the neighborhood and many of it's hotels while trying to decide where to stay, we chose Sumengen because its friendly staff, newly renovated rooms and welcoming atmosphere stood out well above the rest. The rooms are very pretty, spacious and clean with modern bathrooms featuring blue Turkish tiles. I have stayed in rooms on the front and back of the hotel and never been bothered by street noise or neighboring rooms. The service at this hotel is exceptional, the manager, Ibrahim, went well out of his way to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed during each stay. The staff at the front desk were always helpful too, even speaking to taxi drivers over the phone when I needed help getting back to the hotel at night and giving directions or looking up ferry boat schedules when we needed help. Turkish hotels typically supply a breakfast spread, but they are not always very good. At Sumengen the breakfast was plentiful and always fresh, and the wait staff willing and ready to bring out more of anything or brew a fresh pot of coffee (even beyond 10:30am when breakfast ends), and to top it all off it is served in a beautiful room overlooking the Bosphorus.

Convenient to walk to the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, Grand Bazaar, etc. -- but bring walking shoes because the entire Sultanahmet area is up and down hills. Hotel is small and clean. Rooms are 'decorated' in Turkish style, not western style. Rooms are comfortable and clean, but none too large. Not all rooms have showers, so to get one that did we took a room that was in the back of the hotel. My wife, to whom bathrooms are important was pleased with it. The fact that our room was in the back of the hotel was in itself was no problem, but there's a tram that runs from something like 6:00 am - 1:00 am, so if you're a light sleeper (and/or if you're not used to city noises) you may be bothered by the noise of the tram. This will be particularly true if you have the windows open. Service was good, but not all hotel staff is as fluent in English as we'd have liked. The Sumengen has a buffet breakfast -- pretty extensive, but mostly unchanging from day to day. Nevertheless, you can certainly eat as large a breakfast as you'd like. Oher than breakfast, there's no restaurant in the hotel itself, but there are plenty in the neighborhood, and there's one at the Obelisk next door -- also a Great Western. There's no spa or massage in the Sumengen either, but -- as with the restaurant -- there is next door. There you can arrange for a Turkish-style massage. There's a computer with Internet access in the lobby that's available for guests' use (at no charge), so you can check your email, etc. Nice.

Topkapi, Aya Sofya, The Blue Mosque, et. al. are all within walking distance. Breakfast is satisfactory with good variety, and the restaurant has a lovely view to the Sea of Marmara. Room cleanliness is excellent in my limited hotel experience, we changed two rooms during our stay and both rooms were squeaky clean. Hotel staff was quite friendly albeit be warned, English language fluency isn't commonplace. On to the negatives: Although we booked the room 3 months in advance and asked for 2 single beds, we weren't provided with such during our first night there. This was more about the hotel being probably at full capacity than negligence, but still, prior notification would be thoughtful. If you are a heavy Internet user, like myself, be warned that Wireless Internet wasn't of any use. At least in the floors we were staying (1st and 4th), we just weren't able to either have a signal of the Hotel SSID (1st floor), or the Access Point was malfunctioning and the Internet connection was constantly being reset (4th). This may or may not be temporary and/or specific to the floors we were staying. That being said, there's a PC at the lobby that may be used which has wired Internet access and works fine. Finally, Floor numbering isn't what one quite expects. Since the Hotel is built uphill, the 4th floor is actually the ground floor by way of the entrance. So if you're staying at the 1st floor, you're actually going to take the elevator 3 stories DOWN :) Overall, I would recommend this hotel but it would be heavily depended on the needs of the traveller :)", "Date": "March 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Krasnodar, Russia", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel in my holidays\u201d", "Author": "Vitaliyyy", "ReviewID": "UR59790674", "Content": "The Hotel - is very good and staff - very helpful!
