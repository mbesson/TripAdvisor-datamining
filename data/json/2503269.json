What really catches your eyes when you walk into this hotel is the wonderful color scheme. You feel at home. Instantly. Do not forget to visit the restaurant in the evening with the cosy fireplace. We were here in winter time and it was wonderful. With the courtyard and the terrace I can just imagine how nice it must be in the summer time.

They are small, very dark, slightly basic but brand new and comfortable. They have huge mirrors and checked tiles. All in all a nice design, but the ugly corporate looking curtains somewhat ruin the whole look. We paid euro 69 per night for a basic room excluding brekfast - great value! We didn't eat in the hotel, so I cannot comment on the food. The best thing about the hotel is its location on trendy Torstrasse. It might not be the most fashionable end of Tostrasse and there are a few doener and currywurst buden, but art galleries, trendy bars and good restaurants are all within walking distance and the whole area feels less touristy than hackesche hoefe nearby. It surely cannot compete with hotel de rome or soho house in design (both are much more expensive), but it is a great mid price option.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamburg, Germany", "Title": "\u201cA bit too much design and too little common sense!\u201d", "Author": "Joizee_HD", "ReviewID": "UR124794503", "Content": "This is the sister hotel to the Hotel Amano around the corner which I've been to often. It's a bit smaller and a bit more \"boutique\". Without going into a page-long description, it's all kept quite dark with a club/lounge feel to it. Here's what's wrong with this place. It's all about the design and \"making it look good\". Unfortunately too many things missed. First of all, the reception is just two girls sitting at a desk, both with laptops. I was there about a month or two of their opening and staff were not yet up to speed on how everything worked. A bit amateurish considering it wasn't their first day being open. Further, there's only one elevator. If a bunch of people are enroute, you're waiting quite some time for the lift. Construction is still going on in the breakfast/bar/restaurant room. I didn't get a chance to use it all as it was blocked the whole time. The rooms are quite small and not necessarily easy to move around in. The bed is OK and the showers are good. Yet they're squeezed into the room and everything else is cramped. For example, I couldn't even really get at the closet in my room as there was no way to both open and use it without kind of standing on the bed. Really weird that they accepted this layout. I was also on the 4th floor facing the street and did hear quite a bit of noise from the cars. The rooms also have central heating and air conditioning. Unfortunately, you set a temperature you want and every time it drops below this, the fan goes on. It's super annoyingly loud, enough so that it woke me up each time it sprang on. If you're a light sleeper, bring ear plugs. Anyway, it's fairly cheap and the location is perfect if you're in Mitte and meeting up with the start-up crowd (plus free wireless in the room). They're all right there. Subway entrance is a couple steps away too as is a taxi stand. Really easy to travel to and from. Finally, one of the girls at the reception is from the Amano and she went out of her way to cater to my requests after jumping in for the other lady who had no clue. If I just need a place to crash and want to be in the area, I'd come back as the price is right but there are many other hotels right in the area who are now offering similar deals and if you want to actually spend time in the room, I'd recommend something with slightly larger rooms.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prague", "Title": "\u201cReally annoyed!\u201d", "Author": "melinda311", "ReviewID": "UR123864364", "Content": "The Hotel Mani in Berlin was recommended to me highly, and I was surprised that it was only 69 Euros. I arrived and had to stand at the desk a very long time while the Receptionist finished a call. That would have been fine but she didn't even acknowledge me for the longest time. I won't go into specific details about the hotel other than the fact that, if all you care about is feeling like you're in a black and white, stark, design hotel for mini people, then you'll love it. Otherwise, forget about this place! I am so annoyed! They didn't bother to tell us on the internet, or when we made the reservation, that they are under serious construction, men and equipment and the whole nine yards. It was too late and too cold to switch hotels (I'm surprised that Booking.com, the best service of its kind around, gave it such raves). I could only get a room on the 2nd floor because of the construction. And then, when it got really cold outside and I went downstairs to inquire about having food and hot tea brought up to my room, the Receptionist said sorry, we've only got room service 3 days a week because of the construction! HELLO?! I was never told they were under construction or that there would be no room service when I was there. Unbelievably, she told me I could get a warm drink in a MACHINE in the hotel. I let her know how I felt about that, so she helped me tiptoe and tread my way past construction guys and wires, to a hot water machine, where I poured myself some hot water, grabbed a tea bag and came back to my room. BAD BAD BAD STUPID WAY TO DO BUSINESS AS A HOTEL! And thank goodness my husband wasn't with me or we would have been cramped like sardines in this miniscule, stark black and white, checkered hip hotel room!", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Mani", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d2503269-Reviews-Hotel_Mani-Berlin.html", "Price": "$93 - $184*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Torstrasse 136</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10119</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2503269", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/99/70/9970d6ccef2c06e5b3ad9a281bc954db2large.jpg"}}
