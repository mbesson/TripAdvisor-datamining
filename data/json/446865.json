It is located on the outskirts of Barcelona and it takes you a ten minute stroll to the subway and from there you need less than half an hour for Las Ramblas with the red line. We did this every morning and liked it. There's also a big shopping mall right behind the hotel that caters to most of your needs (apparel, food, entertainment). Fortunately, we got a great price for our stay which was the trigger to choose NH La Maquinista. Unfortunately, the friendliness and service wasn't worth neither 3* nor hostel ranking. So we had this broken flush in the restroom which wasn't appropriately fixed (twice). The first day we left for town announcing the problem and by the evening it was solved (so the reception) but it was exactly the same as before. There was no plumber on staff so it could only be fixed by the next day. Was it fixed then? No, it wasn't. Arguing on departure for a recompensation (e.g. free breakfast) for not having a functioning restroom (basic necessity) all we got was a free drink at the hotel bar and late check-out (after half an hour of discussion). You could notice staff on duty was really offended and they didn't take us seriously because we weren't the regular customers but rather young. The motto was: Cust..., err, employee first! Further advice: - Don't take the breakfast here. It is way too overpriced. Instead, go to shopping center. - Don't necessarily use the hotel parking (13\u20ac/d?) but park on the street - Ask for free 1h WLAN codes at reception - Ask for room to the front, back view is just concrete, walls and exit ramps", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worthing, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cReally nice hotel, third time back there\u201d", "Author": "hairycelt", "ReviewID": "UR117598676", "Content": "This hotel is slightly more out of the main city but withing easy reach by the metro which is about a 10min easy walk form the hotel. (35 Euros or there about from the airport ) If you do stay here get a ticket at the metro a T-10 this allows you ten journeys for around 8.45 Euros rather than single trips for 1.45Euros. The station is Sant Andreu to Catalunya in central Barcelona. Right by the hotel is a great shopping mall with all the shops you would find in town as well as a cinema and nice restaurants and coffee houses, so if you had tired feet you can just take it easy doing things more local. One good restaurant to try if you want something a wee bit more special is in Barra Gothica area just off Las Rambalas, its called The Four Cats and is very traditonal Catalan food. But again discovering the back streets yourself you will find many nice lovely restaurants. We are ardent lovers of this City and have been many times.....its great for Gaudi , Picasso and Dali lovers as well as having a beach and other things to do a city to explore. Our hotel was clean and the staff very helpful and the continental breakfast was really nice alot of choice not just a croissant and tea , meat, fruits cereals juices pastries etc, not much spqce for hangin clotes as mainly used as a business hotel but still very very good. Like any city just be careful against pickpockets be street savvy and you will be fine If you love shoping and fashion this a a place to go, but also have fun exploring the sites...

We got to the airport only to discover that our planned hotel was 80 km away from Barcelona, so we had to quickly find something else. Because of the late notice and all, we ended up here at the NH. They got us in last minute (but couldn't get us any better rate than about 170 euros a night, which was terrible, because we already had to pay the cancellation fee for the other hotel even though it wasn't our fault that they lied online about their location) and the front desk staff was friendly and helpful. The food at the hotel was not good. It wasn't terrible, but it was simply not good. Even though there was no private place to check email (we weren't travelling with our laptops), there was a computer with internet available for use at the front desk, and they were very nice about our extended use of it to try to get our mothers to send more money to pay for the room (aren't you glad you aren't a recent college graduate anymore?). The location of the hotel is not ideal for tourists... it's about 9 stops on the very fast and efficient metro to city center, but 9 stops is a lot when you're trying to get in as many museums/parks/churches/pitchers of sangria as possible. At night, the neighborhood it's in can feel a little on the sketchy side, but I never felt as if I were in any real danger. I read a couple of other reviews that mentioned that the area wasn't safe for women. Well, I am a woman, and everything was just fine. In fact, the men in Barcelona were extremely courteous in general. It was the women who were snarky, sometimes to the point of absolute rudeness. There is also a huge mall right behind the hotel, which makes for a lot of teenagers running around nearby, but also was convenient when I needed to buy conditioner (hotels in most of Spain won't provide it). There were some excellent restaurants within walking distance, but you have to explore the side streets and allyways to find them. The room was spacious and had a nice view of the very phallic, multi-colored-at-night tower about a mile or so away. The beds were comfortable and the air conditioner was wonderfully fridgid. The room also had the only TV with British programming we found throughout our Spanish travels. Let me tell you: after two weeks of nothing but television we couldn't understand more than maybe 100 words of, a little CNN coverage of Wimbeldon was very welcome. Unfortunately, I was allergic to one of the cleaning products or air fresheners they used in the rooms, and ended up sleeping on the cold marble floor of the bathroom. This may sound uncomfortable, but I actually slept pretty well - considering the circumstances. The bathroom was large, had a nice big tub to soak in, a bidet and a quiet toilet. Next time, we'll look for something closer, but for a last-minute find, it was acceptable.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berkshire", "Title": "\u201cToo far from Town, walk to Metro not suitable for women\u201d", "Author": "DeeBerkshire", "ReviewID": "UR47400687", "Content": "This hotel is lovely and clean and an ideal business hotel.

The hotel is okay, but it is not suitable for tourists. Please see main points: Location It is supposedly meant to be in the business district, but there are no businesses in view, apart from a car show room and run down flats. It is a 15 minute walk or so to the nearest metro, and 9 metro stops to the main tourist areas - Catalonia Square, La Rambla and the Gothic Quarter. The Hotel Staff I found the staff extremely aloof, rude and unhelpful; particulary on Reception. I spoke a few words in Spanish to them - mainly good morning and good evening, and never received a response let alone a smile. The Rooms The Room we were in was extremely small, but very clean. Our room contained no drawers, so there was no where to store our clothing. we asked for an alternative room with drawers, but said that all the rooms were the same - no storage space. There was a small cupboard where we could store some clothes, but it was sufficient enough for 1 person. The Breakfast The food available for breakfast was of poor quality and unhealthy. There was a choice of cererals - with only full fat milk, pastries, cheesecake, chocolate cake - FOR BREAKFAST. If you aren't fussy and unhealthy this is the place for you. La Maquinista Mall Next to the Hotel there is a mall with an abundance of shops, which was a godsend for us in the evenings. There are places to eat, but no great choice.
