This is by far the WORST hotel I have ever stayed at. The staff was rude, non-accomodating, and unprofessional. They did not have my reservation when we showed up. After much haggling, they gave us a room but surprised us with a 5% deposit that they failed to mention when we booked the hotel. Over the course of our stay, the hotel masseuse kept calling and bothering us about their massage service, while the housekeeping staff failed to provide anything we asked for. When we checked out, they tried to charge us for phone calls we did not make. The room was big, but it wasn't worth all the headaches we had to go through. The hotel was only interested in getting as much money as possible out of their guests, while providing as little service as they can.", "Date": "Apr 3, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR424534847", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "\u95ae\u3125\u773f\u9287\u5c7d\u7c1d\u9287\u52e9\u4ef9\u9287\u6b0d\u20ac?#x201d;   showReview(19160708, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR144927174", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d581877-r19251035-Baoding_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "581877", "Price": "$90"}}
