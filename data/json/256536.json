True the area is more unsavoury than dangerous but criminality is usually comcomitant with these types of locales. They also suffer from neglect by the municipal authorities e.g. the state of the footpaths was lamentable in King's Cross. The street the hotel is on can be noisy and chaotic at night, my sleep was frequently interrupted. This can be countered by earplugs, what a shame the smell of must in the room couldn't so easily be cancelled out. I found reception staff to be rude and unhelpful and breakfast was below average although there is a nice cafe called 'The Fountain' just up the road and the 'Bourbon Hotel' is good for food too. Despite the apparent slew of 'entertainment' options in the area, there actually isn't any decent bar to drink in and we often resorted to bringing off-licence to our room or better still, frequenting cool bars in the Rocks and Harbour Districts. There is a bus that goes from King's Cross down the the Harbour but it can be time consuming during daytime traffic. Try to get a hotel nearer Darling Harbour/The Rocks/Downtown and take a trip to Manly rather than wasting half a day going to the overhyped Bondi Beach", "Date": "May 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cAppaling service\u201d", "Author": "PiaSydney", "ReviewID": "UR30558014", "Content": "The service was appaling.

If you are a budget traveller and you want a SAFE place to stay, this is a place I would recommend. Its in Kings Cross which is in a red light district, but the GOOD side to this is the food. THe food is amazing on Darlinghurst Street. You can get pizza, kebabs, indian food, thai, malaysian, chinese - you name it. And very cheap prices! Best of all, they are open all night. The street has peddlers who ask for money and you might see some red light workers on the streets in the early hours of the morning or late at night but having stayed here twice I had no problems. The views were incredible, the bed although it was old was comfortable and clean. The sheets were clean. I took off the main cover. The bathroom was clean. It came with a table and a basic tv, an alarm clock that worked (this is very important). Overall, for 80 dollars or so and for its central location close to Elizabeth bay and the harbour views to the opera house I would have to say I was satisfied. What more could you ask for on such a cheap price? Seriously you get what you pay for and a little extra here. IF you can handle the fact that the hotel is old 70's style hotel and needs a renovation then you will be most pleased. Sydney hotels this close to the harbour dont come cheap, and I guarantee you that no place, no matter hoe expensive does not come with the range and diversity of food choices as this place. Take a step out of the hotel and you will be amazed. For $10 dollars I got 2 curries, 2 tandoori chickens and 2 slices of pizza. You go anywhere else and you will pay almost $20 dollars for that. Also the hotel is within walking distance of the botanical gardens. I stayed at Manly once, and it required a ferry and a bus and cost me almost 50 dollars return. With regards to safety in Kings Cross - this is my advice for you. The only way you might get into problems is if you actively look for this kind of thing. If you walk down the street at a brisk pace and dont stop like I did, you can avoid any troubles. Hopefully some people out there will be agreeing with me.

My travel agent booked this hotel for us stating it was in the city, close to nearby attractions, and has been given 3 stars. My travel agent has booked many outstanding family friendly hotels in the past, and I thought this would be no exception so I didn't even bother to investigate the details of this hotel. When my family arrived in Sydney in November 2006, we took a taxi to the hotel. The taxi driver asked a few times if the destination was correct as if I had been mistaken. When we arrived I was shocked not only by the location, the local people, but the hotel itself. There were scantily clad women sipping from champagne bottles at 7 am in the morning. Men urinating on the street, and many what seemed to be minors either hung over or strung out. I'm from a small town in Minnesota, and I was not expecting our travel agent to book us into this type of area with my 2 children. My wife freaked out at this scene, but I comforted her and proceeded to check into this \"hotel.\" The front desk person was young and partially dimissive, but not rude. We had asked for 2 double beds and what we got was a large corner type room with a queen bed and a single bed. The room was dank and musty with decor from the early 1980s. The carpets were worn, stained, and in some areas burnt from cigarette butts. The window overlooked the street with the champagne sipping women, and the leather clad strung out men (were they pimps?). The windows would not open, and the air conditioner leaked water which may have explained the musty smell. The bathroom was unclean, the grout was moldy, the toilet soiled not only with urine and faeces but pubic hair as well. I frantically tried to call my travel agent, but she didn't answer. I went downstairs to report the state the room was in, but there were no more rooms with two beds. The receptionist did contact their version of housekeeping and the bathroom situation was partially rectified. Feeling exhausted from the flight I had no energy to look for another hotel that day and my wife and children slipped into the yellow stained sheets of the lumpy queen bed. I was too afraid to let my children attempt to sleep alone in that single bed. We had a decent rest and as it was the evening we thought we should get showered and go for something to eat. My wife was first to shower, and when she used a towel to dry herself there were small black eggs on the towel. I'm not an entemologist so I don't know what kind of eggs they were, but feeling energized I called the Novotel in Darling Harbour and we stayed there instead. And no, I did not receive any refund by leaving early. The Novotel was offering rates for about $55 a day more than this place which is worth it to avoid insect imbued towels.", "Date": "December 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Underwater in California", "Title": "\u201cSydney Slime\u201d", "Author": "scubacap", "ReviewID": "UR6336169", "Content": "We stayed at the Crest Hotel in November 2006, we had a horrible time. The pictures on the web site are nothing like the hotel. This hotel ruined our stay in Sydney. The rooms are awful, smelly, unsanitary and loud. Our entire room was wallpapered, including the ceiling. The wall paper was pealing off the walls and there was severe carpet stains. It looks as the entire floor had water damage. The room smelled of urine, feces, smoke and alcohol. The room was unsafe: exposed wires on the wall, wall sockets and the TV power cord. The air conditioner was very loud, it was like being inside a truck engine. The control was broken and we could not turn it off. But at least the sound of the refrigerator would drown out the A/C, and when that didn't work there was the screams, shouts and yells from the street. We could not close our drapes as the rod was broken. The dead bolt for the adjoining room was missing. We had to pile our suitcases in front of the door so no one would come in. We could not use the bathroom as it was covered in mold and we had brown water. The area outside the hotel is not a family area. There are hookers (legal) several strip shops and live sex shows. Bums (homeless persons) sleeping and peeing on the street. Beggers and street performers (not very good ones). The street party goes on 7 days a week, starts at sundown and goes on until sunrise. The hotel staff was totally discourtesy and refused to help. We could not find another hotel room because of the Billy Joel and U2 Concert, as well as conventions in Sydney. They had no more rooms and knew we couldn't find another room. They just didn't care.

Prior to checking in, our group took a tour of the city. Our bus driver asked us where we were staying. We told him the Crest Hotel. In his fine Australian accent, he says oh you are staying in the \"RED LIGHT DISTRICT\". We all laughed, like he was joking. We finally arrived to the hotel to check in at 8 p.m. Low in behold, our tour bus pulls in front of a the hotel. All of our jaws dropped and said the bus driver was telling us the truth. The street infront of the hotel was full of drug dealers, prostitutes, XXX locations, strip clubs, sex shops, bath and massage houses and and so in and so forth. Once we unloaded the bus, here they come to solicite you. We had to remind everyone to hold and watch there bags. Once we entered the hotel, we were given our keys. One elevator was broken and the two others were slow. The desk crew was young and inexperienced. Once we arrived to our room on the 8th floor and street side, the problem became worst. The windows were open and there were no screens on the windows. Who knows what had could of crawled in. As I lifted the drapes to close the window, the drapery lining fell into my hand. As I look closer I noticed the drapes were falling apart. As they fell apart the dust starts flowing in the air. I thought for sure we had tons of dust mites. As I check the room, next to one of the beds I find an unusual brown substance flowing midway down the wall to the floor. I have never seen anything like it before. My party and I pondered what it could have been. As I looked at the wall and the positioning of the bed, our thoughts came to the conclusion that it was feces left from a romp from the activitites outside. At the same time one of us check the bathroom and there was missing appliances, the doors weren't painted, and the wall paper was falling off the ceiling and the walls. I call the front desk to complain, and they tell me no one is avaliable. Finally I demand a person to come and check the room. They finally come with a dry towel and some water. I had asked them about some disinfectants, but they said they did not have access to any, because housekeeping was gone for the evening. I am finally fed up and go to the front desk. As the elevator doors open I see the other members of my group. Approx 60-70 people. The complaints were enormous. There was one couple who had rat feces in their room. Another who had no bathroom, because their bathroom was out of order. The complaints went endless. The complaints were so enourmous, everyone wanted to check out of the hotel and go to another. Which is impossible at 10 or 11 p.m. at night. We demanded our travel agents to do something. That became diffilcult, because of the agreements sets. So we were stuck for 3 days. During the days we were on city tours, at night we stayed at the hotel just to sleep and have breakfast. The nights were long and noisy. On the 8th floor, with the windows closed, we could hear the howling from the strip clubs, the strippers theme songs, the overly intoxicated yelling, the horn honking coming from the vehicles and taxis, the street bands until 5 or 6 in the morning. In the morning when you look out, you can see the ones who could not make it home, hanging around the shops and the entrances to the metro rail. This story could go on and on.

The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. We had a spacious room with 1 double and 1 single bed for the two of us with a great view of the tower. The hotel was a bit tatty, especially the bathroom where we had a permanent drip, and there was a strange smell in the corridor outside our room, but, apart from those minor details, we were really comfortable and relaxed. We were also glad to make use of the underground parking. The hotel offered a special offer for two people having breakfast which was very good value, but with so many alternatives we only had breakfast once at the hotel. There was a great little pavement cafe next door to a bakery more or less opposite the main doors which served very reasonably priced but delicious food (also a very acceptable claret) where we ate cheaply and often. The main beauty of this hotel is that everything you need is right there. Station, bus stops, supermarket, bars, cafes, restaurants, chemists, massages and most went on until very late so no worries about buying the bits and pieces that got overlooked during all that sightseeing. Kings Cross is the red light district, and there were a number of adult entertainment venues, but the street was well lit and crowded, and as two females of a certain age we can say we felt perfectly safe and unmolested at any time of night. If you are looking for those little extra touches of luxury, I guess you'll be disappointed, but if you're looking for a reasonably priced. lively location with good transport links this could be the hotel for you.

I found a room at a Backpackers in Pitt Street which was like a rabbit warren with what looked like a prison cell with a small bed and no window.

At 10PM I return, to find a very rude desk clerk. I stand there saying, I need a key...he said I have one..I say I don't, that my room was not ready. He brings me an account from the spa bath to say I was there. 'Yes\", I say, 'I was there because the room was not ready and I had to fill in a few hours before going to visit my family\". He is not convinced. I get angry. I ask to see someone about a key. He finally gives me a key for room on second floor. I say I was on 8th before with harbour view. Then I see my luggage still in the foyer tied with a chain. He unlocks the chain, and I stand there. I sayneed help with 3 cases to my room. He says there is nobody to help. I say if you take a bag and I carry 2 to the lift I can manage from there. He says it is not his job. I ask for help to find lift and room and again we have words. He takes me to the lift and it doesn't go. He takes my door card and puts it in lift..I have never seen door card for a lift before. I go up alone and find my room. It is very bleak. Brown with brown bedcover, and small bathroom. I look for view...and I can barely see the bridge. I feel sad. Its not nearly 10.30pm. I go downstairs and tell him I do not wish to stay there. He does not care...I pay for the spa...and I stand there wondering what to do. I walk outside...my luggage is still standing in the foyer... I see a Internet cafe next door, and ask how much. I go and get my luggage and place it by the door and go on Internet and look for another hotel....then my cousin calls to ask how I am and I tell her I have no-where to stay.
