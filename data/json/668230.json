{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great service and clean for the price I was anxious about this hotel. The 2 stars and 40 Euro rate did not bode well. Plus it looks like its trapped in a time warp.And yet its fine for the price and during the current Berlin transport strike, they really surprised us and surpassed the already good service by going the extra mile and taking people to the S Bahn in their cars to save us long walks walks.The rooms are peculiarly dated, but clean and spacious enough. I found the stay comfortable and relaxing and if there hadn't been a strike it would have been conveniently located.I would stay here again.", "Date": "Mar 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR987105340", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "biztravelleragogo"}, {"Content": "Etwas weiter ausserhalb   showReview(14099786, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR285533981", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "spezialist2001"}, {"Content": "Buena relaci\u8d38n calidaz-precio   showReview(11097442, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR643701332", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "REALISTA-100-"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d668230-r14093096-Central_Hotel_Tegel-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "668230", "Price": "$60"}}
