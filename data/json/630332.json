GROSS! DIRTY! YUCK!!! I did book this at a cheap rate, but Expedia had it at about $150. Outside is gross. Right next to a porno shop though--very conveinent. THe girl at check in was a snot. I am a single woman business traveler. I travel ALOT. There is a smarmy guy at the front desk waiting to check in after me. So, she asks my first and last name and has me spell my last name. Then she gives my room # in front of the guy. So, now he has my name, spelling, and room #. There was a DATELINE episode on this! After he checked in, I asked the girl to please give me a new room # as the icky guy knew all my info. SHEW DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE DID WRONG She got RUDE! She said that is the way they are supposed o do it, and how could I know my room # unless she told it to me? HELLO! WRITE IT DOWN LIKE EVERY OTHER HOTEL ON THE PLANET! THw lobby was dark, dirty, and just GROSS. Hallways sick. Smells bad. TV is fuzzy on 9 of 10 channels. Towels are like thin sandpaper. No sheer curtains--just black out curtains or nothinfg. I was afraid to walk barefoot on the carpet. soap and shampoo CHEAP. Linens on cheap bed worn out and cheap. I think like a 4 thread count! Heater was sooooo LOUD!!!!!!!!!!!! Like a train! Lighting is awful in rooms and bathroom. I got back to the hotel at 10 pm and no parking left. I had to ask the snotty front desk girl where to park--whick was the Radisson 2 blocks away. THey could have at least let me know that when I checked in. I was walking around this creepy neighborhood in the dark late at night--but the porn shop patrons were there to protect me. No stairs or elevator in parking garage, so I had to walk the whole stupid garage. In the morning I spoke to the manager about the check in girl and you could just tell she hates her job. And she could care less. I would not even stay here for free. It is like a 1* hotel!!!

Total of 20 watts (OK, maybe 60) in room lamps which made reading impossible. Beds are old and \"queen\" was a full bed. No \"guest services\" guide in room--maybe because there were no guest services to be had? Pool not cleaned/spa with twigs and leaves.

The staff was VERY indifferant and downright unfriendly! I think the owners should have waited til the place was revamped because now it has received so many bad reviews, it will be hard to overcome! Case in point, they ran out of creamer and sweet and low at the coffee area.....I asked if they had anymore and they said their coffee man had not been in lately, I said there was a Safeway 3 blocks away, and they just looked at me, as if to say so what.

I'd definetly stay there again. Hopefully it will still be as affordable after it's caught on, which I'm sure it will. Today so many hotels, restaurants, etc seem to have adopted the McDonald's business model; offerering an adequate, bland, easily replicable product in order to serve the most people at the greatest profit, without offending anyone's sensibilities.
