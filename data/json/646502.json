We were able to walk from and to the train station nearby--as well as to the duomo, the river and the marketplace. The owners are friendly, welcoming and extremely accommodating. The rooms were good, the breakfast delicious, and the owners helpful. They made dinner reservations for us for two nights, and they were both good, moderately-priced restaurants. Everything is within walking distance. A real family atmosphere.
