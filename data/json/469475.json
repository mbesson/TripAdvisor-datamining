{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A great value and location The Suitenhotel Berlin is in a great location right next to the Anhalter Bahnhof S-Bahn station and within walking distance to Potsdamer Platz and Checkpoint Charlie. The rooms are very spacious for Europe, are squeaky clean, and have air conditioning. We did have a room on one of the lower floors facing the street (the hotel vas very booked) but there wasn't very much noise when we closed the window. The reception staff is friendly and helpful. The breakfats area however is rather messy. But it's a free continental breakfast which will hold you over for a few hours.", "Date": "Nov 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR202021175", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Weltreisender77"}, {"Content": "well....
