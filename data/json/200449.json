My wife's aunt, whom we were meeting in Berlin, had stayed at the hotel a number of times, booked the room as an early anniversary present for us. We flew into Berlin and took the train and metro to a stop near the hotel. Although the hotel turned out to be in walking distance to the hotel, the area wasn't particularly pedestrian friendly and the streets entered the area at odd angles making it difficult to navigate on foot to the hotel. The hotel itself was extremely nice and located in a more quiet area nearby. Our room was quite plush and the bathroom was huge--even by American standards. The only criticism I have is that the day we were there, it was unusually hot for Berlin, and the room had no air conditioning; however, when we arrived in our room, the large windows were open and there was a nice-sized fan set up. It turned out that the evening was much cooler and the fan worked great. We did have coffee at the restaurant the day we arrived and had a nice breakfast in the morning. All in all, a pleasant stay.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cumbria UK", "Title": "\u201cAnniversary & reminiscence.

The excellent cleaners who were very quiet until about 0930hrs each day. Everyone within the hotel was just great. Overall - brilliant. Good / excellent clean & spacious rooms at the rear of the hotel were brilliant... There was also a fitness suite & swimming pool .. Would we stay here again = Definitely & likely try another upgrade ...

I was extremely pleased with this hotel. I chose the hotel because I was going to a conference at the nearby ICC, and it was indeed only a short walk away. It's not the closest hotel to the conference centre (that's probably the Ibis), but it's close enough, and I'm sure it's far more comfortable than the Ibis would have been. If you're there to see the sights of Berlin, however, there are probably many better located hotels. The staff get top marks for their attitude. Friendly, professional, and helpful. They spoke excellent English, but only if required. I speak reasonably good German (although it's not perfect, and people can generally tell I'm English by the time I've uttered about 3 words), which is more than adequate to cope with the sort of discussions you have with hotel staff, and I find it quite patronising if people speak back to me in English. They didn't. But they did speak to my colleagues, who don't speak German, in flawless English. That's the way it should be. A nice feature of the hotel is the swimming pool. OK, it's not exactly Olympic sized, but for a hotel this size in a city centre location it was very respectable. Bedrooms were clean and comfortable, with very nicely kitted out bathrooms. My only quibble is that there was no safe in the bedroom, but this is a minor point. No doubt the hotel would have found somewhere secure to stash valuables if I'd had anything of any great importance. Breakfast was fine. A rather limited selection of hot food, but an excellent cold buffet. The sausages in the hot food were very good. The main negative thing to be aware of is that the communual facilities in the hotel are less than you'd usually expect in a 4* hotel. This wasn't a problem for us, because we spend so much time doing things related to the conference we were attending, but if you were expecting to sit in a nice hotel lounge, you'd be disappointed. As far as I could tell, if you wanted to sit with friends or colleagues over a beer, you'd need to do so at a table in the restaurant. But overall, I was very happy with this place, and would definitely stay there again if I were going to another conference at the ICC.", "Date": "March 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "BUTE", "Title": "\u201cBeuatiful breakfast, beuatiful waitress too.\u201d", "Author": "BUTENUDE", "ReviewID": "UR7555536", "Content": "Good, if compact, sauna steam room and exercise area with free apples and German Newspapers.

The room had a nice balcony and mini kitchen. Internet access was only partially working during our stay, but they were getting it fixed. We were too busy to have dinner in the hotel as planned, which we much regretted, and will certainly sample it next time as it looked good and sensibly produced for small numbers.

We had an spacious double room with balcon, confortable bathroom; bathtube and two washing sinks. The room was confortable and relaxing, but the indirect lightening worked out too dark when looking for things in cupboards.
