From our first arrival we were greeted by a very friendly hostess who immediately did her best to try to find us a nicer room than the one that was reserved for us. While the new room was being cleaned she treated us to a complementary cocktail at the bar. When we got a chance to go up to our room (the elevators are wild by the way) we found the minimalist style and use of space to be quaint and attractive. The views of the High Line and the Hudson were breath taking. Although we didn't spend much time in the lounge on the 18th floor it was incredible. Awesome views of both downtown and uptown. It was classy and elegant without being stuffy. We should have stayed awhile but we were meeting guest. Altogether this was a great experience and one I will be looking forward to having again. Make no mistake, The Standard is an ultra hip and ultra chic hotel that may turn you off if you are a little too sensitive and don't get with it. It was fun for us.

I'm a mother to 4 and a country bumpkin. I have labradors, live on a farm and I always seem to trail mud where ever I go. My husband had to go on a business trip to New York and I decided to join him. I saw a Lonely Planet magazine in the News Agent with New York on the cover. So I bought it. The New York they talked about was the rejuvenated meatpacking area and the High Line, a disused suspended railway line that used to service the meat industry and now has been reinvigorated by clever landscaping. Very interesting and away from the hustle and bustle that slightly freaks me out. There are many hotels in the area, but The Standard straddles the High Line! It's so cool and I was worried I would feel out of place. But no, when our taxi turned into the street outside the hotel, we were greeted by a very welcoming and friendly guy. Our check in was effortless and our trip in the lift to our room an experience. Our room was great and cosy, with views over Manhattan and the Hudson River. The mini bar was incredibly well stocked and the toiletries extremely generous and replenished on a daily basis. The Bar on the 18th floor is unmissable and has one of the best views around. A trip to the loo is also a must! Breakfast was really good as well, a good mixture of really healthy, Ok for you and down right unhealthy. Fresh juices!! Sweet waiters and waitresses.

This is for the perpetually un-hip like myself. If someone asks you \"Why is the hotel logo upside down?\" and you first thought IS NOT \"Isn't it obvious?\", then this review is for you. I stayed here for a recent business trip and the first indication that I was out of my element was that I walked around the hotel, not once, but TWICE trying to find the entrance. Eventually, I found it - to spare yourself the trouble, look for the unmarked yellow revolving door. Inside you will find the trappings of a modern, trendy hotel from the stylish lobby to the \"heaven and hell\" montages in the elevator. There is also an attached lounge (nice for a nightcap on those cold winter nights), beer garden and associated restaurant (the Standard Grill). There is a well-equipped gym on the 17th floor with excellent views of the city. My room was on the small side but well organized with a queen bed and room for a small couch and desk (yes, there aren't many outlets but they are there, mostly hidden behind furniture). There is also free Wi-Fi, a must for any business stay. Note the beds tend to be low so take that into account if you are used to a more elevated sleeping experience. Taking a cue from the modern hotels in Europe, the room features an open bathroom that opens right into the main room, I guess for all the voyeurs out there. It did feature a large garden tub which is a welcome addition to any hotel room. Not sure if this is the same in all the rooms but my bathroom area was elevated - if you weren't paying attention you could easily take a header onto the tile floor. Of course, the best feature of the room (and probably the reason you will want to book here) is for the floor to ceiling windows with magnificent views of NY city and the Hudson. NY has an amazing skyline day or night and especially at elevation. Those same windows seem to have attracted some exhibitionists who have performed free but most likely unwelcome \"shows\" to the chagrin of the people strolling along the High Line (this is the park that has been built on an old elevated railway line which cuts through the Standard). However, that practice is now frowned upon as noted by the message from management to be aware of the transparency of the windows. The service here is friendly and unassuming and I would rate that part highly. Things get taken care without much fuss - the rooms getting cleaned and the mini-bar refreshed seemingly on their own. Other reviewers have commented on the lack of access to the club on the top floor. This is true - you can use it before 10pm but afterwards, if you are un-hip like me, you will be turned away at the door. But that's OK - you haven't had an authentic NY experience unless you've been turned away at the door somewhere so check that off your list! So most likely you heard of this hotel since it was recommended by your more trendy friends. You will end up going if you want to experience a stylish hotel in a fashionable neighborhood with incredible views of the city and exceptional service and are willing to be a fish out of water for a wild, noisy, disorienting weekend and mingle with club kids, trendy locals and jet setting European tourists.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami", "Title": "\u201cBusiness stay at the Standard\u201d", "Author": "Sara T", "ReviewID": "UR125079141", "Content": "I have stayed at The Standard in the Meatpacking District several times.

This hotel is completely out of our budget for a reason, they treat you like you're special. The best part is, they make you believe it. We were greeted at their lobby by some of the coolest, good looking and friendly staff I've ever come across. The Standard lobby had an atmosphere that some of New York's best clubs can't even rival. The room was sick. Unbelievable view of the Hudson with an excellent front-row seat of sunsets that fall behind the buildings on the water's edge. The bath was outstanding and a great centerpiece to the room. There are only a few bad things I could say about the room and the hotel, what's up with the toiletries? To throw down that kind of cash, you think you'd get some exotic and extravagant soaps and shampoos to douse yourself with. Bring your own hair tonic, the stock toiletries are way below standard. The restaurants were outstanding. Breakfast at the grill was excellent and very relaxing. The bar next to the lobby seemed to have people 24 hours a day, it was very chill and relaxed. The restaurant behind the grill was very cool, dimly lit with a strong crowd all day and night. The beer hall was way sick. Ping pong tables, a big bar, mess-hall style table layout. Legit. Location, location, location. Right around the hotel is a bunch of boutiquey select shops. The hotel itself sits over the old train tracks converted into a walkway. A quick 5 minute walk north on this and you're at Chelsea Marktet. Train stations are also abundant, I think there were two choices putting you about a 10 minute train ride from anywhere you wanted to get in the city. If you need to do a taxi, you're pretty set too. We got a $25 taxi from the LES and a $60 ride to and from JFK. You're also just a 10 minute walk from the West Village, if you go there, hit up a place called the Spotted Pig. Overall, outstanding stay and a perfect compliment to a trip to the best city in the world. This could be the best hotel we have and may ever stay at. Might have to save up and do it again.

There we can start and end this review - truly stunning.

Accept high floor only....you'll regret it otherwise....just not too high and thus too close to their boom-boom-room (hey, they don't call it that for nothing!). Now the downsides: 2) remember you're booking into a \"party hotel\". It's >SO< party that you can see the razor blade lines in the tabletops from the worshippers-of-charlie who've previously overnighted in your room. Your neighbours arriving from the local chill-out lounges will ensure you hear the continuation of their party, hours after the party is over... 3) the design of the \"wet shower\" will ensure that you, and all of your toiletries, are just that: wet. The sinks were bought on the cheap and don't drain properly. Wait til you see where they put the large screen TV's - smack dead in the middle of your expensive Manhattan skyline view (corner room). There's no exhaust fan in the toilet \"cabin\". That said, whoever purchased the mattresses did well.... 4) \"room service\" lacks the \"service\" - coffee day one, 51 minutes flat and coffee day two was under 48 - so don't plan an early check-out. 5) you can also forget a friendly welcome or special guest services - you need to book at the rooftop bar (no special contingency for hotel guests) and same at the restaurant (albeit there are plenty of restaurants, bars, and nightclubs in the area...see 2 above). The limos from Jersey pull up at all hours of the night and you'll hear the inebriated young Jersey girls on the high floors, as well as the low, too. Yes, all that entertainment from the quiet of your own room. Just don't expect the hotel staff to anticipate that you, too, might want a quiet nights sleep as your principle desire in a \"hotel\". 6) in addition to the expected \"Manhattan drone\" of cars, horns and street-sounds which you'll hear at any NYC hotel, you can look forward to the semi-trucks arriving to the local meatpacking district meat-packers with their annoying \"beep-beep-beep\" reverse warning sirens just prior to the arrival of your neighbours from the after hours club (see 2 above). There are also major construction projects on both the north and south side of the hotel - the west rooms all overlook the westside highway (joy, zoom, joy, siren) and the east rooms are all corners - so there is no escape if you crave silence other than earplugs. 7) I'm boring, you are too....so I'll stop here and let your imagination or high fill in any other details.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "Foodnwinentravel", "ReviewID": "UR122903146", "Content": "Stayed 5 nights after Christmas.

The rooms are smaller than the Gansevoort, but they are newer and quite comfortable (once you get over the fact that your room is exposed to the world via the floor-to-ceiling windows, that is). The bathrooms have glass walled showers that abut the bed and if you're staying here with someone you're quite intimate with, this can be fun. The shower has very good water pressure despite being one of those stupid \"rain shower\" heads. The one problem with the shower is that it is not enclosed so water that sprays off of you or the wall just pools up outside the shower soaking your bath mat. The sink in the bathroom is kind of silly form-over-function-esque but not nearly as foolish as those in the \"Dream Downtown\" rooms. Beds are comfortable, but unfortunately very low to the ground. I despise that trend in hotels. There is a built in \"couch\" and a small table to eat your unbelievably delicious room service on. That is something that should not be overlooked, by the way; the room service. It is the best I've had at any hotel, both in terms of food quality and the service itself. The staff are so nice and are always very prompt. The food, well, it's just incredible for room service. Do yourself a favor and order at least one meal from room service here. You won't regret it. The rooms have giant LG flat screen tvs mounted on the wall with difficult to use remote controls because of some inexplicable delay between the time you push a button when the tv reacts to that command. I have stayed here several times along with several colleagues in different rooms and it's the same for all of us every single time no matter what room we stay in. It's so strange. The front desk must get hundreds of calls a week about this awful inconvenience. The other bad thing about the Standard is the free wi-fi service. It is PAINFULLY slow because they want you pay $20 a day to upgrade to the faster connection. This is extremely frustrating, especially if you need the service for work.

This was my first time staying in the Meat Packing district and I absolutely loved it. About the hotel: --Stayed in a deluxe king, great view of the Hudson and the High Line path, decent size room, floor to wall windows, and huge tub if that is important to you. Also important to note: people can see into your room from down below e.g. windows are not privacy screened / darkened, so don't be thinking you can walk around your room in the buff without curtains drawn. --Top of the Standard: inside the hotel itself, the top floor bar with great views and really good vibe, go there before 9 or 9:30PM as it closes to the public and becomes an exclusive access type venue. --Staff: I had a great experience with the staff, everyone from door men to concierge to receptionist were super helpful and friendly. Although cabs are plentiful around here (there was always a line right outside the lobby waiting to go), the subway is only a couple blocks away. Super easy to get to all the points of interest around Manhattan. But before you venture out, spend some time in the surrounding neighborhood, as it has some great things to see / experience. There are too many to write but here are a few: --The High Line: nice, elevated walk way that was once a railroad line, great vantage points giving you a different view of the West side --Chelsea Market: super cool indoor market with a bunch of shops, primarily food (bakeries, coffee shops, lunch-type places) and grocery. --Shopping: lots of stores for either buying or browsing including Sephora, Diane Von Furstenburg, Vince, Tory Burch, etc.. --Night time restaurants: We ate at one of several seemingly great options, Scarpetta (YUM italian), there is no need to travel far to get good grub, wether you want casual or a bit upscale. Neighboring Chelsea having a ton of great options.

The view is not as good as the rooms' (at least our room). The service is noticeably snobby and different from the other restaurants/bars in the hotel. The waitresses/hostesses are all waif-ish wannabe models waiting to be discovered and not so much interested in clearing tables, taking orders, etc. Also not a very good scene on the night we were there; lots of boys in hooded sweatshirts spending daddy's money. -The people walking the highline park can see in the rooms very clearly. And evidently (from friends with apartment nearby), it is a pastime for nearby residents to sit on their roofs with binoculars. Be warned! -There was construction going on in the floors above us from about 1030am - 430pm each day. We were not told at check-in and heard the details from another guest when my husband and I were talking in the elevator. I expect those kinds of details to be disclosed by the hotel staff. -The elevators are a little strange. Very dark with a photoshop video montage going on loop on two screens.

There was virtually no room for a waste basket in the bathroom and no hooks to hang towels. The room smelled of cigarette smoke. Waste baskets were dirty and the house keeping does just minimal cleanup during the daily cleaning....no wiping soap build up in shower and then some......the cleaning is just a touch up really but for the price you would think it should be more...maybe it's pride but I would make sure all my housekeeping staff really cleaned thoroughly.

We first stayed there when the hotel had their \"soft opening\" before the hotel was completely finished. Both stays were very good. The best thing about The Standard is that no matter what type of room you get, you won't ever have to look out your window at a brick wall or an air shaft. How many times have you stayed at a nice hotel known for its views and ended up in the a room that looks at a brick wall? No natural light or air, etc. The way The Standard is situated on its own block and the way it is designed makes that sad situation is an impossibility. The Room: For me the light and air (and views) and just the general feeling of coziness make up for any cons, but read on for the cons...Like most NYC hotel rooms, this one is definitely on the small side. We had two full size suit cases that we never really found a good place for. Small closet with a fabric curtain rather than a door. And the bed itself is flush against the bathroom wall on one side so only one sleeper has immediate access to the floor. There is a kind of swivel table/desk over near the fantastic floor to ceiling window wall that works quite well for work or for eating. Nice big flat screen. The bathroom is one of those open plan types with a gigantic glass window in the shower/tub that looks out into the room. It lets in lots of light to the bathroom but you have to make sure no one is using the shower when room service arrives. There is a separate room for the toilet itself. The tub/shower is enormous but the drain is right smack in the middle of the tub which can make it slightly awkward taking a shower or even a bath. The rain showerhead is nice but, again, like many hotels, if you are 6'2\" you have to bend a bit to fit under it. The Bed: On the softer side. We tend to like a firmer mattress and this one after four days had me pining for my bed at home. Linens and comforter were very cozy and clean. The Views and Location: Even the rooms that don't face the river still have river views. And your consolation is a superstar view of the sky line with the Empire State Building. If you have a room on the other side of the building you have to make do with a fantastic river/harbor view of the Statue of Liberty.Surrounded by pretty good upper end shopping and restaurants. Definitely an urban/warehouse feeling to the quickly gentrifying neighborhood and great proximity to the West Village as well as the parkway along the Hudson. Of course the hotel also straddles the fantastic High Line park which is a joy in itself, but also a great way to walk as far north as 30th Street without having to deal with cars. Service: Sometimes these hip hotels can make anyone who isn't a fashion model feel like an idiot. Not so at The Standard. Everyone we dealt with (with the possible exception of the excellent restaurant) was friendly and didn't throw of any kind of attitude. Room service was particularly good. My husband had a cold most of the time so we stayed in more than we would normally and I was always amazed at how fast the food came. From phone call to hot breakfast was only 15 minutes. Food: Room service food was good and fast. The Grill restaurant was comfy, had a great menu with lots of variety, and was really delicious. Lunch we could do as a walk-in, but evening meals require reservations well in advance--although they do take walk-ins even if you can't get a reservation. Amenities: The fitness center on the 17th floor was well-equipped, open 24/7, and had unbelieveable views. Room had a very well stocked mini-bar with reasonable-ish prices. Bathroom amenties are Kiss My Face and have a distinctive, not overpowering, clean smell. On demand choices on the flat screen were kind of on the lame side, not much choice, but the cable stations had more than your typical choices (like Bravo, etc.) but also had about five channels of art documentaries which were great. Free WiFi was plenty fast, but you could also upgrade for 19.95 a day for faster connection.

We knew before heading to New York that we wanted to stay in the Meatpacking District and we had our eyes set on taking as many pictures as possible in the Highline Park. This hotel allowed us both. The service here was fantastic! From the minute our driver dropped us off on the curb to the minute we left, I felt special and appreciated. The concierge took our bags from the curb, brought us to check-in (where we were able to check in at 9 AM complete with a free room upgrade!) He brought our bags to our room, opened the curtains, gave us a little tour of the room, the mini-bar, etc. Told us the best places to eat and check out in the area, etc. The views from this hotel are sweeping. Aside from the fact that the hotel literally overlooks the Highline Park, we also had an amazing view of the Empire State Building. I was blown away! The rooms, however, while modern were a little dated. The bed was comfy, but the bedding needs to be updated. The bathroom, however, was great. I loved the rain shower. The hotel property overall is amazing though. Between the restaurant, bars, the coffee shop, and the little Octoberfest beer garden, we were pleasantly surprised with all of the choices right at our finger tips. The meat packing district was hip, trendy, and a great place for any 20+ year old to socialize and have fun. It was warm and mild the first week of October and all of the restaurants had outdoor patios and places to eat. We were surprised by the options in this neighborhood. It was clean and just had a great vibe to it! At times, in shorts and a hooded sweatshirt (I did feel a little under dressed). So plan accordingly (as NYC is where the fashion is made!) While you will probably pay a lot to stay here (we did) it was well worth the extra 100 dollars or so (especially after seeing some of the dark and dank hotels in Times Square that were only about 100 dollars less a night).

Not to give away my age but this is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hottest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever stayed in. I was a little apprehensive at first because of all the reviews I read which spoke about how rude the staff was. We had no such experience. We arrived here the Friday before Hurricane Irene. Both my wife and I were born and raised in NYC but now live in NJ. We wanted a quick weekend getaway and got a great deal on this hotel. We arrived by taxi around 1:30pm and the driver stopped pretty far away from the entrance. As I was paying him there was already a man taking our luggage out of the trunk. We weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure who this guy was but It turns out that the bellhop (I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you call him) noticed the taxi and came right over. We were still apprehensive about check-in (once again from all the reviews) and walked inside to officially check-in. The front desk staffer was also no problem. As nice as can be. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m only mentioning these things because I put a lot of faith in many of the reviews I read. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m the type who does a lot of research before I travel so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m letting you know that although some may have had bad experiences, be your own judge on this one. We were impressed with many facets of this hotel the service being one of them. The room key is not handed to you in a small folded piece of paper like many places but instead was in a small leather binder along with writing paper a pen and other pertinent hotel information. Even the elevator is hot. There is a weird montage playing on video monitors that you have to see to understand. We were staying in a deluxe room on the 10th floor. The hallways are clean and neat. When my wife got to the room all she could say was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. What a view. The only down side was the size of the room. It was small but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure if you could afford it you could get a much bigger room. The window went from ceiling to floor and took up an entire wall of the room to the right of our bed. You can see the world but there is a note on the table near the window reminding you that the world can also see you. There is a privacy curtain provided so that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t end up on YouTube. The bed was very low to the ground so if you have a hard time getting up and down from the floor you will not be able to get in and out of this bed. Fortunately both my wife and I are in good shape so no problems. One other draw back was no HBO on the TV. I thought that odd for a hotel of this caliber but this in no way diminished our experience. The shower is in the middle of the room and is see through so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t share this room with anyone you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want seeing you nude. Overall the room was very clean though I did notice some signs of wear and tear. There is a very nicely stocked mini-bar which has decent prices for a mini-bar. They provided robes in the room which were also very nice and an umbrella for use in the event it rains. We had drinks on the rooftop where there is a cozy lounge area. Views of the city and NJ, the river, et\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 They have two small hot tubs along with a full service bar, crepe stand and comfortable seating. There were women in bikinis and guys in bathing suits. We enjoyed sitting up there taking in the views. On Friday evening we asked the concierge for information on good places to eat and not only did he recommend several options but even drew us a map and added some tips on how to get into some hard to get into places. Once again I only mention this because we were expecting a snobby attitude after reading reviews. Saturday Hurricane Irene decided to ruin our weekend getaway. The hotel was not in an evacuation zone so it was somewhat business as usual. We decided to check out anyway to be safe. If there was going to be snotty attitudes for sure we thought it would be today when employees had to work knowing there was soon to be no mass transit service. Not the case. Friendly as the day before.

Check-in Despite having emailed ahead of time, my name was not added to the reservation made by my friend. I was told I would need to wait for 40 minutes for a meeting of hotel managers to end before checking into my suite, despite showing them the email confirming. When I checked in, finally, I was told that the room had mechanical issues. We waited until after 4:30, and eventually were checked-in. There were light fixtures in the room. Room service We called several times the first night for turn-down service. They never came. When they cleaned the room the next morning, they changed the sheets etc., but never tied up. In any 5-star hotel I had stayed at, and any time I book a suite, the staff will tidy amenities, etc. At the Plaza, they will dry-clean/iron your clothes. Nothing. Club We reserved tables at Le Bain, the Standard's club. Despite having a reservation on my phone, again, when I arrived to check in, I was told I had no reservation. When I showed an email from the club's manager to the bouncer, the bouncer informed me that he was not sure who the manager was. After a few minutes, the situation cleared up and we were shown a table. The club was great, and our hostess was fantastic. General service Several times we called for Blackberry/iPad/iPod chargers and were told simply \"we do not have any.\" A good hotel will either offer to buy them for you, or tell you where to get them. Nothing of the sort. The room The room was stylish with a fantstic view, but lacked expected amenities and several items were broken. The television in the dining room was broken, and would not turn on. The lighting panels in the bedroom and in the dining room were spotty at best. There was no automatic curtain system, so you literally had to step over couches, the hot tub, etc. to close the blinds in the room. The \"guest\" shower (the smaller of the two) had watermarks all over the glass and floor, indicating that it had not been thoroughly cleaned. In general, we were there for a good time, so we did not really care; however, for having the most expensive room in the place for several nights; for having spent thousands of dollars in the restaurant and bar, we expected much more.

Despite having a larger room, they are quite small and basic. The bed was amazingly comfortable - you could almost just lie in it all day and stare at the Hudson if there wasn't so much to do. Yes it is pricer than others available, but certainly worth it for the views alone. Try exercising in the amazingly equipped gym with 180o city views! hard to concentrate on exercise. We definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again. Warning - be aware of the taxes you have to pay in NYC. We did not reserach this before hand and found after a week, it cost us an additional $500 on our accommdation bill which would have certainly influenced decisions we made on expenditure.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cBRILLIANT.

After booking flights, we decided to stay at The Standard. I'm not one for super trendy habitats, but my guy friend is, so we booked a Queen Superior room for four nights. I wanted a tub, and with this room you get a tub plus a shower. When you choose to stay at a place like the Standard (or the Gansevoort, or the Smyth, or whatever) you are staying there for the \"fabulousness\" aspect as well as for comfort and location. The room - a \"mod pod\" really - was very comfortable and very interesting in design. The views were incredible. The bed was very, very comfortable and the A/C and water pressure worked great. The tub is a deep, large square ceramic box, and not for lounging/soaking. Too bad!. It's not comfy to even sit in because the drain is smack in the middle of the tub and you will, invariably, pass over the tub plug with your boo-twah. The shower sufficed. The pillows are down but I bet they have others if you are allergic to feathers. Surprisingly, the amenities in the fridge and on the shelves were not crazy overpriced. Water was $4.00 or $6.00, for example. Amazing. The toilet is in it's own little private closet with a door. The mini ironing board and full sized iron came in handy. The black out curtains worked great. So the room was great and worth the $275 - $350 you will pay a night, plus taxes and various other little fees. And they have 24/7 room service, which was extremely nice. The Standard Grill had an excellent breakfast. Great coffee and yogurt/berries/granola. A wonderful selection of foods and beverages. Very white tile/French cafe-ish. I loved breakfast there. It was too hot to be outside when we were there so we never sat outside for cocktails or food. And this is a place where there are lots of people outside! Outside the lobby, outside the Grill, outside the Biergarten, outside on the Highline, etc etc. The Standard, in the Meatpacking district, is a huge space occupied at most times of any given day with oodles and oodles of people. You know the type....those fabulous people. Louboutin heels, Malandrino dresses, Penguin shirts, Varavatos slacks, ultra skinny jeans, etc. Trendy, trendy, trendy. If you want relative escape from swarms of trendy people, you will have this escape only in your room, in the lobby between 5 and 10 a.m and maybe while waiting for your elevator before 6 p.m. You will have it no where else. So if privacy at all times is your thing, be prepared for the gaggle of people hanging out here, most especially after 6 pm. Good thing....cabs are always there for you. The rooftop bar on 18 is closed to hotel guests, generally, after 8 or 10 pm. There is usually an event of some type going on that is closed to the general public. People are dying to get to the rooftop bar because it's verboten. They really glam it up and giggle their way to the 18th floor. These people - who will share your elevator ride on occasion - are cute, or extremely annoying, depending upon your personal perspective of people who frequent trendy rooftop bars. All I know is there was no noise pollution, even with the throngs of people, and I slept like a baby without requiring ear plugs. On the whole, the Standard is an excellent, convenient, aesthetically interesting hotel. The staff were kind and pleasant. \"Pleasant\" in a New York City kind of way, not in an Omaha kind of way.

Warning: if you read the reviews, you'll see that a lot of people are disappointed by the Standard, either because they find the staff snobby or because the place is over-run with people looking to party. Neither of these things should come as a surprise to anyone, based on the location of the hotel and the bars connected to it and surrounding it. Here's my experience: I showed up super early and was able to check in around 12:00 p.m. Our room was on the 12th floor, toward the end of the hall and facing uptown. The room was a good size, had a HUGE window overlooking the Highline and the Empire State Building. Nice flat screen TV, queen bed, glassed in shower (my wife noted that if you are not traveling with a very close companion, this may be a little awkward) and separate toilet. There was also a surprising amount of storage. We have eaten in the restaurant and have had a drink in the beer garden, so we didn't do that this time, but we enjoyed both in the past. The bar on the top floor is pretty incredible. (The closest thing I can compare it to is the view from Mix at the top of Mandalay Bay in Vegas.) It's definitely over the top, but again, that's to be expected. Don't go looking for friendly and attentive service, it's just not that kind of place. But the views are incredible and just being in there makes you feel like a rockstar. We did venture up to the rooftop deck for a bit. Wow. Holy fratastic spring-fling. There were drunken people laying all over the place (oh, to be 23 again). Needless to say, we didn't hang around there much, but it's there if you want it. I found the front desk staff to be pretty professional. They definitely give off a vibe that they're not to be bothered, but once you see through that, they're pretty good about getting you checked in/out and telling you about the hotel. The bell staff was pretty good as well. The first guy took our luggage for storage, noted the time we needed a cab and was very helpful. The second basically loaded our luggage in the cab. In sum, if I had spent $400 or $500 I would probably have expected a little more. (We got a great deal, $250, through Jetsetter.)

I've stayed in lots and reviewed quite a few on TripAdvisor now, so you can see I'm pretty balanced. When I travel for leisure, I really looking for one thing - good service. You'll note that from some of the previous reviews I've written, so hopefully you'll understand I'm not out to take a pop at this hotel. Here we go.... It was a bad sign when the Limo pulled up and the driver had to ask US if we knew where the bell boys were. None to be seen in sight, not even a bell-stand to suggest where he should pull up. By the time our driver got our luggage out, and we had hauled it to reception I was already more than a little taken aback by The Standard of welcome at this '4 star' hotel. There was no-one waiting at the front door, as there would be in most hotels. No-one to offer you a seat or a refreshing drink while they take away your passport and get you checked in, as they do in almost all hotels, everywhere in the world in such heat and humidity, which was truly sweltering that day. We stood, patient (if sweaty) and tired at reception where we were processed (I wouldn't really call it a check-in) swiftly. We were told by the check-in agent that we could only use half of the hotel's bars until 10pm in the evenings, after which time we, the paying guests, were no longer welcome and would have to leave. This wasn't just on one night, it was all nights. I checked the website, that info is there, but it's not on display. It's definitely not on any of the blogs postings they put on Facebook, or the emails that they pepper your account with almost every day after you make your reservation. So, now we'd been processed, I stood looking blankly while I waited for an act of God. Er, I mean a bell boy. No, none to be found and no-one volunteered to find one so WE took our bags up to our room. Rooms are nice, but small. There's a nice seating area with a table, a great TV, our room had a bath and a rain shower. The finish was good, but there's a totally ridiculous amount of storage space. Two people with a suitcase and a bag each could unpack about two days of clothes maximum, each. Not deterred by our check-in experience, we were hungry and decided to head to the Grill for a late lunch. It was empty apart from two tables. We stood for I'd say around five minutes, waiting for FOUR members of staff, who were LESS than 1 metre from us, to ask if we would like a table (having tried several 'hellos' and 'harrumphs' while they busily ignored us. In the end, the Charcutrierre noticed we were looking rather irritated and suggested 'perhaps one of you could seat these guests?' to her colleagues. We were seated and offered menus by a pleasant young man. We ordered our lunch. We ordered a St. Emilion (as I recall) to accompany lunch which was pretty well priced at about $60 or so for the bottle. Lunch arrived very promptly and we sat and waited for our wine... 'It's coming right up, Sir', so we began to eat, much to the protest of my French partner, to whom eating before the wine has breathed for at least ten minutes is a sin. We waited for wine (a very perky one, which was not bad at all, but served too cold, which let it down) but unfortunately, the wine arrived as I took one of my last bites of steak. No apologies were offered or received, not even the OFFER of a free desert or coffee, which is the custom in any restaurant when the customer is left waiting, never mind left waiting for his wine. I had been in the hotel less than 2 hours and I already knew that if this was The Standard, I was not going to be a happy man for the next five days. In short, far too much chatter and banter among the staff, and nowhere near enough focus on the guests, their order, their needs, desires or expectations. You get better service in MacDonalds. And faster. Talking about MacDonalds... let's discuss those wonderful bars. Having been mightily irritated by the no-guests after 10pm policy, I am now able to say I don't think we actually missed much. We went up on the first evening to one of the bars at issue. Having waited 20 minutes in a bar I would estimate could hold 200, but at that time had an equal number of guests to bar men, one of them sidled up and served us. We enjoyed the view. We also admired the foaming yellow-y weirdness that was the 'jacuzzi'. The two bars on the ground floor (yes! these are the ones you, the paying guests, are 'allowed' to use), suffer from their success and the same profound absence of staffing as those upstairs. They're also open to the world and it's wife, so don't go hoping to get served (noticing what 'The Standard' really refers to, yet? Certainly, we were getting the message and it was only our first night). You see, it appears that in a parallel universe encompassing a small corner of Meat Packing, the longer you wait for anything - a drink, a menu, food, a bell boy, a glimmer of pleasantry - the more people will write rave reviews about it. We 'experienced' this level of service throughout our stay. This was 'The Standard' of Service. I also enjoyed had the good fortune of 'experiencing' the service levels of this hotel BEFORE as well as during my stay. The Concierge service, while eventually 'getting there' with a level of direction I think most people would reserve for a 6 year old, took over a dozen emails to book one excursion. Honestly, I really, really, really should have just done it myself. There was nothing convenient or helpful about it at all. I put more time into telling them what I wanted to do, than they did in satisfying my requests. Let's not even get onto the subject of them replying, but then that's The Standard I now know I should have expected! In summary, I don't think it will be long before people start to realise that in fact, this hotel is all about paying for style over substance and that you can have as nice or better a room at any other high-end hotel (probably bigger, though sadly I'll admit without the river view) for less money and without the obnoxious attitude and absence of service. One thing's for sure - it will be a darned sight easier to get fed and watered elsewhere, particularly if you want to do the two things at the same time. Redeeming features: - the view. Book a room with a bath on a high floor. Be careful with the windows, they are NOT one-way. - the high-line. Very nice in Summer. - lots of French people, so made for a good time laughing about Dominique Strauss-Kahn's misfortune, just a few blocks downtown of us. Downsides: -facilities. if you are a Nun and go to bed before 10pm at night, this would be the ideal convent for you. If you are not a Nun, repent for thou hast considered staying here and it is truly a sin. Do not get a Cosmopolitan or Mojito, do not go out partying on the roof deck, go directly to confessional instead. - room size. Yes, it's New York, but don't expect to join in any cat-swinging tournaments, Rumours of a lack of storage space are entirely accurate (on the upside, you don't need to unpack) - service. You are in America and have SO MUCH choice. This hotel knows it stands out on a design front and uses that to it's advantage. Simply put, I thought it was awful. The staff don't respect the guest and I left with the distinct feeling that I had paid nearly three thousand dollars ground rent so others could have a party on the top floor at my expense.

The lobby is stylish but smelt of a burger grill. The bar/grill which is part of the hotel is off the entrance so if you aren't a fan of cooking meat- you may not enjoy! The check in was swift and friendly, we were dealt with by a super trendy hipster. The lifts are AMAZING, and I would tell most people to come to the hotel just to see these! The room was nice, it isn't very big but it was very clever in it's layout. Views were as expected; amazing. Our room had a glass wall between the bed and the bath tub so I wouldn't really recommend this hotel to anyone other than couples. The main issue we had was the noise. We are talking full on. The plumbing for the rooms obviously backs onto each other, and as such if next door was using the bathroom, then so were we. This was augmented by the fact the shower and bed are beside each other. We had to call the reception about it and were told \"to wait a few minutes\". While I understand that there isn't much they can do about the construction I was shocked that a hotel that had been open for so long with such obvious problems continued to market itself as high end.... There is also a club on the roof, which we went to. Fine on the night you are there, annoying when you are trying to get sleep. We were paying a huge amount of money to stay here yet our sleep quality was really messed up by this. As mentioned in another review, the halls were being painted. Not a big deal- but again paying $300ish per night for a hotel that smelt like burgers in the lobby and wet paint in the corridors? I can't really call this value for money. I am glad I stayed here as the hotel is very different to a Hilton or Marriott which is what I usually do in NYC but for this price in what is essentially an \"up and coming\" part of town.

The hotel itself is very modern and stylish, almost to the point where it can be a bit disorientating. The lobby and elevators are all very dark, almost no lighting. The rooms are a bit unusual at first (for instance, there's a window in the shower that looks onto the bed), and the windows are *very* clear (to the point that there's a letter when you arrive asking you to be mindful of what the patrons in the High Line park can see!).

First, I'll give The Standard a few kind words because they are doing some things properly: 1. The beds are really, really comfortable, and so are the pillows. The sheets are also amazingly soft. 2. When on my first night the people next door held a party in their tiny room from 1:45-4am, replete with music and shouting, the hotel did move me to a different room. 3. Christian, from Room Service, was positively the nicest person at the entire hotel. He made me feel like a guest, and that wasn't the reception I got from everyone else who worked here. A+, Christian, you rock. Ok, now for the cons. I get that The Standard is going for a minimalist look. However, I found the overall design of the room bordering on the austere and the functionality severely lacking. There was nothing about the rooms (and I stayed in two of them, due to item #2 above) that made me feel like I was staying at a hotel that was concerned with aesthetics/visual appeal/luxury. The bathrooms were poorly designed, no doors and water splashing and leaking everywhere. Not to mention their shiny black subway tile reminiscent of an unrenovated apartment from the 70s. Not chic, just industrial looking. The convenience beauty items like shampoo, conditioner, etc. were nice, especially the honey lotion, but the packaging looked like I'd just bought no-name bug spray at a convenience store. Probably more aggravating than anything else at The Standard is the utter disdain nearly everyone who works at the hotel has for you. It always felt like I was putting someone out by staying at the hotel--whether it was getting someone to hail a cab, help me carry my belongings during my room change, or simply passing an employee in the hallway, etc. Only exception was Christian from item #3 above, and the woman I saw doing housekeeping--the only 2 friendly people in the establishment. The other really aggravating part about staying here is the noise from the remaining meatpacking establishments nearby. They're just trying to run their businesses so this is not their fault, but why build a hotel here without taking this into account? As a result of this, at 3:45 AM for 3 nights, I listened to incessant beeping from the bobcat machine loading items in and out of trucks for delivery (and I was on the 12th floor). I would compare this to having a dull bedside alarm clocking that never stops going off, no matter how many times you hit the snooze button. In addition, West Side Highway traffic picks up at about 6am. The floor to ceiling windows in the rooms don't buffer against this too much, so if you're sensitive to noise, this is fair warning. Lastly, during my stay, without warning, they began painting the entire corridor white with absolutely no ventilation. My first room (on the 10th floor) smelled of fresh paint. Not cool. I was then moved to the 12th floor, which was much quieter. The Standard has some pros, but a lot of cons--some of which can be fixed in terms of enhancing customer service (if they even want to), and others that are just inherent to the hotel.

The shower must be mentioned: great rain shower-head, only separated from the room by a glass wall.

After complaining to reception about the amount of noise.. they sent someone up to check the noise level... but obviously the whole hotel was loud so they claimed not to able to hear anything.

Once upstairs we were informed the bar was closing at 730 for a private party. I was rather upset. When I spoke to the front desk I asked why we weren't told at check-in. They had no response. Once the desk realized I was upset I was told \"I will see what I can do\" by the front desk staff. We waited around the hotel for another 30 min. I never received a call.

The staff and the guests are beautiful and the height of fashion.

My only complaint is that when we checked in we were informed that the bar on the 18th floor would be open every night until 21:30. But on Christmas eve after getting ready to up there we found it was in fact closed for the 24th and 25th, which was a great disappointment. So if you are staying over the holidays be sure to ask when it is open. Apart from that one detail, we had a wonderful stay. The suggestions from the concierge were nothing short of inspired. There is a good variety of equipment in the gym, and you can not beat the 17th floor view while you work out. The food in the Grill was excellent as were the cocktails and buzz in the 18th floor bar, when we did get to go. The area is surrounded by good (and expensive) shops and lovely bars and restaurants. Last of all, we were stuck for an extra two days due to the adverse weather, and the staff were amazingly helpful and accommodating. We were able to stay on in our same room, and the bookings department were very sympathetic to our situation as we did not know how much longer we would need to stay at first.

The restaurant attached makes the nicest breakfasts, definately a must when you stay! We did attempt to go there for dinner but reservations are a must unless you don't mind an hour and a half wait... Room service was delicious- the burgers are YUM. The local area is super cool, with lots of trendy/designer shops and very local to get into Soho which is probably my favourite neighbourhood. There are lots of bars/food places etc to go to, but if you don't want to partake the hotel doesn't turn into a club so no interruptions for a peaceful nights sleep.

First impressions were not good as the dooman had an air of arrogance and as I had a day pack, he probably just mistook me for a sightseer. Rule #1 that any doorman who knows his stuff - Treat everyone the same as you would the most imprtant guest at the hotel. Check-in is a little messy with 2 staff sitting behind laptops flanked by counters on either side but not making any eye-contact with anyone. The staff I got a reception was very helpful when he found out ti was my first stay in NYC and proceeded to offer me options for my room with different views available (additional cost as well but thi swas NOT a hard sell but allowed me to choose). I opted for the standard room. While looking for the elevators, again 2 staff (they looked like the may have been part of the concierge team) at the reception counter who were in chatting away totally ignored me till I asked them for directions to which one looked at me and told me where it was without as much as a hand gesture to point or changing body language. The rooms are functional and quirky and the rounded design gives one the feeling of being in a ship or aeroplane cabin which I enjoyed. The floor to ceiling windows gives the smallish room a sense of space and a lot of natural light. Warning.. the bathtubs only have a glass screen separating it from the bedroom and no privacy screen. So you either have a shower in full view of anyone else in the room or get them to go have a drink downstairs. I have been in hotels with similar designs but they usually come with a pull down privacy screen. Somethings you just don't want others to see. Thankfully the bathroom has a door. Another thing is that the shower/ bathtubs are about 3/4 of metre off the ground which makes it hard to get in or out if you have any sort of injury or disability. Not sure if other rooms cater for this. Probably best toiletries I have ever gotten for a standard room in a hotel (have stayed in close to 200 hotels in my life) and the bottles are so large that I took then with me as I didn't want to waste any. Rooms also come with free internet for the 1st day then paid for the rest. The Grill is superb and the service again inconsistent. The waitress and busboys were fantastic yet some of the reception staff were bad. As I walked in, again I was ignored till I piped out (must be my ugly head...lol). The food here is value for money and wine list though limited, adapts well with the food. The buzz within the restaurant was good if you're into that sort of thinkg. The meat packing district is an exciting one and definitely has yet to even reach it's full potential. There is lots to do around the area and High Line is a feature of course - though a little brown and bear in the winter but a great concept nevertheless. A sense of gritty New York mixed with the trendy artistic makes this area unique. Don't forget to visit the great Chelsea Markets for some great fresh produce. The one major gripe that I had was that I cancelled a tour to make the rooftop bar in time only to be told that it was booked for the evening. Spoke to the Duty Manager about how inconvenient this was for someone in NYC on such a short trip - this being a feature of the hotel, staff should advise guest when they check-in to avoid disappointment and inconveniencen as there is enough to do in NYC otherwise (there was another couple trying to get to the rooftop bar and were equally disapointed when I told them it was not open.) Plus - Trendy, great views, things to do around the area Negative - Staff need to realise they aren't working in a trendy nightclub but a hotel (not that any service orientated person should provide anything less than the best service irrespective of where they work) To the Standard Hotel - Your staff seem to lack the passion of having the experience of working in a hotel that bucks the trend yet allows guest to still experience first class service.

The living room (lobby bar) is a nice place to unwind after a tough day slogging the manhattan tourist trail and have a great chocolate mousse, drinks are NYC prices. I would say that the morning staff here are far more attentive than the evening staff. We found the staff in the evening were more concerned with hanging out with each other than making the hotel money by getting you a drink, but this is really knit picking.

Each room has a \"window wall\" which is amazing. I could sit in my room all day and stare out the window. I've stayed on both sides of the hotel, but prefer the side with the city view, so I always ask for that side. *Design: The rooms are very modern but still feel very comfortable. The beds are comfortable and most rooms have a nice little seating are where you can get work done or enjoy the view. The place just feels stylish. *Service: The staff is INCREDIBLY helpful and friendly. I've heard they hire aspiring models- which makes most everyone nice to look at BUT there is no attitude at all! I was a pumping mom and had some special issues around refrigeration - and they were so accommodating!! *Location: The Meatpacking district just comes to life over the summer. I am always surprised by the level of activity in this neighborhood when the weather warms up. I love that you have acces to the High Line park if you want a nice after dinner stroll.

Their inability to smile consistently or to seem generally interested is something they need to work on. I must point out that Megan at reception was more than helpful in organising a room amenity before arrival however I thanked her in person upon arrival. Is it worth the price?

We are recently married and were upgraded to a suite which was lovely! I adored going to sleep with a view of the Empire State building each night. We could also see some of the Hudson and the Highline, so overall it was the very best view! Did I mention the bed? I need to find out where they buy their mattresses... I slept in every morning. I unfortunately didn't find the time to check out the biergarten which looked very cool, but we did manage to dine for a late lunch at the outdoor cafe which was very pleasant. The decor is spot on, the food was good and the server was knowledgeable and attentive. I was a big hungover and wanted a bloody mary as well as oysters and I was in luck - great bloody and fresh raw oysters! My husband and I also went to the outdoor rooftop bar (Le Bain) which is honestly a once in a lifetime experience. It was a gorgeous afternoon and it was enjoyable to take in the panoramic view of the Hudson from up there. And the waterbeds are a cool feature. We also had a cocktail in the 18th floor lounge (previously called the Boom Boom room) where we were able to take in some live music. The lounge closes early, but it was nice for a pre-party cocktail. Another thing I loved about this hotel is the close proximity to the Chelsea Market. It has a wonderful variety of restaurants, specialty shopping, bakeries & cafes etc. And the BEST coffee shop (Ninth Street Cafe). I walked there every morning for breakfast and a latte. I also like the walk to Greenwich village and enjoyed the now built-up meatpacking district. Overall we had a wonderful mini-honeymoon, enjoyed our room with amazing views and the superb location. Thanks for a great stay. The only negative I could think of is the lighting in the bathroom. The bathroom in our suite was all black and I had to put my makeup on in the other room (which was not a problem since there were a lot of mirrors and plenty of light in there).", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, TX", "Title": "\u201cGreat views, awful customer care!

We were attracted to the location (in the Meatpacking District, over the Highline), the views, the sexy atmosphere and the architecture. Our room was a superior queen, about 230 square feet, but although space was used wisely, it felt a bit cramped. We only stayed for 2 nights, so we had enough room in the closet, but we used all of the table space for our luggage. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom, although small, was adequate. The rain shower and large tubs were nice amenities. We liked the 2 black bathrobes but never used them. The large TV set at the foot of the bed gave us an error code and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work but we never bothered to get it fixed. There was a letter from Ian, who has answered several disparaging reviews on this forum. He reminded us that the windows were transparent and we should therefore use discretion. I am still confused as to whether the hotel wants us to perpetuate or dispel the voyeuristic and exhibitionistic reputation. I am guessing that there is a fine line somewhere and the hotel is straddling it without direction. We had a reservation for the Boom Boom Room and with anticipation we took the elevator up. The elevator had a video that seemed entertaining at first, but after a few trips to our room and upstairs, the video got tiresome and made the ride seem even longer. And now we must tell our velvet rope story. We went up to the Boom Boom Room and had 2 drinks each and shared a pate appetizer. The tab came to $110 before tax and tip. We would have spent more but the staff insisted that we leave before 10 PM so that the Boom Boom Room, hot tub bar and rooftop bar could open as an invite-only club. We asked if we could gain an invite but were told that we would not be offered one. Now this must be a very good marketing ploy because the best way to get someone to want something is to tell them that they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have it. We went to a late night show at the Duane Park Caf\u00c3\u00a9 and then returned to see if we could get past the velvet rope. Despite us being hotel guests and dressed to the nines (girlfriend had a gold sequined form-fitting Barbie Doll dress) we were not treated as invitees and were not given the privilege of waiting on a line for about an hour to pay $20-$25 for drinks. So next night, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try. After a Broadway show we ended up at Dizzy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Coca Cola in the Time-Warner Building. There the cover was $5. We were able to walk right in and the jazz music was amazing. And the really good drinks were very reasonable. The setting was absolutely beautiful (makes the Boom Boom Room look like a corner deli) and the acoustics were perfect. I can't understand why people would prefer something like the Boom Boom Room. So the Standard did us a favor by not inviting us upstairs after 10 PM. And we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t return. Ian, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to hear from you what the limited schedule is for facility use by hotel guests. And I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to hear how you hope we will return and give you a chance to show us that our initial impressions were not really true. Your set up made us feel like second-class guests. Next time we will look for a place next time that makes us feel like we booked a first class ticket. If you want my partner and I to return, then ask Andre to contact us on this forum to discuss what it would take to make us come back.

Below is our summary: Location: great location for leisure but not if you are coming for business in finance Hotel & room: new and chic, great view. Size is too small even we are in the suit. We have to leave both our bags on the floor and we have to walk very carefully in the room. we won't fall on the floor. The shower place need to have door coz all the water being leaking out and it's all wet, bad design. I guess you need to sand your tile floor a bit coz their edges are pointy and sharp. The finishing of the carpet on the corridor is not firm and you slide them while you walk from lift to your room. Paints are not quite finished when you look at the ceiling and some corner . WiFi: it is free but you need to connect everyday. They drop off very fequently now and then. Once you walk out of the room, you lost it even you are still in the hotel. If you have a problem, they will connect you to an outsourced IT company. So if you are business traveller, it's a\"no\" Services: it varies, I met a few nice staffs especially the room service one called Andrew who is always sweet and happy to take my breakfast order. He will greet me everytime. However most are bad , it is an attitude issue and they forget basic like \"greeting your guest\"!!! It's like we are too cool for you. It is ok if you want to brand it as a \"cool\" hotel but don't forget we are not paying to put up for a face. The staffs has to been tentative and have the initiative to assist your guest. Bars & restuarants: beer garden, forget about that , you need to go into the line with the non- hotel people , . They are every busy night after 6 pm. The Grill, sorry they are full all the time and no reservation can be made. My husband cannot been seated because I have not arrived!!!! The Living room, sorry they are full at night and we have to wait for 20 minutes. 18/ f , sorry they don't open to us after 8:30 because they are for private party. The bouncers are like killing you while you walk around them towards your lift . One Friday night at 11 pm . We couldnt get food or drink at all around the area, so we went back and hope to get food and drink in our hotel. Sorry all are full and we end up having room service.

Don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful hotel. The rooms are amazing and EVERYTHING was new when I stayed. However what sucked were: 1. The service - The staff were arrogant and obnoxious little weasels! Never judge a book by it's cover, I was on a work/leisure trip however I had just flown from Australia to NYC. Now that's a 22-24 hours trip with an approx 15-16 hour straight flight. So by the time, I had to do the L.A to NYC leg, I was delirious, tired and needed a shower. Now, I was dressed comfortably and casually. Already I was getting looks from the staff. They didn't open my taxi door (which I don't mind) however why were they doing it for everyone else? I turned up at the reception to check in and was left standing there for seriously a few minutes while the girls and guys were talking about their plans for the weekend and other useless crap! Finally the receptionist asks, 'Do you understand the current rates we charge for this hotel?' By this stage, I was fuming. But I kept my mouth shut. Everything changed once she realised which room that was booked and what type of credit card I had and where I worked. This type of crap pisses me off! Management cannot change this behaviour, however the one thing I believe in is hire staff for attitude especially the face of the business because you can teach any monkey skills. The staff at The Standard need to shape up as the benefits of being the 'cool' and 'new' place to be will only be appealing for so long. 2. Their internet is terrible. I had to send through documents from a local internet cafe due to their slow service. 3. The location is okay, unless you enjoy hanging around over-weight Russian gangsters with beautiful blonde young girlfriends, then this is the place to be. Overall, the experience was okay. I enjoyed waking up and seeing the Hudson River every morning. And I did enjoy that the hotel was pretty brand new when I stayed. However on my recent trip to NYC, I stayed at the Rivington in LES.

We were with a group of friends (some who live in the city) to celebrate some big birthdays. Hotel is a short cab ride away from Penn Station (we took the train from Boston) We stayed on the 6th floor in a regular room. Yes, the rooms are small but most are in NYC. The bed was king-sized and super comfortable and I loved the pillows. There was a good-sized flat screen TV across from our bed with a ton of channels. The mini-bar was quite extensive with anything you could possibly imagine. You have to be comfortable with who you are staying with if you have a room with the see-through shower. We loved it and thought the water pressure was great. Our room looked over the highline walkway and you can literally look down at people, many waved to us. Be aware of this as it is very easy to see into your room from there and at night, if you want privacy, draw the curtains (which by the way did a great job of blocking out the early morning light) We had friends who stayed on the 12th floor looking over the Hudson. Their room offered more privacy and they had a more private shower with bath. The rooms were relatively quiet. You could not hear any noise from outside, just the occasional door in the hallway. It had a good amount of towels, toiletries (even though I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a fan of what they provided) and great black robes that my DH loved! My only complaint with the room itself was storage space. Besides the tiny closet, there are no places to put your clothes. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imagine what to do if you were there for an extended time. We just kept most of our stuff in our suitcase on the floor. The elevators were awesome with the video constantly playing, sometimes we wanted to keep riding in it just to watch. We went up to the Boom-Boom room late afternoon for cocktails , very stylish with great views! This is closed most weekend nights for private parties. You have to check out the bathrooms, floor to floor glass windows (like the whole hotel) looking out at the city. One of our friends was too uncomfortable to go the bathroom! We also had drinks and snacks in the lobby bar which also had a great outdoor seating area. We were lucky to have a very warm May weekend. Great people watching- we saw a commercial being filmed one day and models another for a magazine spread. Drinks and food are not cheap but we find that nothing is in New York so we were not surprised. We went to the BeerGardern late afternoon with friends which is a great place on a warm day (and they do serve more than beer) and also checkout the Standard Grill late night which had tasty sandwiches (at slightly reasonable prices). This whole area was hopping on Saturday night with a wide range of people. Located in the popular meatpacking district there is a lot to do in this area. We enjoyed walking the Highline which is not completed yet, but definitely a nice walk. Hogs and Heifers is across the street if you like beer and dive bars. Pastis is around the corner for brunch which we did (very busy place) and we also were able to go to Morimoto which is just a few blocks away for some great sushi.

The room had a wrap-around banquette across from the bed which was a nice touch. The TV was mounted to the floor right in front of the windows which was odd since it blocked part of the view. The bath was split on either side of the room as you walked in, with the shower/bath tub on one side (with a great louvered window to see the view) and the sink and toilet on the other side. I understand set up design-wise but it wasn't all that practical since the sink area was very small and the shower area had no door so water ran onto the carpet. We went to the lounge at the top of the hotel for a drink and snacks before the theatre (love the elevator art installation). It was retro-fun with a wonderful view (take your sunglasses). It was nice but a little chaotic - it felt like they didn't have the seating plan down yet. It is set up like a lounge so the tables were jumbled and and the wait staff kept pushing us to one side or the other trying to decide what table we were sitting at. Service was anything but invisible which was distracting. The menu was limited but nice. We had never stayed in the Meatpacking district before so weren't sure what to expect. We were really interested in seeing the HIgh Line and this was a great way to experience it. The park is beautiful - they did a phenomenal job on the design and details.

Great location, too. I couldn't formally check-in as the reservation was under my partner's name -- he was on a later flight, due in about 4 hours. But the lady at the concierge made me feel at home immediately, arranging for the porter to stow my suitcases and loaning me a plug adaptor so I could use my laptop. She also moved me to the adjacent lounge/caf\u00c3\u00a9, introduced me to the bubbly young hostess there, who she instructed to make sure my drinks were \"on the house\". I was blown away by their foresight in this matter; I certainly wouldn't be using their wifi to grumble about the wait on TripAdvisor. I had two of their house cocktails -- a mojito and a kir-like drink. Wanting to reciprocate on their generosity and try the menu -- I'd heard great things about The Standard Grill -- I had their amazing Club Sandwich, which was perfection, arriving with a fresh salad and mini condiment jars. The standard double room was small, as others have griped, but the fabulous modern furniture, mod/minimal design, and floor-to-ceiling windows made it feel airy. Those who gripe about room size need to consider the service -- this a great reminder that you pay for the experience, not just square footage (in NYC, at that). One more note: Breakfast. While not included, the restaurant has a great breakfast menu at very reasonable NYC prices and a great atmosphere; I would much prefer my $10 brioche-french-toast with caramelized bananas, walnuts and maple syrup over a generic spread any time!

Cool room layouts have panoramic views over the city (along with a letter from the General Manager to remind you that the rest of New York City might be able to see everything you have on show!). Mine had a large wet room, with oversized tub - very nice - but then you had to cross the corridor to the tiny (shallow and badly designed) sink and minimal storage area. There was also no hook to hang your towel - which did not seem to go hand in hand with the note on your bed to change/not change your linen. The bed was very comfortable and there was a nice seating area. Great TV and also nice bathroom ammenities. The open plan design is great if you are on your own, but did not afford much privacy, if you are traveling with someone else. It is very much a room designed for a one/two night stay - not great for longer. The hotel has a good restaurant - which is certianly popular in the city and opens late into the night. Service was however patchy and this is a theme throughout the hotel. The Front Desk Team (especially The Concierge & Doormen) are more concerned in being one of the 'beautiful people', rather than offering great service. All the money seems to have been spent on the rooftop bar - which is certainly spectacular, but vastly overpriced and with poor service. It is only open from 4pm - 9pm, when the lights come on and everyone is kicked out. It is a private club later at night and I believe you need to have sold your soul to the devil to get in (no special priviledges for hotel guests). There is a great gym, with spectacular views.

Positives first. the hotel is in a great downtown location with great retailing and dining options close by. The gym has views only rivaled by the gym in Tokyo's Park Hyatt. Rooms too have great views - particularly those facing uptown. But views alone don't a great hotel make. The rooms are pokey and cramped. Closet space is practically non-existent. If traveling with a suit case prepare to trip over it while in the room - if traveling with two consider booking adjoining rooms. We felt as if we were staying in a caravan or winnebego. The concierge was sloppy and pretentious. We trusted her with a task of confirming restaurant bookings which proved either too much or too menial for her - either way it was messed up. Positioning-wise, this hotel is perfectly aimed at 20-somethings - it feels like a disco-hotel and has something of a scene attached to it. it certainly will not canabalise the Mercer's customer as it lacks the world-class service levels and discretion of its cooler sister hotel. i would suspect that it may not get a lot of repeat custom, and should enjoy its buzz status while it can. There is a club on the 18th floor which offers amazing 360 views of the city, but is not available to guests post 8pm Thu-Sun. It feels a tad too self-conscious but certainly worth scoping out for the vista. The club's loos offer great views externally, but the toilet was blocked when i tried to used it. I think the staff were too gorgeous to look after such trivialities. Half of the building's elevators will be closed off during the exclusive times to accomodate the club's guests rather than the hotel's.

The Standard, one of the most inspiring structures to rise in NYC in years, gets everything right. Its design is not only captivating but makes sense on the level of experience. It may be the exciting new place on the block, but this hotel is far from trendy. Our corner room on the 14th floor was small in terms of square feet, but the overall layout and design made the room feel expansive. Of course, the floor to ceiling windows overlooking the city also promoted this. It was absolutely amazing to feel suspended over Manhattan in such a calming environment. There were many interesting elements to the design that defied the usual expectations of a hotel room--such as the open bathroom with no wall separating the shower area from the sink--that worked so well.

Cons: The service is, frankly, an embarrassment. A bag was dropped for us on Friday night, Saturday night it still hadn't been brought to the room. I called, they had no idea what I was talking about. I made them search and finally they found it and asked, as though I was bothering them, if I needed it brought up. Add to that the confusion of the desk staff who were clearly hired more based on their trendy appearances than their qualifications in hospitality. It would take two or three of them to handle simple requests like a new room key. We also had several people getting ready in the room for an event with hair & makeup people coming in to prep. The hotel was notified of this in advance and said it would be not a problem. The open shower (which is silly) has no way to be closed off from the rest of the room (frankly the entire bathroom is part of the suite). We asked that a Chinese curtain be brought in so one person could shower while the other was being prepped. The staff had nothing they could do and told us that it really wasn't something they could accommodate. I'm sorry, but when you're charging around $1000 a night for a room there should be NO request that is hard to accommodate. They finally brought up sheets & painter's tape to create a divider. It was a bad solution but go the job done. It should also be noted that the finishing in the hotel are embarrassing. The carpets in the hallways are cheap and poorly installed so they slip under your feet slightly as you walk. In the suite, the carpet had rough-cut edges against the walls, much akin to how carpet looks like when installed by you and your friends. The couch fabric (also used to cover the woefully small closet - with no shelves for clothing, only five hangers) was described by one person as \"a donkey blanket\" based on it's look & feel. Lastly, this was really one, not-so-big room. Bathroom, L-shaped couch sitting area & bed all open together. It is like a starter studio apartment with a kick-butt view. I generally expect suites to have two rooms with some divider between them, which this lacked. Frankly, this is a hotel that it would be very hard to recommend.

I was really looking forward to staying here so I didn't have any doubts when we decided to come to New York for our 7-night honeymoon, impressed by the design proposal and the massive views of The Standard Suite (room 8.23). When we booked the room, I made it clear we wanted to pay cash for our room, which it didn't seem to be a problem when I contacted the hotel. However, our problems with the service started at the check in: the person who received us was not prepared for this method of payment, uncomfortable and almost annoyed, insisting in authorizing the full amount of our stay in our credit card. We offered the cash deposit of all the money which was, to my surprise, not accepted. He really wanted the credit card... after a few times trying to authorize it (we told him again and again that we didn't have high limits available on our credit card, hey, we had just payed for our wedding!), he finally took the cash. Took too long, and it was embarrassing as there was a long line forming after us. We got sick on the first days and we had to ask for some salt, a request received with irony by the room service staff and ignored. Had to call again to finally get the salt... absurd. Then we ran out of shower gel. How come house keeping does not check something basic as replacing your shower gel? Had to call for more, took forever, and when I was just about to do my second call, waiting wrapped in a towel, it arrived. The concierge service was fine, doing reservations and giving you recommendations in the neighborhood but, as the text messages they supposedly were sending to us were not arriving to our room phone, in the end, our impression was very poor. And, speaking of phones, ours doesn't work for local calls (they are supposed to be free but we're using our cell phones - from spain - instead). Whenever we try to call, we get a \"please hang up\" message as if the phone was blocked. I didn't even bother calling to have it unblocked/fixed. I would probably have to call twice, get upset, etc. so I left it the way it is as I really don't feel like interacting with the staff. The good side? the room has impressive views and nice designed furniture. Bathtub by Philip Starck, all very nice indeed, specially if you're design oriented and really cares about this stuff, as we do. But a good hotel, those who stay on for long, is not only made by good views and design. It needs to excel in service. The next \"hip-place-to-be\" hotel is just around the corner and If I want to survive in the New York city battlefield, I would improve that aspect of my business. Def not staying again.

We spent 3 nights in this UBER trendy hotel to finish off our fab NYC visit. The area: wow....I must start by saying that the Meatpacking District is so very cool, and has a trendy, underground feel to it. It may not be THE in-area right now (Hell's Kitchen is hotting up big time), but it is still the Meatpacking district, point. Nice shops, great restaurants (we frequented Pastis more than once), the High Line park is lovely and gives a great chance to explore the area. We really enjoyed exploring on foot and walked all the way down Bleecker Street until we hit Soho for great shopping and scene. We even went so far as to walk all the way from Brooklyn Bridge up through Tribeca then Soho and up to The Standard hotel. Walk, walk, walk....staying at this hotel puts you in a great position to explore by foot. The hotel staff: All the staff we encountered were extremely friendly and knowledgeable. I have read other reviews saying that they felt the staff would barely look up and offer assistance. I personally think though that some people confuse the hotel service you would expect to find in a 5 star chain to the service one simply must expect at a trendy, boutique-esque hotel. All staff were amazing. We had room service, bellboy bags to room, assistance at the front desk on a few occasions...each and every time, without fail, we were given friendly, cool service with a smile...not fake, not over the top...just what one would expect. No robots here...just staff with personality. The hotel: ooh la la...from it's truly unique exterior to it's super trendy interior, The Standard really knows how to put on a show. The design is supercool. The bright yellow table/bench combos adorn the entrance, leading to revolving doors, bringing you into a slick, sexy lobby. Round the corner are the pitch black elevators...quit complaining that they are too dark people! It's all about design. So you know...the elevators are pitch black, you are in darkness, apart from 2 adjacent video screens with a superb, ongoing digital video collage...I seriously loved the ride up and down to our 14th floor. The screens DO provide some light, so it's not like you are fumbling around in the dark. We arrive on the 14th floor, heading down the minimal corridor to room 1414. The numbers are embossed in HUGE, vertically, on the door itself, as well as on small plates next to the door (I wonder if they had to add those because the complainers couldn't 'see' the numbers on the doors originally). We enter the room and need a moment to compose ourselves because the view just takes our breath away. We see ALL of downtown, the Hudson River, Jersey City, Madame Liberty in the distance, High Line park below. The floor to ceiling, room wide, windows are just superb. And yes...people can see into the rooms so beware, unless you like to put on a show for those down below. The room itself is also quite simply amazing. We took a Deluxe King...perfect choice, room enough to swing quite a few cats, very clever use of space and design. The bed was very, very comfortable, with the loveliest squishiest pillows I have slept on in a long time. The bath was more than big enough for the 2 of us...and if you are into that kinda thing, 3 is still not a crowd in that tub. The closet space is more than plenty for a typical weekend away in New York...we solved the suitcase 'space' issue by putting our cases in the corner of the room on a table, voila...nothing worth complaining about. The toiletries are provided by Kiss My Face...hide them daily so you keep getting more to take back home, they are lovely! The ONLY 1 downside to our room was that on Saturday night, we actually wanted an early night, but there is a bar down the road which does have an outside area belting music till the early hours. Brass Monkey I think it is called. The sound is muffled, the room insulation is very good, but still, I did use earplugs to drown out the slight noise. The issue is solved very easily...just use earplugs, or go down and join the party. This would not put me off staying at the Standard again. All in all, I highly recommend this hotel. It's all about design, cool, great atmosphere, catering to couples/singles...not families (I secretly like that fact).

Poor craftsmanship and maintenance meant scalding water came out of the bathtub, hot water out of the shower caused the smoke alarm to activate (with a disheartening lack of response to the alarm or our safety from the front desk) and bathroom design that causes shower water to wet the entire floor making it very slippery.

The nightlife here is very active--weekdays and weekends we witnessed crowds at 2 am and later--people who require very little sleep and/or don't go to work until the afternoon, if at all. Over the course of our 6 day stay, we saw exactly 3 children in the area, all during daylight hours and none within the hotel itself. The hotel offers queen or king rooms only; 2 people maximum per room. The nearest subway stop is about a 5 minute walk away. The Hotel Public Rooms. There is a large outdoor seating area in front of the lobby, which is smallish but stylish, a bit retro looking. The elevators all have 2 unique video screens playing a mesmerizing continuously scrolling presentation, with music. There are several lounge spaces on the ground floor, both indoors and out, with the largest being outdoors under (and protected by) the High Line--very popular. The restaurant The Standard Grill is adjacent, also with indoor and outdoor seating. Not yet opened is the top (18th) floor lounge/club, which apparently will have pool, and is certain to be a hot spot once it opens in about a month. It will surely be a velvet rope type of place, and I would expect there may be difficulty (or at least a wait) for guests just trying to return to their rooms. Even now, over the weekend there was security at the elevators, asking for room keys and checking guest names from a list. There is a large gym on the 17th floor with fabulous views in 3 directions, including the Hudson River. There is no business center (but Wifi is free) or spa. The Guestrooms. Our web rate was for a Standard Queen, but we were upgraded to a south-facing Superior Queen, a slightly smaller room but with a better view. Apparently all the Standard rooms face north, where one gets a glimpse of the river. High Line and Empire State Building, but mostly one sees a large building being built one block north. From the south-facing rooms, there are virtually no buildings taller that the hotel, so one can clearly see Downtown, the southern tip of the High Line, much better views of the Hudson River, New Jersey and the Statue of Liberty. We were informed at check-in as well as via a letter delivered to the room that the floor-to-ceiling windows were non-reflective, so without your drapes drawn, people below can see EVERYTHING, and this apparently has been an issue, based on things we'd read online. Indeed, whenever we looked down at the High Line, there were always people staring up at the hotel. The room was not large, but I've seen smaller in New York, and things were designed to maximize space--a built-in seating area, 2 sides of the bed placed flush against the wall (the person with the stronger bladder should sleep against the wall). The colour scheme is black, white and beige. The flat screen HD TV froze a lot. The bathroom was tiled in black with a laboratory-like sink and counter fixture. The bath products were cleverly packaged. Very early TA reviews of the hotel mentioned the flooding situation involving the shower, and we bore witness to this in our room. The shower is not enclosed, with only a small glass partition between it and the sink. Only the water temperature can be controlled, not the volume (this is true of practically every hotel shower we've used for the past few years), so the water naturally flows out onto the floor, which is not sloped enough towards the drain. We learned quickly to form a dam using a towel (very large and fluffy by the way) to contain the water. Indeed, after showering, the driest place in the bathroom was in the bathtub, which was huge and open to the bedroom with shutters. The toilet was in a separate water closet. The Staff and Service. The staff was all quite young and stylish, courteous and helpful for the most part. Male staffers seem to outnumber the females. Our one exception was with an unfriendly room service attendant, but this was after midnight and he was doing double duty--taking an order on a mobile phone while delivering our order. This was a fun hotel in a fun location. It's not a 5 star place, nor does it strive to be, but it delivered on most fronts. Again, it's not a place for families with small children or friends who are not intimate with each other. or for business.

You know what I mean, some scream 'business' or 'budget' or 'help i'm stuck in the 90's' but with The Standard there is none of that kind of aura. It's a place where you can be who you want to be and do what you want to do. Everything even down to the design of the rooms has a sense of fun about it (even some of the items in the Mini Bar)! My room had an amazing view down the Hudson towards The Statue of Liberty and downtown. While not being one of the biggest rooms, the clever layout and floor to ceiling glass made it seem spacious and roomy with a good sized and very comfortable bed and its own 'lounge area'. Other clever design details allow you to sit and enjoy a movie while lounging in the massive bathtub thanks to the window between the bathroom and the sleeping area. The overall design is spectacular and everything has been thought about down to the last detail. There is even a rather clever animation of 'heaven to hell' in each of the lifts. In fact I would love to have that as a screen saver for my Mac! The staff are friendly and helpful and don't pressure you. The Concierge even managed to get me a table at short notice for the newly opened and very popular Standard Grill which is superb. My sister has even gone as far as declaring it her new favorite New York restaurant! Room Service is great, efficient and very reasonably priced as is the Mini Bar and there is a great movie/tv/music choice on the generously sized flat screen TV.

For the most part, the staff was lovely, but I do concur with an earlier reviewer who referred to them as hipster. Mind you, if you are staying in the Meat Packing District, you need to buy into it and it was no surprise that the front office staff were all very attractive, young, stylish and well-coiffed. The housekeeping staff were all lovely and attractive and overly, far more friendly than some of the young front end people. Overall, the housekeeping staff was terrific! The rooms have a bit of a dorm room meets camper trailer feel to them. That said, I was paying the soft rate while they complete construction and have no complaints about that at all. The beds were very comfortable an the quality of linens was nice. I slept really well. But the white quilted blankets made me feel like I was in school and the seating area totally reminded me of camping when I was a kid. I would not be surprised if the table collapses into a bed. I do have one big complaint about this hotel. They need to seriously upgrade their product line of soaps and shampoos. They are also just a bit DUDE on that front. Spruce bubble bath? Ick! All the scents were very masculine. I'm not looking for super flowery either, but I don't want to come out of the bath smelling like a Christmas tree. The bubble bath and shower gel were a huge disappointment, especially given the massive bathtub. The packaging of all that stuff was also terrible. It looked like generic shampoos you might pick up at Walmart. They really need to upgrade that stuff, especially once they are off the soft rates and people are paying full price. The towels, however, are fantastic! Nothing like a massive bathsheet. A bathrobe would have been nice too. In general, I had a great stay and given where all my friends live, it was the perfect neighbourhood for me, but I'm not sure I would pay full price for one of these rooms. It just doesn't feel that luxurious. Clean and comfortable? Absolutely! Luxury? Not really. But perhaps that not what they are aiming for. The architecture of this building is great!", "Date": "June 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cOMG, the VIEWS!\u201d", "Author": "LRK", "ReviewID": "UR31860974", "Content": "We were delighted by our short stay at the Standard. We reserved 2 standard queen rooms. We had to beg for the reservation since normally they have a two night minimum, but when I explained this was a special occasion (our daughter's 21st birthday), they were kind enough to make an exception. We couldn't get in on the soft opening deal of $195/night, but felt the $265/a night quoted price was pretty good for NYC. We were wowed by the contemporary decor that greeted us in the lobby. I had not been to NYC in 16 years, and was quite surprised by the friendliness of the staff, not even a molecule of snootiness--warm, friendly, fun, and helpful. We were blown away when we were told BOTH rooms had been upgraded in honor of our daughter's birthday. Our daughter was given a river view room that was mind-blowing. Although all rooms have floor to ceiling, wall to wall windows with amazing views, at the foot of her bed was a panoramic view of the Hudson river that she will never forget. Even the statue of Liberty was visible. The totally full moon and fireworks display rather added to the excitement of this awesome view in the evening. For New York standards, the room was nicely sized, with a nice contemporary table, huge tub, and rainforest shower. Big fluffy towels (lots of them), and an amazingly well stocked minibar were part of the charm. Our second room (upgraded to a standard King) had a great city view showcasing the Empire State Building. The bed was so comfortable, with wonderful linens. The flat screened TV, glass-walled rain forest shower (in the middle of the room) and comfy contemporary chairs (to position for staring out the window or using at the table) were nice touches as well. The Elevators--so fun! Cartoon/animated-like displays of \"Wonder World\" (hard to describe but a must-see) were whimsical, entertaining, and unique. Clearly this hotel does not take itself overly seriously as so many NY hotels do. The staff courteously accommodated every request--supplying shaving cream and toothpaste on request, and answering all questions regarding directions, travel times, etc. Room service breakfast no longer free and restaurant not yet open, but we ordered coffee and rolls and it was extremely reasonable and prompt. The only suggestion I would make is installing black-out linings behind the drapes (the sun REALLY makes itself known in the morning), but on second thought, who has time to sleep in while visiting the Big Apple? The hip meat packing district where the hotel is located is really convenient in terms of being in a central location and very \"mid town buzzy\" and young. I highly recommend this hotel. although apparently all the views are great, if at all possible, splurge and get a room with a river view, it's spectacular and worth it for a memorable experience in New York.", "Date": "June 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm", "Title": "\u201cAlright\u201d", "Author": "ChrissySweden", "ReviewID": "UR31688883", "Content": "Stayed here for four nights in May.

The view is simply unforgettable and the suite design and layout was gorgeous. A big two-person bathtub, a comfortable (if squeaky) king sized bed. A two-head rain shower in the bathroom. Because of the very modern design, yes, some water does get around the bathroom etc but who cares? The AC does work with a min temp of 60F.
