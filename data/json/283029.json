Expensive, very \"boutique\" very design-conscious. However, if you're going for the exclusive end of the market, the devil is in the detail. The location is superb. Very quiet, minutes from Vondelpark with the Vertigo cafe (the film museum is moving). Minutes from Leidseplein with trams to all parts. Close to the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh museum too. There are several REALLY good restaurants nearby, and a host of great walks (one reviewer mentioned this being out of the way; it took me twenty minutes to walk to Centraal - so it's not that bad!) We didn't include breakfast (we went to Pancake Corner one day, and Vertigo another), as at 19 Euros, it seemed a little steep. The staff were very welcoming and helpful. Our first room was tiny. Laughably so. It was [literally] impossible to walk other than sideways from the TV onwards. The TV itself was against a side wall, and had top be manoeuvred out to be watched, then getting it back in to avoid limbo-dancing past it required a degree in mechanical engineering. There was no welcome manual in the room, so the Nespresso machine was a mystery to me. There was only one remote, but two TVs. The bathroom mirror was badly cracked, and the crack had collected a fair bit of dirt, so it had been that way for some time. There was also mould between some shower tiles. We went for a walk just after 0900, and returned at 1530, to find the room had not yet been made up. Conversely, a good read of any establishment is how they handle complaints; we made the cracked mirror and mould issues known to the staff, and were whisked off to another, larger room with profuse apologies, and a lovely bottle of wine and some canapes. This room had all the remotes! And a welcome manual. Multiple TVs are a nice idea, but if you ARE going to put them in the room (and personally I have no need for them) - make it elegant, both in appearance and in use. All three TVs had different channel set-ups, so if you were watching something fascinating that you wanted to continue in the shower (?) - finding it was an exercise in frustration, as the channel numbers were not the same. Appearance: the idea of hidden DVD players is very nice, but a hotel of this style shouldn't have spaghetti nests of cable hanging below TVs on the wall. Another small point (I did say these were small issues) is that there was a separate alcove at the far end of the room, which was a lovely idea; perhaps your partner wants to snooze, and you fancy reading a book? Unfortunately there is no separate lighting for these areas, so your partner can damn well try to sleep with the lights on! It's a double room, but there is only one miniature shower gel and one shampoo bottle in the toilet. A small point, but it makes a difference. A big problem is the noise: I know I said it's a quiet area (and it is), but the three big rooms on the ground floor are right next to the kitchen, which starts clattering a LOT around 0700. Then you have early-rising guests shouting conversations to the staff, from the dining room to the reception desk. Good - Great staff. A nice \"living room\" feel to the lounge area. A laptop for Internet access. On that note - I'm not overly keen on hotels charging for Wifi. We know how much it costs, and it's not a killer for a hotel, but it makes a huge difference to the stay if you need access. Paying daily or hourly rates seems cheap and tacky. Very comfy beds - VERY comfy! Like I said -these are all small points, but they did add up to let the hotel down. A few tweaks to the fine details would make this a highly enjoyable stay.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane Australia", "Title": "\u201cA nice little hotel\u201d", "Author": "LukeBris90", "ReviewID": "UR122675518", "Content": "I stayed here for 2 nights and liked the hotel.

All in all - the location is fantastic and the room is ok if all you care about is the bed and the bath - which was my main focus. The breakfast you may want to skip - the service was very slow and no one was clearing away the table so we could sit down so I had to do it. The food on offer wasn't exactly the freshest either. You are much better off going to a cafe nearby. For 260 a night it is fine. The bed did not have a mattress cover which I found slightly odd for a hotel - just a sheet.

There was nothing egregiously wrong with the hotel, but I'm not sure \"boutique\" hotels are for us. Our check-in experience was fine, and our initial impressions of the room and hotel were fine. We thought the shower and sink in the bathroom were stylish, but not very practical (in fact, our stay at this hotel has prompted us to jokingly define \"boutique\" as \"the people who designed this stuff may not have ever actually used it themselves\"). The DVD player in our room didn't work properly, which was no big deal in itself, but we were surprised when we called to report it that the hotel had to send out for someone from their \"sister hotel\" to come and fix it. It was indeed fixed, but the player is oddly located in the coat closet by the room door and in order to pause, ff, rewind, etc, you need to jump up from the bed and point the remote at the player in the closet. Very strange. On checkout, the elevator was not working and they again had to send out for someone from the \"sister hotel\" to come and fix it. Again, maybe not a huge deal but we were on a timeline to catch a train and had to tell the hotel ourselves that the elevator wasn't working - and then it took some time for the \"sister hotel\" person to arrive to fix it. We got the impression that there was really only one person in charge at this hotel, who for the vast majority of issues had to call the \"sister hotel\" for resolution. It seemed to us that, compared to other hotels in Europe at which we stayed on this trip, the Hotel Roemer was skewed a bit low in terms of value for money. Were we to return to Amsterdam, we'd probably look to stay somewhere else (although we thought the location was fine). Don't get me wrong - there was nothing obviously bad or objectionable about the hotel, it's really just an accumulation of small things that make you go \"hmm\". On the plus side, the hotel embraces an \"all-inclusive\" concept, which in part means that they provide you with carafes of liquor in your room that are complementary.

The hotel is absolutely lovely, very modern and nicely laid out. Can't comment on breakfast as it was \u00c2\u00a320 per person per day for breakfast so we ate out, but if you're all inclusive breakfast is obviously included as are the complimentary spirits in the room, otherwise you pay around \u00c2\u00a33.50 per drink. Our room, number 27, was lovely and quiet and the bed was huge and very comfortable. Patio doors open onto a large balcony, however there is a fire escape that runs down through all the balconys so you couldn't leave the doors open if you left the room/at night for security. The bathroom is amazing, the shower is powerful and the spa bath works great. Even has a flat screen TV in the bathroom. There is a DVD player in the bedroom and coffee maker for expresso, no milk for regular coffee though. The staff were all lovely and were happy to help with any questions. They, like all the dutch, speak fantastic English. There's a lap top in reception you can use for free for internet access. When we arrived we walked from the main station and it took around 30 minutes to get there, but it is a pleasant walk, all be it a bit crowded with a suitcase. I would suggest if you plan to walk it you get a good idea of roads to walk down so you aren't standing outside the station with a map, drawing attention to yourself as a tourist. We walked around the city late at night and never felt threatened or concerned for our safety, as long as you aren't making yourself a target, as in any city, you would be fine. We loved the whole break and if you like walking there is so much to see and the city is easy to navigate with a map which you can get from the hotel. There is a lift in the hotel, but it is painfully slow to arrive. The one problem with the city is it is so packed with bikes, cars, scooters, trams, and taxi bikes it is actually dangerous at times, and you have to constantly check what's around you at junctions. One particular junction I checked and stepped out only to take a girl off her bike completely. No one was injured, but it was a bit of a shock for all concerned, so beware.

Having almost been mown down twice by the aforesaid two-wheelers on a very wet day at the tail-end of summer, we arrived at the compact five-storey Hotel Roemer. In fact, we were two hours early, so we left our bags with the friendly lady at reception and went in search of a leisurely lunch. Returning after 15:00, we were pleased to discover that we'd been upgraded to a junior suite; not so good was the fact that the inclusive breakfast had disappeared from the booking, although this was quickly rectified. The suite (room #14) was a reasonable size, with a king size bed, a two-persons en suite bathroom (i.e., double sink, double shower and jacuzzi bath), two comfortable leather armchairs, a table and chairs, and a separate dressing area with ample hanging space. This particular suite is on the lower ground floor, with doors onto a terrace with a table and chairs, and stairs up to the garden. If the weather had lived up to the expectations of late August, the extra outside space would have been perfect. Two minor drawbacks of the suite are the low ceiling and the lack of view that one would get (or would have got) with the executive rooms on the upper floors. Other perks include free decanters of gin, vodka and whisky and three flatscreen TVs dotted around the place, including in the bathroom. The room was quiet apart from first thing in the morning when there's plenty of foot traffic from upstairs. Wifi is available in the rooms and works well, but there's an extra charge of six euros for 24 hrs of access. Hotel Roemer's inclusive rate also includes soft drinks, spirits and wine in the comfortable lounge, with bottles open for consumption from 17:00 until bedtime. The 'bites' served afternoon and evening rarely appeared. The interior design of the lounge is commendably up to date, with excellent art work on the walls, chill-out music, and an intriguing, arachnoid ceiling light made from multiple anglepoise lamps. Hotel Roemer has no restaurant as such but there is room service which offers the usual club sandwiches and so on. One restaurant not mentioned in TripAdvisor's 1,147 Amsterdam eateries is 'Joost, eat & drink' in its sister hotel, Hotel Vondel, just around the corner. This scores high with interior design and handsome waiters but the food is only average. Breakfast is served from 7:00 - 11.00 and includes the usual continental options of fruit juices, fresh fruit, cereals, breads, mini croissants, pastries and jams. Bacon, scrambled eggs and sausages are included but they're on a burner. A la carte is also available. There's only a small number of tables so you may find yourself having to wait. Checkout is usually 12:00, but is extendable without charge to 13:00, which fitted well with our flight back to Heathrow at 16:30.

Unfortunately we had to ask them for the champagne that was included in our package and we did not get the slippers and bubble bath as is meant to be included aswell! Not very good service!!! The spirits in the room had enough in the bottles for only 2 drinks of each and we had to ask 3 times for these to be refilled. The mini bar was very basic - 2 beers, 2 cokes, 2 diet cokes, 2 oj, 2 tonic water, peanuts and pringles. On ourlast day the mini bar was not topped up at all. We went for the all inclusive package so all this was included in the price as well as drinks in the bar downstairs. We did sit downstairs a couple of times but felt a bit awkward as it is self service and the white wine bottles were only half full so when we had a glass each we had to move to something else. We just felt for the price that they were rather stingy on the things that are meant to be included. I would have rather spent less on a room and gone to a bar elsewhere and paid for the drinks.

We weren't impressed at all as we both work in the industry and run a Bed and Breakfast in UK and know what standards to expect. The breakfast was ok, there was a menu that was pretty basic. No muesli just a couple of cereals. I ordered two poached eggs and when they came they were hard and awful - I am a chef and know it is not hard to poach an egg! The feeling at breakfast was rather sterile and no one was very friendly - which is a shame it's nice to have someone that looks like they enjoy their job and likes talking to guests.

The interiors of the wardrobes, and some of the ornaments were very dusty. The bathroom floor had feet marks on it, as the sink had soap marks on it. I think that probably this kind of marble is difficult to clean, but this is not an excuse to leave it stained. The breakfast was good, but I ordered fried eggs, and one of the eggs was broken (had its yolk mixed with the white). I good chef would have discarded this eggs and prepared new ones. The second day I was served perfect fried eggs. I ordered rosti (potatos, it was in the menu). The first day they said they ran out of it. Fair enough. But the second day they told me that rosti was actually toast, and that I could have it from the buffet. Nonsense. Free minibar was included in my room, but the second day they didn't restock it, so I had to ask for it twice, and the drinks were warm when they finally arrived.

My husband and I were on our honeymoon and we booked 3 nights at Hotel Vondel (sister property). Upon arrival, we were early so our room was not ready. We walked into for a couple of hours, had lunch only to return and discover we were upgraded to a junior suite at Hotel Roemer, located around the corner. The front desk manager personally walked us over to the hotel and we were impressed. Granted, Hotel Vondel looked wonderful as well, but Roemer was definitely a step above. When we were shown to our room, we were just in awe. While smaller than most hotel rooms (this is Europe), the room was one of the most modern and luxurious rooms I've stayed in. The bathroom was amazing with a wonderful shower and jet tub, we also had a balcony which would would have liked to enjoyed if it weren't so cold Considering we booked Hotel Vondel for $149 a night, we could not have been more pleased. The staff was very helpful. There is a computer in the lobby to use for free and even a bar. The only complaint is the breakfast buffet. It looked wonderful but, if I remember correctly, the cost was outrageous, something like $50 dollars per person - I've paid less than that at the Ritz Carlton in Singapore. However, I'm not going to go on a rant about such a minor thing - I'd rather enjoyed the pancakes at one of the many pancake houses in Amsterdam. The hotel is a little walk from the city center but it truly is not that bad.

First, for the first four mornings, the staff kept asking us for our confirmation to make sure that breakfast was included. I eventually emailed back the reservation to the hotel to clear things up. Second was the way that they handled breakfast. There aren't enough spaces for all the guests to eat at once, which is fine, but they don't have an orderly system to seat people when it's busy. Clearly a foreseeable problem. [We were directed to wait on the couches until a place was available, only to have other guests seat themselves at dirty tables. I was told by the staff that they didn't want to insult these people by telling them to wait, and instead chose to insult the rest of us who were already waiting. (I sound like an old geezer, don't I?) ] All of this leads me to the conclusion that the place is disorganized; management ought to know that the problem exists but chooses to ignore what a few simple changes would fix.

We wanted to stay somewhere with a boutique feel, and for us it came down to Banks Mansion and Hotel Roemer. As we were already pushing the boat out, and we had found a deal that made Roemer a bit cheaper, we plumped for the latter. So glad we did! Got the train from the airport to central station and found the tram which takes you to Leidseplein. Total cost was about 8.5 euros each compared to about 40 euros from the airport and probably took about the same amount of time. Tram is a great way to get about and get a feel for where you are. Found the hotel easily and was immediately made to feel at home with a glass of wine. After booking in and getting an amazing room upgrade (still not quite sure how we managed that!) we settled in to the suite (room 14) in the basement. I have read reviews about this room, and you definitely have to realise that even though the room is amazing and massive, the trade off is that its under the main eating area and therefore prone to noise. Not quite sure how as there are so many thick rugs up in the breakfast/bar area. Earplugs and large nightcaps sorted out this problem for us. We certainly can't complain as we got the suite upgrade for free, but I would imagine if you were paying for the extra room, you may be a bit disappointed with the noise. But I hope that doesn't put people off as it was still the best room i've ever stayed in. Great double rain shower, double jacuzzi bath, walk in wardrobe, huge bed (but two singles on a king frame), 3 tv's, nespresso, private access to the garden. Unfortunately the DVD player didn't work. The staff are all very friendly, and I have to agree with other reviewers that it is sometimes a bit chaotic, especially at breakfast time. If its busy you may not get served for a while, so make sure you help yourself to the bits that are out. We weren't sure on the first day whether to help ourselves to drinks etc, but soon learnt that this is the best way of getting on with things there. Treat the place a bit like home from home and it will make it all a lot easier! Cleaning staff are ok, but a bit hot and cold. We liked to take a glass or two of wine down with us when we got back in the evening and by the end of the 3 night stay we had about 10 wine glasses with us! But otherwise it was always spotless. Great location for Van Gogh and Reiksmuseum. Vondelpark is a great place to spend a few chilled hours and the restaurant under the film museum there is a definite recommendation. Would also recommend the canal bus as well. Great way of learning about the canals and seeing the city. All in all an amazing weekend in a perfect hotel.

Every other meal was room service. (Side note here... when I get sick, I get PICKY about what I eat! I'm a sensitive creature.) I had not one complaint about the food. They brought us every extra condiment, utensil, and plate we could have possibly needed, and then left us to enjoy our meals. And the hotels happy hour!!! I don't remember the exact times, but it seemed to run all day long! Free drinks... an entire table just lined with beers and liquor.... you could make your own, or they would make one for you.

Tub and all... The backgarden was such a treat, calm and secluded (as secluded as you can get in Amsterdam I guess LOL) Some other reviewers have commented on the size of the rooms, and me never having seen the reg. sized rooms I don't know. However my boyfriend is a BIG guy, 6'6 (2m), and he was very comfortable. This says a lot. We have also travelled a lot so we do have something to compare with.

Even though we arrived late because of delayed flights into Schipol we received a very warm welcome from a lovely girl on reception who couldn't have been more helpful. They helped us with our luggage and showed us around the room. I think they have recently introduced their all-incl policy so were quite keen to tell us about the mini-bar being included as well as the bar downstairs. You also get a carafe of whisky, gin and vodka in your room which all seems rather exotic, but the reality is that we simply didn't use it. I'm not sure how much extra you are paying for this on top of the previous room prices, but I think it would be ideal if you were in Amsterdam for a party weekend, stag, hen etc and were into slamming back shots and draining the mini bar, but we were so busy out and about that we just didn't make best use of it. The downstairs bar use would be ideal if you were lazing around reading newspapers and magazines, I could really see you getting the advantage, but again we were out all the time so didn't get the best use of it. We booked an executive room and I must definitely agree with the previous reviews that say the rooms are tiny. I wouldn't like to see a standard sized room! But we knew this before we went and were prepared for it, and I think that boutique hotels in Amsterdam would be largely the same becuase of the general size of buildings etc in the city. One thing I have to mention is that, as I said at the beginning, I was staying on for two nights on business and had made a separate reservation for a smaller room (limited business expenses!!!) but they linked our two reservations and let me stay in the same room for no extra charge which I thought was very generous of them. Space for breakfast was tight and I don't think they were full so I would think it could only get worse at high season. But if you time it right then I would say the food served is some of the best we've had. Again, staying in boutique hotels comes with some quirks so you need to prepared for them, i.e. one of the breakfast tables is a high level 'breakfast bar' sort of affair which leaves you perched on tall stools. Fine if you're not planning to take your time over things or if you're not dying of hangover!! We came and went as we pleased and there was someone on reception 24/7 as far as we could tell. The biggest downside had to be room service/cleaning. I'm not sure if what we experienced was 'the norm' or if they were a bit short-staffed that week but they really need to give their housekeeping a shake. Our mini bar and coffee was not restocked leaving us with no water etc and considering it was an all-incl they definitely saved a few bucks by not restocking! The standard of cleaning was poor and whilst we didn't expect them to pick up after us, a bit of a tidy up wouldn't have gone a-miss! We ran out of tissues on day one and it wasn't restocked - our fault to a certain extent as we kept forgetting to mention to reception on the way out - and one day we were left with nothing but decaf coffee for the nespresso machine (which is a fab machine by the way!!). Also, the night before I was due to check out, they removed the bathrobes and cut down on the towels, which made us feel a bit cheap as presumably they expected us to try and nick them??!?!?? Our sheets were not changed during the entire stay and, well, most of us at home go at least a week without changing bed linen which meant that we weren't particularly repulsed, but part of staying in a hotel means that you do expect fresh sheets more frequently! Definitely some room for improvement, but overall it didn't really spoil our stay completely as the service from other parts of the hotel compensated. It's very handily located and is convenient for Vondel Park and the museum quarter. It took us more than an hour to wander down to Centraal Station but we were wombling along taking photographs. I reckon if you put your mind to it and were in a hurry you could walk it in 30 mins. Other reviewers have commented on the number of flat screen TVs and I would definitely agree. We had three, one of which we never used because it was pointing towards the whisky corner with chairs that we never used and the one in the bathroom we used about twice, so really just the one in the main bedroom by the bed would be sufficient. Again, it's hard to tell how much extra you end up paying for things like this but I'm sure it's added in somewhere. We would also say that noise carries between the rooms and between the floors - we seemed to be above the kitchen and I was disturbed with banging and crashing from time to time and our room always seemed to smell of cooked food which bothered me some days more than others. But again - overall we would say that it was a pleasant stay and as long as you've read reviews like this and are prepared for what you are going to then it never seems to be so bad!! For what we needed, it did the job. And again - a special mention to the reception staff who were always extremely polite and helpful and willing to go that extra mile. We had a hiccup with a car hire booking and they couldn't have done enough to help and were more than willing to get on the phone and lambast the car hire company for their failings.

The location is ok about 5 minutes walk or less from the tram stop (Leidseplein) you can take route 1,2 or 5 and the hotel is more or less on the road behind Mariott. From there you can walk to Rijks museum, Vondel park and many more.

We went down to the reception and asked but were told it was the executive room. Later, I found out there are rooms in our floor which is bigger so perhaps not all excutive rooms are small. Apart from that, the hotel is wonderful. It's location is perfect with the wonderful Vodler Park right next to it.

We went for a fun break away, and we wer glad we stayed here. I think the greatest thing about the hotel is its location. It is in a quiet street, very close to the nicest shopping street and the vondelpark. The museum district and the De Prijp (best place for non-tourist type restaurants and bars) area are also stroll away. But best of all, its a good distance away from the sleaze of the red light district!The room itself was very nicely decorated - everything is modern and comfortable. The bathroom was lovely with a jacuzzi bath and rain shower. Our main complaint about the room was its size - it was quite small and pokey. However i have heard that this is standard for Amsterdam hotels so we didnt dwell on this. The other negative was that i had booked a twin room and also emailed the hotel to confirm it was in fact a twin. When we arrived it was two beds pushed together that for some reason could not be pulled apart. We were informed this was the only type of room they had, so i felt i had been misled during the booking process. The hotel operates on a 'fully inclusive' basis. This basically means you can have free minibar, drinks in the bar and breakfast. Dont be fooled by this - we just had breads in the morning which can be bought cheaply elsewhere. Plus the booze didnt have labels and we suspect was cheap. We booked thinking this would save us money overall even though the hotel was pricey - i dont think it did so be careful of this trap/gimmick! One other thing to note: we asked the staff twice for help on things to do, and they werent able to do anything for us. While they were very nice people this was disappointing. Overall i have to say we enjoyed ourselves and would consider staying in this hotel again - depending on the price!

The location is fantatic but get your bearings because the streets look the same so sometimes a wrong turn can put you right off track - the best way to the local bars clubs etc is to go through and behind the Hard Rock Cafe - once here you can get anywhere from the shopping areas right to red light district and dam square. Vondel Park is like 3-5 minutes away and also the trams are great - quick clean and on time they can take you anywhere and fast too! cabs in to dam sqaure are cheap too so if your out late get one back! we got lost on the way home just becuase we preferred to walk talking in the sights and sounds! there are also bikes with a small carrier at the back perfect for 2 people - they are cheap and about 6 euro per person (12 Euro as they only hold 2 people) but you can get these anywhere and the drivers tend to give you a tour, expaining what everything is as you pass - good to know stuff too! all in all we had a great stay and saw and did so much - the hotel is great and i will be staying again soon! thanks for a great stay! and Amsterdam in itself is a lovely place - no matter what your going for you can find it there! the hotel Roemer is great value for money, location, comfort, and ambience! go there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i have been to amsterdam about 20 times (my job takes me there too) and on all types of visits from working, with the lads on a crazy weekend, with a girl on a quiet relaxing break, on a music holiday to go clubbing and raving etc - and also a 17 year old years ago to experience the place and definitley the hotel Roemer just had something special so would say its better then the 5 star hotels i stay in when working in amsterdam! thanks!

Either they were all new or just hadn't had sufficient experience running a small boutique hotel. The young man who checked us in was quite arrogant and was little help acting in concierge capacity. The woman working in the bar was a great help and very knowledgeable about local restaurants and bars. The hotel offered us complimentary breakfast for a couple of inconveniences that we experienced during our stay. This was a nice touch and the breakfast was great. Here is an example of the poor management. If your hotel is sold out you should plan for more than 8 people to have breakfast at 9:00 AM on a Sunday morning. Guests were arriving to the breakfast area only to find that seating wasn't available. There was also quite some confusion operating the espresso machine to get espresso drinks for the guests.

My suggestion, if you do care about the room size, is to take the king executive rooms in the second floor, without balcony, but with much larger space in the room itself (Room number 30).
