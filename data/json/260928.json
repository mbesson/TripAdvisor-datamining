{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Not worth it This hotel is owned by the same man who owns Pension Bruns (which is much nicer and quieter by the way). We had originally booked into Pension Bruns, but there was a guest who had overstayed and could not be found or contacted. The owner moved us to his property Hotel an der Galluswarte. He called for and paid for the taxi, so that was appropriate. The room at the Galluswarte, however, left a lot to be desired. Lights not working, fan in bathroom made screeching noise and moved zero air, holes knocked in door... Basically a shambles. We are good campers, and found it easy to roll with the punches on this one. The staff were actually very nice and helpful. They get a 4.0-5.0 rating. Just the room and location get the 2.0 rating. It was very convenient to the Galluswarte metro station, but most decent hotels are just as close to one station or another. I would say you could get much better for your money, especially if you look in the outskirts of Frankfurt....", "Date": "Sep 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR457560067", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "MaxAndKaia"}, {"Content": "Terrible Experience! Eight months before our trip to Frankfurt, we made a reservation at this hotel for a 1-week stay for 50 Euros a night. The hotel manager sent us several confirmations of our reservation and took our credit card information. Several months went by....just before we were to leave for our trip, they informed us that they had made a mistake and the rates had risen to 130 Euros a night, more than double the price, and we could either pay that price or find another place to stay! They did not honor our reservation, and raised the rates on us after we had a confirmed reservation with them. The bottom line: do not stay there.....there are many better places to stay in Frankfurt. This hotel is certainly not worth the price they are charging and the headache they have caused us.", "Date": "Dec 22, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR705858218", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d260928-r8852185-Hotel_An_Der_Galluswarte-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "260928", "Price": "$97"}}
