Our balcony room was nothing like these pictures.On our arrival we were asked to pay for our entire 4 night stay before we were given a key - that should have been enough to start the alarm bells ringing. This experience has taught me that if a hotel ever request this pre-payment that travellers ask to see their room before handing over any money.The room was very dated, with old curtains, carpet, tiles, kitchen units etc - this is not so important in the scheme of things, but the fittings in the bathrooms were so old that the vanity basin had large dirty-looking cracks in it (not hygenic at all), the base of the toilet leaked (in the middle of the night it is hard to avoid the puddle) and the standard of housekeeping was not good. There were hairs in the basin and bath, gunge around the taps and soap-holding slots, and the toilet was old and unclean-looking. When we complained about the room not being as we had imagined from the website the receptionist ignored us and walked into the back room (I guess she gets tired of that complaint).The restaurant is over-priced. We did not eat there because we tried the coffee on our arrival (it took about 15 minutes - the waiter forgot, even though we were the only people there) - it was cold, weak and tasted like bad instant coffee.The rooftop area is very attractive, good for taking a bottle of wine up to.There were no bugs of any sort so that aspect was good, especially for that area of Sydney, which has a lot of cockroaches.Overall, I would not stay there again. However it is handy to restaurants and Kings Cross so for the price is not too bad. Just don't expect it to be beautiful.", "Date": "Jul 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR911415196", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Libertas"}, {"Content": "nothing special Having just returned from a world trip, the morgan hotel was one of the worst we stayed in , the hotel is in need of a good clean and an update.We had a load of bags and cases and nobody helped us up the steps to the hotel, after we booked in we entered the small smelly threadbare lift to our room. The room was not hoovered as there were bits all over the floor, i cleaned the bath which had pubic hair all over it!!. The area is a bit rough further down the road( sex clubs ect) but it did have some good restaurants especially across the road for breakfast and i can recommend the indian down the road about 100 metres.

From the moment my partner and I arrived at Morgans in Sydney, we were so glad we had chosen this hotel. The food was to die for, such a healthy and creative menu, and the location and service were spot on. We were looking for a stylish and funky boutique hotel as a central base for sightseeing, and that is exactly what we got! The rooftop bar area has spectacular views of the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House and as my partner was from the UK he was suitably impressed with the location. The hotel decor was very cool and the staff friendly and helpful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting great food, a central Sydney location and easy going, laid back staff.

It wasn't. The room itself was adequate but not in great condition (in particular the bathroom needed a lot of modernisation) and it was rather noisy - we could hear everything from the adjacent room. The public areas of the hotel were dated and some of the reception staff not exactly helpful. I though the area around the hotel was pretty good - we felt safe, and there were a number of good restaurants and cafes, which helped make up for the fact that the hotel cafe was expensive and mediocre.

I booked this hotel because of the description i found on Wotif, which made it sound like a quality hotel in a good area. This is not exacly true. The hotel is located very close to Kings Cross and as a result, is in a fairly seedy area. The rooms are medium size (i booked a one bedroom apartment) and are reasonably well appointed but lack some attention to detail you would expect for a 4 star hotel. The bathroom was a particular issue for me as the shower was inside the bath and the windows didn't lock !!! Also, the room the bedroom didn't seem clean and the TV channels were not tuned in properly. The mini bar was also I won't be staying here again but that is only because of the location.

After having read reviews, it was no different to what we had expected. Cooking facilities pretty basic but we ate out most of the time (I think we went to the same pizza place as a previous reviewer, and they were right - food was dire!) One warning - our room was at the front of the hotel and the Friday and Saturday night of our stay was extremely noisy due to the music in the bars in the street below and people screaming and shouting.

Having read several trip reports before booking this hotel we knew what to expect - we were not disappointed. The room was a reasonable size - certainly not BIG as described in one report. Nice to have self-catering facilities although we didn't use them, except to boil a kettle and to eat breakfast. Hot water was always available although the towels had seen better days. The room looked out on to an enclosed central courtyard and so was rather dull and the decorations did nothing to brighten it up - but the bed was very comfortable. The area around the hotel is seedy, but not as bad as it was a few years ago - it is Kings Cross after all.Transport, both bus and train, is very close to the hotel so the tourist spots are very accessible. However, all the best and/or most interesting restaurants are around the tourist spots such as Circular Quay. Despite what some reports suggest we found no good eating places in the area of the hotel - cheap and plentiful yes, but not good. In fact, we had the worst pizza we have ever been served only 50m from the hotel's front door. But , on the other hand, we also had a good Indian! When one has been sight seeing all day, the last thing one wants to have to do is go back in the evening to those areas for dinner.

Booked this hotel through M Power Accomodation who stated that it was a 4 star hotel in a  Trendy Inner City Location with an  air of sophicitation . Firstly this was not a 4 star hotel as when we arrived we found the hotel to be of very poor quality - 2 star in our opinion and the rooms were very tired and basic. Not at all like the description and pictures from M Powers Web Site. We stay in the honeymoon suite - avoid!! There is an air conditioning power unit outside of the bedroom area which was very noisy all night - thus no sleep! We tried to ring reception but no one works at night and you have to ring an emergency number - but no one could help us. The area we found not to be trendy but was very seedy. When we spoke to our taxi driver when getting out of the hotel he confirmed that it was a very renounded bad area. Hence we can only presume the reason for the security door at the front of this hotel which is always locked. Overall should avoid this hotel and never using M Power Accomodation as in our opinion they give misleading information.", "Date": "Feb 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR872463868", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Paul072"}, {"Content": "It's okay       bathroom", "Date": "Jan 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR698358644", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "AucklandVisitor"}, {"Content": "What a Pleasurable Experience My husband and I just had the pleasure of staying at Morgans Hotel in Victoria Street Darlinghurst.
