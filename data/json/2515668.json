Stephanie in the restaurant is really a top star, as is John in the restaurant - super friendly and very enthusiastic. I remember tipping him almost half of the bill, just because he was both charming and on his game. The food was delicious. I was physically ill, unfortunately, during this trip. My wife was able to get some medicines from the gift shop (the lady in the gift shop was VERY nice and felt bad that I was sick!) - and I guess if you're going to be sick on vacation, being sick where there's a nice view is about as good as it can get. The room was comfortable, and the sunsets were beautiful. Even at my worst, I couldn't help but enjoy the view and the beauty of the property. The balcony was nice and spacious, and room service was friendly and the food - again - was good. Front desk was ok, but not very personable. I was surprised, and a little worried when checking in, but everyone else was nice. Additionally, $16. for parking is really ridiculous, and I think a little creepy after paying over $1000. for three nights. No amenities were considered, and no manager to discuss it with. I guess after $1000, who cares about another 1.6%, but after the fact, I just don't like the concept. It's like getting a hotel room only to find a pay toilet in the room. Who does that these days?

This really bugs me because the first two hotels on this trip were no problem at all and then this hotel is nothing but internet problems. I\u2019m guessing this would be blamed on the hotels internet provider, his tools and program setup. The internet here was free. Used the guest laundry, and had difficulties there as well. The washing machines took nothing but quarters, $1.50 per load, a few loads of washing and drying used up a $10 roll of quarters. The dollar changer did not work prompting a fairly long walk to the office to get change. The office was apologetic and provided the change but all in all it was an unnecessary hassle and the high price of the machines provided no feeling of quality.

On the left hand side is a nice big bathroom with plenty of counter space and even a few shelves for storage. At the end of the hall is the living room. It has a pocket door to separate the rooms. Their was a couch that pulled out to a bed, chair, coffee table, two end tables, a small round table with 3 chairs, and another dresser with tv. The best part of that room was the whole back wall was the balcony doors and windows that covered the whole room. The balcony was huge. A small table with four chairs and also a lounge chair. They have two pools. The one we used was big and nice and warm. They had plenty of lounge chairs, 2 cabanas, and a hot tub. We tried both restaurants. The firefly had a nice atmosphere. I felt it was a tad expensive for the quality. We only went to the Blue Pearl for breakfast and felt the value was good. I've read many people where charged $18 a night for parking. When making reservations they gave me a rate of $8. Maybe because we were staying for 7 nights. When entering the parking lot you must scan your room key which can be stubborn. It took me 12 scans once before the gate would open. I really have no complaints. You for sure need a car to stay here, IMO. However I felt it was centrally located. Most places we went to were a short 5-10min drive. I choose this hotel for the extra green space that it gave my boys for running around and the suite style rooms and would stay here again.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "oakville", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing resort\u201d", "Author": "maltesefalcon54", "ReviewID": "UR124738500", "Content": "The setting is out of this world. the location is great.

The Blue Pearl was great, the food was well done and very reasonably priced, they are very accommodating to children (always had the crayons and colouring sheets ready!) and service was friendly and fast. My husband especially loved the huevos rancheros. The grounds were nice, with lots of plants and trees. There was a grassy area near our room that was good for playing on, and I saw other guests playing badminton there. There's a nice walking path that takes you from the marina, around the point, and on down the beach. We enjoyed walking it every day, although we did see homeless people sleeping in the park area beside the highway. The location is great, there is a shuttle to SeaWorld if you are going, and a quick drive (or medium walk) over the bridge to the beaches on the other side.

This was a hotel room, not a condo, but the kingsize bed & furnishings were well placed and roomy. Ice machine down the walkway outside room, elevator is handy for unloading car. We took our bikes and they were welcome, as you can bike everywhere, along the bays, parks, marinas, and only 1/2 mile to Mission Beach & the boardwalk strand there. Fish the bay, or charter a boat, there is lots of activity on the bay waters (gulls, pelicans, coots, ducks, etc) or take the short hop to Mission Beach and walk along the shore, we spotted dolphins out jumping beyond where the surfers were waiting for the next ride in. The Sea World exit is only a 1/2 mile in the other direction. After a busy day, you can come back to the Dana and have a swim in the heated pool overlooking the bay/marina area. Heaven....

It reminded me of a tropical resort in layout -- similar to properties I have stayed at in Hawaii and the Dominican Republic. The location is perfect, quiet and on the bay, but convenient to everything San Diego has to offer. When we checked in, we were greeted warmly at the desk. We were early, so only one of our rooms was available. The clerk upgraded us to a superior room, in one of the newer buildings. It was a beautiful and exceptionally comfortable room. Tons of fluffy towels, cozy down comforter on the bed, lots of pillows. The small kitchen area was great, especially given that we had a toddler in tow. We had a lovely view of the bay from our nicely sized balcony, and we spent awhile just soaking in the sun and beautiful weather while waiting for the second room to be ready (they told us it should be ready by 4pm). We left the hotel, and came back at 4:15. The other room was not ready, but they upgraded my parents to a suite! Seriously, these people know customer service. The suite was an enlarged version of our room, with a separate living room and large patio. Very nice! Before checking out, we had breakfast at the Blue Pearl restaurant. The food was tasty, and prices were very reasonable, For a $3 fee and 18% gratuity, you can have anything off the menu delivered at regular menu prices. Fantastic room service policy. The real highlight of our trip was the customer service. My daughter left her blankie in our room. We realized our error when we were almost back to Los Angeles. I called and left a message for Ted, the person in charge of lost and found. He called me back in the morning, located the blanket, and had it in the mail to us that day. So easy, so understanding, and so kind and polite. We travel down to San Diego a few times a year, but usually try to avoid the hassle of getting a hotel by driving back the same day.

We chose this hotel because of the favourable reviews that we had read. We decided not to rent a car so we could make a concentrated effort to walk on a daily basis. The hotel is right along the beautiful marina and a launch site. The grounds themselves are immaculate and well designed. I was hard pressed to find a weed or anything out of place. The plants chosen added a tropical feel and made me think of Hawaii. We initially were placed in ground level suite in the 400 block. We found the room to be on the small side and the layout itself felt cramped and poorly designed. We were shocked to find that there was no safe even though in the literature stated that they were in all the rooms. It turns out that they no longer have safes and are not planning on any in the near future. The lady at the front desk was not even sure what was going on with that. She did offer us the use of a tiny locker behind the desk or have our valuables locked in the office. We were not happy with either choice and ended up carrying all our valuables including our passports everywhere. The other problem with the room was the noise factor. These are two story buildings and the floor between is poorly insulated. We could hear everything from the family upstairs, it was like living below a bowling alley. At one point my husband got so frustrated that he banged a couple of times on the ceiling. One minute later there was a phone call from the front desk with a noise complaint about us. We finally asked to be moved to the second floor which they kindly did. What would have happened if the hotel was full? The move made all the difference in the world and we were able to relax and enjoy ourselves. On a more positive note the beds were very comfortable with lots of pillows and the rooms themselves were very clean. The two restaurants were nice. The Blue Pearl had great breakfast food and the staff were warm and friendly. The more upscale Firefly is trying to be trendy with a higher end menu. We found the food to be very hit or miss. Some of the food was very good while other things were just plain bizarre.Overall there were better places to eat that cost less than the Firefly. I don't know if we will be back since we chose this hotel partly because it was within walking distance to SeaWorld. Sorry to say but we hated SeaWorld.

Several restaurants are within a 1 mile walking distance but guest will be happy to know that the Dana has two restaurants, the Firefly and the Blue Pearl for all of your dining needs. The Firefly is a contemporary restaurant and bar that offers cuisine unique to Southern California. Many of their menu items are designed to be shared and the amazing view only enhances an already impressive facility. The Blue Pearl is a more casual dining facility that offers breakfast lunch and dinner favorites that the whole family will enjoy. The hotel also has a reasonable room service menu with an impressive selection as well as a pool bar for guests looking for some refreshment in the sun. I wish our schedule allowed us more time to take in this wonderful facility as well as more time to sample the cuisine. The Dana also has a very nice convention facility and his popular site for weddings and receptions. The helpful staff can also arrange tours, reservations, and other necessities during your stay.

From the obliging staff to the spacious and comfortable rooms, I highly recommend this beautiful facility and look forward to spending more time there on a future visit.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denmark", "Title": "\u201cGood location\u201d", "Author": "DKK031", "ReviewID": "UR121388122", "Content": "I think this is a good hotel.

I had read previous reviews about this hotel and knew to book a deluxe bay view room to get the best room. We were not disappointed! We stayed in the 2000 building on the second floor and had a great view of Mission Bay from our balcony. The grounds of the hotel make you feel like you are on a tropical island with all the palm trees and tropical plants. The bathroom and kitchenette have granite counters and looked very stylish. There is a safe and mini refrigerator in these rooms along with a coffeemaker. There are 2 restaurants on the property. The Firefly (closest to the main lobby and bay view rooms) does not serve breakfast. We ate dinner there our last night and the menu is not that extensive and a bit pricey. You can also eat outside by the pool if you so wish. The Blue Pearl is on the opposite end of the property from the lobby and takes about 5 mins to walk to. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. We had breakfast there each morning and were happy with the meals. You can charge your meals to your room. Parking costs $18/night but we were charged $9/night because we received a \"discount.\" Not sure why but it was fine with us. The hotel offers a shuttle to Sea World but we could never find where the shuttle picked up in the Sea World parking lot due to lack of signage. We ended up walking both ways and it takes about 10-15 mins to arrive at Sea World's main gate. My advice when walking to Sea World...make sure you walk on the left side of the road after crossing at the light (not the black bike path) because you can cut across the parking lot and get to the gate faster. We, unfortunately, chose the bike path and had to back track to the main gate because an 8 ft. fence prohibited us from crossing into the parking lot. This made our walk to Sea World much, much longer. Tickets for Sea World and the San Diego Zoo can be purchased from the front desk at a discount. If you choose to visit the Zoo, take a brochure from the lobby and use that discounted coupon to purchase your ticket at the main gate. It turned about to be cheaper for us that way. The Zoo and Balboa Park are about a 10 minute drive from the hotel. The SD airport was about a 15 minute drive which was very nice. We would definitely stay here again if we were to return to this area.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mesa, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay anywhere but the new section along the bay\u201d", "Author": "mikegodphx", "ReviewID": "UR120866470", "Content": "We stayed here again and were put in a non-water view room in the old section of the hotel.

I want to review the hotel based on my experience trying to pick the hotel for our trip. I think this will help those of you looking at this hotel, but not sure if the rooms are nice or if you should up grade or not. ROOMS The Dana can be broken down into two parts: The older section and the newer section. As you may have noticed, many people love the newer section. I decided to take a chance and stay in the older section (even though many people said it was terrible). We stayed in the Marina Bay rooms, although ALL the standard rooms would be the same (you just would not have the same view). Despite what people have said, these rooms are EXACTLY as pictured. They were small, but very well kept and clean. I would not hesitate to stay in them again. Don't be afraid to get the standard rooms, unless space is an issue. If you want lots of room, then go with the deluxe rooms. Since we were gone all day anyways, the room was not an issue for us. HOTEL The hotel itself was beautiful. It had two good size pools and hot tubs. We found it very enjoyable to walk around the hotel grounds during the evening. It is also a 15 minute walk to Sea World, which was awesome. The entire staff was great to work with. The Blue pearl restaurant was very reasonable and had great food (we ate breakfast, lunch, and dinner, each one time). Overall, the hotel was perfect. Just what we wanted. Some have mentioned that the hotel walls are very thin and you can hear everything. I had not such experience. I heard the other people's door shutting, but that was it. It is a HOTEL, not a single family home. Not sure what some people expect.... Wi-Fi is free and easy to access. It is great to check e-mail and other quick things, but not much else. I assume they keep slower for a reason. Extra Charges / fees Some things to note: -They charge 9 dollars per person to use their shuttle from the airport. If you have a group of 3 or more, it would be cheaper to just take a taxi. Plus, since the taxis are right at the air port, and you don't have to wait for them, you would get their faster. My wife and I had a real problem with this. I think a small charge is reasonable, but 18 to get us to THEIR hotel was pretty ridiculous. Most hotels don't do that (atleast the ones I stayed at) -They also charge 20 dollars a night to park. There are other parking lots/streets around, but I am not sure if I would trust them (especially since we had a rental). Our first two nights we did not have a car. Then we got a car the last two nights we were there. Not sure how, but they did not charge us for parking. Not sure if they just missed it or what. I was kind of glad since I think that is pretty ridiculous. Food If you want to save money on buying food, there is a small bait shop / fishing store right by the hotel. They have sandwiches, chips, cereal, etc. It is a little bit pricey. Your best bet is a target store about 1.5 miles up the road. Easy to get too and can save you some money. Within 3-4 miles you have just about ANY restaurant you would want. Transportation As people have stated, there is a public transportation bus stop right in front of the hotel. We found that very useful to get to old town. It is only a ten minute right straight to the hub and old town is right across the train tracks. I had originally planned using the bus to get to other locations like the LDS temple, USS Midway, and Zoo. However, I found it would have taken 1-2 hours EACH WAY using the bus. That is assuming you get off at the right spot. Since I did not know much about San Diego, I decided not to use the bus to go very far. As stated it will take you anywhere, but I think it takes more time than it is worth. It cost less than 50 dollars for a rental car for 2 days. Well worth, since we drove to Universal Studios our last day their. My overall impressions are good. The hotel itself is fantastic and exactly as pictured on their website. Don't be afraid to stay in the standard rooms, as long as you don't want lots of room. Try and avoid the extra fees of the shuttle and parking if you can. If you are going to sea world, don't rent a car that day. It can save you on parking. You will enjoy your stay at the Dana.

To begin with, we were blessed with an outstanding rate from Jennifer Kietzke for a deluxe room with a beautiful view of Mission Bay. Our room had two queen bed, a pullout couch, small table and 2 chairs, as well as small fridge, micro and sink. The bathroom was very nice, with plenty of counter space as well as a lighted make up mirror. Little details, like two robes and swim towels folded on the bed each day were impressive. The view from our room was spectacular, with a large sliding door leading out onto our own balcony with several chairs, overlooking Mission Bay and the marina. We enjoyed watching the 7 and 9 person kayaks early in the morning out on the bay. The resort has two heated pools, one with a small sand area, complete with sand toys for the kids. Although the weather was cool during our stay, our kids still enjoyedswimming each evening and building sandcastles on the \"beach\". Everyone we encountered at the resort went above and beyond to make our stay one to remember! There are two restaurants onsite, but we only ate at one of them; The Blue Pearl, where we had breakfast twice and ordered carryout pizza once. Everything was absolutely delicious, and the service was incredibly fast! Our first morning there, we informed our waiter we were hoping to catch the resort shuttle to Sea World, so he put a rush on our meal. We couldn't believe it when breakfast for 5 showed up in less than 5 minutes!! NEVER have we had such quick service in a restaurant!! And this waiter was the most cordial man ever! Unfortunately, I didn't get his name. Although we had a little trouble getting to the resort on our first attempt, it truly is right across the road from Sea World's parking lot.

Wolgang Puck brand, I loved it. I'd brew the coffee each morning and enjoy it. I would sip my coffee and visit Dana landing, just a small walk, where I'd order an egg/cheese sandwich and watch the gorgeous bay. By the way the sandwich was only 3.99. I also got my beer from the Dana landing . Dana Landing also rents all kinds of sea sports/ fishing goods. It also has a good deli and cold cuts department. Fresh! You could rent a bike and ride it for miles on the beautiful bay, or rent a boat at Paradise point. The room was not grand. It was more like a Days Inn kind but the bed was excellent and the furnishings good . TV was a flat panel. Staff was very friendly. The lawns were manicured. I enjoyed the foliage. The high point was the FireFly cafe. You must at least go there once and try the chowder. I loved the chowder so much that I ate it every day. It is a better chowder than you can get in San Francisco. It was the location. Heaven on earth! Will go there again.

By this I mean that there are Standard rooms and there are Deluxe rooms and the difference between the two is night and day. I know this only because I stayed here three nights recently with several other families. My family was \"upgraded\" to a deluxe room simply because we needed the pullout couch for sleeping. The other families were put in the standard rooms. Note: these rooms were booked through Disney as part of a vacation package. Shame on Disney for putting people in the standard rooms. The pictures on the website are misleading and even the pictures of the standard rooms make them look much nicer than they actually are. Since I stayed in the Deluxe room, I'll base my stay off that, but I'd like to give a brief review of both. Standard Rooms: This part of the complex looks like it was built in the 1970's as the buildings look dated and the rooms do as well. The two standard rooms I went in both had a terrible musty smell and they are much smaller than the deluxe rooms. The carpets were stained and had numerous ripples in them. I was hesitant to even let my kids sit on the floor since they looked so dirty. The only thing that looked updated in the entire room was an LG flatscreen TV. One person demonstrated the large gap under the entry door by pushing a roughly one-quarter inch thick stick under the door! Everything down to the quality of sheets was even different than what is in the deluxe rooms. My only other comment on this area was would have to be the rat trap that was visible under one of the stairwells. Deluxe Rooms: These rooms are obviously in a newer area of the complex. The rooms are large and feature a small kitchenette area with a small sink, microwave and fridge. Everything appears to be updated. Our room featured two queen beds and a small sofa that was a pullout. The room we stayed in backed up to a large park area, which didn't really allow for much privacy for sitting on the patio area. There were large groups of people either picnicking or playing soccer directly outside our back door. Room service was great and they left lots of towels, including towels for the pool. The complex does have two outdoor pools that are nice. There is also a restaurant near the lobby that always appeared busy. I did not eat there, but it looked somewhat upscale. I did read comments about high fees for parking vehicles, but we were not charged to park our two vehicles. We were also given an access code for free internet access. I was unable to access using my wifi, but was able when I hooked up the supplied ethernet cable. Overall, I did enjoy my stay, but if I would have been stuck in a standard room, my rating would have been much lower. I did hear one other family in the lobby complaining about the standard room they were put in. I heard the guy saying the room looked nothing like the pictures on the website and all the lady at the front desk kept telling him was there was nothing she could do because he booked through a third party internet service. I'm guessing this is a common complaint from guests and it's somewhat deceiving by this hotel.

After rearranging the furnature we made it work. We had a pool side room... awesome! Small private patio with a gate directly to the pool. Each night at the pool the Hotel was showing a Disney Movie. Rooms were very clean and anything you needed the staff delivered in record time! During the blackout there was no food anywhere because stores had no way to sell the food. The Dana pulled out mac and cheese, pasts dishes, fresh fruit, drinks, veggies, and anything else they could manage to put together and serve for free to those staying at their facility. It was served at no cost. In addition, once it got dark they had countless employees wandering the grounds with flashlights helping escort people from place to place, and get settled in their rooms. I was very impressed with the service! As a result of the inconvenience from the blackout, the hotel waived the parking fees for our stay. The drawback... the Dana has limited handicap parking.

Pros: our room (premium bay view 2 Queens w/balcony) was much better than expected. We were in AW! upon entry as we couldn't believe how spacious and bright it was.You have use of a robe and 2 towels for your use of there pools. Be far warned... it's not yours to keep. It must be returned to the hotel if not, there's a costly charged to your credit card. The bathroom was spacious but could have been a tad bit cleaner. There was hair on the floor and ceiling. Nothing to complain about though. In the lobby you have free use of the internet as well as printing out your boarding passes etc. Free shuttle service to sea world and early morning coffee/newspaper. You can rent a bike for $8.00 and hour or more etc. Cons:_( Our room (as lovely as it was) was extremely pricey(a room in the water's edge section) They add ridiculous amounts of incidentials once you receive your final bill at check out. Also, there were unsupervised underaged teens having loud parties in which we didn't get a peaceful nights sleep. We noticed food trays left in hallway. Garbage/pizza boxes plus empty soda bottles thrown on the side of the garbage cans. I don't know where the parents/guardians were, but you can bet the teens were left alone to cause major chaos. In conclusion, If you enjoy being near the marina and you're a water/boating person, this is the perfect hotel for you.

We stayed in the old section, which was perfectly fine for us. We had a ground floor room with a patio that overlooked the pool, however the foilage was too thick to view the pool. It was a tad dark in the room but provided some great afternoon shade when relaxing on the patio. The room size worked out fine for us, but I definately would not recommend these rooms for families as they could get cramped with 3 or 4 people. I was very impressed by how clean and updated the rooms were & with all of the ammenities, including robes! We ate at both restaurants, and definately preferred Fire Fly. Blue Pearl was \"o.k.\", but more of a upscale Denny's feel. Great for families I suppose, but not really the atmosphere two adult gals were looking for. Food was also just \"o.k.\". The food and the atmosphere of Fire Fly were much better. It is located next to the pool & bay, so we were able to watch the fireworks from our dinner table! I agree with the reviewer who commented on how early they close. Would be nice if they stayed open until at least 11 p.m., especially this time of year. Only two complaints were 1) We were overcharged for drinks once, and they tried to overcharge us two more times, but we caught it. Apparently, they introduced their new Spring 2011 menu but failed to input the new reduced prices in their computer. Once we pointed it out they charged us correctly. 2) The paid shuttle service the hotel provided to get race participants to the start line 6-7 miles away. I was very concerned that the 5:30 a.m. schedule deparure time was not going to allow us enough time to get to the start line before 6:15. I was reassured over & over by the hotel representative that it would. Sure enough, the shuttle never showed up & about 2 dozen runners were still standing around at the hotel 10 minutes before the race start. The manager finally came out & payed all of our cab fares to the start line, but it still created a fiasco. Nothing is worse than getting to the start line as the gun is blowing off with no time to stretch, mentally prepare, etc. Not cool! The hotel did send out an apology and refunded our shuttle fee, but still a pretty stressful situation for us runners. Oh, and yes, the parking charge is ridiculous. This is one of my HUGE pet peeves, when hotels charge you to stay there & then tack on a over inflated parking fee. It's really, really tacky.

It's a 15 minute walk to SeaWorld and you get a picture perfect view of the fireworks from the marina! The only downside are the age and wear and tear of the rooms. We were misled by false advertising on the Internet because all of the photos on the website are of the new wing of the property. A majority of the rooms (8 buildings worth) are older. They were recently updated, but essentially they are an upgraded version of a motel room. They are tight and extremely small for any family with kids. Our room was also noisy facing the road and parking lot! My kids woke up several times due to garbage trucks and utility trucks backing up into the property. People could be heard talking loudly in their rooms and outside. You will most definitely be booked in the older rooms if you book through any of the discounted websites like Priceline or Hotels.com.

There is a free shuttle from the hotel to Sea World but it's easily in walking distance. In fact, we walked back to the hotel after our day at Sea World. Our suite was spacious and nicely decorated. There was a small kitchen and the bathroom was huge and surprisingly posh. We loved the floor to ceiling windows in the living area that overlooked a large deck. The view of the bay from our room was nice. We didn't use the pools but we saw plenty of hotel guests taking advantage of them - it was chilly outside but the pools are heated! We had breakfast two times at the hotel restaurant and by all accounts the food was good with generous portions. My only complaint was the layout of the suite. It was awkward and backwards. The front door opened into the bedroom which was attached to the kitchen and bathroom. The 'living area' where my 11 year old son slept on the pull-out couch was in the back attached to the deck and was the only room that had a door for privacy. So if he had to get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, he essentially came out into our room to get into the bathroom. This completely eliminated any privacy for the adults and ensured there was no romantic 'adult time' all weekend so to speak. Overall, a nice place to stay but don't expect privacy if you're travelling with friends or as a family.", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Queensbury, New York", "Title": "\u201cWith a few changes it could be top notch\u201d", "Author": "Jaguar4094", "ReviewID": "UR98685433", "Content": "First impression was horrible as we arrived after midnight.

First the positives: the property is in a nice area, very close to Sea World and Mission Bay (although being in meetings all day I didn't get to experience either). The staff was very friendly and accommodating, and the meal services, both in the restaurant and for the meeting, were a highlight of my stay. The bedding was decent and the bath area was fine. The 42\" flat screen TV was larger than I would normally expect. The room had a small refrigerator and microwave, which I didn't use but which would have come in handy on a leisure visit. The meeting facility was convenient, except for the fact that there were no restrooms and we had to go over to the reception area on our breaks. The airport shuttle ($9 each way) helped us avoid renting a car, although they only run between 8 am and 8 pm. Whether the negatives are significant depends on your needs. The rooms are a bit cramped, though similar to other San Diego properties I've stayed at. There isn't really a workspace per se, just a small round table at the side of the bed. There aren't any usable power outlets near the nightstand, making charging a laptop or cell phone inconvenient. Although the rooms have been updated, they are clearly older and not very well noise-insulated. I could hear a baby crying from the room above each morning at 5 am, though coming from the East Coast I was already awake. You could also hear anyone walking by the room, along with doors shutting, cars starting, etc. It was hard to darken the room completely, as the shutters don't close completely. That being said, I've had much worse and wasn't too bothered.

There is a microwave, coffee maker and small fridge. Coffee packages were Wolfgang Puck brand. We decided to order room service for breakfast. Came to $20.00 (including tax, mandatory gratuity and service charge) but for cereal, fruit, orange juice, eggs, toast and hashbrowns I would say it is really not much more than one would pay at a decent restaurant (not talking Denny's or IHOP).

The next day I check my bank statements and I had already paid online through Expedia so my room and services were already paid for. I check my statemnts and over $150 was missing. I call the Dana and talk to the accountant and the people they booked me in their room all their charges were charged to my card, after leaving work early to find the solution, we figured it out. I was givin a free room on them. Two days later I go to get gas and my card declines, I check my bank statements on my phone and the $150 was not put on my card yet. So it took them 3 days to refund my money so I was given dinner at their resturant the firefly. Then I stayed this last weekend Sat-Sun. I got the same room [bayside] and had dinner on them. Dinner was wonderful and the service was great. I return to my room and get constant complaints of loud noise, jumping on the bed and banging the door. It was before 12am, and I don't consider walking in the room jumping on the bed. Also, hotel doors slam and I got complaints for my door. Then.. security of the Dana comes to my room at 2 in the morning saying I have these complaints and I have to leave the hotel. Over jumping on the bed??? And my slamming door. YES, the security harrassed me to leave and told me I better sleep in my car and he was calling law enforcement. I was excited to talk to a policemen but that never happened so around 3 I packed my things and left. The next day I get charged over $200 for the people who complaineds' room.

As others have mentioned, SeaWorld is just a 15 min walk away (most of that time being spent wandering through SeaWorld grounds). When you're soaked from the rides or Shamu's mischievous splashing, having a base nearby in which to change is a reassuring thought! Travel into San Diego is fine. The 28 & 29 buses run regularly from Old Town. A taxi from the Amtrak station costs around $22-25. The shuttle van can take you to the airport. A special word finally for the Firefly restaurant. We ate there twice and actually found it the best place we ate at on our 12 day holiday. Menu choice was not huge, but food was excellent and service top notch.

I asked if there is a renovated section of the hotel and there is, but it would cost $50 a night upgrade. We decided to just keep our room. Parking is $18 a day with no where else to park. Our room was on the second floor of a motel-style building (outdoor hallways which my wife did not like). The room was small. Two queen beds but could not walk along the side nearest the window. The decor was fine. There was a larger mini-fridge (I mean bigger than the little usual square dorm fridge) and a microwave. Nice large flat-screen TV maybe 46\" or larger. Bathroom was clean. Soft matresses which were not comfortable to me but as we were leaving a huge Serta semi was pulling into the parking lot! The room was obviously renovated at some point but the work looked a bit unprofessional. I didn't mind it too much but I know some reviewers would not like it and share photos of bad tile grout or paint jobs. Overall, we had a decent stay. The only problem I had was that it doesn't seem like a 3.5 upscale hotel. The newer side, however, is probably much nicer and maybe deserves the 3.5 star rating.

My family and I stayed at one of the Water's Edge rooms which were much more spacious (from what I could see from the outside) than the Marina Cove rooms which looked like typical hotel rooms. Our room on the ground floor had a very large patio and a very spacious living room, complete with sofa bed and a small dining table. It was possible to close the doors into the main bedroom so our kids could watch their own TV. The living room (about 20' x 15') did not have a single overhead light but only one table lamp which I thought was strange. There are shutters on the window to let the light in, but being on the ground floor and on the end of the block meant that we had walkers, joggers etc pass less than 30 feet by our room. But the view of the marina and the water was very nice and we never felt like any of the passer-bys were invading our privacy. Having the wet bar (plus mini fridge, microwave and plenty of cupboards) in the main room was a bonus as it allowed us to prepare a few simple meals (including breakfast - the only restaurant serving breakfast on the property is the Blue Pearl which is way over on the other side of the property). The best part of our stay at The Dana was definitely the pools. We spent most of our time at the pool near the marina and with doubt it was the warmest pool (in the 80's) I have been in. Which was useful because the weather in SD was around 70 when we stayed there (mid-September). The pool was also sparkling clean. The 'tropical pool' was also good (more shade and not as deep so perhaps better for little kids - there even is a sandpit nearby). Both the spas were nice and hot. We only ate once at the Firefly restaurant and it was very nice - the kids' meals were of a good size and my wife's fish dish was very tasty (despite the fact that we realised later that she had been served something she hadn't ordered!) There were two weddings on the weekend we stayed but neither seemed to intrude on the guests - we were able to stay in the pool while the reception was on and eat in the Firefly restaurant. One little tip for anyone staying at The Dana - there is a small shop at the marina which sells (apart from all the fishing gear you could want) things like sandwiches, snacks, beer, wine, ice creams etc. Also across the road from The Dana is a casual diner ('Sportsmen's') where you can buy fish and chips, plus other seafood, burgers and light meals, all very reasonably priced. One more tip - there is a computer in the reception area which is free to use for guests (it allows up to 15 minutes use). Great for checking up sport results (which I did!) or printing off boarding passes etc. The ambience of The Dana is very relaxing, more of a resort than a hotel, as you are able to walk around the gardens and you hardly ever see any staff. A good place to consider if you want a relaxing stay rather than a full service hotel where everything is done for you.", "Date": "October 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beijing, China", "Title": "\u201c$18 PARKING PER NIGHT!\u201d", "Author": "agumonster", "ReviewID": "UR81884106", "Content": "From the outside, Dana on Mission Bay looks beautiful.

As we walked through the grounds of the hotel we could see into other rooms that were being serviced by housekeeping and they did appear to be pretty dark and dingy so it is definitely worth getting into the new block if you can. Overall the hotel has a feel of a large motel - absolutely fine for us but if you are looking for a romantic getaway, this hotel isn't for you particularly not in July. The hotel pools were small and crowded so we didn't use them. They also charge for parking - $16 / night but only for 2 nights so if you're staying for longer, the other nights are free. The hotel is well placed to use as a base to explore San Diego. They run a shuttle to Seaworld which is very close by. We walked back from Seaworld because we wanted to leave at a non shuttle time and it only took 15-20 minutes. Thy told us at checkin that our room rate included a credit towards breakfast which was great (and a surprise) so we ate at the Blue Pearl restaurant every morning. The food here was good and it really set us up for the day. We just signed the breakfast to our room and this was deducted at checkout - except for any gratuity which we'd added.

They do provide a regular lock plus 2 auxiliary door locks but I was never truly secure. They do have safes in the room, be sure to use it for your smaller valuables (laptop, jewelry, etc). The room was fine as far as that goes. Bed was comfortable. However there were several lights that didn't work or the switches mysteriously either did nothing or did several things. Weird. The light in the shower was burned out as well as one of the lamps. The clock radio is a joke. The batteries in the TV remote were dead (I can't make this up) we used some spare batteries from our camera flash (they are AA in case you need to plan). Shutters partially broken the only way to make the left one work was to lift it and slide it. For the price and hype EVERYTHING should work. How hard is it to replace a battery or a light bulb?

The rooms were the Deluxe Bay View Premium guest rooms which were located by the marina and provided magnificent views. The furnishing and decor were exceptional. The rooms contained a small refrigerator, a wet bar and microwave. The small sitting room provided an area that we could all meet for \"happy hour.\" At around 10:00 each night, we could view the fireworks from Sea World right outside our patio. Parking was limited and we were charged $16.00 each for the first two days. I'm not sure why we were charged for only the first two days, but if you don't get back early to the hotel from your day and evening out, you will have to park quite far from your room. The girls at the front desk were adequate, but they certainly could have been a little more friendly and accomodating. We left our cell phone number because one room wasn't ready. Within a few minutes, while we were eating at their Blue Pearl Restaurant, we received a call that the room was available. After thirty minutes, we went to the front desk and were told that we had to wait a few minutes because some guests were removing their luggage from the room. (???) I'm not sure why they made the call to tell us the room \"was ready.\" Of the three rooms, my husband and I had a first floor room. Thank goodness the rest of our family were on the third floor. However, we wanted this room so that we could walk out on the grass to the marina. This was a HUGE MISTAKE! If at all possible, never get a room on the first floor. The noise level from the guests directly above us was completely intolerable. Were they walking and throwing things exceptionally loud and on purpose? Were they doing anything extra, like jumping jacks or other exercises? I don't know...just be aware that you do NOT want a first floor room if you enjoy quiet and solitude when you can be alone. They had arrived quite late at night, after we had gone to bed, so this was truly an annoying situation. We complained two nights into our four-night stay, but were informed that there were no other rooms available. The last night was so horribly loud that I honestly thought I'd go sleep in the car. I would have, too, except the car was parked quite away from our room (see above advisory about getting back to your hotel room early). Upon checking out, we again complained and mentioned our previous complaint and lack of action.

The package we had included a $20 credit each morning for breakfast. We used it 3 times in the 5 days. It tends to get a little boring for the food. If you are just there to sleep it's o.k. but I did feel let down. We paid $175 a night and got the 5th night free.

But we had a great first floor patio on a beautifully landscaped lawn. There were lots of young children and some older ones, mostly in family groups, but this was Spring Break after all. We didn't have a rental car, so we used a combination of ways to get around. The Dana is a little removed from the main action, which meant it was like a little beautiful oasis. We walked across the bridge to Mission Beach and spent a day lying on the beach and watching the people surf, and ate pizza at Gabbiano. We used city bus one day to Old Town, walked around, and then took the trolley to Maritime Museum ($5 day pass for both bus and trolley). Went sailing on the Californian (what a great adventure!), went to the Zoo (expensive taxi ride, but love the Zoo). The Dana has a shuttle to SeaWorld, but we didn't go there. Ate breakfast and dinner most nights at the hotel.

Here's what we did: we reserved one of the newer rooms in the buildings called \"Bayside\". It came with free shuttle to and from the cruise ports and FREE parking for the duration of our 12 day cruise. The Dana at Mission Bay is adjacent to Sea World and a 15 minute shuttle ride to the cruise terminal, but most hotels near the ports either jack up the price of a park and cruise or start charging your parking after 7 days, and they mostly have poor reviews and shoddy rooms for the price. If you were to need a day or two at SeaWorld before or after your longer cruise this would absolutely be the perfect choice - and Mom's and Dad's will feel like heroes for this selection if this is the situation you are in. In our situation the cost of parking nearer to the cruise terminal for our 12 day cruise would nearly pay for the room. If your cruise is short, or you flew in, there is that much less incentive to stay here. It might still be my choice if I flew in because the shuttle does the airport, the cruise terminal and Seaworld. We read all the reviews - they are so mixed I was sort of worried, but here's exactly what you need to know. Older rooms are rooms 101 to 829 - we didn't see any of them but understand they are older but remodeled. For under 100 dollars I'd guess they may be just fine, most overlook a parking lot and will feel much more like any older motel. The new very nice rooms are in two adjacent curved buildings, each 3 floors tall. Again, they call these \"Bayside\".The first building (rooms 1100-1320 are more pointed towards a park with the bay being to the left and beyond that, a distant overpass. I would probably avoid these rooms as well. The second new building (rooms 2100 to 2320) are where you want to be, and I'd especially request a third story room as they overlook a lovely bay. The room number would then start with 23XX (second building third floor) The first floor does not have private balconies, but the second and third floors do. There is a nice elevator. The rooms are exquisite, really they are, and along the lines of any 5 star resort. You can read about all the amenities at their web site but we didn't really use any of them. I feel certain that cars are safe here - hotel parking is gated but the long term is not, still, it's location makes it seem safe. People were friendly, the shuttle clean, the directions clear, the lobby beautiful, the room exquisite, and I got the free parking in writing due to some other reviews here but it was never questioned.

When we booked this hotel we got a great rate through Hotels.com amounting to a 50% discount which we thought was a steal. Having stayed there now we feel that was probably a fair price. Had we paid full price I think we\u2019d have been disappointed. We booked a deluxe bay view suite so were accommodated in the newer section of the resort. We did have a quick look at the rest of the accommodation and would agree with most of the other posts on here that the bay view rooms are the best bet. Our room was on the ground floor (1st floor for all you yanks reading this) so we would also say that if you can request one on the 2 floors above this you\u2019ll get the best return. The location of the hotel is also very good, not far from the airport, right next to Seaworld and very accessible. It\u2019s also right on the bay so the surroundings are very pleasant. When we checked in we were told that there was a \u2018fan\u2019 in our room as the carpet has been cleaned but would be removed shortly. As it turned out it was gone when we got to the room but unfortunately the smell of damp wasn\u2019t. We stuck it for one night and then asked to be moved, which happened without any problems. It turned out when we got into the new room and turned on the air conditioning it was leaking onto the carpet so I suspect this was the issue in the original room. In the end we didn\u2019t really need the aircon so the problem went away. Other than this we could really have no complaints other than the room didn\u2019t have great lighting which was only a problem when we were changing and had to close the blinds to prevent prying eyes on the outside (another drawback of the ground floor). There were 2 queen beds, a fridge, microwave and sink as well as a safe and TV (which was never switched on during our stay). The bathroom was spacious and clean, as you would expect with room enough for 2 people to get ready. As some other reviewers have mentioned there was a $30 a day credit that could be used for breakfast in the Blue Pearl restaurant (not including tips) but we found this to be plenty for 2 adults and the range of breakfast options and quality of the food was very good. Because of this we decided to eat there one evening but found the options were a bit more limited so ate elsewhere for the rest of our stay. We didn\u2019t eat in the other restaurant on site but we did have drinks in the bar where the staff were friendly (which could be said for all of the staff we encountered while we were there) but it did turn out to be quite pricey. A little bit disappointing was the charge of $12 per night for car parking\u2026nowadays you\u2019d expect that to be free. There is also a charge for using the internet connection so we chose to log on elsewhere if needed.", "Date": "September 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at the Dana but with reservations\u201d", "Author": "ManchesterPowells", "ReviewID": "UR45011277", "Content": "We stayed for a week in the lovely Dana Hotel near Mission Beach in San Diego. Overall we were very happy with this hotel, we booked a large bay view suite that had two queen sized beds (ideal for our family of 4). The hotel is nicely located about 1 mile from the fantastic Mission beach (it isn't \"on\" Mission Beach though) with it's great surfing and sunbathing opportunities - we walked this everyday but it can be hardwork if it's very hot. The location is perfect for Seaworld. There is a little noise from aircraft taking off from the nearby airport as the Dana is under the flightpath but it didn't really bother any of us and didn't affect our sleep;- it was pretty quiet overall. The room we booked was large, comfortable and had a nice en-suite bathroom. There was a fridge in the room which was very useful to store simple things such as milk, fruit and of course a few beers! The beds were comfortable and we had sufficient pillows. The rooms were cleaned to a high standard every day and we had sufficient clean towels provided every day throughout our stay. There are two restaurants at the hotel;- the Blue Pearl and Firefly. We didn't eat at Firefly but had three evening meals at the Blue Pearl. The food there was pretty good quality but the service was patchy to say the least. Our first meal was excellent and at about $90 for the four of us was good value. Our second night proved interesting in that the waitress decided she was going to remove any unnecessary dishes, plates, cutlery etc within two seconds of them being finished with by us (you could argue efficient but I would say annoying). This led us to feel we were being over-watched and scrutinised and I only left a modest tip of about 10% of the bill. On check out on our final day I was horrified to find that my RECEIPT FOR THIS MEAL HAD BEEN ALTERED to add a further 20% to that particular bill. Naturally I queried this with the receptionist at check out but she didn't seem too concerned at something that is probably illegal (in Britain we call this \"theft\") and certainly didn't offer a refund of the money in question (a relatively paltry $18) and has not contacted me by telephone or e-mail as I had requested to clarify what had occurred. Our third (and perhaps thankfully final) dinner at the Blue Pearl also proved interesting in that there was something wrong with one of every course we ordered between the four of us;- my eldest daughter had buffalo wings that had pure tabasco sauce on them (not the bbq that we'd requested) and hence were inedible. My youngest daughter ordered a toasted cheese sandwich that had peanut butter inside it and no cheese! My wife had a chicken and pasta dish that had no chicken in it whatsover (perhaps a chicken had run through it?). After a few complaints the waiter realised that by this time we were getting a bit piss_d off and offered us free desserts (a nice touch) as a result. What a shambles though. These latter two events didn't really spoil our stay though and we would certainly return to the Dana or recommend it to a friend.

We weren't disappointed. The suite was beautiful and very spacious with a nice common room that serves as a second bedroom and it's own patio and small kitchen. We ended up with a room on the bottom floor which turned out to be perfect as we brought along bikes and could just ride them onto the patio and keep them there. We also happened to get the corner unit which has an extra large size patio as well. There's also a small refrigerator that we used to stock drinks and bottled water. There is a marina on the property that can rent ski boats and wave runners. There is also a bike path on the periphery which connects to the other areas of Mission Bay like Paradise point via the numerous bridges. For the most part you can bike all around Mission Bay via the connected bike paths which is good if you have small children and want to avoid traveling on any busy streets. The pool was nice too but calling it an infinity pool is a bit of a stretch. There's also a free computer with internet connection in the lobby which we made use of.

Of the 2 location restaurants, the Firefly is closed on Monday causing some inconvenience and the Blue Pearl (I think) offered good food but was noisy. Items of irritation were the $12 per night for parking and the $9.95 daily charge for internet access. (These days?! Come on guys!)

I booked throught the hotel website, which is a lot better than going through Expedia or Travelocity because they give you a plethora of options on what kind of room you can reservice. I took the advice from a few online and upgraded to the newer Bay View Rooms and was impressed. We were given two queen beds as requested with a nice balcony overlooking the bay (there was even a wedding going on right in front of our room one day). The room was clean with great ammenities: fridge, flat screen tv, kitchenette with sink. The pools were really nice with pool side waiter service which we took advantage of. We were also able to watch the Sea World Fireworks show right from the property on Friday night. We didn't have a chance to eat at the two restaurants on site or order room service, so I can't compliment on the food but if you do go to restaurant.com and buy the gift certificates, it will save you a lot of $$ of heard. I would only give two small suggestions: 1) get rid of the $12 per night parking fee, kind of unnecessary. The street outside has no parking after 2am so we didn't have a choice but to pay it. 2) if you're going to offer a flat screen TV in the room it might be wise to actually have a HiDef feed going into it. The standard def channels looked like crap on it.

However, there are a few things that made me unhappy about this \"resort\" (and I use that term loosely). All in all the hotel was clean, located conveniently next to SeaWorld, and was in a \"quiet\" location, away from the hubbub of the beach. It is in a really pretty setting, right on the bay with it's own docks, 2 heated pools, water activity rental center and more. So what's the problem? Coming from a hospitality work background, a few things were off. The Bad: -They charge you to park in their parking lots. To me, this is outrageous and I'm not really sure if other hotels in the area do the same. You're already staying in their hotel, have paid the room rate for the day and if you drive in, you have to pay an additional $12.00 per day to park AT YOUR HOTEL! -Their rooms are inconsistent. We stayed in the 500 block of rooms. The room was clean, but the case goods were dated and old looking as was the rest of the decor. The television in our room was an older, non-flatscreen television with pretty terrible Lodgenet reception (lots of lines and static). When we went to the pool, we noticed the more prime located rooms near the pool were much more updated looking with newer tv's. Would be nice for them to offer the same comforts to all of their guests. -The Blue Pearl hotel restaurant was overpriced. The food wasn't awful, but it wasn't anything special either. Good if you're hungry and cranky and want to eat immediately. We got to the restaurant around lunchtime, I guess, and I'm not sure if the employees are comp'd meals from the restaurant or if they order them, but the flood of employee lunches was backing up the kitchen, making for a pretty long wait to get our food. My advice would be to extradite the guests orders, not the employees. Did not eat at the Firefly restaurant, but it seemed upscale and probably not really \"family friendly\". -There aren't any real perks. You have to pay to use the wireless internet (free in laundromats nowadays) which will run you a $9.99 per 24 hours. No complimentary coffee/tea or complimentary breakfast in the restaurant in the morning (also pretty common with many middle-range chain hotels these days). There wasn't HBO or any other movie channels in the scant television channel selection. The pools are free to use and there is also a free business center you can use if you need to log in to the internet without paying the fee. The water activities seemed a little bit expensive, but not terrible...and probably very doable for a couple or family with a bigger budget. -The housekeeping staff, although effective and good at their jobs, are quite loud in the morning, shouting to each other from across each side of the building. I was woken up both mornings from this and the sounds of doors bouncing against the latch locks as the housekeepers entered and exited rooms. The Good: -Free shuttle to SeaWorld. Then you don't have to pay to park ANOTHER $12.00 at SeaWorld! Shuttle times are limited and seem to get full, so if you're there when it's busy, probably best to get to the shuttle area a little early. -Pretty and peaceful setting. The garden area and tropical pool areas are very pretty as is the rest of the property...riddled with tons of palms and an array of exotic shrubbery. -Comfortable (but kind of old) beds. The pillows were nice and squishy, just as I like them...not too hard or flat. -Clean (this is a biggie for me with any hotel). I found some dust on a lampshade, but the bathroom was spotless and the carpet didn't have any debris on it. Sheets were clean and room was already made up upon checking in early. -2 heated pools and jacuzzis (really nice if you want a quieter swim as usually one of the two pools is a little less busy than the other). -Nice soap and in-room coffee amenities. To sum it up, we reserved our room through SeaWorld as a package. We paid a little bit for the room plus the SeaWorld tickets. I would suggest if you are truly interested in staying at the Dana to reserve your room directly through the hotel website or through their phone system and request a newer room or spring for the room with a view of the pool or bay. Plan on paying for the parking expense if you are driving in a rental car or your own vehicle. If you do not have a car, ask the concierge or front desk for a bus schedule. The buses looked pretty clean and the routes seemed to run through most major areas of interest. The beach on the bay isn't really swimmable, so if you want lots of beachtime, try heading up the road closer to Mission Beach and check the hotels there. Not a terrible experience, but not a romantic, thrilling or exceptional one either. The word \"resort\" has connotations of luxury, convenience and inclusiveness and The Dana didn't have much of any of those things.", "Date": "August 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel in good location - no complaints\u201d", "Author": "Galleon", "ReviewID": "UR37978077", "Content": "We stayed at the Dana for 6 nights and it was absolutely fine. It isn't the nicest hotel I've ever been in but in terms of value for money it hits the mark. Our room was on the small side for 2 adults and 2 teenagers but had a fridge and a microwave and was directly across from the lovely marina. And you can just step outside your front door and watch the fireworks at Seaworld! The pool area is great, plenty beds & towels and a jacuzzi so kids were well pleased with this. We only ate in the Blue Pearl for breakfast which was fine, standard american breakfast. I did get caught out with the breakfast deal in that when I booked through Expedia I thought I was getting breakfast for 4 but the deal was actually an allowance of $30 per day. This could have been a problem if the teenagers had got up out of bed every morning! As it was, the two of us had a lovely peaceful breakfast and got coffee & toast to take back to the room for them, all within our budget. If you are on this deal, also be aware that you pay your gratuities even if within the budget. It terms of the area, you can't really walk to anywhere but Mission beach is only a few minutes drive and its only about 10 minutes to the city centre. For shopping, we would recommend the Fashion Valley mall over Horton Plaza which we didn't like at all.

By the time we were finished eating, sure enough our room was ready and within a 1/2 hour of unpacking we got a call from the front desk wanting to ensure that everything was okay. We stayed in the newer part of the hotel which is called Waters Edge and had a large bayview room with two queen beds, a pull out couch (twin) and kitchenette. I would suggest that you book your room in the Waters Edge if you have more than two people to a room as the older part of the hotel appears to have smaller rooms. The bathroom was large enough that a couple of people could get ready in there without bumping into each other. Also quite liked the natural shampoo and soaps that are provided. And the room was very clean. We had booked the bed and breakfast special and received a $30 credit daily - this was enough to feed two adults and two kids (ages 8 and 10) a very good breakfast (menu had everything you could want for breakfast - granola to bacon and eggs) at the hotel's casual restaurant The Blue Pearl. Staff at the Blue Pearl were very kind and friendly and the food was good casual fare. I have to say that the concierge at the hotel made a good vacation great. She was fantastic and offered great suggestions for beaches, restaurants and also helped us rent a car. My husband had mentioned that we were going to the beach and while we were having breakfast I got a call from her offering two boogie boards for my daughters to use for the day. Impressive. Also you can buy discount tickets from the concierge to many of the local attractions. The pools were clean and attended by wonderful friendly staff that were ready to help you with anything. You must try the ceviche at the Firefly which is the formal restaurant at the hotel. While at the pool, you can order food from the Firefly (or the Blue Pearl) and enjoy it poolside. The gardens are beautiful, lush and well maintained. Our toilet got plugged and when I called the front desk , they immediately apologized for the inconvenience (okay, WE plugged the toilet!) and sent someone over right away. Location is pretty good - walking distance to Seaworld and a longer walk to Mission Beach and Belmont Park. But anything else such as the zoo, you will need a car as transit requires a couple of bus transfers and frankly you can rent a car for pretty cheap. Yes, parking is $12/day but we only rented a car for a couple of days so it didn't seem too unreasonable. I have travelled a fair bit on business trips and personal trips and have to say that the Dana was one of the best hotels that I have stayed in.

Check-in Relatively quick, friendly staff. Room Likely my biggest disappointment. We stayed in the 800 bldg. Bottom floor, another mistake. Stay top floor! And be sure to check your bottom floor windows are locked. Ours were not. Recently renovated but VERY cramped if you get a king. Lumpy pillows, heavy nasty bedcover. Barely enough room to walk in front of the amoire. No luggage rack to put a suitcase on. No balcony or area to put your wet suit/towel if you are on the bottom floor. No fan for the bathroom, constantly steamed up all the mirrors. Window A/C unit, BLASTED you with freezing cold air out of the shower. Super annoying. Heavy LOUD doors. Constantly woke us up. As well as the staff starting to empty garbage and clean rooms super early. Big negative. 10$/day internet. A rip, in this day I hate being charged for internet. One of our outlets didn't work. Lampshades were cardboard and all bent/torn up (not a big deal, but so cheap!) Nice fridge and microwave to use for snacks. Amenities Nice pool areas. Neither were too crowded. Only used once though. Pool bar complete rip off though (10$ for a frozen drink), go to the marina deli next to the property and fill up on drinks for your fridge. Grounds nice/clean. Not really a fitness center, don't be fooled. We didn't use and just ran outside along the marina. Don't spend 10$ on breakfast there, go next door again to the marina deli, stock up on cereal/milk or get a great bagel sandwich for 3.99$ Best deal around the bay! We never ate on property, no reason to. Across the street you can get fish/chips too. Rented wave runners on the bay, that was fun, staff was nice there too. Bargain for a better rate :) Walk to Sea World. Only 15 easy minutes, and shuttle times are not really that covenient, unless you need to as you are traveling with little ones. Mission Bay and Mission Beach are so much more dirty, boring, and crowded. La Jolla is a cleaner beach though much smaller. Go there if you can, for sun, etc. Jeff's Burgers is tasty! Finally (sorry its long - but hopefully helpful!) the first couple nights we stayed at Gaslamp Holiday Inn on the Bay or something. Honestly, the beds were cozier, free wi-fi, fitness center, and closer to finer dining and bars. 15 mins to pretty much anywhere there too... might consider staying there again.

This stay was for pure relaxation and time with my brother.From the time I entered the main lobby,I knew I had picked a winner.The front desk staff were a joy to deal with.Everyone with a smile,and so very helpfull. We were assigned our room which was a \"Bay View\"catagory.I could not believe it when we arrived at the room.It was \"Bay Front\".We were only a few yards from the water.The view was incredible.The room was very spacious,and included a refrigerator and a microwave,coffee maker, and complimentary coffee and tea.Our room was ground floor.So we could walk right out on to our patio,and then a few more steps to the sand.We could not have asked for a better location. The hotel is literally on Mission Bay.Located very close to Sea World and Belmont Park(a local amusement park,with roller coaster and other rides).It is also close to 2 major freeways that will get you any where in San Diego that you may want to go.Very easy access to all. Room service is provided by their on site restaurant\"The Blue Pearl\".We ordered several meals from room service,and the quality was great.It was always delivered promptly,we never had to wait more than 20 minutes. The hotel has a very nice swimming pool,excersize facilities,and even it's own Marina.The grounds are beautiful,and we enjoyed many walks around them.With the bay as a back drop-it just does not get any better.We also enjoyed beautifull sunset's from our patio. The Dana is a jewel of a find.It has much more of a local feel to it.Very different from the larger chain hotels.I am definately going back.And I would highly reccomend this hotel.The Dana has somthing for everyone.There is plenty to do for adults and families alike.You will be in for a treat when you pick \"The Dana\".

It started at 2 AM when the woman arrived with several loud party friends in the walkway facing the marina. After several minutes of shouting about heading for the pool, the group finally left. At 3 AM they came back to party in the woman's room. My initial call to the front desk at 3:05 AM brought a security guard ten minutes later, who asked the group to quiet down. There was only one registered guest to that room, and Dana's policy was to just ask the 3 AM crowd to quiet down! The party did get a little quieter, I mean, I no longer could hear as clearly the intimate details of when the partiers had lost their virginity (I don't think they were shouting, just very thin walls), but it was still loud enough to wake up my 9 and 6 year olds. My husband called the front desk again to complain. Dana staff came back and I assume asked the non-registered guests to leave, because from that point to some time after 4 am, the guests all slowly left--one or two about every five minutes (we could hear a good-bye said at the door as the guests left the room). When we checked out later that morning my husband complained about our interrupted night's sleep, and the Dana staff was clueless about the events of the night before. My conclusion is, if what you value in a hotel is a quiet atmosphere to relax and sleep at night, the Dana is not the hotel for you.

We had booked on the springtime stimulus package which meant paying the amount upfront. When we arrived at reception we were informed we had booked for 2 rooms. After going away to see someone in the office the chap on reception told us that we would still have to pay for one extra night for the unused room. Not a great start to the holiday which meant me hanging around in reception for nearly 3 hours as I was not prepared to pay, meanwhile leaving my family back in the room with my young daughter in tears. This was eventually sorted though and I must say the manageress who saw me was very efficient and polite. When we got settled in we realised the safe was not working so had to call reception, the guy who came was quick and again very polite. The room we booked was lovely, a duluxe balcony room with 2 queen beds. The only downside was there wasn't an extractor fan which meant opening the balcony doors each time we took a shower, normally not a problem but it was a bit chilly on our stay. The beds were very comfy and the hotel grounds were well kept. All the staff we met were great from the cleaners to the managers, a nice touch being the helpful concierge at reception. As mentioned the grounds were lovely and both pools were great. We used the marina pool which the kids loved especially the jacuzzi, all with complimentary towels. The package itself was good value and meant us being able to book a better room whilst also getting $25 a day towards food etc. We used the blue pearl for breakfast which was efficient with nice food. We did use the firefly restaurant but only for a nightcap as it was a bit too over priced, the staff in here were lovely and made us feel very welcome. Whilst here we visited Seaworld using the complimentary shuttle bus which was well organised ,again with a friendly face behind the wheel. We also did the zoo and the old town which is a must. We would have liked to have done more including hiring bikes to do the trip around Mission bay (28 miles in total we were told) but the weather held us back a bit. The Danas location for us was great and everything was within easy reach with a car, the only negative was you had to use the car even on a night as everything was further along the beach. In the end I'm glad we chose the Dana which looks impressive from the outside and doesn't disappoint on the inside especially when passing other contenders for our booking on mission bay.

We were upstairs at the end of a block and the noise from people walking up and down the stairs was bad - but the noise of the traffic outside was unbelievable. If you are staying here do not stay in the 500s block., it really was one of the noisiest hotels I have ever stayed in. I think if you were in one of the blocks with the marina view or pool view it would have been much nicer in that respect.", "Date": "April 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Beach, CA", "Title": "\u201cSo much more than we expected\u201d", "Author": "Twenty3Skidoo", "ReviewID": "UR28267721", "Content": "We booked our room through AAA.

I booked a deluxe premium bay-view room with a breakfast package via a booking engine which made it quite clear what I was booking and paying for, but I checked Trip Advisor just the same. What I found was alarming, as several people were claiming a \"bait and switch\" done by the hotel upon check-in. My only thought on this is they booked the lowest rate on any given reservation site, but on researching many sites, could not find one that wasn't clear about the room being booked. My advice would be to specifically book a room in the Water's Edge buildings, specifically a premium bay view if you want the best view of the bay. If you're concerned about cost, book the cheaper, older rooms in the old section, but expect to get what you pay for. In our case, we feel we got MORE than what we paid for. We got exactly what we booked upon check-in, experienced GREAT service from everyone from front-desk clerk, to maid service staff, to the bartender at Firefly, the shuttle drivers and EVERYONE at the Blue Pearl. I find that if employees are treated with cheerfulness and respect, you'll generally get the same back. The breakfast package was a total of $60 for our room, which was enough to feed our family of 4, and was very good. We ordered dinner to go, and that was excellent, also. The service was fast and friendly, almost classy, given the fact it's a casual, family-friendly eatery. We only had drinks at Firefly, but as I said before, the bartender was fantastic, the drinks were great, and he even found us some bread and dipping oil. The pool by Firefly is the better pool of the two available because of the view of the bay and the fact that it's lit at night. The Tropical Pool at night was a little creepy and dark, but would be nice during the day.

My husband booked this hotel the morning we left the house so we didn't have a chance to do much of a research. Location.. Next to the Marina. If you're looking into launch your boat or anything that requires boating, this might be your perfect place. Otherwise, it is close to Sea World, it does offer shuttles from hotel to Sea World three times in the morning and three times in the afternoon. Departure times are 9:30, 11:30, and 12:30, returning time 4:30, 5:30 and 6:30 (could be a bit off since I'm working off of memory at the moment). Since we have smaller children we prefer not to take the shuttle for the flexibility, so on top of the parking we're paying at the hotel, we're also paying for the amusement park parking. Walking is 15 mins or so, which also doesn't work well with younger children. There are kayak and bikes for rental, but scenery is much limited. Our kids looked at the boats for about 2 minutes and got bored with it. There aren't any shops to browse. Hotel room: We paid the $40 upgrade to get the Marina view room. Let me describe the buildings first. It reminds you of those motels you have a open walk way and everyone's windows are facing the walk way. If you don't open up the shutter blinds the room would be quite dark, but once you do, you're pretty much open to the entire building guests that walks by.. trust me, everyone walks by just couldn't resist to take a look into your room. Since the walkway is open to the parking right infront of the building, you hear people talking in the parking lot on top of the activities in the hallway. Lucky us happens to have some guests yelling from parking lot to building 1am in the morning. Our room does have marina view... but you have to leave the blinds open to see through the hallway to see it, which was total waste to us. I do noticed a newer building somewhere on premise, but I do not even want to know how much more it would cost us. Room is quite cramped. Two beds fills up the whole room, and they managed to squeezed a tv and seating into it which makes it impossible to move around with the 4 of us. My side of the bed which is close to the window barely allows me to stand up and walk sideways, and I'm a skinny person. Windows shakes when our neighbors slams the doors or stomps in the hallway. Bedding is firm, and pillows are small and fillings aren't fluffy anymore. Room seems pretty clean, our feet stayed clean even though we're walking barefeet. I've stayed around San Diego area numerous times. This is the first place I'm incredibly disappointed with and will not return. It truely made me feel like I'm staying in a motel 6.

I arrived after traveling from the east coast with my wife and 3 kids. I had found a good rate about 2 weeks prior to arriving and checked out reviews on tripadvisor and discovered there seem to 2 distinct class of rooms here.Those that have been renovated on the bay, and those that have not. We arrived around lunchtime andI was immediately informed the great rate I got was for an older room and that they would gladly upgrade me to a bay view room for another $50/night. With the reviews fresh in my mind, I upgraded but I really felt as though I was being played, like this goes on all day with peolpe that have gotten good online rates for the inferior rooms. It really felt like a bait and switch. Being early , I was told our room was clean but had not been checked yet. My wife was not feeling well and I asked how long it would be ( realizing we were there about 3 hours before check in. I was told \"about an hour.\" We decided to get some lunch at Ocean Beach hoping that all my wife needed was some food after a long day of travel. We got back about 2 hours later and my wife had a migraine at this point and really needed to lay down. I went to the desk ,told them my wife was ill and asked if I could check in. I was told the room still had not been checked. When I reminded the woman at the desk that she had told me the room would be ready an hour ago., she very sternly told me we were sill about an hour or so away from official check in time. Let me say, I am a stern believer in \"Don't tell me what you can't do, tell me what you can do\". This person seemed unwilling or unable to expedite our check in or to find us another room. Finally after about 30 minutes we were able to get our keys to our room. Imagine my surprise to find our room did not overlook the bay, but instead overlooked a public park. Beware that in the renovated building that has the upgraded rooms, the left one-third of the building does not overlook the bay, but a public park. Our ground floor room had a sliding glass door that opened right into the park. Needless to say we did not feel great as we saw a few homeless people walk by our patio during our stay. That being said, the room was clean and the kids enjoyed the pool. The location is hard to beat.

We chose this hotel as it was close to Sea World, there was a hotel shuttle from the airport (for a fee - $6 each), a free shuttle to Sea World and to the cruise port. There were also amenities right on the property as we did not have a car. The hotel is an outdoor hotel meaning all room access is from outside. The hotel is in a beautiful area with a marina, walking/bike paths, bicycle and other water toy rentals. There is a beautiful pool area as well. The property is spread out with multiple buildings. We stayed in the newer section of the hotel on the third floor overlooking the bay. Our room was a king with a small sink, microwave and refrigerator. It was roomy, had a nice balcony and contained a lot of tile with granite counter tops. Very nice, comfortable and clean. The older areas of The Dana are two story buildings with drive up parking surounding the buildings. They were renovating many of the older units while we were there with new carpet and paint etc. There are two restaurants on the property. The Firefly, which is right off the pool area has a full bar and is more upscale but has drink specials and a good selection of draft beer and wine. The food is very good and the folks who work there are excellent (Jason). The Blue Pearl is your basic breakfast and burgers type restaurant. While the service and the people were excellent, the food was terrible. When we arrived at the resort we were tired from a long travel day. We had a few drinks in the Firefly and then decided to just eat at the Blue Pearl and call it a day. We both ordered burgers. They were burnt to a crisp. I am not talking well done, I am talking crunchy charcoal burnt. We were exhausted so we did not complain, still tipped 20% as the people were great and called it a day. Our room package included breakfast (up to $15 each) at the Blue Pearl so the next morning we set off for breakfast. My wife ordered an omelette and I ordered the heart clogging ham, bacon, sausage, eggs and hashbrowns and toast. The eggs were ok but the ham was tough, some of the bacon and hashbrowns were burnt and the sausage was not browned at all and looked uncooked. I don't eat food that looks uncooked and I don't eat burnt food. My wife's omelette was brown. Now I assume the issue here is that the grill is simply too hot. Ok - so that was breakfast on day one. Again we didn't complain. We should have though. The next day, same thing. Again we didn't complain but still took care of our server. The part that is baffling is that the servers and managers must see that the omelettes are brown and the bacon is black. Anyway - enough about the Blue Pearl. It will be interesting to see how people describe their dining experience after reading this. I say this because upon return I was emailed by the hotel and filled out a survey. I brought up the items I listed above and managment took care of us by refunding our dinner meal and offered a discount on our next stay. We were assured that the issues were taken very seriously and they would follow up. I commend management for that as it is very obvious they have strict rules about taking care of the guests. My guess is that this property has had past problems and they are trying to turn it around. A couple other items - as you have read, the folks who run the shuttle are great. We had a great time at Sea World. The weather was beautiful and the Shamu show \"Believe\" is a winner. Shuttle to the cruise port was easy as well. The front desk and concierge are top notch too. Because of the people - we would come back to this hotel. The only item I would like to see changed is the fee from the airport.

As for the rooms the hotel was a little run down. The bathroom walls are patched and the windows leak when it rains. The hotel could use some updating but it was a clean and comfortable room for the money. The hotel business center is hardly a business center. It is one computer that you can use in the middle of the lobby. where anyone and everyone can see you type. I would caution you to becareful with the shuttle. It is three minute ride that takes over 30 minutes. It may be worth it to pay for the parking at sea world.

My husband booked it and I must admit to not having read TripAdvisor reviews beforehand, so maybe our disappointment was our own fault..... The hotel website shows lovely rooms, so I was quite surprised when we drove in to what appeared to be a fairly ramshackle site. Our room was in one of the older buildings, admittedly facing the marina, but opening on to a public walkway (which we had assumed would be divided into private balconies). The whole room shook every time anyone walked by and noise was a constant problem, especially at the weekend. You make a choice between privacy and natural light - if you want the latter you must have the wooden shutters open but the world and his wife can look in as they walk past. Also the walls are very thin and we could hear conversations in the next room. The bed was comfortable enough but facing it was a huge cupboard, half TV cabinet and half wardrobe; with the doors open for either function, it was impossible to walk past the bed. Off the bedroom was a space containing a double sink unit but there was no door for privacy - do I want to watch my other half brushing his teeth, or vice versa? Then off this space was the bathroom with toilet and bath, thankfully with a door. The air conditioning was incredibly noisy. It would start up like a rocket motor, clatter away and then stop altogether till the next time - like Chinese water torture if you let it bother you. We asked to move to the new block with private balconies, but they could only offer us one overlooking 'parkland' i.e. a strip of green separating the hotel from the road and for 4 nights only, so we stayed where we were. Our breakfasts were included to the tune of $15 each at the Blue Pearl, and not once could we reach this total. Hearty is the word that comes to mind! On our first night we ate at the more upmarket on-site Firefly restaurant and had a disastrous encounter with a waitress which left us feeling like we'd been part of street theatre or a 'happening' by the end of the meal. This put us off till our last night when we ventured back and to our relief were served by a very nice young man - and the meal was good as well. We were glad we kept our rental car for the duration of our stay, as it would have been hard to get around by public transport. However, we didn't like being presented with the parking charge when we checked out - not mentioned on any previous occasion. There was free computer access in the lobby, which was a bonus, and people were very good about keeping to the requested 10 minute limit if there was a queue. If we return to San Diego, I would not stay here again.

Although we went to San Diego for the zoo, the location was nice. We got the corner Premium Bay View Suite with king size bed (room 2320). We got there early but they were able to check us in early, which was nice. I guess they weren't that busy since it's no longer summer. Having an active toddler we liked the size of the room. He loved going out on the balcony, opening and closing the sliding door. Having a mini fridge and wet bar was also convenient because I was able to keep all of his snacks in there. On to the complaints: When I made the reservation, I requested a crib. When I checked in (at 1:30pm), I let them know that we requested a crib-they said they'll come set it up. We went to Balboa Park, came back around 5pm and still no crib. Called the guest service and 30 min later, they brought it. It wasn't a crib, it was a small pack and play. (which my son doesn't sleep too well in) The king size bed was really bouncy and uncomfortable. My husband and I were tossing and turning and every time one of us moved, the other will bounce up and down and get woken up. After tossing and turning for 2 hours, I finally went to the couch and slept there. They didn't have any extra blankets or sheets in the room so I slept without anything over me. The air conditioning system was LOUD. I mean LOUD. If you have it on auto, it makes a HUGE clicking noise whenever it turns on. I was so worried that it would wake up our baby, I turned it off but then it got really humid so I turned it back on. Even thought we were in the newer part of the hotel and in the corner, it has no sound proofing system so you can hear the music from the pool/restaurant area and there was some weird noise all night. I think it was the elevator. The sound traveled down the hallway and right at the end of the hallway was our room and when you open the door, that's where the bed is. Bad design to have a bed right in front of the door. Every time someone slams the door, you get woken up. (and you can only close the door by slamming it since the door knob doesn't turn) If you order room service, be ware that they include gratuity already plus a $2 service fee. I wasn't paying attention to it so I totally over tipped them. The restaurants were good but felt a bit pricey for the quality of the food. Had much better dinner across the street at Red Marlin at The Hyatt.

Here are a few points: POSITIVE: - Location, location, location = we did some jogging around the harbor and spent most of our time on the beach, so the location was perfect. We didn't go to Sea World, but if you want to go there you can take the free shuttle from the hotel. - Pool / spa = neatly kept and perfect for relaxing - Price = we paid $70 per night on priceline which is far below full price and even below a regular Holiday Inn type hotel in the area AVERAGE - Room was pretty small, but you get what you pay for. I've seen reviews in which people were disgusted by the \"older\" section of the hotel and were upset they had to pay $60 to upgrade to an ocean view. If that's the case, then book direct and pay full price. We were willing to have the older section and a \"motel\" type room in order to save money. - Refrigerator in the room was nice NEGATIVE - Weight room = for someone who spends a lot of time working out, the place was almost non-existent. These days hotels seem to feel that putting a treadmill in a small room with mirrors qualifies as a weight room. - Movie access = we always enjoy watching movies on vacation. The room had no DVD player. We brought a portable of our own and had no way to plug it in. When we asked about it at the front desk, they said it wasn't possible, but that we could purchase movies directly on our TV. We looked into it, but the selections were minimal and it was $12 per movie! - Parking was $12 per night. We were told when we called ahead that parking was free, but apparently not for priceline customers. Even with the addition of the parking we paid $82 per night, so we can't complain, but it was an unpleasant surprise.

The older section is a set of run down brown painted buildings which makes up most of the rooms available to guests, the newer section ( shown on the website) is a modern looking concrete building with a balcony for every room. We booked our rooms through Travelocity, paid extra for the Marina view and were horrified to find ourselves spending the night in the old section of the hotel. The rooms are dark and smelly with the only window facing a path everyone walks by, making a zero privacy situation if you want some natural light and keep the blinds open. The blankets on the bed were faded and stained. There is zero sound proofing so we felt we spent the night with our neighbor and their cranky toddler. The next day we were moved to the newer section, unfortunately having to pay the upgrade fee, the rooms there were much nicer and brighter. We could also keep the blinds open for natural light. The new building is nice and I would recommend that if you are going to stay at the Dana request the new section. Although they seem reluctant to move guests to the new section. This upgrade did cost me an extra $400, whether staying there was worth the price is debatable, in retrospect I should have checked out of the hotel and booked one closer to the city. The benefits of the Dana Seaworld is a ten minute walk from the hotel, forget the shuttles they are scheduled at awkward times and only run once an hour three times in the morning and three times in the afternoon, the last shuttle leaving Seaworld at 5.45 sharp There is a Marina close by where you can buy snacks and wine at reasonable prices They give you plenty of towels and coffee in your room daily, much more then the average hotel Be aware that this hotel is a $25 cab ride to the city, so if you want to spend time in the city and not on the beaches I would recommend you find a hotel closer to the city center, we ended up paying far too much for cabs during our stay to see the city. The shuttle from the airport is a joke, you need to call them when your plane lands to pick you up, even booking it ahead did not work for us, and we ended up paying a cab to take up there after we waited for an hour and watched other hotel shuttles come and go. Even though you are required to call them ( we found this out from another shuttle driver who saw us waiting) there is no courtesy phone at the airport, for those of us coming in from other countries with out working cell phones this is a pain.", "Date": "September 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "PARIS", "Title": "\u201cExcellent stay at The Dana\u201d", "Author": "NEEDLES75", "ReviewID": "UR19948208", "Content": "Superb location in itself and within the San Diego area.

I definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend staying in the other sections, however, as they had a much different feel. Minuses: The hotel is not service-oriented. It appears to be much more oriented toward special events than paying guests. #1 complaint: Parking There is inadequate parking at the hotel (and there is no street parking). Every evening a significant portion of the parking was marked \u201creserved for event parking\u201d and we had to circle the lots to wait for someone to leave in order to get a spot. This is inexcusable in a hotel that charges for parking. #2 complaint: Food 1) The first evening we arrived at the main restaurant around 6:30. There were many tables inside and out empty. We were told that we couldn\u2019t be seated until 8:00. 2) The second day we wanted to have lunch before attending a 2:00 wedding. We walked to the coffee shop-type restaurant at the far end of the property, were seated and handed breakfast menus at 11:15. We requested lunch menus and were told that lunch wasn\u2019t served until 12:00. It was suggested we go back to the other hotel restaurant because lunches were served there starting at 10:30. After walking to that restaurant, we were informed that no lunches were served there, either, until 12:00. Breakfasts only at 11:30? This is not a guest-oriented facility. 3) The only food available in the \u201cgift shop\u201d was a basket of chips, etc. and another of candy bars and supermarket cookies\u2026far fewer choices than the vending machines one finds in a standard motel chain. #3 complaint: Bathroom ventilation The lack of a dedicated fan in the bathroom is a real problem. It takes about 20-25 minutes for the bathroom heat and steam to clear after a shower. Trying to do makeup and hair for a formal wedding in the bathroom was torture. It was like trying to get ready in a sauna. In summary\u2026The views were terrific if staying in the newer section, although you pay a lot for them. But don\u2019t expect the service or amenities you\u2019d find in someplace similar. The older sections looked dark and unappealing and the huge tour bus we saw parked there made us wonder if the hotel catered to group travel.

Like other guests we also were wondering about the parking fee they charge, which seems to be invented after 2005 (12 Dollars per day!!!). But we still were looking forward to our stay. After our first night the housekeeping forgot to prepare our room, if this would have been happen once, we wouldn't mind, but this happened three times during our five days stay and we had to call the reception every time! Instead of an excuse we just got the info, that this is normal if there is a \"Privacy please\" sign outside or that the housekeeping will take care in the afternoon - unfortunately we removed the signs after 10 am and usually came back in the evening to our room. So for people who very appreciate cleaning on time we can't recommend The Dana. Beside the Housekeeping the reception staff was also less friendly than 3 years before and because of the new invented \"Pool parties\" and \"Cocktail Happy Hours\" the other guests changed enormously, so for example we avoid the tropical Pool thanks to dizzy guests or awakened on our last night when a drunken guy were banging and slamming the door next to our room and screamed on his wife (?) to get excess.

The desk clerk said they had been cleaned but not yet \"inspected\". We waited another half hour. On weekends the Dana seems to be primarily a \"wedding event\" hotel, and if you're not part of the event you're rather crowded out of the facilities.

The king premium room had a small counter with a sink, cupboards, microwave, and small refrigerator.

The hotel is within a short walk to Sea World, but also provides a very prompt shuttle service. We watched the fireworks from Sea World on our balcony.

The Good: *The standard room was really nice, clean and modern, with a large comfortable bed and large LCD tv. A/C and shower were good - the price wasn't too bad either. *Tried the Blue Pearl restaurant, staff were nice and food was pretty good in quality and price (for a hotel). They also had a more pricey one called Firefly, but didn't try it. *Ordered the free shuttle back to the airport on departure and it was there and ready to go on time. *Walked to Seaworld in about ten minutes, although they also run a shuttle three times a day (ask the concierge for times). *The pools looked really nice but didn't fancy them as the air temp was about 65F. The Bad. *On arrival at SD airport we called the hotel and were told by staff to wait in the wrong place for the complimentary airport shuttle wasting about an hour and a half, although after that were told to get a taxi which they refunded. *One night around 4am heard a gnawing either on the roof or in the ceiling which was really loud. I put up with it maybe an hour and finally called reception told them there was something trying to chew it's way in. Was told that maintenance wouldn't be in until 8am and that they'd take a look - we didn't leave that morning until 11am and nobody came. When we got back there was no real sign of anyone checking our room out. My partner called the front desk to find out what had been done - their reply was \"We don't get animals on OUR roof\" and that was it. Most of their staff seemed fine, so I won't judge them all by this one guys attitude, but to say it stank is an understatement. Other notes of interest: *When booking, pay attention to which rooms you book, the premuim rooms are all in a newer larger building with good views over the marina, the standard rooms are layed out like a motel (external corridors, no balcony, etc) - although inside were of a good standard. *Check in really is at 4pm and wasn't negotiable, unless you pay $60 a night more for a room upgrade. Those are magically available. *The area shuts down after about 6pm, so if you've not got a car you're limited to the hotel restaurants (and the other hotels nearby) or public transport out of there. *If you've not got a car you've a couple of choices because you're not in walking distance of anywhere except Seaworld. 1.

The advertisement on the hotel's website shows a photo of a modern looking lobby area. The modern part begins and ends at the lobby area. The standard rooms are actually motel style -- not a traditional \"hotel\" arrangement at all. The standard room conditions were atrocious. Stains on bathroom walls and door jambs, pubic hair from last guests around bath tub, bedding in our room had not been changed since last guests checked out, shabby and dirty carpets, old wall paper peeling away, messy low quality paint job with paint on fixtures and anything abutting the walls, scarred patched walls, wall light fixtures (some with actual working bulbs) askew, bathroom door hinge pins rusted and nearly out of the hinge, and hand lotion and fingerprints all over blowdryer in bathroom. These are just some of the things we immediately experienced upon checking in. The hotel staff was very polite when we called to ask if there had been some mistake, but there was no mistake. They apologized that the rooms had not been properly cleaned before we were shown to the rooms. No amount of politeness made up for the poor room conditions. After being unable to reach a manager, we asked the customer relations person to send housekeeping to clean the rooms while we went out for a couple of hours. There was no perceptible improvement upon our return, so it appears the Dana has an extremely low standard for cleanliness and hygiene. There was even a cloth napkin from a prior guest's room service meal still on the floor at the table after housekeeping supposedly cleaned the room. Use of vacuums in the room by housekeeping seemed to be optional, and it was not opted for in our case. When I spoke to a manager after the \"special cleaning,\" we had to ask for new bedding to be brought to the room so we could change the sheets used by prior guests ourselves. I asked if we had been issued lower quality rooms because we had booked through a third party, hotels.com, and she assured me that was not the case and all the standard rooms were appointed exactly the same. How sad for this motel and all those who make the mistake of booking a standard room here. The only positive points I can think of are proximity to Sea World, the pools were decent, and the staff was polite but not particularly helpful or effective. This was the worst hotel experience I have had in 15 years. Ironically, the room rate was much higher than the Hyatt Regency at Garden Grove we had just stayed at for the prior three days.

First the good stuff: --Excellent staff, helpful concierge. --Great location if you want to visit SeaWorld, Mission or Pacific Beach, Downtown, the zoo etc. Not too far from any of this. --Many updated features like granite bathroom countertops, stainless steel mini-fridge, clean chairs, newer furniture, etc. --Key-access gated parking lots --Firefly Restaurant (onsite) had upscale food & ambience, good service --Family friendly pool areas But the bad: --The standard room is extremely small. We had 2 queen beds (comfortable). But the walking space between the foot of the bed and the large armoires was about 24 inches it seems. For 7 days, this narrow path was our main walk-way in the room. --The electric outlet for our TV was loose and sometimes it had to be jiggled to get the TV to turn on. --Spots of black mold in the grout in the shower. Everything else was very clean as far as I could see. The bedspreads were dark patterned and the carpet was very dark. Loud, dark patterns always make me wonder what they're trying to hide. --Walls are rather thin. And the heavy mission style wooden headboards pound against the wall when neighbors get frisky. Kind of annoying for 10 minutes, everyday at 10 pm. --Blue Pearl Restaurant (also onsite) OK basic food, but overpriced because there's no ambience, just ho-hum service and nothing special on the menu. If the re-do was as clean and dramatic as their lobby area, I would have been impressed. But what you sense in the lobby is not what you feel in the rooms. This hotel was less expensive than some other options in the area, so I can't ding them on overall value.", "Date": "April 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kirkland, WA", "Title": "\u201cWorst experience ever\u201d", "Author": "mello614", "ReviewID": "UR14714667", "Content": "I booked the Hotel via Travelocity a month in advance as I knew things would get hectic for the following week (spring break). I received a confirmation and the money was taken from my account etc. The plan was to drive down from Washington state. I emailed the hotel to let them know we would be arriving late on the night we were to arrive and received a reply saying no problem. We arrived at 5 A.M. due to traffic and bad detours--we were totally exhausted and only wanted to sleep as we had been driving since 9 AM the previous day. I go to check in and was told that we didn't have a room--that somehow something had happened maybe due to construction in the hotel but there was no room for us. I was beyond upset and furious as well as frustrated. The front desk lady was basically just trying to say \"well sorry--here is a voucher for a nearby hotel for tonight. I called Travelocity to see what could be done and they said we couldn't get a refund for 7-14 days. So now I am stuck I have no room and the voucher was only good until checkout which was in 6 hours. I didn't have any extra money for lodging as i had paid it already and it looked like we would be staying in our little car for the rest of the trip. We went to the other hotel and slept for maybe 4 hours and received a call from the Dana saying they had a room now. The room was supposedly an upgrade with a marina view but it was pretty small. The paint was cracked and peeling on the ceiling, the entertainment center rumbled wildly when anyone passed by outside--so bad that I thought it was an earthquake. We purchased a movie to watch and the channel was so fuzzy you couldn't hardly see it and when i called maintenance the guy said nothing could be done yet they still charged me for it. They also charge for parking daily which i thought was a bit much. The people here need an overhaul in the customer service department to say the least--while i was complaining to the front desk lady about not having anywhere to go and needing a resolution, the security guard stepped forward at one point and said \"nothing can be done--you need to leave\" I will never stay here again and will tell anyone and everyone i know to avoid it as well.

We stayed at Dana Mission Bay for 3 nights. I actually looked at the pictures on this site and on their website to see how it looked like. Unfortunately, I did see the good side of the buildings but not the older side. So this is actually more to show you guys how the rest of the building looks like and my amateur review of the hotel. Good: Customer service was great! I actually booked on the wrong dates but Gary, the front desk guy, booked me in without any problems. I have to say that these people are really very good. At the restaurant, their service was excellent too. The manager, ANna, was going around making sure everyone was happy. They really make you feel like it is a four star joint. Food was good too. Location was also good. However, we were too busy to enjoy the bay since we were out all day. By the time we got back, it was dark already. Perhaps, during the summer months with longer day, a guest can have more time to enjoy the sunset. The room: Its renovated with granite counter tops and nice looking tile in the bathroom. Microwave and small fridge are included. The room looks good (see pictures). BAD: Nothing serious! I thought that the price for the hotel was a bit much. The place looks like it should be $75 to $89 per night type of a place. Not that it run down but just comparing it to other 3 star hotel that I've been too. Most of what you will pay for is the location (see pictures). WATER was too hot. If you got kids, watch out. HOWEVER, their bay view rooms are located in the newer building, which looks pretty good (did not go inside / see pictures) Overall, this was a nice place to stay in. Quiet and comfortable bed to sleep on. The hotel is really trying to be a four star hotel. The service is a four star but the place is a 3 star because its an old building looking like an old motel but beautifully remodeled. If you choose pool view, 1st floor is best since it has a patio. If you choose marina view and actually want a view from your room, go to the second floor not first. Careful of the hot water.

Room was spacious and clean. The only complaint I have about the room is that the air conditioning and heater is a tad bit too loud. But once it gets to the temperature you set and shuts down, it's a peaceful night's sleep. It's in a very convenient location - about 10 - 15 minutes walk to SeaWorld. The hotel also provides a shuttle service to SeaWorld. One down side is that the restaurant there, Blue Pearl, is quite pricey. Definitely not for students trying to save money. However, it's located near Pacific Beach (PB) with lots of shops and restaurants. For those without cars, the public transport system in SD is very decent and will definitely get you where you're headed without much hassle. The Dana is a 10 minute bus ride from PB center and buses are pretty frequent. Had dinner at Great Moon Buffet - wonderful American, Japanese and Chinese cuisine for decent price (12 bucks for dinner buffet). There are also boat and bicycle rentals in the Dana itself. For those who are more adventurous, the prices aren't too bad. Check out was quick. However, we left our luggage with concierge for half the day. It took them at least 20 minutes to recover our luggage. They stored it in a different building and I was glad that they came back as a whole. This part spoiled the whole Dana experience for me. Overall, very nice hotel. The staff is friendly, just a bad experience with waiting on the last day. I'd give it a 4/5.", "Date": "December 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "ca", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, not the best experience\u201d", "Author": "blessing06", "ReviewID": "UR11921657", "Content": "After lots of research and reading the reviews we decided to stay at Dana.

The rooms are equipped with microwave, small fridge and a small bar sink. We stayed in the new section and I would highly recommend the new section as the old section does not look good. Try to get a room in the new section on the third floor to get the best views but if you have little ones it's nice to have the bottom floor as they have a nice grass area to play some ball or just sit on the lawn and capture the view. It's very close to Seaworld but not walking distance but easy access to everything. The only down side is that you are unable to hook up your own XBOX 360 or anything that would use the video inputs. They do it on purpose so you have to buy their games and/or movies. So when you have kids and you want to bring their XBOX, Wii or Playstation or a DVD Player you will be unable to hook it up and they do not rent out DVD players (again they want you to buy their movies) which is really petty and ridiculous in my opinion. Use the concierge they were very helpful in recommending places to eat. Overall the experience was great and I read many of these reviews complaining about the staff and honestly I think people demand a certain service but this isn't a Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons. For the price in comparison to Paradise Point it was good value. Paradise point feels more private and secluded and if you stay at their bay front rooms it's phenomenal but then you are paying over $600 a night it's pricey and the rooms are not that large and not renovated. Even just their bay view rooms are cramped and cost $400 - $500 a night.

Some basics first. The hotel is next door to SeaWorld, which means it's packed with families of screaming kids. Actually, The Dana is really two completely separate hotels--an old one and a new one--on the same property. So there are two restaurants (one Denny's-like and one fancy schmancy--both very good), two pools (both crowded, with loud music starting at 9am), and most importantly, two entirely different hotel experiences. The old part of the hotel is pretty much the worst decrepid motel you can imagine, where you can hear screaming kids in adjacent rooms at all hours, see light under your doorway all night, with the bed right up against the door. We switched to a newer room (the more expensive ones) after one very miserable night. The new rooms are large, quiet, and gorgeous, with balconies overlooking the bay. But here's the catch. Everything that doesn't work (the air conditioning, the light that won't turn off, etc.) requires day after day after day of calls to guest services, waiting on hold, waiting at the front desk, talking with an endless stream of downright nasty and incompetent hotel manager-types, waiting around for hours in the room for repairs that never happen, when all you want to do is get out and enjoy San Diego and to come back to a room where the basic necessities you're paying so much for actually work. It is for this reason that a stay at The Dana is a very unpleasant experience, and one that will leave you still needing a vacation.

We had a premium bayview room in the 'new' or Water's Edge section of the hotel. The room was very good size and slept all five of us comfortably...2 queen beds plus a sleeper sofa. There was a kitchenette with a small fridge and microwave (which was a necessity with an 18 mo. old). We were located on the 1st floor and had a large patio with a great view of the bay. A previous review stated that their review would have been negative had they been on the 1st floor, however, for a family with small children, we enjoyed the fact that our kids could go in and out from the patio without worrying about balcony heights. The patio was enclosed with a gate that led out to a grassy area. Yes, occasionally people passed by our room, but it really was not a big deal. The bayside pool was great, water temperature was perfect, and the poolside food from Firefly was fantastic. It was a great way to relax between 11 hour days at Legoland and Sea World.

You have to walk across the patio to the Lobby and use the restrooms there -- very strange and inconvenient. We stayed in the 600 building (old section) and were very disappointed. Our room reeked of Lysol spray when we first checked in. We had to air it out before we could even go inside. The room was on the first floor and we felt if you opened the shutters, everyone walking by could just look right in and see what you're doing. Absolutely no privacy if you want to enjoy the parking lot view or get some light into your room. The room was very cramped with way too much furniture crowded everywhere. The desk clerk said we had a kitchenette which I had to laugh at when we discovered that was a small refrigerator sitting on the floor with a microwave on top of it. There was no closet, instead a separate armoire took up valuable floor space and had a broken door. The TV stand was huge and tall as the clothes armoire with drawers under it. The bottom drawer was broken and had to be lifted each time you wanted to close it. The wall unit air conditioner was located in the dressing area next to one of the double sinks. So you froze while getting dressed. The room was so crowded (2 queen beds, table, 2 chairs, bench, 2 armoires, nightstand, refrigerator, microwave) that two people couldn't walk next to each other when going from the bed to the bathroom. I can't imagine staying there with more than 2 in a room. One really annoying event happened each day. Our maid would change the radio station on the clock radio and turn up the volume to some Mexican mariachi music. If we didn't remember to turn it down and put it back on smooth jazz EACH DAY, we were jolted out of bed in the morning. She also failed to leave coffee cups (paper) each day. The new section looked nice with very large patios. If we return next year for the same meeting, I hope we can stay there rather than in the \"slums.\" We ate at The Firefly several times and liked the size of the dinners. They offered small, medium and large plates. We found the flatbread pizzas offered under \"small\" plates to be more than adequate for dinner ($12). They had several very good toppings ranging from steak to shrimp. They also offered macaroni and cheese at $9. We had a dish of this one night and thought the flavor was good, but it was extremely dry, maybe due to our eating at almost 9:00PM. The second time someone in our group had it, it was creamy and flavorful and also earlier in the evening. Service was slow. We do not recommend trying to walk to Sea World. It isn't just across the street as someone said. We tried to buy our tickets in the Lobby as we were told we could do. The consigierge was in training that day and no one else was able to help us. We decided to drive over and pay $10 to park. The hotel offers a shuttle, and it only runs in the morning and the evening but it's easy to spend the whole day at the park. Lots to do. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful most of the time. It's a shame they just don't get rid of these old buildings and replace them with some wonderful new rooms.

Room was smaller than out bedroom at home, dated, smelly and downright scary with the woodshake fire hazard roof. Recent remodel consisted of new carpet and paint. All walls were a diffrent shade. Bathroom was cramped. Went to the front desk and complained. Terrible customer service. Finally offered $40 a night upgrade to new side. Went and checked it out. Called wife and told her to pack up stuff and kids we were changing rooms. New room had king and fold out couch. Room was beautiful could not get any better. Beautiful view of bay. And the homeless people living in the park. And the fire pits used by rowdy drunks. Oh well. Pool was nice. No enforcment of pool rules so it was a dumping ground for parents to send kids. Hotel charges $10 a night to park. Was told it was a new system. I picked busy times in Lobby to complain and usually got my way. Hotel comped parking but is so limited you still ended up parking and walking a ways. Not fun with 3 small kids. Credt card was charged out at front lobby as the charged us a $100 per day incidentals charge as well as the $40 a day upgrade. Again I complained enough and hotel comped room and refunded charges. Racked up after 9 days. The web site does not show the old side at all. Stay in the new side if you go here. I suppose I expect a little more after spending over $4000 to fly myself and wife and 3 kids down there for vacation. I do recomend the jet ski rentals $100 an hour. Overpriced, yes but was a blast.

We did a lot during our stay. The dates of travel were Dec 26, 2005 through January 1, 2006. I know this trip was awhile ago, but I thought the details might still benefit some people. Day 1 -- we flew out of O\u2019Hare in Chicago. We flew Southwest Airlines which really stunk. We had to be up at 6am to catch our flight. We landed and took off at least 4 times during our flight there. It was a real pain in the butt. It was almost like riding a bus because we kept stopping to let people on and off in different cities. Also Southwest Airlines doesn\u2019t reserve you a seat, they have a first come first serve type of thing. I highly recommend going online 24hours before your flight to get your boarding pass. If you get pass A you have first choice. Then pass B and then pass C. If you are traveling with a large group of people (We had 4) you want to have pass A so you can all get seats together. That was really a pain to have to try to find internet access at our hotel to print boarding passes so we could get pass A so we could all sit together. But luckily our hotel in Cali had internet with printer. After arriving in San Diego at 2:20pm (cali time) we has to take a bus to the car rental place. I believe we used Alamo. We didn\u2019t have our car until after an hour because they had such poor planning going on there. The line was out the door, and they didn\u2019t have enough cars for people who had already reserved them. We reserved ours at least 6months in advance and there was still a problem. After the rental car mess, we finally made it to the hotel we decided to use. Dana Inn on Mission Bay. This was excellent! We LOVED the tropical cabana look of this hotel. After a long day we decided to head out to find food. We ate at Guava Beach. Everything tasted like fish, even the French fries. Day 2---San Diego Zoo---a major let down. Ever since I was a little kid, my mom and I wanted to go to the San Diego Zoo. It was nothing like I had seen on all the Travel Channels and such. I would probably never go back. Personally I think the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago is much better. I even think that our tiny zoo in Kalamazoo is pretty close to the same. It wasn\u2019t anything spectacular as far as zoos go. We ate breakfast at a place called Jimmy\u2019s before going to the zoo, which their food was good. The zoo had good food too, considering it was zoo food. Then we went to Baker\u2019s Square for dinner, also very good. Day 3---For breakfast we ate at an interesting place called \u201cHide Away Caf\u00e9\u201d and it was wonderful food! We went to Legoland in Carlsbad. We had called before we left to ask if we had to purchase a ticket or if we could do a shopping pass. They let us in on a shopping pass which was between 1-2 hours (I cant remember). They held our charge card incase we didn\u2019t make it back to the gate before our 2 hours ran out. Mom and I went shopping while Dad and my Husband went around exploring the park. This pass was awesome because we were able to roam the park and go shopping, we just couldn\u2019t ride rides or see any attractions. When it got close to our 2 hours time limit we went back up and told them we had more shopping to do so they extended it 1 hour. This was perfect. We were able to take pictures of all the cool Lego things and finish our shopping. It was free, and definitely worth the time since my Dad loves Legos as do my nephews. We also visited Carlsbad Premium Outlets. We ate at Ruby\u2019s Diner, but the food was horrible and I actually think it is what contributed to me feeling sick for the rest of the day. We also went shopping at another place later that day and then everyone ordered Pizza, which I didn\u2019t eat because of feeling sick from Ruby\u2019s Diner. Day 4--- Denny\u2019s for breakfast! Then to the Wild Animal Park. This was WAY better than the Zoo. They had an awesome safari ride through the open savannah where the animals roamed. It was really cold in December though, so bring a jacket. We also got to go at Sunset and it was really pretty. Also, we waited in a line that took about 2 hours to get through to do this, but it was the best thing at the whole park. We also ate lunch there which cost $55 for 4 people to eat hamburgers! Very expensive, but the food did taste good. For dinner we ate at Sizzler, which is always good. Day 5--- Probably the worst day of the whole entire trip. We ate breakfast at Cocoa\u2019s Caf\u00e9, which was good. We went on the Hornblower Whale Watching Tour\u2026please see my review on this. It was horrible. Everyone was sick on the boat, including my mom and I. We only saw 1 whale, which took forever to find and wasn\u2019t even easy to see. We did see sea lions which was cool. But not worth the amount of people being sick and the amount of money paid. When we returned back to our hotel we had to spend most of the day lying around recouping from the trip. Hubby & I walked around the Bay and hotel taking pictures while Mom laid in the bed sick. Later after everyone was feeling better, we went to Horton Plaza, which was awesome. We ate dinner at the Panda Inn there and it was very good. This mall was great. Day 6--- Old Town. Breakfast at IHOP. We went through all the shops at Old Town. It was very neat and worth the time. We ate lunch at a place called Cyote Caf\u00e9, because we wanted \u201cAuthentic\u201d Mexican food\u2026.and it was not good at all. Wouldn\u2019t eat there again. For dinner we went to Tony Romas and the food was good there. We went to a Peir 1 outlet store, which was really awesome and had a lot of good deals. I would def. return there. We packed our bags to go home. Day 7---Went back to Jimmy\u2019s for breakfast. Then later that afternoon went back to the Gaslamp District (Horton Plaza) and had lunch. We had to leave today, so we just walked around for a short time and then returned the rental car. That was the end of our trip, except for the lousy flight home on South West Airlines!", "Date": "June 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for the price (stay in the NEW SECTION!)\u201d", "Author": "Court_SF", "ReviewID": "UR7655488", "Content": "There are two parts to this hotel--the old side and the new side.

We stayed at the newer section. I have read here that the experiences of people who stayed at the older section are not necessarily the same. Having said that, our stay at The Dana was a good one. There were virtually no problems with the room. My wife was attending a conference at a nearby hotel and I mostly stayed in the room during the day, working on my laptop. When we got to our room I was dismayed to find there was no desk in the room. Yes, there is a round table with a couple of chairs but the table was too high for me to use it to type on the laptop, so I had to use my lap. This was disappointing but ultimately, I worked around it. The other thing that we didn't like was that the bathroom was as dark as a cave. One of the lights was out, but I could see that even if the bulb had been replaced, it still would have been pretty dark. If you are a woman and you want to put on makeup, you're going to miss not having a bright bathroom, although there is an enlarging mirror.

THE ROOM: We were given a room in the new section (as requested) overlooking the Marina. It was nice and large. I called the front desk and requested a crib (had forgotten to do that when reserving a room) and they delivered on within 15 minutes (which is much faster than other hotels have been). The \"double\" sofa bed was actually only a twin, but that was fine with us as we had brought a blow up air mattress for my son. There was plenty of room for everyone we could still move around. We had a nice balcony with a table and two chairs. The bathroom was spotless and really nice with a natural skylight and wall lights (no florescent lights). The toilet had a quiet flush on it and my son loved that there were q-tips and cotton balls in the bathroom along with the shampoo, mouthwash & conditioner (little things impress 9 year old boys). There were also two robes and slippers for use. There was a nice sink in the bathroom with a fridge and microwave (they even had a recycling bin under the sink). It was very comfortable and quiet (although you could hear the airplanes from time to time). THE POOL The kids loved in. It was heated with nice views, good size jacuzzi. The pool on the old section was also nice, although no views, but they had ping-pong and other games as well. The bar would put any drinks in plastic cups for you so you could take them to the pool area. THE CONS Not many, and we were there over presidents day weekend, and the were fully booked. No rooms available at all. Our room was not cleaned until 3:30 in the afternoon - which was a bit late for us as we left in the morning before 8:00 and were back to relax and clean up for dinner at 3:00. THE RESTAURANT: BLUE OYSTER Breakfast is available at the Blue Oyster in the old section, and definitely has a dated feel to it. The food was okay. Nothing great, but average hotel breakfast food. The service was slow (had to ask for things several times, including coffee refills). Would not go out of my way to eat there, but it worked for breakfast.

Using TripAdvisor to search for a comfortable, clean hotel with nice pool for my daughter to swim in. When we arrived at SAN, the complimentary shuttle to and from Dana had already left. So we called the hotel to ask when the next shuttle will come to pick up from SAN. She said, everyhour on the hour. We couldn't wait there that long so she told us to take a taxi and they will reimburse the fare (not the tip). When we arrived, my wife and daughter didn't look impressed because it reminded them of a motel or a bungalow. The bldg is mostly made out of wood except for the new section overlooking the bay. The staff was super nice, especially Kevin the bellman and Ana the mngr at the Blue Pearl. They both went out of their way to accomodate us. Kevin gave us a ride to Sea World after we missed the shuttle again. The swimming pool was great. Anyway, the rooms we booked thru Travelocity, came with free breakfast for two everyday. Priced at $169/night w/breakfast or $159 w/out (thru Dana). The only problem, it's a set menu of 2 eggs or pancakes or french toast, then 4 sausages or 4 bacon, then hash brown, and toast, then coffee,or tea or juice. So for the next 3 mornings that's what we ate. It kinda got old after the third day. Imagine if I booked for 5 nights. Yikes! If your going to order pancakes or french toast, you'll overload on carbs for sure because you'll have pancakes, 4 pieces of toast, and hashbrown. That's why the second day we ordered eggs to balance carbs with protein since we were going to get toast and hash brown anyways. The two breakfast was enough for the 3 of us to share. Back to the rooms. The first night, it was terrible! Travelocity advertised the rooms as new rooms overlooking the marina. When we got there it wasn't the new section but the refurbished. The room was small and cramped with 2 queen size beds. There was no vent blower in the bathroom except for a tiny window near the ceiling. My wife hated that since she had to follow right after my using the restroom. Guys you know what I mean. And did I say it was a small room? The refurbished room was noisy because of the wood structure, and wooden hallway. We were on the bottom floor so we can hear our upstairs neighbor with toddlers who kept running back and forth, and playing with the noisy, banging cabinets. Our room sounded like a bowling alley. The walls were not very sound proof. We slept terribly. Everytime someone upstairs had to go to the bathroom we can hear their footsteps. Even very late at night we were awoken because of the footsteps. The next morning we complained and told them we were checking out to another hotel (a brand name hotel). We also told them that when we booked the rooms it stated \"new\" rooms. We showed them the print out from Travelocity. So she said no problem she can give us the new section rooms overlooking the bay. The new section is really nice, roomy, quite and wonderful view of the bay. It's made out of cement and had an escalator. The beds weren't all what i've read in TripAdvisor. It was clean but average. By the way, the newly refurbished room we originally booked overlooking the marina was actually overlooking the parking lot which overlooks the marina. If an SUV parked in front of your room on the first floor, then you'll be overlooking the SUV. All the rooms use a pull-out cabinet that has a spring like action when pushed back-in makes a banging noise. So at one point, we heard our neighbors from upstairs, downstairs, left side, right side all opening and closing their cabinets. The sound proofing was not up to par. Parking is free and the location between LaJolla, Old Town, and other tour sites is great because it's situated mid way of these sites. The Firefly restaurant was above average, except for their $6.50 dry chocolate cake. I think it came from a Safeway or Albertson. My wife and I shared the \"paella\" which was excellent. Probably one of the best. (We're from San Francisco, CA) My daughter ordered cheese pizza shaped like a fish from the kids menu. She said it was the best pizza ever. If you like Mexican food make sure to go to Old Town. You can also visit the first Mission built in the area -Mission San Diego . In the future, I will put more weight on how many stars the hotel is rated instead of the reviews. The Dana is a 2 star Inn. I guess reviews are all relative to ones expectations. If your staying at the Dana, make sure to stay in the newly built section. If you don't, I think you'll be disappointed. One more thing, we we're told by a nice fellow from a rental car to check on-line for great discounts, before renting cars. We rented a compact car for $31.99 per day, The Dana was renting it for $39 per day thru the same car rental. But we were told afterwards by the person in the rental place to check on-line.

This afforded me extra peace of mind that my 3 year old would not push a chair to the rail and jump over the private balcony. My husband also had a bungee cord in the car and we just tied that around the latch of the patio gate which kept my little ones safe inside our room area. The service at the Dana is excellent...I felt like royalty because any time I called the front desk or room service ...they addressed me as Ms. Hunt before I even identified myself. The only problem I did encounter was when the crib I requested came the man set it up in a flash and once he left I saw a jagged broken wood spoke that would have surely caused loss of an eye or worse...when I called they rushed over a playpen instead...which wasnt as good as a crib...but my baby seemed fine once I used our own bedding. ALSO THE ROOMS NEED MORE LIGHTING...VERY DARK. But newer nonetheless. THE DANA NEEDS TO CHECK UP ON THEIR MAID SERVICE...SHE COULD HAVE DONE A WAY BETTER JOB AT TIDYING UP. The restaraunt food was very good at the Blue Pearl....perfect for families trekking off to Sea World...they even have an aquarium with all the Nemo fish inside it that my boys flipped out over. BE SURE TO CHECK FOR OTHER RATE PACKAGES ON THIS SITE THAT OFFER THE BED AND BREAKFAST SPECIAL.. wE ORIGINALLY booked thru the hotel site ...then I noticed a better rate with breakfast at the restaraunt included at the same price...I emailed Becky at the hotel ..she was awesome and she granted us the same rate with breakfasts included. The portions were HUGE and we just spit it with our younger kids with plenty to spare. WE spent $199 a night with 2 breakfast passes each morning thru the hotel...it was a great stay! If you need another hotel choice to consider...I was looking into the Bahia...I saw it across the bay from our patio room and it looked really nice on the beach room side. Also they have a fun looking old fasioned ferry boat that cruises the bay every night thru that hotel...we enjoyed watching it from our room and could hear all the disco music and lights going as it paddled by..we wished we were on that dancing and having a cocktail but had too many kids with us :)", "Date": "January 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cNothing to complain about this hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Nelleke", "ReviewID": "UR6634651", "Content": "I loved this hotel.

I find the quality of the older rooms acceptable, though not spectacular. There were reviews written about the noise levels - we didn't find it to be that big of a factor as other guests really respected each other. We only heard other guests as they were getting out of their car or passing by our room. This property is best if you have your own car and want free parking as well as peace and quiet when you are at your hotel. This setting juxtaposes the hotels by the beach, which allow you to just step out of your room and go to the beach. Those hotels have a relatively noiser environment and parking there costs extra. The Dana is actually only five minutes away from the beach, so every time we wanted to go to the beach and eat there, we just drove there. The only challenge was to find parking, but that wasn't too difficult either. Make sure you go back to the site often to check the room rates - they change it from time to time, so be sure you get the lowest rates when you check in. The big plus is the fact that there is a computer AND a printer at the front desk for guests to use -- the obvious downside is the fact that there is usually somebody using it.

We thought we were going to be in the new building the whole time! A little forthought on the part of the front desk would have prevented this situation. When we declined to switch rooms on such late notice, the desk worker asked me to come sign a waiver so that if we were injured as a result of the remodel, they would not be held responsible. Again, we declined. To their credit, they did end up giving us one complimentary breakfast the next morning to make up for the disturbance. Also, the location was beautiful! We went for a walk all the way over to Belmont park area in the evening and felt very safe in the neighborhood. The hotel also had a great shuttle service to nearby Seaworld and the airport.

I think you get my point. The Dana spent how much on these two new beautiful buildings? but failed to make them the least bit sound proof ! What a big dissapointment. I had ended up using Tylenol PM and EarPlugs just to get some sleep. (even my 13 year old had to wear earplugs so he could sleep) The hotel was booked solid so there was no switching rooms, plus who knows we may have been worse off moving. Upon check-out when asked how everything was, my husband told the gal and she just kind of gave him a blank stare. All of the others who have given this hotel excellent reveiws must be hard of hearing or just don't value peace and quiet. I would not recommend staying here at peak travel season or if you're wanting a quiet romantic vacation. I don't think staying on the third floor would be much help considering, it wasn't just the people above us, we could also hear the people in both of the rooms on either side.

Certainly I would recommend the added expense of going for a bay-view room. The hotel has 2 restaurants, but we only sampled the Blue Pearl, which was very good. The staff there were extremely friendly and the menu had a surprisingly widespread appeal. The hotel is superbly located for access to SeaWorld, with a shuttle bus being run a couple of times a day. They also have a good deal of a 2-day pass at the price of the normal entrance - see the concierge. Would also recommend the $150 per head close encounter with dolphins. My wife and I came out of the dolphin pool on an incredible high and couldn't stop babbling for the next hour. I would recommend it most strongly to anyone who can afford it. The zoo is also well worth a visit and an easy way to see the sights is via the hop-on, hop-off bus. All tickets available from the concierge. Our only criticism of the Dana is the reception/check in. The staff there didn't seem particularly helpful, nor flexible. Without exception, every guest that arrived before the statutory 4pm check in time was told that their room wasn't yet available and to check back at 4pm. Miraculously, at the stroke of 4, all rooms suddenly became available and were allocated to guests!

The only disappointment was not getting into the newer part of the hotel as we were initially told.

We were told the newer part of the Dana was unavailable our first day, but would be available for us on the second day. On day two I called to verify the move and was told it would be an additional $70. I told her this was unacceptable, that we were told before even arriving, and reiterated at check-in, that a room in the newer part of the hotel would be there for us at a never mentioned additional cost. The clerk then changes the price to $40. I told her to make up her mind and just forget it. The only problem in the room itself was the dresser cabinets. They sit next to each other. The lower part were the dresser drawers, and upper part was to hang up your clothes. The TV was located in the cabinet closest to the bathroom and directly in front of one of the beds. Those sleeping in the other bed had to strain to see the TV. Not sure why they didn't position one of these cabinets more centrally to make it easier for everyone. With all of that said, even though the exterior of the older part of the hotel isn't pretty, the rooms are still very clean and the wooden window shutters were a very nice touch. There was also a second pool dedicated mainly for guests staying in the older hotel. It was a good size surrounded by comfortable lounge chairs, each with a towel already set out for you. There was also a tiki hut that served drinks. The pool was gated and part of the pool backed up to the backside of some rooms. This would be the place to stay on a first level pool side room, where you could walk right out your back door and across your small patio into the pool. All of this again surrounded by many palm trees for seclusion and for those not looking to get burnt by the sun. Overall, not getting into the newer part of the hotel didn't affect our time there.

I'll agree that the outside of the older buildings did look old and motel-like, though recently painted. However, the room may have been recently renovated. The sink area had granite countertops and the carpet seemed to be pretty new (berber type?). The light fixtures were contemporary with white rectangular shades and brushed metal bases. Outside the room, there was a small patio with a couple of chairs and a table. The landscaping was quite pretty and I enjoyed strolling the grounds. The pools were both nice. I preferred the one by the new section because it was warmer. =) Both pools were large enough to do short laps and were not overly crowded. They put out pool towels on the chairs and replace them when they are used. They also served drinks (at least at the new pool).

We were in the area with my sons soccer team and several families participating in a tournament. We had a total of 8 families who stayed at the Dana. Not one complaint from any of them. The staff at The Dana is very friendly, helpful and efficient. We had a couple extra requests and they were taken care of immediately. The hotel grounds are clean and well kept. They have security personnel walking around, too. The concierge desk is staffed with some very knowledgeable, friendly people. We stayed in the newer area of the hotel, in the Bay View Rooms on Waters Edge. These rooms are large and all have water views. We were on the first floor, so our balcony opened right up onto the grassy area by the water. There were a couple chairs and a table on the balcony, too. The weather was cold & rainy so we didnt really get to take advantage of our ideal location. There are 2 pools, the one near the lobby and our room was very pretty. It had a nice large jacuzzi, which my kids enjoyed! and the pool was heated nice and warm. They have towels by the pool, too, which was a nice touch. The hotel room (room 1109) itself was really nice. As you enter there is a closet on the right, and the bathroom to the left. A nice touch is the motion sensor light that goes on as you enter the room. The bathroom was spacious and beautiful! Dark slate tile & granite countertop. A ton of counterspace, as well as some shelves to put things. Tub/shower combo. Water got hot quickly and decent water pressure. There was a small kitchenette, too. With a microwave, refrigerator, sink & coffee maker (with plenty of coffee supplied). There are cupboards to store your food items, but no utensils or bowls/plates. Two queen size beds (not the most comfortable, but nothing horrible), and a twin size pull out sofabed. A table and two chairs, nice armoir with tv & drawers for storage. The room has plenty of lamps/lights but none of them get really bright. They had sliding plantation shutter doors, which were really nice! I want some for my house. We were very comfortable in the room! The tv had a movie channel and a Nintendo you could use (I think there was a charge). They had wired and wireless internet in the room, which was nice. We ate at one of the restaurants at the hotel, called the Firefly. Its right by the pool area. The food was good, a little expensive, but good. They had burgers and fried shrimp, salads, etc and its also a bar so you can get a drink and sit by the pool. The rooms on the other side of the lobby are the older, motel style rooms. The families in our group who stayed on that side enjoyed the hotel just as much as we did. They had harbor views and pool views. Some faced the parking lot, but no one in our group had one of those rooms. I did not personally see the insides of those rooms, but they said they looked like they were recently remodeled. The location of this hotel is ideal if you are going to Sea World. You can walk (takes about 15 min) or its a 2 min. drive. They also have a shuttle, but it has only a couple of scheduled drop off/pick up times. There isnt any fast food nearby, you'd have to drive to that. Dana Harbor is right there, for boating/fishing/etc. Not much else within walking distance, but everything else is short drive. Downtown San Diego (Gaslamp area, etc) is about 15 min away. Hotel Circle area is about 5 minutes away. Its right off the 8 freeway and right off the 5 freeway. Negatives: For us the ONLY negative thing was parking. If you leave and come back after 8pm there is no parking near the Bayview rooms. Its a good walk from the other parking areas, so keep that in mind.

This time the room did not stink and it was made up. The room was clean. The bathroom left something to be desired and was definatey not renovate just had another coat of paint thrown onto it, but having only the toilet and shower in there was nice with the sink and hairblower outside the door. Other than a few minor things with the bathroom the room was adequate. The bed was comfortable for a double- they could not accommodate our request for a queen as they were full for most of our stay and we had been moved enough.

Nice intimate lounge and the sports channel was always on for my husband which helped! The menu had a fair variety, and the \"fireworks drink\" comes very highly recommended.

The 'new' section is logistically isolated from the motel section with what technically amounts to its own pool and common area. The rooms are newly furnished, with perfect views of the adjacent bay. We were situated in a ground floor room and therefore I was able to sit on the patio and watch my daughter as she played in the grassy area between the room and the waters edge.

You can make it to downtown San Diego in less than 10 minutes by car. It is very quiet at the Dana, and totally relaxing. The staff went out of their way to be helpful to our family, and I appreciated that very much. We did not eat at any of the restaurants on premises, but they looked great. We ate when we were visiting the Zoo, Old Town, the Pacific Holiday Bowl parade and game, and all the other great places to visit. I would recommend this place in a heartbeat. I did not go into the older units (Marina Cove). It appeared to be an older portion of the Dana, but appeared to be in nice shape. Lots of renovation was on-going on premises. If you go, visit Mission Beach (4 minutes) and Pacific Beach (10 minutes) for shopping and the beach.", "Date": "January 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Dana!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4305982", "Content": "This was our first trip (Nov. 22 - 24) to San Diego with the primary purpose of going to SeaWorld and Legoland in Carlsbad.

The beds were very comfortable and bedding of high quality. The room also had a microwave and small refrigerator. The view from the room is very nice and the hotel landscaping is very well done. We used the pool (heated) on one evening and my daughter really enjoyed it. The pool was pretty large and the jacuzzi was also very good in size. The hotel had a bar right outside of the pool area (didn't try it, but looked very nice). This hotel is very close to SeaWorld and you could walk if you need to but the hotel has a shuttle.

The decor was dark & the bathroom small but there was a good wet bar with microwave, coffee maker & granite top. We spent Sat afternoon by the pool which was awful! no towels were provided & the hotel had 2 back to back weddings taking place. The band was so loud & the music clashed with the piped hotel grounds music. One wedding finished at 5pm , the other started at the same time so the hotel was heaving with people !! very very busy. We were trying to have a meal in their restaurant Firefly but there were so many wedding guests passing chairs over our heads, smoking cigars & cigarette ends all over the floor. That night the revelry continued to very late. If you are looking for a quiet hotel , I would strongly recommend checking if there are any weddings booked! The hotel is quite small and really this took over every available space as their facilities are all very near to each other. The service by the pool was non existent ( noone there), the service in Firefly was very poor - our meals came up wrong & we told them 3 times but they did nothing to change them. The decor in Firefly was also disappointing , not as nice as the web picture shows. The front desk was unhelpful - we checked in at 10 pm but were kept waiting whilst the check in chatted to his colleagues about Las Vegas. On check out when they asked us for feedback & we told them these comments, they offered to take off our internet connection only ( $3.95!). The Dana could really improve their service, there were old messages left on our phone from the pevious guests, our room was not made up til 3pm, there was no turn down service, the toiletries were cheap & unappealing, there were no bathrobes provided.

I must have had 6 different reservations at different areas within Mission Bay/Mission Beach. This hotel was great. I can't be any happier than I was. The view is just so beautiful. We stayed in the new section which is all white 3 story buildings. In what I think was a jr king suite. It had a small sink and frig and microwave which was perfect to keep snacks and reheat any leftovers we had from restaurants. The bed was comfortable and the room was large enough for my husband and 7 year old son. The staff was very nice and friendly too. For this part of our trip we were not looking for a large resort, just a clean large enough room, with a beautiful view of San Diego. There was a pool that children and adults were swimming in at all times of day and night. It was clean and heated I'd imagine because I couldn't imagine swimming in it at night because it was cool out yet many people were. I did some laundry too while there because we were headed to Hawaii for 10 more nights. I had to walk over to the older building to do this so I saw what it was like there. There was a pool there also which looked very nice too. As far as the brown buildings everyone was referring to as being awful well I didn't see inside the rooms and yes it would look much nicer if it was brand new and white as the other side but it was by no means awful as people have said. Of course if the hotel was uniform than it would be that much better but believe me the area is just gorgeous. We did eat in both the restaurants that they had. The firefly and the Blue Pearl. Both excellent. What I thought was so great was that on the patio of the Firefly, which overlooks the marina and the pool area, there were nice tables with an open door to the restaurant which also had tables. There were heated torches all thru the patio because it was quite cool in the evening so you could eat outside or just have cocktails in the great atmosphere and it was warm. The lawn at the back of the hotel was big and perfectly manicured and it overlooked the water. You could sit outside your room if you were on the first floor or just sit on the lawn and relax. Bring food or drinks there and watch the boats. There was also a bycycle path that was along the lawn and marina. You could rent them at the hotel. If I were to return to San Diego I would stay here again and definetly recommend this hotel. Yes I would recommend the new section but again, as far as I know the interior of the older rooms have been redone as well so I'm sure that they would be just as nice. If you don't want to take a chance just book the newer section. I did see the Catamaran and the Bahia while traveling around and just looking at them without even entering the parking lot, I was very happy with my choice. The location was much better than these other two hotels and the feel of The Dana was much nicer. We also saw great fireworks from Sea World on our room balcony every night at 10pm. The location to Sea World was a 5 minute car ride. You could walk but I don't think I would. It would probably take 15 minutes but you are walking on a main road.

Food was great and so was the service, nice atmosphere at both. The Dana Inn, however, is another story. First things first - the Dana website is simply inaccurate, it is a LIE. The photos are very decieving and HIDE the half of the hotel they don't want you to see with computerized images of trees (I kid you not). The lobby and NEW half of the hotel are pretty and modern. The other half is not very nice. Many have noted that the upgrade to the rooms made them better on the inside - it didn't. My friend's room was considered an upgrade from mine - their bathroom sink was in the foyer and they did not have an armoire - they had NO PLACE to hang their clothes, just a few drawers. It seems that they just slapped together whatever leftovers they had from the newer side to spruce up the older ones. The rooms felt like a motel off a highway. The price difference between the new side and old side is huge (and neither are very reasonable). Several rooms on BOTH sides face the highway which you will hear at night if you don't turn on the air conditioner. Also - PLEASE BE WARNED their \"fitness center\" consists of one treadmill, one stairmaster and one stationary bike, period. No weights, no nothing else. It is located off the pool in a room the size of my bathroom. All of this would not bother me so much if it weren't for the horrible service, which both sides have to deal with. The Dana is run by high school and college-aged kids who have not been trained on much of anything. Just one of many examples - my friend's room key stopped operating properly (this happened to all three couples in my group as well as one family I noticed complaining when I was checking in). Rather than fixing the problem, the concierge made him stand on line behind about 10 people who were checking in. This is just insane in the world of customer service. I stayed at the Dana to run the San Diego Marathon, a six night stay. I was given a room on the highway side (my friends, who were spectators and checked-in at the exact same time as me, were given upgrades). I had to fight for a move - the staff stated that they would not accomodate me for at least 2 more days. Eventually I gave up because I simply wanted to unpack already. The hotel staff knew that I was a runner as they gave me a packet upon check-in, but no upgrade for me. It gets better. The ONLY reason why I picked this hotel was for their shuttle service to the race. Rather than dealing with confirmation and payment upon check-in, they had me & 60 others stand on a line at 5am the morning of our marathon (6:30 start) to do this. Then there was not enough room for me in their shuttle. Please keep in mind, they had called me at work in NY THREE times to confirm my 5am shuttle reservation. Yet after standing on line and paying for my ride, I got bumped. I had to take a cab at 5:30am. Then, at check-out, they STILL wanted to charge me the extra fee for the shuttle. I am at a loss for words at what the staff at this hotel did to me. The really sad part is that the location of this hotel is prime and the grounds are beautiful. It has a nice resort feel, whereas most hotels in San Diego feel like just hotels. The pools are nice, although having to use a room key to unlock the pool was a bit obnoxious - I believe that they have a problem with homeless people (I saw many sleeping on their lawns during an early morning run). The Dana has so much potential, but the service was just so poor. In my case, they knew that they had faltered and gave me some $ off on my stay. But this just does not make up for their actions or lack thereof. I have never in my life had such a bad experience.

There are only 3 washers/3 dryers for the entire complex so get there early. One of the dryers has a broken, rusted screen in the back which I didn't see until it had ripped 4 shirts/sweaters. The hotel would not compensate for this until I called Orbitz. Also, the soap machine was out of order through out our stay and you had to get change from the front desk to use the machines. Yet, when I went to get change, they only had $2 worth, which wasn't even enought to wash/dry one load. I had to ask people standing in line for change. The phones were not working for 6 days of our stay - they would ring with nothing but static. We were woken up at 3:00 and 3:30 in the morning by the ringing.

I think they meant off the back community balcony where everyone walks to their hotel rooms - not exactly the place you would stand in your pjs at 10:00 at night.

To which we responded not to worry about it. We left our bags in their storage as advised by the front desk and when we went to collect them despite having the tickets, they had trouble finding them. We then had to lug all of of our bags to the room the front desk had allocated us only to find that the room key did not work. Housekeeping checked the room and it was not even cleaned, so this meant another long walk to the front desk. They allocated us another room and we had to lug all of our luggage up a flight of stairs. The room once inside was nothing special, but clean and much better looking than the outside of the buildings. We had been allocated a room near the pool which my son thought was great. The next day the nightmare began.... we arrived back at the Dana at 6pm after a day at Seaworld to find that our room was completely empty with no note or message. We rang the front desk to be told that they had moved us to a room in the new section (and we would be paying an upgrade fee) to which we responded that we had not requested this as we were satisfied with the room we had and were not prepared to pay extra. We were then told that our things would be brought back to us straight away. WRONG.... Our next suprise was that they allocated our old room (which were still inside as the room key had worked) to another family. So now our room key did not work and we had to do the long walk to the front desk again.

We were made to make a list of the missing items and the manager on duty replaced the miscelaneous items and assured us that they would check with housekeeping to locate the other items the next morning. For our inconvenience they sent us a fruit basket (which was a nice gesture). My husband checked the next morning and was assured that they had located items and they would be in our room by the time we got back that evening. When we got back from a day at the zoo etc, nothing had been returned. We contacted the front desk and were told that they had located my shampoo (not the other expensive personal items which we were more concerned about).

Once we got into the room it was decent. I am not complaining. The walls and ceilings are a bit thin as far as hearing your neighbors but that only happened a couple of times. The vanity had granite counter tops and was nice. The bathroom was small, only a shower. The remodelers that were used didn't exactly do the best job painting. There were a few missed places. The ceiling over the shower appeared to have or had some mildew on it. The room was clean for the most part. Nice decorations (mirrors/armoire/chairs) There were a few spots on the carpet. The housekeeping service seemed to come later in the day than preferred. One night we did receive an unwanted wake-up call at 3am but when this was brought to their attention they did offer to buy us breakfast so they did want to make up for it.

Review your bill carefully, they like to charge you for gas upfront and another daily \"service rate\" (kind of like a AAA service). There is nothing in writing that these fees would be refunded (as the clerk stated) posted in their office or on the charge slip. The clerk offered to hand write on the charge slip that I would be refunded if I filled up the gas tank upon return of the car. I challenged both fees and made them take them off - which I'm happy to say he did. Bad start to my trip though. Now onto the Dana. Absolute difference in level of service upon arrival. The best part of the stay at the Dana was the personnel. Everyone I encountered was marvelous, starting with the crew at check in. The level of professionalism, mixed with a personal touch was much appreciated at all venues - both restuarants, gift shop, concierge and several desk clerks. That said, the rooms unfortunately did not live up to my expectations. The carpets were well worn with \"huge\" spots. The bathroom just okay. Beds also just ok. The grounds were \"cute\" - birds of paradise plants everywhere making the facility look a bit tropical. Location to seaworld obviously a positive, but my trip did not involve visiting the park.

There were a couple problems with the room upon arrival, but once notified friendly office staff, technicians were knocking within minutes of call to solve the problem. Very prompt. The location of our room was fabulous. Have a 7 and 2 year old. We were in the 200 rooms, right out our door was rec area with foosball tables, ping-pong, shuffleboard and pool. Make a left about 10 feet was pool - gated, securely locked. The sliding door in room that lead to the patio area had an extra lock at the bottom of the door to secure so TODDLERS are not able to get out. The carpet in the room we stayed in was filthy. Wore shoes on the carpet at all times. The room was a bit smaller than usual, but not tiny. Those was pretty much the only complaint that was not resolved. I would probably return to the Dana however if the carpets were replaced that would be great.

After an early evening bumper-to-bumper drive from LA, we pulled into the Dana's reception area and were, at first, pleasantly surprised. It was new, well lit and very clean. We all (wife and two kids) were looking forward to a quiet evening by the pool. The front desk was very helpful and checked us in quickly. We went to our room, which was above the old reception area on the second floor. There was no close parking, so I had to lug our luggage 20 yards from the only available parking spot which was dark apparently due to a light being out. As we came up the steps, one of our backs got snagged on the nails that were sticking out of the wooden railing, ripping the zipper open! Then we opened the door to the room and we knew we were in trouble - the carpets were stained and black with dirt, and the bedspreads were dirty a well with yellow stains! The room was warm, so I turned on the AC and my wife went in to shut the window in the bathroom. As she did, the shutter on the window (for privacy?) fell off, smashing the lamp and bruising my wife! I went to clean up the broken plastic with a hand towel, and the towel turned black from the dirt on the bathroom floor. We used another damp towel on the carpet, which also turned black! We called the front desk concerning the window, carpets, etc., and were told this was the only room available unless we wanted to upgrade for $100 a night! They requested that we stay in the room and they would find us another room the next day (by now it was 10:30 -11:00pm).We reluctantly stayed in the room. The next morning, the front desk, as promised, found us another room, which was a little bit larger, but not any cleaner. The carpets were so dirty, that we had to wear sandals once we got out of the shower otherwise our feet needed to be cleaned again before we could put our socks on! Because we had pre-paid, we had little choice but to endure the grime! By far, this was the WORST hotel I have ever stayed in for the money.

I reserved a room from the \"Entertainment book,\" which gives 50% off selected hotels. I checked the facility online, and it seemed extremely nice. The person making the reservation told me of the great rooms and amenities. After checking in the room (with my husband and my 3 y/o), my husband and I were horrified. The bathroom was dirty, and it seems that nobody cleaned it properly for months, including, but not limited to, the bathtub, shutters, windows, floor (I wiped the floor with a piece of tissue, which turned grey), and the mirror was completely stained. The carpet wasn't vacuumed, and after removing the bed cover, we noticed crumbs and a lot of dirt all across the wall (accumulation of a period of time). I called to complain and was told that somebody will be there to clean. While waiting, I started to clean the bathroom. It felt like a not so clean public bathroom without the paper covers. A maid showed up with a bottle of spray and a cloth. After seeing the room, she went to bring a vacuum and more cleaning stuff. We left the room and let her clean. The place was cleaned very superficially. The bathtub still had hair. I cleaned it with soap and a washcloth, around down and up which turned the wash cloth black. I didn't dare put any clothes in the closet. The smell was unbearable. The air conditioner was so old and loud, I had to use ear plugs. The sheets were not changed the next day. If I knew the real condition of the rooms, I wouldn't have reserved a room. If I knew they had different rooms, I would have paid a little more. Although we were very disappointed from the room, the exterior was very beautiful. There is a nice bar by the pool, and we enjoyed the \"Blue Pearl\" restaurant. If you decide to use this facility, I strongly suggest that you request and receive a room in the new wing. After checking out, while at Sea World (which is two minutes away), I remembered that I dropped my expensive sunglasses in the room behind the bench, just before checking out, but I attended to my daughter and forgot to pick them up. We came back before heading home and were told that they weren't found. I showed the front desk girl a similar pair belonging to my husband. I went back to the room, which was already cleaned, but they were not behind the bench or anywhere else.

They said if you left this little card on the bed they would not change the sheets, however, I did NOT leave the card on the bed and came back to an uncleaned room with the beds merely made. One good experience was Kevin at the front desk who suggested a restaurant, gave us a card to give to the restaurant for special treatment and offered to drive us there and pick us up.

The room was overly spacious (even with 2 adults and 2 kids) and very clean. Everything was new. The countertops to their mini-kitchenette (microwave, sink, and small fridge), dining table, and bathroom sink were made of granite. The shower walls were made of stone tiles as were the bathroom floors. All the faucets and hardware were by Moen. The hairdryer that was provided was also of good quality. Request buildings 1000 and 2000 since these are the new ones. The other buildings w/rooms looked much older and as other reviewers stated, looked like a motel. We had no problem w/ hearing every little noise as some of the reviews stated. The walls must be well insulated in the new buildings. The new pool was very nice too overlooking the marina. You could see the Sea World fireworks nightly from the pool area and grass areas. We traveled w/another family and requested adjacent rooms. We lucked out and were also on the ground floor which was convenient since the kids liked running around on the grassy area right outside the patio and bay is just beyond the grass. The view of the bay was excellent and unobstructed. Mission Beach was a 5 minute drive away and Belmont Park is next to it too. The Dana Inn had a complimentary shuttle to and from Sea World which was very convenient. This is a great place for kids and families! The breakfast was also very good at The Blue Pearl on-site.

The hotel,(motel section) is old but clean, and was a bit noisy with the 2 pools open late and the wooden balconies. The staff could bone up on the local attractions but were as helpfull as they could be. The hotel has only 1 shuttle to Seaworld and had no tour or bus arrangements. (they suggested the local transit bus). The gift shop is WAY too small and carries very few ammenities. All in all, I reccomend the property if you are travelling with kids or just want a nice casual place to stay close to some very beautiful sights.

I told the girl I would really appreciate a room away from the pool and somewhat more quiet since we did not children and didn't really want the noise. She rather curtly told me she would see what she could do and come back at 4:00. We waited outside until 3:30 and I went back and spoke to a different girl and our room was ready; the one overlooking the pool. While I was waiting, the couple next to me asked for a room with two queens, which is what we got, and she was given a king. She was told she had been upgraded since they closed some of the other rooms. Lucky her! Get to the room, no tub, moldy shower only. It's very noise from the pool and the carpet was absolutely disgusting. Went to dinner at the hotel restaurant, not that impressive and rather pricey. When we tried to go to bed, the noise was so loud until 11:00 p.m. when the pool closed; but the people in the room below, who had a balcony, decided to drink and talk until about 1:00. Then the people next door banged around on the walls half the night. And the pillows!!!! They stunk to high heaven. Take your own. Next morning, get up plug in the hair dryer and curling iron, and blow the fuse. After 6 minutes of letting the phone ring in the office, my husband had to go down and there were three people standing around; could not understand why someone didn't answer the phone. Five minutes later maintenance was there to tell me we blew a fuse and it was fixed. Had breakfast at the hotel restaurant, again pricey and not great service. Every night it was loud by the pool; so unless you have kids and don't mind the noise find another area. They new section looked nice from outside, but the old section should be condemned. All the rooms that we passed on our way to the stairs (no elevators) looked as bad as ours. I had stayed at the Dana years ago, and had hoped for the same experience; but was completely let down.
