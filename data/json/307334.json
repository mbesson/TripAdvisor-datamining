Then some more service. I've stayed here every year for 6-7 years now. Let's get the negatives done with. It's a little out of the way so you'll spend money on taxis or get to know the Tokyo transport system. The building is architecturally dull. The style is classic Four Seasons wannabe- Eurotrash decor, a bit overstuffed and pastel (I'm not a fan of that, many people are). The indoor pool's a bit too warm, and short, for a serious pool workout.Everything else is wonderful.The gardens of Chinzansou are among the most beautiful in Tokyo if not Japan, perfect for an uncrowded stroll. The rooms are large, with a good working desk, free internet (a bit slow, but hallelujah nevertheless). There's a kettle in the room (another hallelujah), and a sound system that plays your CDs or MP3 player (my favourite nice-to-have luxury in a hotel room). The bathrooms are good, with a big long bath and enough lighting to read a book in the bath, and of course (this is Japan) with high-tech toilets that do things to your butt that'll make you smile. The FB is close to perfect, tho' the hotel could do with a slightly more relaxed dining venue option. The spa is wonderful, including an outdoor jacuzzi and an indoor hot spring.But the main thing is the service. Of course unfailingly polite, but it's efficient, friendly, and thoughtful. Check-out was super-fast, as if they knew I was coming down to the desk before I got there. The housekeeping staff addressed me by name, in English. They put my cufflinks in a little box for me on their initiative. The bar staff understood I was on a conference call on my cellphone and served me a drink and a snack by sign language, with a polite smile despite my rudeness. I could go on, but the staff here are, I think, the best I've come across in terms of training and client-facing efficiency.And to be honest, this hotel is not expensive by the standards of super-five-star hotels in major cities globally.", "Date": "Nov 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR755755169", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "hoboesque"}, {"Content": "an Eden in Tokyo If you enjoy Tokyo and its hustle and bustle style of shopping and amazing culinary adventure, but at same time, still wishes for peaceful and restful night sleeps in spacious room and bed, then this is the hotel for you. Service is IMPECCABLE and the property is, for lack of better awesome word, BEAUTIFUL. Certainly very popular with the locals who want to getaway from the city. Plenty of greeneries (there are waterfalls and a SHINTO temple amidst the huge chinzan-so garden behind hotel!!! ). Staffs are excellent, though command of English was limited with the housekeeping staffs. We left behind some items, and the housekeeping department sent back to us in this beautiful huge Four seasons box, filled with extra toiletries. Impressive indeed the effort they put in for their guests. Those on business will appreciate its serene surrounding and availability of many function rooms and conference halls. Also, internet is free of charge in rooms via LAN cable. Room is oversized, a palace viz a viz any other hotel rooms in Ginza or Shinjuku area. Though furniture is a tad old, they did not bother me at all. They are in perfect condition. There is an LCD TV but as in many hotels in Tokyo, lack the English speaking channels.  Bathroom is also very big with separate shower and tub areas. Yes, typical Japanese toilet bowl functions inclusive (though no seat warmer). BUT, the best of all, the views from our garden facing room was simply TO-DIE-FOR!!!. My only concern was that through our windows, we could see neighbouring room and its inside quite clearly, so watch out for any activity meant only for private viewing, keep the curtains shut. Concierge service was excellent. Kep ( I might have spelled name wrongly) was very helpful in giving us directions and recommendations for restaurants. He even lent us a Michelin guide for all the best food in Tokyo. The other concierge staffs were slightly lacking, but they always made up with their most courteous of smiles. Perhaps my only concern for those choosing this hotel is.. the distance from the city. hotel is only ten minute cab ride to Mejiro station on Yamanote line, i.e. yen800 ride. So for those who wish to stay up really late in town, cab fare might be rather expensive. If you wish to indulge in late night Shinjuku shopping and partying all night long, this is not the hotel for you. Otherwise, an Eden amidst the hectic neon lighted metropolis. A perfect garden. A perfect stay for us.", "Date": "Nov 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR912611168", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "HnD1507"}, {"Content": "Excellent choice - but know what you are choosing I chose the Four Seasons at Chinzan So for a 2 day business retreat for a Board. I wanted somewhere peaceful, with efficient service and air to breathe (i.e. meeting rooms with a view, spacious bedrooms, relaxing things to do after the meeting). I also wanted it to be close enough to Tokyo to allow the group - who were for the first time in Tokyo - time to see the city.For this specification, the hotel is perfect. The hotel gardens are stunning (better than website conveys), rooms large, food great, service immaculate etc. However, I spent the days before the meeting at the Ritz Carlton Tokyo so I had a sense of contrast. The Ritz is slick and metropolitan. Chinzan So is much more traditional in decor and service - more old school. Rooms are large, beautiful but were modern 15 years ago. The spa is great(especially the hot springs) but it's not hip. Nothing negative - but it's a different style to the Park Hyatt or the Ritz Carlton.So if this is what you want, go without hesitation. It is slightly out of the centre (20 minutes by cab) but Tokyo is easier to get around that people think. It also represents great value for money in my view. But if you are looking for a full Tokyo metropolitan experience, this may not be for you.Final word - their business meeting organisation and concierge is flawless.", "Date": "Sep 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR498691058", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "JT14"}, {"Content": "Winter in Tokyo I\u9225\u6a9de spend three nights in this hotel, organized a business event as well.

Or for location. Or for over the top insane Japanese style. You stay here because you want somewhere quiet in the insanity that is Tokyo. The service at the Four Seasons is exceptional (would you expect anything else?) and the rooms are huge which is a luxury in a city where many rooms are glorified closets. The public spaces are beautiful and the garden is really exceptional. Here's the thing about this hotel: whenever I met someone from Tokyo and they asked me where I was staying and they found out it was at Chinzan-So their reaction was always wow, that's a great hotel, you must be rich! The drawback to this hotel is its location. It is far away from the areas of town where Americans are likely to sightsee and dine but it is on the subway line and reasonably easy to get to. (The bad news about the subway is that it's at least five to seven blocks away from the hotel entrance and you have to schlep up a nagging hill to get there; no fun especially when its humid out!) I would recoomend this hotel wholeheartedly to anyone who appreciates old-school understated luxury BUT I'd suggest you spend at least part of your time in Tokyo in a more central location.", "Date": "Jun 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR716145754", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "dougiefreshpdx"}, {"Content": "Heavenly gardens       View of the hotel from the gardens", "Date": "Mar 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR294897090", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "muffinita"}, {"Content": "Beautiful Grounds - Great Property As I have previously written, I do appreciate the Four Seasons and Ritz as hotel chains. The Four Seasons Tokyo at Chinzan-so does not disappoint, and has a beautiful Japanese garden just outside. As with all Four Seasons, this property is extremely well kept, and the service level is high. Combine traditional Japanese service with Four Seasons and one should expect, and does receive, a high level of service that is not intrusive. For the business traveler, the internet in the room is free -- probably the only thing in Tokyo that is cheap. The cord is in the desk drawer to the left of the desk, and the connection is on the side of the desk to the left. Location is a bit unusual, but it works. The restaurants inside the hotel are very good...and very expensive. If you walk outside of the hotel, go either right down the hill or left up the hill, you will find local restaurants and shops all within about a 10-15 minute walk. As with any Four Seasons, you should not expect it to be inexpensive. However, being in Tokyo, expensive is REALLY expensive. The orange juice at breakfast was 1900 yen or about $18 -- just for the juice! Good thing refills were free. The gardens that this hotel is built on is really beautiful and you should take the time to walk around the garden (a must in my opinion). It is really worth the time and just outside of the ground floor.", "Date": "Mar 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR227968027", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "ordflyer"}, {"Content": "Another great Four Seasons hotel Another great Four Seasons hotel.

The Four Seasons at Chinzan-so is a hotel built into a stunning complex that features a beautiful Japanese garden. We were there last December, and the experience of staying there was one that I will not forget.The room was spacious (size-wise, on par with any 5-star Western hotel) and clean. The bathroom was opulent with a huge tub, separate shower, and an assortment of L'Occitane products. Our room overlooked the garden, which was just great, as well as the surrounding areas of Tokyo. The TV had like three or four English channels including BBC, of course.The service is impeccable here. And the real lure of this place is the garden. The garden is huge, and you can explore its many paths that wind along brooks and waterfalls. There is a traditional temple/pagoda-like building on grounds, which is sort of the hotel's landmark (maybe?). Try to book the garden view room, if you can.In terms of its location and transport, it is rather remote and you're in the middle of a residential district. Having said that, this is also the draw of this hotel. If you're in Tokyo for several days and you want some serenity for a couple of nights, this is a perfect place. The nearest subway stop is 10minute walk (although you'll probably get lost, making the trip even longer). Ikebukuro, a mega shopping/entertainment center of Tokyo, is only about 10minutes away by taxi. I believe the hotel also runs a feww shuttle to Ikebukuro every so often, although we never took it. A 5-minute walk down the hill from the hotel will land you on a major boulevard which has a couple of 24hr convenience stores that sell very high-quality take-away food. To get to Narita Airport, you can either take taxi or hotel shuttle to Ikebukuro and then take a train from there (either Narita Express, or Yamanote Line to Nippori and then change to Keisei Skyliner) or you can take Limousine Bus (really just an ordinary bus) which picks you up right at the hotel lobby and takes you straight to the airport. The latter only comes to the hotel a couple of times a day, I think, so you may find that their times don't work for you.Another problem with this place is that everything is rather expensive here, even by Tokyo hotel standards. The restaurants are very pricy and there are none nearby outside the hotel, except for the aforementioned convenience stores which are perfectly good options for me. If you can find a package that includes breakfast for about an additional 2000-2500yen per person, then I would definitely taken that. You can easily head out to Ikebukuro or some other area for lunch and dinner, but it's a hassle to eat anywhere other than at/near the hotel. Oh, another thing I have to say is that they seem to have an amazing-looking swimming pool and an onsen (Japanese hot springs) complex. I highly recommend you try the onsen. This hotel is probably one of the very few in Tokyo that has an onsen. The catch is that you'll have to pay to have access to the pool and the onsen. We went down to use it on our last night with one hour left till closing (not knowing that it wasn't free to hotel guests), and we didn't go in because we didn't want to pay all this money to enter the facility for only an hour.Yes, this is an expensive hotel. But I really think it's worth it. Just a gem, and you'll all realize what I'm talking about when you stay here.", "Date": "Oct 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR552751897", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "brookl"}, {"Content": "Loved the Four Seasons Chinzan-so My husband and I stayed at the Four Seasons Chinzan-so during Christmas in 2002.

It is located in a historical Japanese garden, which is perfect for taking pictures. The interior of the hotel was very elegant with all kinds of Japanese and Western antinque. Our room was huge for Japanese standards, spotless clean and very lovely. From the room we had a great view of the garden. The bathtub was huge, enough room for 2. We ate dinner at the Japanese restaurant which was very good but pricy. We had an early flight on the departure day and service at check-out was extremely swift.

The Park Hyatt was a slick, fine-tuned machine with ammenities and decor which were on the cutting-edge and more in tune with 2007 than the dated Four Seasons. The Chinzan-so we found shabby and dated and in need of an expensive renovation if it intends to compete with the new Penninsula and Ritz Carleton.

This is a wonderful hotel that is far superior to an average Four Seasons in the US.

The cliente consisted of business people and wealthy, well-dressed locals. The rooms are huge and bigger than a lot of hotel rooms in the US andother countries. The bathroom is luxuriously equipped with a TV over the tub. The onsen is small but nice. I cannot rave enough about the pool area which seems like an oasis. I'd suggest guests to explore the Chinzanso garden surrounding the hotel to escape from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. Further, the Edogawabashi area is worth exploring on foot, as it has plenty of stone-paved alleys and traditional style Japanese buildings. The only issue about this hotel is the location. It's neither right next to the JR train station (it's a 2-minute taxi ride from the Mejiro JR station) nor close to major business districts.
