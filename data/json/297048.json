Don't be fooled by the neighborhood - the buildings in the area are covered with graffiti, but remember graffiti is an art form that goes back to the days of the Roman Empire. The first look at the hotel from its beautifully manicured front courtyard and parking lot is one of marvel - the foliage and trees in front are very tasteful and well kept, and the hotel has a perquisite that is not often seen in Rome - Free Parking! The staff is friendly and helpful, the lobby area is sparkling with comfortable seating and marble everywhere. The breakfast room has marble floors, travertine wainscoting on the walls, and two beautiful crystal chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. The servers at breakfast are attentive, and the espresso and capoccino are excellent. The breakfast spread is typical of a Roman hotel - croissants, both plain and filled, cold cereals, cold meat and cheese slices, cereals, fruit juices, rolls, and so on. It is all fresh and very good. The guest room we stayed in was clean and comfortable, with a king sized bed, desk, and armoir, two end tables, two armchairs, a telephone, and several electrical outlets for things like camera and cell phone chargers and razors. The bathroom had a lighted medicine cabinet, bidet, toilet, sink, and a shower. The shower stall was somewhat small, but as good as can be found for the cost of the room. They had a deal were if you stay five nights, the sixth night is free.

The hotel is respectable and a fair share of its clientele appears to be Europeans coming by car. The hotel is east off the railroad tracks leading into Termini station, just outside Rome's ancient walls -- not really close to any of Rome's treasures, but within reasonable walking distance (even on a blisteringly hot day!) of Porta Maggiore, the university quarter, and the priceless church of San Lorenzo. If you're relying on public transit, you'll need to connect by tram or bus to one of the principal lines or to the Metro.

The flat screen TV is nice and has a lot of channels, however almost all are in Italian. My room faces the courtyard so it's very quiet, apart from other hotel-goers coming and going. I would recommend this place overall if you don't mind staying in a less than perfect hotel. I felt safe and comfortable. If you want a romantic getaway, this is not the place.

As I walked from the Termini Station following my mapquest directions, the neighborhood seemed to be getting more and more seedy (dodgy). And, yes, when I was only one block away, I was planning on turning around, losing the money, and moving on to a different hotel. I'm glad that I did not. Though the Hotel S. Lorenzo Maria is in a bit of a rougher area than I might be accustomed to, I've actually grown quite fond of my roost for the past few days. The hotel is immaculately clean, very nicely decorated, the staff was excellent, the cleaning staff was even more friendly. The pictures on the official website aren't fake. It's really quite that nice. True, you have to take a tram or bus to get here (it's not really walkable from the Termini--and certainly not recommended as the neighborhood between here and there isn't great), I really think that this is a great deal. For a very reasonable price, I've been able to stay a ten minute tram ride from the Coliseum and the amenities are quite nice... wireless internet, cable tv, plenty of hot water, good air conditioning, breakfast, and a charming property with lots of character. If you're not comfortable with cities and a bit of grit is going to cause you alarm, this isn't the place for you. But if you're the sort of person who is comfortable with the realities of an urban setting (and can deal with taking the tram/bus), you could really like it here and save a lot of money. I really liked it here and would certainly come back. Would I come back with mom? Hmm.
