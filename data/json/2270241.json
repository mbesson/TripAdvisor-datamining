Excellent bars, restaurants and shops in the area and very good value when you ask the hotel for assistance with your plans. Breakfast just right to start the day before setting off to explore. If you want a chinzy hotel with lots of public spaces, a dining room etc to socilaise with other guests, then Hotel de Monti is not for you - better pay double the rate and get another hotel to suit your needs.

I was initially concerned as our taxi couldn't find the hotel and it is difficult to find initially, but once found ( the man on reception came out onto the street after taxi driver called him), I was impressed, staff were very friendly, gave us invaluable advice on where to go to avoid queues, recommended excellent (and reasonable) restaurants to eat etc, and generally made our short stay very enjoyable. It is a 5-10 min walk from Palatine Hill, Forum, Colleseum etc, 10-15 toTrevi Fountain, about 20-25 mins to Panthenon, and probably about 40-50 min (leisurely stroll) to Vatican, so if reasonably fit no need for taxi/public transport. The room was simply furnished, and breakfast was brought to your room in a morning on a tray (toast croissants/yoghurt, coffee etc), there are no communal areas such as breakfast room or bar etc, so if these are the things you want from a hotel, then this is not for you, but if you want a clean, welcoming and friendly place (with comfortable beds) to rest your head after walking around the city, then I can't recommend Hotel de Monti enough.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cFirst night in Italy\u201d", "Author": "jjwc", "ReviewID": "UR127037621", "Content": "We stayed here based on trip advisor reviews and were absolutely delighted.

We chose what we wanted for breakfast each night, slipped it in the box, and it was brought to our room each morning exactly on time.

They are prompt in responding to emails, very professional and helped us plan our exploring with tons of local tips/tricks!

We spent most of time with Alessandro who speak 5+ languages perfectly and has really solid knowledge lots of europe country cultures. Really great guy!
