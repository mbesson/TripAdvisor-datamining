I was travelling alone and had to stay in toronto for some 2.5 months due to office work. My stay there was hassle free. My room was cleaned once a week on a particular day. What I specially liked was the kitchen lounge. As I preferred cooking myself, I found the kitchen unit very helpful. Just one glitch that I felt was currency conversion as my money was in US dollars and the admin wanted it only in Canadian Draft or cheque. I would still say, its a nice place to be.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "chiang mai", "Title": "\u201cDon't think i'll go back\u201d", "Author": "LivingThai", "ReviewID": "UR114820422", "Content": "I stayed here June 10 with some family because we wanted to see the falls, I don't think it was really worth the money and the cleaning service wasn't exactly up to par, i too found socks in the drawer and dust on nearly everything.

There are several unknown stains in the hallway and in the room; when at first got here and unpacked the cooler the kitchen floor was grossly sticky and had food all over it. While looking for a missing bag, my mother found socks underneath the bed, and clean or not that's disgusting. The mini window air conditioner decided to NOT work, instead just blew out warm air. In the middle of June, after walking around all day we would have liked to return to a nice, cool room, instead it was just as hot as it was outside.

Trust me... the Marriott, which is literally down the street, is cleaner, cheaper, has free breakfasts and dinners 3 days a week, has much more comfortable beds and amenities, has just as big a kitchen, modern appliances, and has maid service EVERY day instead of only once a week. There is simply no comparison... I'm only here because the Marriott was sold out, and I'd switch hotels but the Glen Grove cunningly doesn't offer refunds once you book. FYI I am not a princess... I've traveled to 30 countries including all over Africa and Afghaninstan, often as a backpacker.

We spent 5 nights in The Rosemont and found it to be in a perfect location for sightseeing and convenient for restaurants, shopping etc. We did not have a car and found we did not need one. The apartment was very comfortable, well equipped and clean. There was also a lovely roof terrace with seating, jacuzzi and gas barbecues which was an ideal place to chill out after a day sightseeing. The small charge for the internet was money well spent when travelling with 2 computer addicts! It wasn't very fast but satisfied their needs. Check out time was 11am and we had a few hours before we were being picked up to go to the airport. The concierge very kindly offered to look after our luggage which allowed us to go out for a while.

This review is about 50 John street and this is our 3rd visit mainly due to the Location a 2 minute walk from the CN tower and 5 minute walk via PATH to the subway. We stay here because for the same price of one hotel room we get a 2 bed 2 bathroom apartment complete with ful kitchen lounge and washer /dryer, great when travelling with teenagers. This is NOT a Hotel it is a residential buildling where loads of young 20/30 somethings live complete with matching designer dogs .At no time was this a problem we enjoyed looking at the cute little dogs each evening. The apartment is in the entertainment business so there is a bit of noise at the weekends and early morning when the bottle bins are empitied but not a problem. Down the road there a plenty of good restaurants our favourite being Milestones and Hey Lucy. This year we went on The Shark speed boat at the Harbor and had such a good laugh even if we did get wet. Please remember that as this is not a Hotel there is no reception ,no daily maid service just an apartment of your own.There is a telephone with free local calls so with an $5 international phone card we could keep in touch with our daughter who had stayed at home.There is also internet available in the apartment.

The property is very conveniently located in Downtown Toronto, just one block from the CN Tower and the Rogers Centre, with easy underground access to St Andrew subway station and a short walk to all other downtown attractions, including the Harbour Front. The suite was very clean, well furnished and well maintained. The ensuite washer and dryer, and full kitchen were also a plus. There is underground parking right on the property, which is very convenient. It was real \u00e2\u20ac\u0153value-for-money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in an excellent location. The staff (I must make special mention here of the Concierge and also the room service maid, who doubled in to help reset the broadband modem in my suite) were very friendly and helpful. The broadband Internet in the suite (at an additional cost of $25+tax) was a bonus. In addition, there is also a business centre (conveniently located on the second floor) with two computers where you can access the Internet, print off documents, fax and photocopy for free. Checking in is just a matter of picking up your room key at the front desk and checking out is returning your key to the front desk and signing yourself out in a register (quick and painless). There is a 24-hour security guard on duty at the front desk. The master bedroom has a queen bed with two beside cabinets and a chest-of-drawers (with mirror). The second bedroom has a double bed with a bedside cabinet. There is a walk-in-robe to the master bedroom and lots of closets throughout the suite. The bathrooms are bright and modern, one with a tub and the other with shower. The only problem with our suite was that it was facing the back of the building and every alternate day, we heard a garbage truck flipping dumpsters at 7 a.m. But who cared about this, we were on a holiday and those guys did their jobs and were gone in 30 minutes. All in all, a great stay.

On this occassion we stayed here at the Yonge location because it was close to a family member and seemed great for a family stay with 2 kids based on the website photos. What a mistake I made. The place looked like a quaint boutique hotel online and at checkin but only after we unloaded everything and settled into our room late at night did we understand that beauty is only skin deep. It became very apparent that the majority of people staying were either uniformed travellers like us or people who needed the accomodation for their hour escapade with their companion. Lots of noise was coming from several rooms very late at night where others who did not come for a good nights sleep where just starting to have fun. To make matters worse the room was bone shivering cold. I have stayed in Toronto and know that it is not supposed to be this cold. When I called the front desk they said that I must have a window open...how funny. Then they said that the building is on a central unit and no one else was complaining. I asked to be switched to another room and I was refused. We asked the receptionist to have someone come to the room to confirm the heat does not work but they refused. We slept with 2 socks, 2 shirts, pants, and 2 blankets. We were told the next day that we should bring our concern to management that would return on Monday. After speaking to the manager today he offered a meager 10% discount and also pointed out that no one else complained and that it was not the Marriott because we only had to pay $150 for the stay. I am sure the reason no one else complained is because the majority who did stay were their for a party not for sleep. I would confirm that he is correct on one thing that you get what you pay for when you stay here. We did not stay for the price or party we stayed for location. My suggestion is to keep driving. I returned home with my family with all of us having a cold. The $150 will be much more after our visits to the doctors office. I have a degree in hotel restaurant management and have managed restaurants and hotels for a great number of years and know that this is not what is supposed to happen even in budget hotels. I am not a complainer and definitely never participate in these type of forums but I felt angry enough after this visit at the lack of hospitality, basic accomodation, and poor response from management to give other travelers fair warning.", "Date": "October 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cClean basic accomodation in convenient location\u201d", "Author": "AnroGlasgow", "ReviewID": "UR17343420", "Content": "Booked a 4 night stay at Glen Grove.
