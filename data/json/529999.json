{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Parking in central Florence Beautiful old house in a lovely position. Our room was large with high ceilings and large sash windows. The decor in our room needed updating - there were stains on the ceiling and a few wooden floor tiles missing. It reminded me a little of a school convent (apart from the TV and minibar). The bathroom was huge but again the shower and the shower curtain needed attention. It has private secure parking in the courtyard at the rear of the house which is a real plus. The roof terrace and the breakfast room were gorgeous. The breakfast was continental, croissants, rolls etc which didn't seem to fit with the opulent frescoed ceiling. The hotel was good value. I imagine that if the decor was updated then the hotel could be very luxurious and elegantly expensive.", "Date": "May 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR932442200", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "BeccaUk"}, {"Content": "Good base for exploring We stayed here for three nights. We had booked a twin room, but on arrival were shown to a double room. We said that we had booked a twin, and produced our booking reference. The owner made a big deal of checking his room sheet, said that he had no free twins tonight, and would move us in the morning. The following morning, we re-packed our bags in anticipation of our move, only to be told that they were just going to put the twins in our room. When we came back to the hotel that evening, the double bed was still there, and nicely made. We asked why the change had not been done, and were told that the staff had forgotten. We just figured that there was never going to be a twin, so we just settled for the double. We went to Florence for a city break, and to visit a friend. As a hotel to use as a base it is very good. It provides is a bed to sleep in and a place to have a shower. The room was faultless, (bar not being a twin) the bed was comfortable, the bathroom a bit small, but clean and had great water pressure. There was a safe in the wardrobe, and a mini bar/room service of sorts. The breakfast room had a view of the river, and an amazing fresco painted on the ceiling. it is about a 15- 20 min walk along the river to the ponte vecchio. There was no dinner facilities, or a place to have a relaxing drink , but you are in Florence, and there a re millions of places to drink and eat.It is close enough to the train station. It is very quiet, as it is located just beside the American Consulate, which has barriers up, so it is in effect a cul de sac beside the river!! Felt safe walking back to it at night. I would stay here again.", "Date": "Oct 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR356897299", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "AlliH101"}, {"Content": "Fabulous view After staying at the Consigli in 2006 with my husband whilst we were touring Europe on A Motorbike - I chose this hotel for a holiday with some girl friends - It was disappointing this time round.. whilst our room was very large and comfortable (we were lucky enough to have the room leading straight out onto the terrace). The bathroom however was very poor and shabby - with large damp patches on the ceiling - the tiles also needed replacing and the bath although large was not in very good condition - the shower was over the bath with and was very very low - not a shower you could stand under unless you are about 5 years old.. On a good point - the bed linen and towels were very clean and in good condition. There was a small fridge in the room - ideal for storing water and wine..The Consigli is in an excellent position overlooking the Arno and the terrace is great for relaxing on after a day out - also great on an evening for late drinks with friends. My two friends room was not as nice as mine - a lot smaller - there bathroom didn't even have a shower curtain... I would stay again mostly because of the location and reasonable price.", "Date": "Sep 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR855548534", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Purplemeggie"}, {"Content": "Worst hotel room I've ever seen I've just returned from a visit to Florence where I was booked into the Consigli for four nights from 14th August to 18th August. I was allocated Room 15 and the receptionist directed me to a out-building at the back of the hotel, where I went up some narrow concrete steps to the first floor where there were three rooms.My first impression was that 15 was very small and dark and depressing. There was only a small window with two heavy shutters which kept out the light. That, added to the fact that the room backed directly on to a white discoloured wall, inculcated a sense of absolute gloom, as did the basic furniture - brown wardrobe, brown desk (without chair), bed, brown floor boards. There were no lamps, only a light on a sconce on the wall which gave out a dim glow. Hardly a Room with a View.In fact it was more Aroma with(out) a View as I became aware of an unpleasant smell. I opened the bathoom door and was overwhelmed by the most pungent and sickening stench of damp, mould and decay. The ceiling was a little Sistine Chapel of mould and damp stains. The bathroom window didn't open so the room was basically festering in putrid fashion in the blistering heat of Florence in August. It was absolutely unacceptable.I asked for another room and was informed that they were full but 'perhaps' I could be moved to a double tomorrow. I told the receptionist that I suffered from asthma and allergies and was worried what effect close proximity to this damp would have on them. She said her English wasn't very good and reiterated that they were full. I would have to spend one night there.I did spend one night there. The window had to be left open or the whole place would have been overpowered with the stench. Unfortunately that meant I was subjected to the noise of the generator directly below the window - but I preferred the racket to the reek.I'm at a loss to explain why this hotel has a three-star rating. I've stayed in hotels all over Europe and several in Italy and have never experienced anything quite as hideous as this. I left after one night. I have pics of the mouldy old ceiling should anyone want to see the.", "Date": "Aug 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR795371033", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "portobello_7"}, {"Content": "Excellent and great location       on the terrace", "Date": "Mar 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR612270656", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Ed68"}, {"Content": "Ignore first impressions and you will be fine This Hotel is in a nice location on the Arno, about 15 mins to the main attractions and the walk there is quite nice. The staff are friendly also and the price was reasonable.Please don't expect luxury however. When you open the door to the room for the first time, it is like stepping back in time. Brown, Grey and off-white are the colours that will greet you. It is the dullest looking room I have seen in any hotel. There is a fridge with a pricelist but nothing inside it and a door that takes about 5 mins to open. However, there is so much to do in Florence that you are not going to spend much time in your room so the fact that it is clean, safe, not bad for noise etc makes it a reasonable option.

Hotel Consigli is a 3* located overlooking the River Arno. Its best feature is the rooftop terrace overlooking the river. Rooms are basic and the hotel is very old, but that is part of the appeal. Florence centre is within walking distance along the Arno (10-15 mins), and it is nice to be a little out of the bustling centre as the crowds can get overwhelming. There is also a big park close by if you walk 5 mins further down the river.Breakfast was very limited - don't expect to fill up here. But you are on the continent so it is not very different to anywhere else. The breakfast room is beautiful, and looks out onto the Arno. Rooms were cleaned daily and the staff were very friendly . Rooms have aircon but we didn't need it as the shutters appeared to keep out most of the heat, even in August. We stayed in a room overlooking the back street. It was very quiet, and not actually in the main building, which was good. Staff looked after our bags until we were ready for our flight. One thing to remember is that the hotel appears to be completely locked up at 1am so bring your key if you plan to be out later than this.Overall, I would recommend this hotel if you are on a budget, looking for a quiet place with great views and close enough to walk to everything.", "Date": "Aug 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR120558936", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "km100"}, {"Content": "Ottima soluzione Tra prezzo e...   showReview(22232704, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR301400811", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Lo m\u8c29s impresionante es la...   showReview(20744040, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR625183498", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9288\ue76c\u5137\u9289\u5ea1\u7a9b\u9287\ue1be\u6679   showReview(19172493, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR247628178", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Terrase tres salles pas de...   showReview(11364439, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR598148716", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Por fortuna fue el \u7164nico hotel...   showReview(11364440, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR618165408", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Hotel bien \u813f 15 mn \u813f pied du...   showReview(11364442, 'full');", "Date": "May 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR386717910", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Albergo posizionato in...   showReview(11364443, 'full');", "Date": "May 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR284496107", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Vue excellente sur l'Arno...   showReview(11364436, 'full');", "Date": "May 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR202615534", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Tr\u732bs jolie situation au bord de...   showReview(11364437, 'full');", "Date": "May 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR249497339", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Ottimo Hotel in una bellissima...   showReview(12648615, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR800685235", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Das Personal war sehr...   showReview(11364438, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR454329580", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d529999-r16465098-Hotel_Consigli-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "529999", "Price": "$167"}}
