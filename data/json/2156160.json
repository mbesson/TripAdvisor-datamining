Big rooms, overblown decor, the place simply beams with quality. Its' location is perfect for Sultanahmet. Situated on a nice quiet sidestreet from the convenient tram-road and Sultanahmet tramway stop. The sidestreet I mention is one of the quietest and nicest in the whole old district. We requested a room specifically facing that street, not the garden. And I think we made the right choice. While I don't think the smoke/smell coming from the chimneys in the garden side, that so many reviews mention, is that of a big deal, I also don't think that the balcony, artificial lawn and unspectacular views fully justify the higher price of these rooms. I suspect that the garden-facing rooms at the upper attic floors, positioned on the left side might have problems with noise coming from the massive airconditioning systems/generators which are just above. We were staying in our 'amber' 1st/2nd floor rooms, one floor up from the lobby/restaurant. And had a views to some very important building, patrolled by easygoing guards, who even suggested joining them for a cup of Turkish tea one evening when I went out for a smoke. You definitely get a lot of envy points from the passers-by, who stare jealously and nod their heads making common remarks like \"bella pensione!\" Back to our room... The only problem we had with it is the constant mysterious noise of moving furniture. It couldn't have come from the rooms above because of the carpeted floors, so at first we suspected it comes from the hotel's own cafe/restaurant below. But soon we learned that couldn't be the case either, as cafe and restaurant are being closed at ~23:00 and the noise continues up to 1AM on some nights. The staff were trying to look into it, though to no avail. Soon we realised the noise comes from another building glued to the hotel. It has a nice Khorasani restaurant on lower floors and some rooms of unidentifiable purpose above. The sound must've come from there... It wasn't superbad, but I'm noise-sensitive and could definitely have lived without it. So my suggestion is - ask for a room that is NOT on the far left (facing the hotel). Moving back to the rockstar subject... The breakfast is not exactly a star material. The scrambled eggs are bland, the coffee is instant(!) and the artificial orange juice is made from an orange juice powder mixture. What a disappointment. All this in Istanbul, famous for its' Turk Kahvesi (Turkish coffee) and fresh juice makers on every corner. If you invest in your rooms and brilliant staff, why not invest just a tiny bit more in your food? We went to the lovely closely located Cigdem Pastanesi for simits, coffee and borek. Speaking about food, the restaurant food is OK, but just OK. Guys, listen, the kofte was tasty, but it was written 'mini-meatballs' - in plural - and you brought just one meatball (for 10 liras!) 4-5 euro for a single meatball, seriously? Now the staff. The managers and bellhops were brilliant, professional and helpful. Though trying to sell someone a map for the price of a meatball is not the way to greet your guests. Drop this move, fellas. It doesn't look good. I mean, I get it - you thrive on wealthy numb-from-their-wealth German tourists, but that's not an excuse to push a 10-lira map that most hotels give for free. In everything else you were awesome. And there was no confusing lost-in-translation issues that I've read about in the previous reviews. This is one of the most professionally run hotels I've ever come across. Time to review the housekeepers. First of all, they could realise that 'do not disturb' on one door doesn't just mean 'do not enter this room', but it also means don't make tons of noise while cleaning a room next door. I recommend everyone leaving a tip each morning, because when we didn't our soap and tea wasn't restocked and the teacups were gone! One day the soap-bar we were currently using was gone too. Naturally, we nicknamed our mysterious houskeeper The Soap Nazi, obviously after Seinfeld's 'Soup Nazi'. No soap for you! :-) In conclusion, awesome hotel, number 1 option for Sultanahmet, affordable (if you know where to look --> Splendia.com), great staff, excellent location... and it will make you feel like a sultan. If you'll get your soap, and the orange juice on the next corner. Just kidding.
