The bathrooms were modernised and the room was much the same clean and large and quiet. Great location for all the shows and oxford street 10 mins away albeit the central point end, five mins away from hamleys etc... The breakfast was good and great choices . The only fault both travelodges had was when you were standing at the bar waiting for assistance you waited a while as bar staff doubled up as reception staff and if someone came in to register you had to wait .

When this hotel was new and fresh it was ideal for reasonably priced stays in a perfect, safe, central London location. It probably still is, but this time the continual whiff of what seemed to be old cooking oil in the foyer/lift area, the stained carpets, manky kettle and mismatched curtains (one curtain about 6\" shorter than the other on the same window) left one with the opinion that even 2* standards are slipping at the TL High Holborn.

The manager of high holborn does not inform staff to tell you that the nightclub goes on until 7am , this is i assume kept from you as they dont want to lose your custom i would make sure you dont get a room facing museum street or west central street. hopefully travelodge will take the night club to court to get it closed. but until then be careful of what room you get. p. s. went to travelodge tower bridge the next night , slept good all night. my advice to travelodge is to install 1st class triple glazing to hide any future noise travelodge is normally ok , but loss of sleep for 2 nights is not on. thanks ......", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cMattresses were absolutely shocking!\u201d", "Author": "Muzza73", "ReviewID": "UR119965981", "Content": "This hotel remains valur for money given the location but the mattresses were absolutely terrible.
