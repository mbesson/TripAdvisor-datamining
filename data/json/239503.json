However, on check-in, the owner informed us that some building work was taking place and offered us to move to Residenza Zanardelli. He also offered complimentary breakfast for myself and my partner, which we had added to our booking at Hotel Navona at an additional charge. The owner drove us to the Zanardelli. The hotel is charming - we could not fault it at all. The location is absolutely perfect and the hotel is spotlessly clean and offers the 'boutique' charm you would expect. Breakfast was simple yet fine and the young girl who was on reception was very helpful and sweet. We managed to pick up a map at the Hotel Navona, which was free to take away (and we couldn't have been without it). Everything was within walking distance. The only public transport we took was to airport and back. We opted for taxis - these work out at about 40 euros. If you are staying at the Zanardelli and are a light sleeper, I would recommend taking ear-plugs. The room we were in overlooks a narrow side street which is used as a route for a lot of walking tours - and there is quite a lot of noise created by this early morning/late evening. However, we found that keeping the windows closed sorted it. I can't comment on the aircon as we had no need for it - we opted for the windows to be open. Also, our TV didn't work. We probably could have asked and they would have sorted it but we were not bothered.

The Residenza is very small (only 7 rooms) and on the first floor of an 18th (I think) century building. Although it is supposed to be staffed there is frequently no-one around - although they do give you keys to the outside door to the street and the inner door to the Residenza area so this was not an issue. Rooms and bathroom good sized and very clean although little clothes hanging/storage space if you are there for more than a few days. One large table in the breakfast room and a fairly standard buffet breakfast for this type of hotel in Italy (although I was told on the booking form that breakfast was not included, it was). Internally very quiet (rarely saw or heard any of my fellow guests although I think there were some). Earplugs possibly advisable if you have a room that looks onto the narrow side road - sound does echo round here at night when anyone uses the road. Beautifully situated for the main sites of the Centro Storico and the Vatican. Many restaurants within easy walk in the evening away from the tourist trap of the Piazza Navona. I was not overly impressed with the knowledge of the young man who ususlly seemed to be on duty when you could find him, but this mattered little to me.

It was initially a little hard to find but only because the sign on the front was covered by some scaffolding. We took the bus here from Roma Termini station and the building is next door to a Persian rug store (on the opposite side of the road from the Hotel Genio). The place isn't very large - all the rooms lead off the reception/lobby area. Our room was extremely comfortable - nice bed, lovely furnishings, flat screen TV and very well heated even though we didn't require it as the weather was pleasant. The shower didn't work very well but was adequate and I'm not sure if this was due to low water pressure. The room had large windows which opened out onto an alley below and wooden shutters which shut out the street noise. As this hotel is in a very central location and only two doors down from a cocktail bar, it is inevitable that there'll be the usual sounds of the city - but after long days of sightseeing, sleeping soundly shouldn't be a problem! Noise from within the hotel was something else though - you can hear other guests talking if they're in the lobby and the reception phone ringing. This problem could be solved by perhaps shutting the connecting door between lobby and reception and if a polite notice was put up for other guests to keep their voices down. Breakfast was served in a communal dining room and consisted of continental staples - coffee, milk, juice, cereal, croissants, cheese and ham. The sweet croissants were delicious but considering it's Italy, the cheese and cold meat could be much better if they were bought from a market or deli as they seemed to be processed. You can also request for a cappuccino or latte which will be made for you. The Residenza Zanardelli is in an absolutely ideal location to explore most of Rome's tourist attractions. It's less than a 5-minute walk to Piazza Navona, 10 minutes to the Pantheon and about 15-20 minutes walk to the Vatican. Other sights such as the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Piazza Venezia and Colosseum are easily reachable by foot. There are some great restaurants and bars down the little streets leading off Piazza Navona - do not fall for the tourist trap cafes dotted around the Piazza as they are very expensive. For a true local experience, the Pizzeria Montecarlo and Pizzeria Baffetto are highly recommended. Rome is a wonderful city to explore and the Residenza Zanardelli provided us with a very comfortable stay. The little drawbacks mentioned before can be easily remedied and did not spoil our stay in any way.
