The hotel is basic but I have stayed in much worse places. The rooms are warm and there is little or no air conditioning. On the plus side, in the rooms I stayed in - The views from the balcony were terriffic. This hotel is smack bang in the city Centre and for the price you won't get anywhere better. The rooms I stayed in had the shower and bathroom within the room, or en suite as they call it - (as opposed to a communal facility on each floor). Very clean and well looked after every day. The breakfast is in a first floor dining room, accessable by a winding staircase. The fare on offer was pretty decent - I don't remember having a fry but there was cerial and plenty of bread and fruit/vegetables and eggs on offer. All together - the dining area is clean, bright and the service is really very good. The bar in this hotel is tiny. It is about 12-14 feet long and is poorly stocked by UK or Irish standards. But then again - You are in the centre of one of the most exciting and vibrant cities in the world - What are you doing in the Hotel bar? Overall I give this 3 stars because it is an old and basic place. For myself, when I am away I only really want to see the hotel for sleeping and washing.

However, as other reviews noted, the hotel is very centrally located and close to the Sol metro station which made is really easy to get around. It was easy to get to and from the airport via metro as well. The hotel does not have air conditioning, which is not uncommon in Europe. We slept with the windows open and fan going which was fine temperature-wise, however, the street noise, sirens and helicopter noises went on pretty late into the early morning. I am not sure whether the amount of noise is normal or due to the street demonstrations going on that weekend. We had a room facing the main road with a small balcony. I found the hotel room rather large for a European hotel and it was clean. If you are going to Madrid to party and sight-see, I found it to be a great price and location. However, if you are going to get some rest, I would stay somewhere else. The elevator is small (only holds 4 people at a time) but we were lucky enough to only have to walk up the stairs to the 4th floor twice (and without luggage) instead of waiting. Also, the wake-up call worked the first morning but the second two mornings (including the day we had to get to the airport) we did not receive our wake-up call.

I did get a glimpse of the rooms facing the street and the balcony rooms looked much better so if you can get one of those they are very nice. The other thing was that the the tv remote did not work and frankly the staff attitude was very cool and they did not care at all just saying that most rooms did not have any remote so it was a positive thing that we even had one which did not even work.

Cons: The worst hotel on the planet, the front desk receptionists are unfriendly. We got a room facing the street and it was noisy and with a very small bed. The picture i saw when i booked was a king size bed. When i complained about it, the receptionist mentioned that the full size bed is the standard or they put two single beds together to look like a king size bed. When i tried changing the room i was reminded by the receptionist that this is not an American hotel. Since its my 10th trip to Europe this i know that the beds are usually small,.. But can we start tipping these folks so that they have better customer service and attitude..We finally got a room in middle of the hotel (the hotel is shaped like a V). On the inside of the V, the rooms had nasty smell. It rained the first 2 days we got there and the smell was coming from a gutter inthe middle of the hotel grounds. We had to go to El Corte Ingles and bought candles to take away the smell..Last but not least is the constant noise coming from the hotel. The Hotel needs a complete makeover, rooms, beds and TV.. They have the nerve to still use what looked like a 13 inch TV in most of the rooms...a 19 inch would have been fine..not that we watched TV anyway!!

One issue is with the shower, it's wall mount is facing width ways so unless you get the curtains just right you will end up paddling in the bathroom. The lift is small but big enough for two people with luggage so no issues there. The breakfast is a mix of differing pastries in wrappers, jam, cereals, orange juice and tea or coffee.

If you're after a plush hotel, or even a 'little' luxury, then this hotel isn't for you. If the location is more important, as it was for us, then you cannot go wrong!! It's smack bang in the heart of Madrid, and very close to numerous metro stations. We used the metro that's actually linked to the airport - you cannot miss it. Although we had to change three times, it only took a total of half an hour, and cost two, yes, two euros each!! The underground system in Madrid is second to none, very safe and efficient, and easy to use. It would have cost us \u00a356 if we used the shuttle bus! The staff at the reception desk could perhaps be a little more welcoming, but they were not rude in any way. Yes, the hotel is very very dated, tired in appearance, and could do with a huge makeover. But then i'm sure that would only just bump the prices right up, so what's the point. If you'd prefer a modern hotel, stay somewhere else, and pay more - simple! We were very unfortunate with the location of our room, room 106. I'd certainly say that if you can avoid the 1st floor, then try and do so. Ours was next to the kitchen, and around the corner from the restaurant. So as you can imagine, it was very noisy. Our view out of the window consisted of air vents, and the kitchen staff coming and going. We couldn't leave the window open due to this, the smell of food, and the constant noise of the air vents from the kitchen. So the room was very warm and stuffy. We stayed for three nights, and our room was cleaned every day to a high standard. We were provided with clean towels on each day. There's a tv in the room, and basic furniture. We literally used the room to sleep in, and to get showered and dressed. Yes, a view of the road outside would have been nicer, a quieter room would have been even better, but this holiday (3 nights stay) inc flights & taxes cost us \u00a3135 each, so say no more!! The location of the hotel cannot be faulted, various things about the hotel can be. If you remember that it's a two star hotel, and not Claridges, i really cannot see how you can be that disappointed. I will be returning to Madrid, hopefully within a few months. If i'm being totally honest, i'd probably pay a little bit more and stay in another hotel. This is only due to the noise, and nothing else.

Avoid staying in this hotel like the plague. I was drawn to it because of its position which is indeed very central and convenient. It is just a few meters from the Metro station and just five minutes walk from Sol and all other city attractions. But then again, this is the only positive thing I can write about this hotel. Right from the start, it was obvious that the staff were the 'bored and unhelpful' sort, where if one asks whether they can speak some English, you get an answer in Spanish and a look that could easily pierce one's heart...!! Just going through the moves would seem to be their motto and it seemed to me that they just couldn't wait to be off work asap. The room was bare. Strictly three pieces of cheap furniture: 2 shoddy beds, a dressing/TV table and a bedside table that if given to someone free of charge, he/she would decline to accept such outdated scrap in one's home. TV set seemed older than myself at 50 years. The bathroom was basic as one could expect with no basin and bath plugs meaning that to shave, one had to leave the water running all the time and could not make use of the basic necessities as one is used to. However, the worst was the noise from students..!! They arrived one afternoon and it was obvious that trouble was on its way. They shouted, screamed, yelled, banged on their doors and our door so many times that I had to get out in the corridor and yell louder than them in order to try and get some peace and quiet. Did they stop? No they did not. I went down to the reception desk to inform them that it was simply unacceptable to have forty unruly students shouting and banging in this as we deserved and had the right to decency and peace. They told me that they will speak to their mentor but in affect, they never did. When I could take it no longer, I once again confronted them myself and shouted over their noise in English which was obvious they could not understand and even tried to ridicule the fact that I was trying to quieten them down. The only humane solution at that moment was to get myself and my wife out for the afternoon and evening hoping that things would eventually quieten down. On our return around midnight, chaos was reigning supreme and the level of noise, banging doors, laughter and running around in corridors and over furniture (it seemed so) was beyond comprehension. We had to fly back the following day and we were looking forward for a decent few hours of sleep before our travelling but it was only to be so in our dreams... All night long the chaos continued on. Banging doors and walls. Loud laughter and pranks in the balconies that one had to close the balcony door in order to shut some din out. This in spite of no air-condition in the room but it was the better of two evils. Once again, I had to don some clothes and try to quieten this anarchy down. Their mentor heard me shouting and did come out but the students were too many for this teacher/mentor and they simply ignored him! Who cares about other guests, that they paid for some privacy and peace, that it is our right as guests to have responsible reception people bring this situation under control. The kids did not care, the mentor was hopeless and the hotel staff simply did not care.. This is far from proper service form the staff and they even tried to tell me that it was 'normal' and they could do nothing. Nothing I ask?!?! They were just not bothered to get into the lift and do their job. They were simply way too comfortable sitting on their fat bottoms to get up and warn these unruly kids that this was a hotel were guests pay to stay there and not a playground were they could romp, bang, shout and yell as if there's no tomorrow. We left early that morning (before 0500) mainly because I could not take it any longer. I'm used to disciplined persons, normal and understanding people and helpful staff. I am in the hospitality business and this would have never been tolerated by my staff or myself. Never, ever.. I wish I had paid more attention to other reviews on this hotel as before booking, I had noticed similar complaints from previous guests, especially on the rowdy students issue. However, I thought that it might have been a one off not knowing how wrong I was!! It is now obvious that this is a regular pattern and the hotel is used to house students from other areas and countries mainly because they get a very cheap deal filling in their empty rooms. No wonder the decor is lifeless and the furniture so rundown, lest the surdents will demolish it overnight. With this in mind, of course, this is not a hotel one wants to stay in for his/her holiday. If the operators had to be honest, they would rename it as a student hostel, a place where serious grown ups and paying guests should avoid. Yet, honesty seems to be a very scarce virtue nowadays and it is through these reviews that the majority of travellers and would be users can have a true and honest insight of what this hotel really is. We used it as a base, nothing more, nothing less. Whatever you read about this hotel, know one thing and one thing only - it is a place of old fashioned, outdated, redundant and rundown decor and an obvious lack of care, interest and knowledge of how to accommodate guests in a city such as Madrid. This hotel is an insult to a lovely city which throbs with life all day and night long. A city rich in history and culture that draws inspiration from men of chivalry so many centuries back. Madrid is a city of good food, excellent wine and plenty of Sangria. A city of colour and nice plazas, plentiful to be honest. The Plaza Major is a place to take in whether during the day or night - just take it all in but eat in the restaurants close to it as they are much, much cheaper. All in all, Madrid is a dream - a lovely dream. The obvious conclusion from my experience is that Madrid is a city where everyone should spend some time during his life.

We really struggled to get the key out and wasted the first 2 euros. We called reception and he brought his own euro and did it. It was really stiff to get the key out. The lightbulbs were both blown over the bed and I left a note in very poor Spanish and they were replaced the next day. The lift held four people and at busy times like breakfast we used the stairs. Breakfast was what we expected.The waiters were very efficient with tea, coffee and juice. There was cereal, cakes, rolls, cold meat, cheese, croissants and jam. They were very busy at times with large school parties but still very efficient. We always had hot water, sometimes slow running and no sink plug. Clean sheets and towels. Friendly maids. There is a little bar but we didn't use it. They looked after our cases happily in a room beside reception after checkout which was up to 12 noon. The walls were thin and occasionally we heard other guests in the corridors. All in all a good break in a superb location. Just a couple of Madrid tips. The Prado, which is within walking distance shuts Mondays. The Monasterio de las Descalzas Reales opens at 10.30 with bookable organised tours. We were there about 10.25 and got on the 11.15 tour.

Reception seemed ok in terms of a sort of friendly service and in terms of it looking fairly presentable. When we got to our room however, it was a different story. Though the room was clean, it was sadly lacking any form of comfort. The room was cramped, needed a good overhaul with at the very least a lick of paint. We discovered we had a balcony, however, the glass dividing screens between each of the balconied rooms was smashed or broken. Not good, not safe. The bedding was clean enough for sure, but the bedcover was a nylon throwback from the 70's and didn't look too new or fresh. Bathroom, functioning - just, but no plugs to put into the sink, bath or bidet so no choice other than to keep the water running. It was extremely difficult to turn off the taps fully - you had to use a towel to get a strong grip on the taps to turn them off fully! Shower was over the bath and pretty well ineffective with a distinct lack of truly hot water, The towels were shabby and torn, damaged floor tiles and a lump of concrete by the loo where they obviously didn't have any tiles left to fill the gap. The hotel was like a rabbit warren and difficult to navigate for a couple of days because of the layout. Breakfast was fair for a continental breakfast but if you had dentures you would not be able to eat the very hard baked bread roll you are served every morning. The food quality was not up to much with a blood red jam that looked most artificial and unappetising, really awful orange juice and mediocre cooked meat and prepacked croissants that looked and tasted nothing like a fresh one. The breakfast was the same every day and on the last day I couldn't face it again so went elsewhere to eat. Noise was a problem, from students, football fans, doors being slammed shut in the small hours, lift being kicked because it had failed one more than one occasion.

I can only say that you get what you pay for- If you book on the cheap via an internet agency, don't expect any luxuries. I booked through my local bucket shop, which I have used for many years, and I trust them. My booking for the last week in July 2008 was with flexibletrips.com, part of Thomas Cook. The holiday was for 7nts, room only, plus flights from Bristol to Madrid, quoted as 'double/twin individual use standard, room only', and came to \u00a3568.94. Travel insurance not included. The first impression was good. Although I travelled on my own the room had three single beds ( could have had some great parties... ), plenty of room, the door opened into a short corridor with the bathroom on one side, and the main room at the end. At the other end of the room was a narrow balcony big enough for two or three chairs, although there was only one in the room. It was an outside room, on the fifth floor, and the view from the balcony was mixed cityscape/rooftops, and some outstandingly detailed architecture not completely visible from the street level. The antics of the binmen during refuse collection is well worth seeing! The fifth floor rooms only have a metal roller style shutter plus glass doors, which only dampen the considerable street noise a little. The last time I stayed was on the third or fourth floor, I seem to remember louvred outer shutters, glass doors, solid wooden inner shutters, and a thick curtain, when I closed all these the street noise was completely gone. The hotel has no air conditioning, and no fans, ceiling or otherwise. I don't recommend staying in Madrid during July full stop, now I know how hot it gets- up to 104F, with no letup at night untill well after midnight, but if you must then go out and buy a deskfan. I managed to get one for 10 euros, completely justifying staying at a budget hotel. Just throw it away when you leave. The room was clean, as were the towels and bedding. I didn't try the food, as I was booked in as room only, and wanted to eat out as much as possible. The location of the hotel helped in this matter, there were several bars & restaurants available without even crossing a street. To address a problem raised by another reviewer about charging camera batteries, I use a travel charger, the mains plug can be changed to suit the location, and I was able to plug it into the shaver socket in the bathroom. Or if you can bear to be without TV, plug in there instead. Spanish TV is crap anyway. A music channel would have been nice.

I was glad to discover when we arrived that the hotel was a lot nicer than described! The location was great - only about 5 mins from Puerta del Sol, about the same to Gran Via, and only 2 mins from Metro (though we didn't use it as we managed to get to most places easily on foot). There are plenty of restaurants and bars in the area, and even a Haagen Dazs next door, and a Starbucks down the street! The little bakery next door was great for a late breakfast (hotel breakfast finishes at 11am - though we didn't always make it!!) or a quick snack. I wouldn't really say that the hotel was noisy, as we kept the windows (double glazed) and shutters closed. We didn't hear much noise coming from other rooms. The rooms were simple, but clean, comfortable and very spacious. We had rooms on the 6th floor, all of which were a good size, and some had large terraces (no outdoor furniture though, which would have been nice). The furnishings were simple, and fairly modern (pine beds), the beds soft and comfortable, and the TV did work, though we didn't spend much time in the room to watch it. The bathroom was clean, the towels replaced every day, and the shower always hot with good water pressure. My only concerns are that there is no air-con in the room, and in March it was already warm; and also that the safe in the room is a bit of a swizz - you have to put \u20ac1 in each time you want to open it. The breakfast was ok - we had to pay \u20ac8 per day, which was fine, but there are alternatives in the area if you don't want to take it. You get a slice of ham, processed cheese and processed meat with peppers in, a basket with cakes and croissants, a roll, jam, butter, coffee/tea, orange, and there are also cereals to choose from. A typical breakfast for a European 2* hotel. Finally, the staff at the hotel were always very helpful, kind and patient. They kindly allowed us to keep one of our rooms after checkout for no extra charge before our group headed home. I work in travel, and have stayed in many hotels of different star ratings in many different countries, and I have found many worse than the Asturias (even some 3 or 4 star hotels!!) If you are staying in Madrid for a few days, and you don't want to pay much for your room, and don't expect to get a 5* hotel when you're paying for a 2* - then the Asturias is a good choice.

I stayed at the Asturias for 3 nights early in October 2007. Despite having read the negative reviews on trip advisor, I decided to book with the hotel simply for one and one reason only: location. I was keeping my fingers crossed that it would rise above the negative reviews even for just a bit. Big mistake; don't do it folks. DO NOT , I repeat, do not stay at this hotel. There are other hotels near by, even one located half a block away. Try one of those, hopefully they'll do a better job. THE ROOM: mine was on the fourth floor and I had no problems with the elevator. The room was big enough for one person, but I cannot say the same for the bathroom. It was small and it had no bathtub, just a shower. It had no hair dryer as well, so ladies bring your own. Everytime I had to stand in front of the mirror I had to close the door behind me. The room has no aircondition, just a fan. This was ok with me as I was there in October, and it had cooled off significantly, but I can only imagine the furnace of a room it must be during the hot summer months. There was a small TV in the room but the picture was snowy and the remote never worked. THE BREAKFAST: ( or what they call breakfast at this hotel) .The tables were already set with food on them sitting there for hours. On each table were placed 3 slices of processed lunch meat of indefinite flavor, one slice of processed cheese -which by the time one managed to unwrap, there was hardly any left-, stale bread, a semi-stale croissant and two small cellophane wrapped sweets of no specific taste as well. The guests had to help themselves to a small table with a very limited selection of cereal. The waiters were there only to serve juice and coffee. THE HOTEL STAFF: They would not care less. They were very rude and acted as though they were doing the hotel guests a favor. When I requested a hairdryer, I was given one with an outlet for US use. When I called the receptionist to request a converter, I was simply told that she had no staff available to send me one with and that I had to get dressed , go downstairs and get the converter. When I called again, a different receptionist simply told me that there is no converter -period. The night before I was to leave, I requested a wake-up call, and also asked the receptionist to reserve a taxi for me. He simply told me that they do not reserve taxis and all I had to do is stand outside ( early in the morning with all the luggage, mind you) and flag one down!!!!! ( I have done a lot of traveling, but this was a first for me.) As for the wake-up call: it never came; no one ever bothered calling. I was lucky I woke up on my own.

The people at the front desk were rude, and when we asked them questions (like where an all night pharmacy was, for example) it was obvious that they were annoyed to be pulled away from their conversations to have to actually talk to us. After we check in the man at the desk informs us that the elevator is broken, to go to the back and use the service elevator. No offer to show us where, no signs pointing the way. We found the service elevator, but when we got off on our floor (7th) we took a wrong turn (the service elevator lets you out in the service area on the top floor) and had trouble finding our way out of the laundry area to our room. Once in the room we realized it wasn't air conditioned. My hotel in Germany didn't have air conditioning, but Berlin in July is a lot different than Madrid. We were on the top floor with no attic above us so the tile roof soaked up the sun all day and put it directly in our room, plus the side of the building we were on received direct sun from 8am to 8pm. The room was an oven with only an table fan for relief. The window and terrace door did open, but provided very little air. At night it was unbearable, during the day we had no choice but to seek refuge outside, which was very hard since most business close from 2-4:30. During our stay the outside temperature was 101F, inside it easily hit 110-115F. I knelt down on the floor to pick something up, and the floor was warm to the touch. In desperation we finally pulled the mattresses off of the beds and dragged them out to the terrace to sleep. At night Madrid cools down, but this hotel would hold the heat until about 6 or 7am, and start to heat up again a little after 8am. It's apparent that this used to be a luxury hotel, but it is very quickly falling into disrepair. Walking down the stairs from the 7th to the ground floor (the elevator was touch and go) you could feel the stairs give, a little nerve wracking. Also, they advertise that there is a safe in the room, but they don't mention that you have to pay 1euro each time you want to lock it. Other than that, it was clean, no bugs, and had a good location.

Metro access is everywhere....lots of bus stops....but this hotel is right in the centre. Our room was looking out onto three other walls - no view, but you may be able to get one looking onto the street. However, other people complain of noise though - we didn't hear any from our room so I guess they must mean the street! On our first night we went to bed at 1am & it was quiet as anything. The other 3 nights we didn't get back til 6-7am so I couldn't comment, lol! Although the hotel was noisy in the sense walls are very thin & if someones moving stuff upstairs, or checking out, the whole hotel hears it. Didn't try the breakfast as we were usually going to bed lol, but there's lots of cafes round, especially one a couple of doors down if you turn right from the hotel. Yes, the rooms are old, & so is the hotel...but I don't know, it has sort of a quaint feel & we didn't see what everyone was complaining about. We paid less than \u00a320 a night, with breakfast....you get what you pay for afterall! Reception area was quite modern & clean & there was a bar, though we didn't get anything from here.

The location is fantastic, just a walk from the Puerta del Sol, in the very centre of the city. I knew there must be something bad which should compensate the price. It wasn't the size of the room, which was pretty spacious and in spite of the old fashoned furniture, not too bad. The place seemed quite secure and quite clean. Bathrooms are o.k. as well. Breakfast is basic but not miserable - after all..if you need something more there is plenty of coffe bars in the surroundings. The thing which was not working at all is that the hotel, on the whole, is terribly noisy. The personnel cleaning the rooms in the morning is really disturbing, passing to and fro in front of the rooms with all their stuff clattering and hitting everywhere. So, if you're not completely dead, forget about waking up later than 08.30 a.m.. Besides, one night they decided to work at some water pipe in the building. We had been advised there won't have been any water during the night...and that was not a problem. The problem was they were materially working at those pipes...with an hammer at 1 in the night. What can I say: be prepared...this is one of those places you can chose to save money. If this is your aim, the place is yours.

We stayed here for three nights 27th to 30th Jan 06. I had read the below reviews and was terrified I'd chosen a demolition site for my fiancee's christmas present!!!!!! As it turned out, it was fine. Not great, but fine. The hotel was fantastically positioned, just off the 'sevilla' metro stop (which by the way you need to be careful when using, my fiancee was pick pocketed whilst travelling on this trip, 150euros taken...secure your handbags ladies, or you'll spend 3 hours of your holiday in the police station like we did!!!!). 6.15euros for 10 trip ticket on the metro lasted all holiday, mainly due to the convenience of the location. It's right next to the 'sol' so fantastic for shopping and drinks out. The Royal Palace and the Prado Museum are 10 mins walk. Cafe's are all around, Starbucks being about 100yards away! We had always planned to use it just for sleeping and as a base, so for us it was just what we needed. I would say, if you don't like noise, don't stay in Asturias (or any of the central hotels!). At night you will hear the horns and shouts that seem to be customary of spanish driving! Also, get a low floor. The hotel was good until about the 3rd floor. This was our floor and from the stairs between 2nd and 3rd floors upwards there was a funny smell, quite unpleasant. It was like the drains were blocked. This was by no means unbearable, and was somewhat compensated by a good view from our small balcony, but it just would have been a 4/5 rating if it hadn't been there. The breakfast was ok, again nothing special, but for the price you just can't complain! There are however a couple of handy hints I would like to pass on to you: 1)If it's the only spanish you use, say 'hola' instead of 'hello', the initial response you get seems to make it far more acceptable to speak english afterwards. The hotel staff are very friendly once the effort of that single word is made. 2)Bring proper tea bags and take them to breakfast...the hotel is not accustomed to english tea, but the milk and sugar will make a good cuppa! 3)Be prepared to struggle massively if you are a vegetarian, choices are very limited for decent food in your average restaurant!", "Date": "January 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cVery Basic backpacker style Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4326050", "Content": "We stayed in madrid over New year 2006.
