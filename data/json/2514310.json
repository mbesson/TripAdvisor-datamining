The reception area was a bombsite....luggage all over, dust everywhere. The net curtains were grey, tinged with black. The place smelt; musty old and damp. The lift was a disgrace. The carpets in the hallway were heavily worn through to the flooring underneath. The door to our room didn't fit in the frame leaving enough of a gap above to be able to look up and down the corridor. The room itself was tiny. No tea/coffee facility, headboard for the bed was at an angle and the room totally univiting. Dust all around the skirting boards and radiator. This place should not be classed as a hotel. It was more like a refuge. Had to wipe my feet on leaving the place. There was no-way I could subject my family to staying in this place even for one night. Cancelled and moved to another hotel that did exactly what it said. En-suite etc etc and for a cheaper rate. One other thing to note is they only have 1 (one) iron shared between the 30+ rooms. Even then they want a deposit of \u00a310 for use of it. Oh, almost forgot...... there is building work going on Half the hotel is scaffolding. Maybe that should also be added to the booking site!.

Not the safest area in London, specially at night. The room was dark, small, a very small window. In summer time you may not have a good sleep, no circulation of air. Bathroom was nice but shower didn't work at all. Breakfast is mostly included in the rate, for those who never had English Brekfast and want to try first time -- don't believe Majestic Hotel Breakfast is actually the authentic one, quality of food not very good either. Kitchen staff were friendly. No internet available, but there is a Internet Cafe close to the Station. The room service didn't clean the room, had to request Reception to make sure it is done next time. One final thing, there is no extra lock inside the room.

The hotel looks ok from the outside but as soon as you enter the reception area the nasty truth begins to dawn. The place is absolutely filthy, how it passed any official inspections is beyond me. I decided to have a look at their room and quickly wished I hadn't. The tiny lift was dirty and when it stopped and opened, we were greeted by builders with drills and dust everywhere, I even had to wade through rubble in a very expensive pair of shoes ( I wasn't happy!) The corridor was extremely narrow, dark and dirty, even each individual room door was filthy. I can't even describe how disgusting the room was. I have stayed in every type of hotel over the last 20 years and I have never experienced a place like this in my life, in fact I didn't even know a place like this existed in London. Even the staff wandering around the hotel seemed to have a lot of scabs on their faces. This hotel has the audacity to be more expensive than Travelodge or Premier Inn.

When we told the staff, you could tell that they knew there were bed bugs which was the most distressing part of the stay.

I was lumbered with it as part of a package deal and I honestly considered finding a cheap B&B and forgoing the \u00a360 a night I'd paid in advance. My single room resembled a monk's cell in a monastary far more than it did anything one would expect from the hospitality trade. It was bleak, cramped and wholly unwelcoming. The floor sloped at a forty-five degree angle. The bathroom door didn't close properly. Most amazing of all though, there was no tea and coffee making facilities in the room. It remains the only catering establishment I have ever stayed at which didn't offer that most basic of refreshment. The dangerous element was the bathroom, or to be more specific, the shower. The tiny cubicle did not have a door or even a curtain across it. This meant that water spilt out as you were showering and made the journey from the shower cubicle to the bathroom floor a treacherous one. An elderly person or anyone unsteady on their feet would quite honestly be taking their life in their hands using this shower. I might also add that the toilet seat was improperly fitted and a sign above the hand basin warned against drinking the water. If all that doesn't put you off then beware of the breakfast rip off. Despite the words \"English Breakfast\" being underlined on my breakfast card, I had to make do with the continental bread rolls, coffee and juice laid out in the dining room. I waited for three quarters of an hour for the English breakfast to arrive but was left waiting. You'll probably say I slould of comlpained. However, there was only one person working in the dining room and she didn't speak much English. Travel agents should really remove this delapidated wreck from thier lists of approved accomodation.

The second room was fine, clean and tidy. Nothing wrong with it at all. We slept well and the breakfast was fine, served in an light and airy room and plenty of food.

This is a problem because they tend to be noisy, irritating and poor fellow guests. The noise in the hotel from banging doors, people staying up late and being noisy, and hanging around, was highly intrusive. - The hotel needs refurbishing. It's looking faded and tired, with scuffed carpets and a lack of TLC. - No internet access. - The hotel is on a busy main road where there are deliveries, a thoroughfare of taxis, cars and buses - and you can also hear tube noise. - The radiator was always on, with no means of turning it off - meaning the window needed to be open, which meant a noisy night's sleep - Previous reviews have suggested bedbugs. No evidence for me, although two issues I must draw your attention to: I noticed several ants in the breakfast room on the tables where the buffet-style food and croissants were. This represents a BIG hygiene problem. Secondly, I have begun to itch a bit since staying in this hotel. Like I say, I didn't see evidence of any infestation or pest problem (apart from the ants at breakfast) BUT I do suspect that multi-legged creatures are at work behind the scenes at the Majestic Hotel.

The bathroom was very clean and everything functioned but as I was on the fifth floor I never managed to get hot water. I suffered one very chilly shower and didn't risk another. The breakfast was adequate, plenty of tea, coffe and bread rolls, but I had a problem in conveying to the young man on duty that I would like a fried egg.

Upon arrival at the hotel, we noticed how the floor was rather unlevel in places and we proceeded up to the reception where we met 'Basil & Cybil' as we called them because it seemed to us like a Fawlty Towers type hotel. We were rather shocked to hear a lady complaining at the front desk as we arrived to say that for the second day running her shower still wasn't working and neither was her TV. She said that she also would have rung down to reception to tell them however her telephone wasn't working either. We finished booking in and were given our key to a room on the 4th floor and took the rather small lift up to this level. When we opened the door we discovered that we had a twin room rather than the double we had booked online. My boyfriend said right turn around let go and get this sorted out. We went back down to Reception and requested the double room that we had booked online. We were told there were no double rooms available and could we do the first night in this room. We said no because we specifically requested this hotel because a double room came up. Eventually the 'Basil' behind the desk rang someone on his mobile phone and we were given a new room 106 on the first floor. When we got into this room we thought we had better check out the facilities in case they weren't working. We checked the shower and the TV and the telephone and they were all working. Although the room was small it seemed ok however the heating was on full pelt and in this small room made it very very hot inside already. We tried to open the door and there was a chain on it so we partially had it open and let a small breeze in through the door. We requested the heating be turned off to be told it went off at 10pm however it was still on at midnight. There was no smoke alarm in the room either which i would of thought would have been a basic requirement of any hotel regardless of star rating. When i booked the room i said to my boyfriend that it didn't say if there was any tea of coffee making facilities at the hotel. He said he thought that there probably would of been. There wasn't but this would have been an added bonus to the rooms. We didnt get breakfast included and i dont really think we missed anything to be honest. The roof inside the bathroom looked as though the bathroom above had fallen through at some point and evidence of a water leak too which had been patched up.The bed had a 'mongy' brown blanket on the bed and the pillows were not the most generous with sizes. The back stairs entrance was quite 'grubby' and the place smelt quite a lot of smoking, and the front stairs that we tried to access was only a 'fire exit' and not an immediate link back to the hotel. The hallways upstairs are in need of an overhaul and new carpet too as in some area the pathway dips. Ok if you are still reading this,although we did find the room outdated and basic it was VERY clean and the room was serviced when we left out the card on the door. Clean towels were also left and generally tidied too. This hotel is in a fantastic location for London and tubes and buses etc. There is a sainsbury literally outside the hotel to the left, and is a in a great central location. If i was (which fortunately for my boyfriend i am not) a 'high mainentance girflfriend' there is no way we would of stayed 5 minutes in this place. You also have to pay up front for your rooms - we did wonder if this was because most people stayed one night and then found somewhere else to stay !!!! We felt that this is the kind of hotel which if booked like we booked it would be a once only visit to it and then find somewhere different next time.

And good thing we didn't read! I can't believe so many have had such bad experiences, because we faced hardly any problems during our stay. Okay true that it could use a minor update (especially the carpets) but we didn't mind that at all. As we were checking in we encountered one of the most helpful and nice receptionists ever (long brown hair, piercing in nose, very smiley) who provided us with lots of info and tips throughout our stay. As we headed up to our room we noticed that one of the two elevators was broken, but it had been fixed already the same night. So no problems there. Our room was situated on the 2nd floor, the window facing Cromwell Road, which is a very busy street even in nighttime. Once closed, the window blocked out surprisingly much of the noise, but I'd still recommend to bring a pair of earplugs. Pop them in your ears and you'll sleep like a baby through the remaining traffic sounds. The room itself was very basic, but provided us with all that we needed; Two single beds (as we had requested) comfortable, neatly made, clean sheets & fairly comfy pillows, enough table- and closet space and a clean bathroom. We both had large suitcases and placing them open on the floor called for a little puzzling, but we managed fine. As mentioned, our bathroom was great, nothing nasty bout it. Sink and tub were both clean, towels and soaps were changed every time, the shower worked just fine (not too cold or too hot) and had good waterpressure. Even our toilet was scrubbed every time! Now, you need to pay attetion when closing your door. Especially if you leave your window open, and try closing the door too hard, it'll just pop right open again. So close with care, and double check, and you'll be just fine. The key needs to be left at the reception, but you get this \"room ID-card\" that you'll need to show every time you retrieve your key. I can't comment neither the restaurant nor the breakfast, since we ate out every day. And I would have wished for the rooms to be equipped with a fridge and a safe, but again, that's just me. And you'll be fine off without them as well. For the location; it was fabulous! Close to two tube stations, museums, Harrods, Hyde Park, eating, pubs...you name it!

Overall, the rooms and corridors are in a fairly derelict, shabby state \u2013 the hotel really needs some major, general refurbishment. However, the most annoying and disturbing aspect of my stay was my experience with the hotel management. The receptionist asked me to pay the entire amount due upon check-in with my credit card. After check-in by mid-day, I realized that the shower in my room (# 113) did not yield any warm water (in January!), but its use resulted in flooding the bathroom. I tried again the next morning, and so did my room mate (an old friend, attending the same conference) \u2013 despite letting the water run for several minutes, it remained less than lukewarm. I reported it to Reception, who said that they would send in their maintenance staff. When trying again the next morning, the water was still cold. I returned to the receptionist, who said that the maintenance staff member had inspected the shower and not found any fault, but that they would look at it again. On day 3 and when checking out, I reiterated to the receptionist that the problems with the shower had prevailed throughout my stay, and that I would expect some form of discount or partial refund. The receptionist said that she had no means of refunding me anything since the payment had been made, but that I should talk to the hotel manager who was bound to arrive an hour later. Indeed, I waited for the manager. He left me with an impression of arrogance and dishonesty (in contrast, I would characterize the 2 ladies staffing the reception as friendly, but helpless). He refused to give his full name other than \u201cAlex\u201d. He started off by disputing that there had been any problem with my shower in the first place, since he trusted his maintenance staff member \u2013 when I asked him to go to the room together with me to convince himself that the shower was not working properly, he refused. He said that he was not willing to issue me any partial refund since \u201cthe bill was closed\u201d, but when I insisted, he hinted that I might get a discount during a future stay at his hotel \u2013 however, when I requested a written statement confirming this, he refused and said that it would be enough to remind him of me. I then suggested that he should give this discount to my friend who had been my room mate and who was staying still longer \u2013 which he also refused. Also, he was very reluctant even to issue me a receipt for my stay. Overall, very dodgy and unfriendly.

On the beds, there is a cover as thin as the top layer of skin on my finger. A chaperone advised us to take that off, because it looked dirty. Under that was a wool blanket, mine with food crumbs stuck in it. Under that was a sheet, which i also stripped off the bed because, can you believe it? There was a pee stain. So that night I slept on the raw matress, which probably wasn't a good idea, but it was better than the bed i was given. I was scared of what i might find with the pillow so I used my coat. The bathrooms had signs in them that said \"Do Not Drink Water!\" on them, and my bathroom lights didn't work. One of my classmates said their room didn't even have a door on the shower. Our shower had mold on the handle. The hotel's technician did not know how to fix the lights, so he returned with a friend, who looked rather sketchy with his hands behind his back so we turned him away. We weren't allowed to step on the floor without shoes because it smelled like throw up, as someone probably did. There was no central light, but reading lamps on the wall above the 4 beds. Mine was swinging upside down falling off the wall. Breakfast there was disgusting. I didn't dare try dinner, if they have dinner. I only have one more word to mention: Bugs. If you are thinking about staying at the Majestic, don't do it.", "Date": "March 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "LellaSS", "ReviewID": "UR13861005", "Content": "Stayed at the Majestic for 4 days during a school trip. Rooms need refurbishing and updating, but water in the shower was very hot and the heaters were always on, which was good since the weather was really cold. Personally I never had breakfast at the hotel (there are a couple of Starbucks nearby), but most of my students did and say it was awful. Staff very kind and helpful. Location is what makes this hotel special. Only 6 stops from the West End by tube, Harrods and the Museums just around the corner and the big Sainsburys next to the building was open 24/7 , which was the last resort to those students who wanted to grab a bite or a drink late at night. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this hotel to families with children or elderly people for its very basic facilities, but It's OK for students or young couples who can make up for this lack of facilities more easily.", "Date": "February 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGross Gross Gross!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "craigdecarlo", "ReviewID": "UR11307406", "Content": "Wow....this is the worst hotel I've ever stayed at in my life. We are a young couple, with average expecations...we can handle slumming it, but geeze, this place was terrible. Our bed was literally a mattress on the floor, the blue carpets in the hallways were so worn out that they have huge gaps in them. Paint was coming off the walls everywhere. The rooms are TINY, in your washroom, there are signs saying not to drink the tap water (who would anyway? The faucets were covered in grime), there are also posting everywhere saying that we shouldn't leave any valuables in the room because the hotel will not be held responsible for stolen items (so we jsut kept the do not disturb sign on our door all week and refused maid service)...the front desk staff were so dumb -I asked where the West End/Theatre district was and they said they didn't know. The also told us the nearest place you could get internet acces was a 5 minute walk away at Earls Court -when there was an internet cafe a few doors down. Every time you leave the hotel, you have to hand in your room key. One night, we (we're a young couple) came home and there was an older man behind the desk and he wouldn't let us go up to our room because he said that there was only 1 person registered to stay in our room, and he was really rude about it too. I argued and told him that I had made the booking myself for 2 people, he argued back, then I looked noticed that the booking he was looking at was for a completely different room...he apologized, but still...very rude. Don't stay here, seriously. We stayed 5 nights, and pre paid so were were stuck. The location isn't even that great. It's a 5 minute walk to the tube station, and about an hour walk to the centre of town...you can do better.", "Date": "December 7, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Majestic Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d193642-Reviews-Majestic_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$81 - $146*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">160 Cromwell Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">SW5 0TL</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514310", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/8e/5a/8e5a6df5db1e2501e5755300e9678e0c3large.jpg"}}
