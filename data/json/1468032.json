Otherwise, I found the place to be clean and pleasant looking. I wish the blackout curtain had been much longer, though. Light was bursting in from underneath it. However, the bed was very comfortable. Overall, I felt that the room served me well. On one of those occasions, a signal no. 10 typhoon (the strongest) hit Hong Kong in the night, but I was blissfully unaware of that in the hotel room. The next day, I found out that some Hongkongers had been unable to sleep that night from the noise of the heavy downpour, so I counted myself lucky! This is of course a rare event. Yes, some of the staff are not so polished. After I had checked out, I came back to collect my luggage and requested to use the bathroom.

On the contrary, I and my husband stayed at L'Hotel Island South and we were able to store our huge Samsonite luggage there on 23-31 July.

I also liked the fact that this hotel is located about 5 min walk from Sheung Wan MTR station, and Sheung Wan is only 1 station away from Central station. Sheung Wan is also close to Macau Ferry terminal and it's close to the tram stops. There are also interesting bird nest shops outside the hotel, which is something that you do not see every day. Right outside the hotel, there are also 7-Eleven, K Circle shop, and Wellcome supermarket nearby. There are some nice eateries at Sheung Wan, otherwise you can walk about 10 minute to Wellington Street at Central to find popular HK eateries. The hotel stay also includes breakfast as well, which is good (as smaller hotels usually do not offer breakfast). Because of their small rooms, I do not really recommend stays for family or travellers who like to spend most of their day in the hotel (then again... HK has so much things to explore, why would you want to spend most of your days in the hotel anyway?). I will definitely stay at Sohotel again next time when we visit HK.

I travel to Hk every other month and have stayed at numerous hotels and sohotel is the by the far the one I would highly recommend to anyone who likes the buzz of soho nearby and the convenience of the MTR without having to pay exorbitant price. Service at this hotel is well beyond their call of duty, I had a splitting headache & had asked for aspirin in which they did not have, the front desk then went on to say that they will get someone to run out to buy and will have them sent up to my room. True enough, I had the aspirin delivered to my room in the next 15 mins! The complimentary breakfast was simply delicious and the ladies at the cafe were so accommodating and it felt right at home with your mum actually serving you breakfast! The free wifi certainly helps and at no time was it down nor weak. The only con and this is well not within their control, is the construction right opposite. The drilling & hammering gets you up by 8am & if you had a late night previously, this may not be the best way to rise. I feedback this to them and guess what! I was given ear plugs when I returned later than evening, a fine example of top notch customer service. On my last trip 2 weeks ago, I tried to book Sohotel but they were full, it's not hard to know why they are full, with loyal customer like myself, you are definitely pampered at Sohotel!", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFind youself a better place- Rude staff, breakfast served unhygienically\u201d", "Author": "psaini09", "ReviewID": "UR101692562", "Content": "Only thing that we liked about the hotel was its location, it was located at 5mins walk to Sheung wan station. From here it was easy to take a train to anywhere you want to go. About the hotel we booked a standard room but this is way too small, bed is attached to the two wall and there is literally 15inch of space left in-between, so you cant even open you luggage over there. We did upgrade to superior room which was bit bigger but still not enough to keep the luggage properly and with it you don't have enough space to move around. hotel staff was just OK, I don't remember the name as this skinny girl, use to work at reception almost every morning while we was there she had a bad attitude problem. On the day i left, I requested the staff to get a taxi and they just pointed me to the front entrance asking i can stop one over there. I had a suitcase and three bags but they wasn't helpful enough to help me with the luggage. Service guys literally dragged my luggage to and from the room. As i wasn't able to find a hotel which servers the breakfast and that was one of my deciding point to stay in this hotel but i can say they do serve very basic breakfast. They had a list of 10-12 items of which i tried few and they said its finished or not available so i end up eating egg sandwich for four days There is only one guys to serve everyone so you have to wait, i was twice served a juice in an unwashed glass with lipstick marks on it. I reported that to reception but they didn't like it and advised i should tell that to the staff serving. I end up paying them 700 Aussie dollars for 4nights, i should have booked a better hotel for this price.
