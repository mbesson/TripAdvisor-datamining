It would be a 2 star hotel there. The room was ok but the carpet was really dirty, the toilet was shaking when you sat on it.... the bed was too soft and I had a feeling I would fall over in my sleep...the big minus is that the corridors are not air conditioned so when you step out of your room, you are in a sweat. Breakfast is not what I expected, they had only bread, no pastry at all.... Location is ok, about 1, 5 km to Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque.

Initially when we arrived at the hotel, I could tell by the area that it wasn't going to be as good as I hoped. It was located in a busy congested high street, looked a little run down and to top it off the driver who dropped us off told us to beware of the area. Although this wasn't really an issue for us as there were 6 of us who stuck together all the time, we didn't encounter any problems with safety etc. Arrived at the hotel and we greeted by the bellboys who helped us with the luggage. The reception was smaller than it looked on the website but still looked quite nice. We had some trouble with the rooms, they placed us in 2 rooms on different floors, even after we'd asked the unfriendly guy on reception if the rooms were close to each other, he assured us they were, but we found out we weren't and they'd placed us on the 2nd and 4th floors. The lift getting to the rooms was a nightmare. Its supposed to fit 4 people, but with luggage don't even think about it. There was only 1 lift and it was ridiculous how small it was. When we got to our room, we were far from happy. The room was dark with no natural light at all. It was dark in there even when it was morning, it just gave us a dingy, depressed feeling. The window it did have faced a grey wall with a load of pipes. The room was stuffy and had this underlying stale smell to it that lingered almost all of the time. The taps in the bathroom were VERY bad, the water would hardly flow out and this was very frustrating. The shower was not clean and we saw a hair in it still there from the previous guests. We complained about the room on the day, and the guy at reception (who spoke very little English) told us that he would change our rooms the next morning. So when we went back in the morning, he wasn't there and a lady (who spoke good English) said that no rooms were available and that we should come back the next day to rooms with windows. After spending 2 horrible nights in the unpleasant rooms, we did eventually get 2 triple rooms with windows, with a view of the high street. We were very grateful to the lady who changed our rooms. The breakfast was poor. Watered down juice, the coffee machine which seemed to pour out the same drink no matter what button you pressed and nothing continental about it. We thought we'd go to the restaurant in the hotel for dinner on the first night, looked at the menu in the reception at what they offered. When we went down to the restaurant it was closed. Overall I would not recommend this hotel. It was definitely not a 4*. More like 2-3*. The location was ok, it was in close proximity to the local shops, tram and bazaars. But the quality of the hotel was just not good enough for me to go back there. Next time I would choose a hotel nearer to the tourist attractions, such as Sultanahmet.", "Date": "November 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "bedfordshire", "Title": "\u201cdefinately not 4* !!!!\u201d", "Author": "Roz123", "ReviewID": "UR47234586", "Content": "Seemed like a nice hotel from the outside and was impressed with the bellboys rushing up to grab our suitcases but we soon found out on the contrary. It was a struggle to communicate with the reception guy who spoke little english and never smiled. We had booked 2 seperate rooms that were far from each other and didn't know where the other half of our family was placed as the guy on reception just sent half of us up with a bell boy to our room without telling what rooms we were in!! The rooms were dark and dingy, bathroom was ok but as small as a normal ensuite and surprisingly tatty considering the hotel was supposedly built in 2009!! Don't be fooled by the pics on any of the websites as the window behind closed curtains faces a wall and a generator. The rooms were hot and sticky and no amount of AC could cool it down. By morning the rooms stank of sewage (god knows from where). We complained and after 2 days of managing in those rooms we were placed in rooms with windows which were much more airy and next door to each other. There was a very pleasant reception lady who helped us change rooms and we were very grateful to her and tipped her generously. The hotel was situated in a good location, near shops and the tram. It was only a few stops away from the Grand Bazaar, the Blue Mosque and Topkapi palace which is the reason why we booked it. We will never ever book in that hotel again as it tainted our trip to Istanbul. The lift (yes only 1) was very small and only accomodated 4 people or 2 people and luggage. They also do not offer evening meals although they advertise an a la carte menu!! The breakfasts were not what we expected. It was not continental and was what we think typical Turkish people eat but alot of it was unedible ie watered down juices, soups?? and dirty cutlery. The lobby was quite nice though and was like it looks in the pictures, but the fact there were no real windows in some of the rooms makes it puzzling how it can be advertised as a four star hotel!!", "Date": "October 19, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Marinem Hotel Istanbul", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d1541785-Reviews-Marinem_Hotel_Istanbul-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$60 - $79*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Gencturk Cad.
