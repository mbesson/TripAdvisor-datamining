I used to walk by and gaze wistfully in the windows, telling myself that one day I would come back to Berlin as a civilian and stay at the hotel. Well, I finally did, in 2005, when I came to the now reunified Berlin on my honeymoon. My wife and I had a wonderful stay in one of the regular guest rooms and hoped that we'd eventually be back. Well, five years later we returned, this time with a young daughter. During this trip we decided to stay in the Hotel's apartment, which I highly recommend for families. It was spacious, and had a gorgeous view through the enormous windows overlooking the courtyard. But really the best thing about the Hotel Riehmers Hofgarten is the fabulous breakfast served every morning in the restaurant. The Br\u00f6tchen are simply to die for (see my photos). We can't wait to come back again!", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful, sophisticated hotel: great value, great location!\u201d", "Author": "SBlink", "ReviewID": "UR112961656", "Content": "Andreas at the desk was an terrific resource, spoke English well and was very thoughtful. The rooms are light-filled with high-ceilings, modern furniture and extremely comfortable futon-style mattresses and pillows. The double-paned windows and dark curtains kept things quiet when I needed to sleep. The iPod stereo was a plus, as was FREE in-room Wi-Fi. Breakfast was delicious and plentiful. The location is EXCELLENT, just a short 2-block walk to the Mehringhamm U-Bahn (subway) station. Kreuzberg is a super-cool, multi-ethnic neighborhood with tons of restaurants & shops within a few blocks of the hotel...but the hotel is removed enough to be elegant and quiet too. I would definitely stay here again!", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cLovely staff made our stay\u201d", "Author": "pippagirl", "ReviewID": "UR61183356", "Content": "A friend and I stayed at the Hotel Riehmers Hofgarten recently. We arrived tired and a little grumpy, and were greeted by a friendly smile from the receptionist. As we walked in the door she said \"oh, you must be the girls who phoned. Your room is ready for you\" which immediately made us feel welcome. She also loaned us the hotel's laptop so we could access wi-fi in our room. This was a godsend. The room was clean, simple and comfortable. Complimentary apples and a knife, which was a nice touch. The next morning was Easter Sunday, and were were delighted to find a chocolate bunny sitting outside our door. Breakfast buffet was delicious - boiled eggs, smoked salmon, cold meats, museli, yoghurt, pastries and much more. Receptionist and breakfast waitress again very smiley and kind. We had to leave straight after breakfast (this was only a short stay) and the receptionist happily phoned us a taxi. I would highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "April 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "LOMBARDIA", "Title": "\u201cReally satisfied about this Hotel !\u201d", "Author": "FRANZISKA7", "ReviewID": "UR10772086", "Content": "Very comfortable hotel, located in a strategic position.

The manager of the hotel, Herr Andreas Krause, was so welcoming and helpful with directions, suggestions, fixing my daughter's cell phone, etc, etc. The hotel has recently renovated an apartment which we moved into our 2nd night(180 euros) which was fabulous-- felt like we had a really cool apartment in Berlin! The rooms are huge, quiet and sunny.It is in a beautiful old restored courtyard and was well worth the extra expense. We had started off in a room facing the street which was lovely, except with the windows open, it was noisier than I would like. (The courtyard rooms were booked for World Cup.) The street-facing rooms are fine if you have earplugs or keep the windows closed, but the courtyard rooms are my first choice. We had dinner several times at e.t.a. hoffmann, the restaurant in the hotel. The food was delicious and interesting, and the ambience was delightful-- very relaxing and the three young servers are all so nice. It started to feel very homey! The neighborhood in Kreuzberg is great; not touristy. We loved the area and felt very safe and comfortable. It is a short walk from the hotel to the Mehringdamm u-bahn stop which will take you anywhere. There is a nice park, Victoriapark, nearby and good restaurants within walking distance. The things we liked most were the friendliness and kindness of the people working there, and the fact that the hotel seemed to have Europeans, including Germans, staying there. We didn't hear a lot of English spoken, except for me! The staff speaks English and everyone was nice about it. I highly recommend the Riehmers Hofgarten if you would like a friendly, non-touristy place where you will feel at home.", "Date": "July 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geneva, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cMost ideal hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4345481", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Riehmers Hofgarten in November for three nights and had a most enjoyable time. The room was huge, stylish and comfortable. The service was exceptional. The front desk staff was most helpful in planning our itinerary. The restaurant, very classy, serves excellent cuisine. As for the hotel's location, it's perfect - 8 min walk to the underground station, and in the middle of all the sightseeing, such as the Brandenburg Gate, Potsdamerplatz, the shopping thoroughfare Kurf\u00fcrstendamm, Checkpoint Charlie and the Jewish Museum. There is a Catholic church right beside the hotel. The room rate is most reasonble - 138 Euro a night, considering it's Berlin.
