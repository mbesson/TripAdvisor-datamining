I booked on the Hotel website as the hotel looked very nice. Arrived at the Nathan hotel at night (side road entrance). The room is nice and Spacious (I think we booked an executive) and on the 12th Floor. No real view per se. Great Room, comfortable bed and we had a good night sleep. Weekend started pretty well. The next morning we went to Breakfast and boy oh boy was it quite a shock! I work in the Hotel Business, in Thailand and I would be ashamed to serve such food and have such a poor breakfast selection for the price we paid. 2 star at best. Unfortunately for us, this was not the end of our surprises! we went out to walk and shop then came back to take a nap before going out to dinner. However our nap was interrupted by what sounded like Drilling Noises, hammering and plain Construction. It turned out the 14th floor (just above us) was in renovations. Now I don't have anything against renovations, but as we booked via the Hotel website we did not see anything mentioned, when we checked-in the hotel we were not warned that they had renovations going on (one Floor above us!!!). This, by any standards, is highly unprofessional from the hotel's part. On the 14th floor, when we were going for Breakfast, we saw the construction workers come into the public areas, with no shirt on. Appalling. We went down to Reception and talked to the Manager who apologized and offered to move us to the 9th floor. Really??? even more unprofessional, if you have renovations, why not put your customers on the 9th floor to begin with? Being in the hotel business managing 5 star properties, I was very disappointed with my stay at the Nathan Hotel. Room is nice but the poor quality of the breakfast and poor service made our stay very uncomfortable.

The hotel is within walking distance of both the Ladies Night Market and the Temple Street Market. I recommend going to both as you can get some really great items for a good price if your bartering skills are good. If you want good food go to Knustford Lane. This street is full of a variety of restaurants from Italian to Indian and even an Irish pub. I highly recommend eating at a restaurant called \u201cSpice\u201d. It is a Thai, Malay and Indian restaurant all in one. The food is spectacular and well priced. We ate there on 3 occasions during our stay! Knutsford Lane is about a 15 minute walk from the Nathan Hotel but well worth it.

This place got a okay rap so as the other two were booked out we ended up here. Firstly, Hong Kong is busy, specifically Nathan road .. Our room was clean enough, but obviously tired, two different kinds of carpets on the floors and a heavy hand with the silicone sealer in the bathroom, but linen, beds and all that nice and clean. Our cleaning lady was super friendly, smiling and very helpful , very pretty too! The rest of the front of house staff tried with their limited english to be helpful, some far better than others, but all were cheerful and did their best to help. We paid extra for the breakfast, it was'nt much chop for anglicised or asian brekky, so I suggest you give it a miss and for the money, go into Nathan rd , turn right and walk a few steps to Main street coffee, excellent coffee, atmosphere and of course, free WIFI or use one if their computers, there is WIFI here too, but it can be dodgy .. There is WIFI everywhere even on public transport, so you'll always be connected. Rooms aren't super sound proof, our neighbors were a group of enthusiastic Chinese whose laughs and tells came through quite well and the little kids pitted patter up and down the corridors was annoying,especially at 11 pm. Television has limited channels but the idea is you'll be cruising the night markets, just across Nathan rd and a couple of streets over. Not far to Ladie's market and all those other ones up that way. Plus, go a few steps to the left, and one can get a number 6,2 or 6a down to the Star ferry wharf. So, in this regard the Nathan is pretty good. Just be aware that Hong Kong is a sea of concrete crawling with heaps of people, and Nathan road is a epicenter of shopping and commerce, so it'll always be noisy and full of traffic, and unless you go into New Territories or up the Peak.. All in all, the Nathan is decent value, good location and ticks the boxes for a quality time in Honkers.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manila, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cBest Executive Service at an affordable price\u201d", "Author": "Jana C", "ReviewID": "UR128537942", "Content": "I stayed with my friend at Nathan Hotel for 4 days and 3 nights.

It's a shame we didn't get good weather while in HK but am grateful for the recommendations given by porter Leo on what to do on a rainy day. One good place he suggested was outlet shopping (Citygate Outlets) with a big food court at Tung Chung where you can find many international brands at a discount.

Would have paid less for the Nathan room (220-250 sqft) had I known the Grand rooms were the same size....or they sell Nathan Grand rooms and just slip you into a smaller Nathan room to make more money and hope u don't notice. After reading some other reviews, it looks like this may have happened to others before. **So, a couple days after I posted this review, I felt that I needed to edit it to explain the following: My room was called (on the day of my departure) and the staff asked when my flight was leaving. I told them I had to be at the airport at 3:30 pm and they said \"No problem, you can stay in the room as long as you like.\" When I went down to the lobby to check out and settle my account, I was greeted by the Manager - he said he understood that I had a problem with the room I was provided. He apologized and said if I ever come back, they have flagged my account and want to upgrade me on my next visit - they also provided me with the hotels private shuttle van to the airport (for 2 people) at the same price it would cost me for a taxi. They seemed very sorry and asked if there was anything else they could help us with and seemed to want to make things right. Too bad it was the day we were leaving. Next time I go to Hong Kong I will probably stay at the Nathan and take them up on their offer...wish me luck :) Nathan rooms have access to the 9th floor hospitality room.

The TV was a good sized flat screen attached to the wall - good choice of cable channels as well. Breakfast which was included was a whole different experience!

The chef who was meant to be cooking at the egg station was never present so I asked a waitress if I could order an egg and she looked at me like I asked her to offer up her newborn son to sacrifice! A very sullen face! She then personally cooked me an omelette which was basically raw and pushed the plate at me and walked off. The service was no better the next 2days.

They sent someone up to investigate straight away, called us back within 5 minutes and although they cldnt find the smoker, they gave a solution of either airfreshner or transfer to another room. The smell had gone by then, must have been a small waft from the a/c or something, so we stayed put. Still, very impressed with their assertiveness. Location is great, it took about 15 mins to walk to the ladies Market, 5 mins to temple st, 3 mins to the next MRT station, 10 mins to langham place - perfect spot. Oh, another complaint I previously read was that the breakfast was no good - this is not true either, they have a decent selection, it's not huge, but more than enough for a good start to your day.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel and location- Highly Recomended\u201d", "Author": "ozJOHNau", "ReviewID": "UR125106632", "Content": "Went here on the 6th Feb till 14th Feb 2012.

The Front Office staff and Manager Mr Chui were always there to assist us in all of our needs. Rooms were very clean and tidy and of an excellent size by Hong Kong standards. The hotel is only a few minutes away from the Jordan MTR Station, which gives you access to all parts of Hong Kong. Temple Street Night Markets are two blocks away and the number of local eating places close by are a treat for those keen on trying the Local foods, which we did and loved. The Nathan Hotel is a great base for all your sightseeing needs and there is a Local Tour Desk in the Reception area where the friendly young lady who speaks very good English will be more than happy to give you advise and make bookings for you.

The rooms themselves are average at best, but the price is pretty good. It was quite convenient to get to Mong Kok and Tsim Tsa Tsui either by walking or MTR (station is two blocks away). As for service, we had two very polarizing experiences with the front desk. The first time we checked in, they upgraded us free of charge to a bigger room and the front desk was very friendly. However, on the day we checked out, we were accused of consuming a drink from the mini bar. We travel a lot and never use the mini bar since it's a rip-off. It was a drink that I purchased at the 7-11 a block away. As a result, it was hugely disappointing to be accused of something I didn't do and it really soured our overall experience at the hotel which was bordering on 4 stars given the free upgrade, great location, and value. The front desk lady handled the situation very poorly while making accusations without much proof besides an empty bottle found in the garbage can. Our previous stay at the hotel the week before revealed a fridge without the drink in question so I don't know if they're sure that drink is at every room. A bad experience over a $2 drink is highly unfortunate, but that's what happened. The rest of the staff was great especially the person that checked us in (absolutely professional and helpful), the doorman and baggage check-in who was used on a few occasions. Other pros: Their gym is excellent for the price point. There are 4 cardio machines, a bunching bag/stand, a few benches, free weights, shower and bathrooms, and a self service ipad that plays music for the room.

In terms of location, the hotel is not at the heart of TST as it is actually in the Jordan area midway between TST and Mongkok. The better shops and restaurants are in the TST area. The markets, except for Temple Street, are in Mongkok. Having said that, it is definitely less crowded here and getting to anywhere is very convenient. The bus stops are just outside and the train station is just a short walk away. It was difficult trying to decide where to stay in HK.

Transport-wise, it is an easy 1-hour ride via the CityFlyer bus A21 from the airport (HK$33 per person, but either check with the bus driver where to alight or watch out for the cross streets near hotel), or you can always choose the more expensive option of taking the Airport Express train and transiting to the complimentary shuttle which drops you off at the Eathan Hotel next door (We did not choose this option so am unable to comment on this experience). The Nathan Hotel is also located less than 5 minutes\u2019 walk away from the Jordan MTR station, so getting anywhere in HK by public transport is a breeze. The hotel is also just across the road from the Temple Street Night Market where many small restaurants are located. However, if you are, like us, more interested in visiting the much livelier Ladies Market area in Mongkok, it is about a 25 minutes\u2019 walk or so from the hotel (or 2 MTR stations away from Jordan). We had booked a Nathan Room and were given a corner unit just a couple of doors away from the Nathan Lounge. As such, we popped over to the Nathan Lounge quite frequently for the yummy canned juices, pastries and espresso. There is a variety of reading material in the lounge as well as two computer terminals for use. Besides the use of the lounge, another privilege of booking a Nathan Room was the free daily breakfast. Although not particularly spectacular, the breakfast spread was decent and the dishes do get updated daily. The hotel room itself was cozy and well-furnished. Sound-proofing was good and street-noise was non-existent even though we were directly overlooking the busy Nathan Road. The bathroom though, was a tad small. The shower stall was however very well constructed and no water seepage to the outside sink area occurred no matter how merrily I splashed about in the shower. ;) There was also more than sufficient shelf space in the shower stall for toiletries. All in all, it was an extremely good stay and I will not hesitate recommending the hotel to anyone. Besides the points mentioned above, the staff of the Nathan Hotel are also amongst the most polite I have encountered in HK hotels. Staff members will often rush to open the lobby glass doors for you with a smile.

We booked a rather large room with breakfast each morning. The room was a triangular shaped and was a little suffocating at times however the room was still very nice none the less. The morning however brought noise and annoyances from 7:00am which drove me absolutely crazy. We also experienced quite a lot of attitude from the breakfast staff which was very unusual. I had asked the waiter for some cutterly as the items that I was given were dirty. The waited proceeded to throw the cutterly on the table in a rude manner. I then decided to speak to the hotel management about the noise and the abrupt behavior. The hotel manager very quickly apologized to us and offered us a Nathan Hotel Suite which was around the size of a small apartment which contained two large LCD television screens and a huge bathroom. The hotel staff were very keen to assist us and were very apologetic in trying to appease our concerns. The breakfast was very good, there was an assortment of all cuisines catering to different backgrounds. The location is excellent very central to Nathan Road and Hong Kong Island itself. The only downside to this hotel is that it has no pool and the views from each room are below par, however the roof top bar and the rather large rooms more than compensate for these negative points.

My husband and I booked a Nathan Room for 3 nights in March 2011 based on TA reviews and we were very impressed with the hotel. Our room was at the end of the hall on Floor 12 and it was a pretty decent size for a HK hotel. We only shared one wall with the neighbors and it's nice that the walls are thick and we didn't hear them at all. The decoration was chic and modern, and the huge 65in flat screen TV was a nice touch. The bedding was just as soft as the sheets I use at home, and I use 400-450 thread count. The bed was a little too hard for me, but the husband slept just fine. You could also order different kinds of pillows for your stay. The bathroom was small (shower only, no tub) but very well-designed and had all the amenities you could ever want. The robes and slippers they provided were very comfortable. The gym is located on the 6th floor and only has 4 machines and some free weights. However, there's a punching bag and gloves that the husband was very happy with. The massage chair costs 5 HKD for 15 minute and since we didn't have exact change, we didn't try it. The Nathan lounge is located on the 9th floor and it's quite small. It's really only consisted of 3 small areas, one with 2 computers, one with a comfy chair, and another section where the drinks are and some chairs. They have a coffee/espresso machine, tea, some cookies, and 3 types of canned juice (pineapple, grapefruit and I think apple). There's a note on the juice bar that asks you not to take the juice out of the Nathan Lounge, and that if you do, you will be charged 10 HKD for each can. There's no bottle water, but you can get hot water from the coffee machine. Breakfast at the 15th floor could use some work. The eggs chef is pretty good and can make you omelets or any eggs to your order, but the rest of the selection is pretty weak. I would only eat breakfast there if it came with the room. Location is fantastic. We took the A21 bus from the airport (33 HKD one way, or 55 HKD round trip), and we were dropped off half a block away from the hotel. The Jordan MTR is 4 blocks away and about a 5 minute walk, and Temple Street Market is pretty much across the street (I can see it from our room). There are various buses either half a block or 1.5 blocks down Nathan Road: 2, 6, 6A take you to Star Ferry, and 35, 41 take you to the History Museum. Check out the routes before heading out to avoid confusion: http://www.kmb.hk/en/ and http://www.nwstbus.com.hk/home/ Check in/check out was fast. We wanted to use the fridge to store our own drinks so we asked them to clear out the mini bar. Both elevators were working during our stay but the system isn't the smartest. I can see the wait being long if one of them was down. We tried using the stairs, but it was dark and seemed to be only used for emergencies. The blinking lights in the elevator were annoying. The wireless internet did not work during our stay and we had to use the ethernet cable. It was down briefly but after a call to the front desk, they fixed it in 40 minutes. We had a late flight and the hotel accommodated our request for a late check out. They also held our bags after check out, and when we came back at 8pm, they gave us the gym key so that we could use the shower and repack. That was very nice.

We arrived at HK airport and got on the A21 Airport Bus, which was HK$33 each and dropped us off just near the hotel. The tourist information desk was most helpful with any enquiries we had. Upon arrival, all the staff were really friendly and helpful.

The room was nicely appointed, everything clean and tidy, it was big enough for a couple of nights, but I think we would have struggled a little if we were stopping longer due to there being no where to store our suitcases. The bathroom was a nice size, with a good shower. The bed was comfy and there was a large LCD TV with plenty of channels. The room had free WiFi which was really good as we had a laptop with us. We only visited the Nathan Lounge once, there were a couple of computers but it was much smaller than it looks on the website, as we had WiFi in the room we didn\u2019t need the free internet access in there either. Breakfast was included in our deal, we only had breakfast once as we were away too early on our last day. The breakfast was a buffet, there was a selection of hot and cold food, it was OK, neither great nor rubbish. The only real problem with the hotel was the lifts, there were only two and one of them was out of order for our whole stay, which meant waiting for what seemed like an age as they travelled up and down! The hotel is well placed to visit all the touristy sites, Temple Street Market just over the road, and an easy 30 minute walk down Nathan Road to get toward the ferries to get to Hong Kong Island, or a cheap taxi ride.

The room itself was excellent - spacious and clean - although the bathroom was small and the shower only adequate. The walls were very thin, as we found out when a loud family with excessively boisterous children (who delighted in throwing themselves off the walls and conjoinging door ) moved into the adjacent room. Still, we weren't too concerned as we were out most days. On the other hand, we were greatly frustrated by the elevator situation in the hotel. They only have two elevators, but during our stay only one was in service...for the entire hotel. We spent nearly as much time standing around in lobbies waiting for the elevator as we did in our room. And when the overworked elevator eventually did arrive, it was inevitably packed full, very hot and stuffy, and smelling suspiciously as if it was overheating from the continued exertion. We asked the desk staff politely when the second elevator would be fixed, and were told by the unhelpful female staff member it would be on Thursday, and yes, we could use the service elevator if we had to. Needless to say, Thursday came and went without any developments and when we left on the Friday afternoon, there was still only one elevator slaving away. The service elevator option was somewhat helpful, but cramming into a dodgy old lift with trolleys full of dirty dishes and laundry wasn't exactly the image we had of our hotel stay in HK. On the subect of staff, the concierge, bell hops and doorman were all very helpful and polite. Thank you in particular to Leo. Unfortunately the same couldn't be said for the female desk clerks - they were brusque, unhelpful and borderline rude. Some training in customer service skills wouldn't go amiss. Other amenities - the Nathan Lounge was handy, the gym was small and musty, and the Bali bar was good value with 2 for 1 drinks. Finally - the buffet breakfast. On the positive side, there was plenty of food and the service was okay. On the downside....the choice of breakfast food was one of the strangest we've ever seen. Mashed potatoes, green beans and zucchini, tuna pasta mornay, blue cheese....some very strange options. Still, the food was plentiful and more than adequate, once we got past the unusual options. In summary, if you're thinking of booking at the Nathan, check if both elevators are working otherwise you'll be very frustrated at the amount of time you'll spend hanging around waiting. Don't be surprised by the lack of friendliness from the female desk staff. And be prepared for some adventurous breakfast options.

The restaurant that they use for breakfast gets very crowded at peak times, but given that I was enjoying the comforts of a nice suite for the price of a promo package, I shouldn't complain! One good point about the Nathan Hotel that I didn't realise when I booked it is that there is a bus stop for the shuttle bus to the Kowloon Airport Express station just 50 metres from the entrance in Pak Hoi Street. I didn't realise that the hotel was on that route because I think the stop is labeled as the Eaton Hotel (which is opposite). So that makes getting from the airport very cost effective and convenient.

I had been mentally preparing myself for small Executive room (we are in Hong Kong) and was pleasantly surprised when the hotel upgraded us to their Nathan Floor Room when we checked in. They had recently renovated the hotel and the Nathan Floor is one of the areas that was revamped. I must say they did a nice job as the room floor was cozy and warm, yet trendy. The same design theme extends into their rooms as well. It was small, but with a creative mind, they managed to fit a lot of amenities inside without the room feeling cramped. Although, I did find the bathroom a little tight, but that is easily overlooked since I don't spend a whole lotta time there. The check-in was quick and painless, and most of the staff are friendly and eager to help. For a small room, it is very well appointed. The queen bed was comfortable and they have really soft, fluffy pillows. You're also given a menu to choose the pillow you want! The large LCD TV is more than adequate and a 2.1 channel sound system with DVD player is provided as well. If you prefer your own music, there is an audio jack for you to hook up your MP3 player to the sound system. Do you really want to leave the room? Personally, I think the best thing about this hotel is the location. It is situated along Nathan Road, close to big shopping malls and a myriad of restaurants. The MTR station is barely 3 mins walk away, the airport Citybus A21 (from airport to Nathan Hotel)stops right in front of the hotel, and the K1 (complimentary Airport Express bus which picks up passengers taking the Airport Express train) stops right beside the hotel as well. This is really fuss-free travelling if you ask me! Don't fret if you're thinking of getting a room without breakfast, there are plenty of options available just round the corner. The Tsui Wah Restaurant a few doors to the right of the hotel serves decent meals or you can also try the Nathan Congee and Noodle restaurant, which is located 2 streets away along Saigon Street. Their congee is delicious! You can generally get a nice hearty breakfast at about US$2-4 at such places. If you're too lazy to walk, there's always Starbucks right at the hotel lobby.

Travelling with 3 kids, aged 10-18, was not always easy, but the staff at the Nathan Hotel went out of their way to make our five nights there, one of the most memorable experiences of our 6 week holiday. We were given adjoining rooms, which gave us all enough space and the necessary distance as well. The rooms are spacious, quiet and kept immaculately clean. There was no outside noise at all. The view of Nathan Road is nothing spectacular, but the proximity to the street markets and public transport more than make up for that. The kids loved the gym on the 6th floor, but note that there is no pool. Prior to arrival we thought this might be a concern, but there is more than enough to keep all occupied in HK. Within a minute the obliging doorman will hail a taxi for you to get to the dock for a fare of HKD25. A Star Ferry ride for a family of five to Hong Kong Island was about HKD12 - incredible value. A taxi ride to the Ladies and Electronics Markets, costs between HK20-25, depending on the traffic. We highly recommend the Night Market on Temple Street, only two blocks from The Nathan. There the intrepid explorer will unearth a bargain at every street stall. The Night Market stretches for 5 city blocks and will easily tie up the die hard shopper for hours - at least until midnight when the vendors shut down for the night. The Jade Market is a short step further along, but closes at 6pm. Jordan Station is five minutes walk away along Nathan Road, which gave us ready access to the rest of this stunning city. The rail network in HK is unbelievably efficient and modern. The people of HK are incredibly polite and generous. The staff at the Nathan were no exception. The level of personal service was extraordinary. Even the doorman went out of his way to help us with our inquiries about transport and tourist destinations. On our last day they happily bundled our luggage for us in the lobby while we went off for a last shopping excursion prior to our airport transfer. We prearranged airport transfers with the Nathan Hotel because we were newbies to the locale and had a large amount of luggage and kids in tow. The driver was brilliant. He was justly proud of his city and very happy to answer our questions as we drove along. At HKD450 per transfer it's not cheap. Now that we know how good the public transport is, next time I'd opt for that. Catch the train to Jordan Station and walk the two blocks to the Nathan. Contrary to another reviewer, We loved the buffet breakfasts. There was some variety each day, sufficient to placate our temperamental, diet faddish 18 yr old.

The biggest complaint we have is that during our 5 days there, there was only 1 functioning elevator - the other was broken and we never saw any repair people even attempt to fix it. Therefore, there was always a line in the lobby for the elevator and you had to wait quite some time. Also, in the only working elevator, there was some video adversement that was not working properly and would therefore give the effects of strobe lights the entire ride - very weird.

What seems interesting for me is seeing the variation of critiques from different guests regarding the rooms. Let's clear some things up, as I understand them. Firstly, you get what you pay for, By that I mean that they have a range of rooms from their \"economy\" rooms (which I have NEVER used...) to their so-called Nathan Rooms. I always stay in a Nathan Room, or their so-called Nathan Grand Rooms. These are an excellent size, fully equiped including a large plasma TV, free internet connection, good size bathroom, and a very large in-room safe capable of holding several laptop computers. All \"Nathan\" rooms include breakfaast which is a reasonably good buffet spread. I love this hotel, having stayed at a number of similar-standard hotels in Hong Kong, but always keep coming bak to the Nathan Hotel. I have always found staff to be friendly and cooperative and efficient, rooms clean etc. It's located about 5 minutes walk north of the Jordan MTR metro station. A mandatory Hong Kong visitor requirement is to have an Octopus smartcard. These are AMAZING, and means you can get by with almost no cash in your pocket. Strongly recommended and VERY useful. Finally, back to the Nathan Hotel for a moment, about the only \"odd> thing about this hotel is that the elevators do not go to the top floor where the restaurant is located. You need to take the elevator to it's top location (14th floor, I think it is...) then take the stairs to another level for the restaurant.

Staff where very helpful with whatever I needed from places to shop or tours, only two downsides of the hotel was: the elevators are slow, as there is only two elveators you can be waiting a little for the lift to arrive & the second downside was the breakfast which I thought was very average if you have to pay for it its not worth the 98hkd they are charging, but if you book the hotel through sites like www.expedia.com.au you will likely get breakfast free in the hotel package.

I found the Nathan to be excellent value. The simple rooms were of high quality and were quiet and comfortable. The bathrooms were clean and adequate. The housekeeping was efficient and invisible. However having been informed that the room rate included breakfast, an almighty fuss ensued when we took our places in the restaurant where we were told bluntly to pay or leave. I asked the restaurant manager to hold his fire while I went in search of the hotel duty manager who argued with me at first but after I informed him quite clearly that we had been told that breakfast was included in the price he apologized, went to the restaurant and directed the restaurant manager to stop making such a fuss, then came to our table and apologized again. By this time the other 15 or 20 people in the breakfast buffet were politely concentrating so hard on their food to try to ignore the fuss going on about them that it is a miracle they did not inhale quarts and quarts of congee porridge. This entire incident should never have occured, as should none of the others concerning the Nathan which are reported on this site. Needless to say we did not return to the breakfast buffet during the remainder of our stay, with the happy resultthat we discovered the Eaton Hotel breakfast buffet to which we will always return when staying at theNathan as it is cheaper and ten times better than the Nathan Hotel's buffet.

This includes free tea and coffee and the use of computers, (internet not always working and slow) books and magazines.

This was my first time in Hong Kong and on the advise of people that had already travelled to Hong Kong before I wanted to base myself in Nathan Road. I decided on the Nathan Hotel and I booked, though their website, a room on their newly renovated Nathan Floor at HK$900 per night (this would have converted to 70 euro at the time) I had also arranged my airport transfer with them prior to my departure costing HK$125 (10 euro) Checking in was straight forward and the staff at the front desk spoke and understood english perfectly. My room was a nice size. The bed was big and comfortable. There was a plasma screen TV mounted on the wall and also a DVD player. There was also a safe which you can set your own combination code for. I loved the bathroom. It was small but it was bright and clean with a really good shower. They also supplied a bathrobe and slippers. The weather was extremely hot while I was there and the air con in the room worked fine. I could not fault the room in any way. Breakfast was included in my rate and was a little disappointing. There was very little selection to choose from and the breakfast room was a little shabby compared to my bedroom although it did look like they were carrying out renovations on that floor so it may well be that the breakfast room has been renovated by now. But there are plenty other options for breakfast near the hotel and there is also a Starbucks located on the ground floor near the reception area and this always looked busy. I also had access to the Nathan Lounge which was located on my floor where there was free internet access, newspapers and self service tea and coffee. Access to this room was with your key card. This hotel is in a great location on the bustling Nathan Road. It was around a 15 minute walk to Kowloon Harbour and the Star Ferry and the Jordan MTR is very near. To me the Nathan Hotel represented excellent value for money in a great location. I found the staff to be helpful when I required any assistance.

Arrived about 8pm, check-in was very easy, staff was friendly and spoke fluent english. Was assigned room 1311 (Executive). Bellhop escorted us to our room and got us situated. This is when I noticed that the elevators are incredibly slow. When we finally made it to the 13th floor and into our room, I did notice right away that the room had a musty smell but figured that all rooms would, as Hong Kong is humid much of the year. Another thing I noticed right away was that there was ONE accessible plug in the ENTIRE room, under a flip-up lid on the desk. No outlet in the bathroom. So to use my electric razor, the desk in the main room is where I had to be. The room was surprisingly quiet. In fact, our room on the 13th floor of the Nathan was quieter than our room on the 26th floor of another hotel we had previously stayed at in San Francisco a few days before our arrival in Hong Kong. The street noise below was not that noticeable at the Nathan, which, for anyone that's stayed along Nathan Road, is a good thing! On the 3rd night, we encountered a problem with our bedside master control panel (controls the lights, a/c, dnd and make-up room signals). For some reason, the panel was unresponsive; the lights would not go on and the a/c was \"stuck\" in the on position - could not adjust the temperature. I called down to the front desk to report it and they said they'd send someone. One hour later, no one had arrived to check it (and we were still freezing from the a/c being \"stuck\" in the on position) so I walked down to the front desk and told them about my call one hour earlier. I then gave them two choices - they could send someone to our room immediately to fix the problem, or move us to a different room, immediately. David at the front desk said for me to go back to the room and if I was still having a problem he'd move us. I went back to the room and tried the control panel again - still unresponsive. I called down to the desk to speak to him and he told us to pack our things and he'd move us to another room. Literally one minute later there was a knock at the door and it was a repair technician. He came in and got into the closet, turned off the master control switch for 10 seconds and then turned it back on. That solved the problem. He left and I quickly called down to speak with David to let him know the problem had been fixed. He insisted on still moving us to a different room for our inconvenience and said he'd personally be up to escort us to the new room. About three minutes later he rang the doorbell and wheeled our luggage out of the room, moving us to room 1211, which appeared to be a Nathan room, even though it wasn't on the 9th floor as the others are (decor was different, TV was a flat panel, more amenities in the room, larger shower, a large desk area, lots of wood paneling walls, upgraded linens). It was a very nice, very much appreciated gesture on their part to rectify the problem. And in David's words, \"the problem we encountered with the original room did not meet the expectations we had of the hotel\". Moving to the upgraded room really helped to make our last two nights very comfortable. The location was great, just a 5 minute walk to the Jordan MTR Station and less than a 5 minute walk to the Temple Street Night Market. Although Nathan Road is a very busy location, it's a wonderful area to immerse yourself into the bustling city, if that's what you like. The Nathan Hotel also has a free shuttle each morning at 9:00 and 9:30 to the Tsim Sha Tsui Star Ferry terminal. We frequented the Starbucks a few mornings as well, very convenient to have that connected to the lobby. We did not check out the restaurant or bar, nor did we use their internet service which would have cost us HK$50 for one hour. We did, however, purchase two Hong Kong Disneyland tickets at their tour desk which was a very nice convenience. They tried to sell us a \"package\" that would include our transportation to the park, however we declined that and just purchased the ticket. The Disneyland ticket was HK$295 each and the transportation would have bumped that up to close to HK$500 each. How they consider that a good value is perplexing, since you can ride the MTR to Disneyland for about HK$16 each, each way. To sum it up, the Nathan Hotel is a friendly hotel providing good value in a great location. Some of the little touches were nice, like the hotel staff that opened the door for us each time we came in our out and the complimentary bottled water in the room. I would probably stay here again, but would likely pay a little more for the Nathan Room to ensure a more comfortable stay.", "Date": "March 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth", "Title": "\u201cGood clean room but lacking some amenities\u201d", "Author": "oldshepp", "ReviewID": "UR26584234", "Content": "Good clean room .Bed was huge but the room was small by Australian standards.

We had chosen the Nathan Hotel as it is located in the cheaper Kowloon area compared to the more expensive Hong Kong Island. Kowloon is a great area, its absolutely buzzing with activity and is lit up in so much Neon during the night its a wonder anyone can get to sleep! By staying in Kowloon it also gave us an opportunity to see a more realistic version of Hong Kong life compared to all the financial and tourist driven environment in Hong Kong Island. The hotel itself is a wonderful place to stay, its modern, clean, full of friendly and helpful staff, and provides great chinese food for both breakfast, lunch,and dinner...although you have to pay extra if you want the latter two meals. There is also a great rooftop bar which has a happy hour each night. It was never really busy in there but was a nice way to end a day of sight seeing. The hotel is located on the busy Nathan Road which leads all the way down to the harbour. Its about a 30minute walk which can sap the life out of you in the midday heat but its still worth doing to see all the hustle and bustle of Kowloon. If you arent the walking type then there is a metro stop 5mins from the hotel which will take you anywhere you need to go in Kowloon and across into Hong Kong Island. As for Hong Kong itself....WOW! I loved it over there, so much to do and see...especially if you like eating and shopping! The view from the peak is amazing and is well worth the visit during the day and night. If you like a night out then you are spoilt for choice, especially in the soho district and Lan Kwai Fong....one tip, if you want greasy burgers/pizza/hot dog/kebabs then go to the 'Cul de Sac' which is down a side alley off Lan Kwai Fong, that place served me well on a night out! For places to visit outside of Hong Kong i recommend going to the Ocean Park theme park located on the other side of HK Island, and visit the giant Bhudda in Lantau.

We booked the summer executive room promotion so we got free internet access in our room and late check-out until 2pm which was great! We took A21 bus from the airport and it took us about 30-45 min to get to the hotel and the bus stop is just right there in front of our hotel. (If you will stay at this hotel, I would recommend you to go by bus than by MTR since you will have to carry your luggage up and down the stairs and walk to the hotel.) Nathan Hotel is located in a good area, it took us only 3-5 min. walk from the hotel to Jordan MTR Station which is only 2 blocks away. You can also walk from the hotel to Tsim Sha Tsui, Harbour City, Victoria Harbour and Mong Kok and you will find lots of shopping places on the way there. The night market is on the other side of the road, just cross the road and you will find it along with many good eating places. Well, it was our first time at this hotel and we found it a very nice place to be in HK. The room has a good size for HK hotels, it\u2019s a lot bigger than other hotels I have stayed before. We had plenty of space to lay our luggages and our shopping bags. The hotel is very clean, the bed was neatly made and the new fresh towels were replaced in the bathroom for us everyday. The wardrobe is well-designed so it doesn\u2019t fill up the room space. It has enough space and hangings for our clothes. Inside the wardrobe is a safe box which you can easily fix your own code, very convenient. On the bedside desk, you will find an electronic controller which you can easily control the air-condition\u2019s temperature and fan, all room lights, radio and TV. I have read from other reviews for Nathan Hotel that the room is dark but my girlfriend and I didn\u2019t find the same problem in our room. Our room had a stand light, a table light, two bed lights (left & right), a night light (a very soft light from the top of the bed) and a corridor light which could lighten up our room and gave enough light for the night time. The bathroom is again bigger than other hotels I have stayed before. You will have a large wash basin counter, surely enough for all your toiletries. You will also be daily provided toilet amenities; toothbrush & toothpaste, soap, comb, shower cap, cotton buds, shower gel, shampoo & conditioner and body lotion. Well, if you decide to stay at Nathan Hotel, don\u2019t forget to visit the Bali Bar on the top floor. It can help you cool down after your long day shopping. The bar serves all types of beverages with the nice sweet music and cool air. One more tip: buy OCTOPUS Card before you leave the airport. You can use this card to pay for bus fee, tram fee, The Peak Tram fee (don\u2019t have to queue up and wait to buy the ticket) and many other places do accept this card as well. It\u2019s very convenient and no need to use cash.

We arrived at the hotel from the airport on the A21 bus, which was cheap and straightforward. It stopped approximately 50 yards from the Hotel entrance, which is slightly off Nathan Road. The lobby was very impressive and both reception staff and bell boys were very helpful. We were advised we were being given rooms with an interconnecting door which they would open for us if we wished. On arrival at the rooms, we were pleasantly surprised at both the size and the decor of the rooms. They were very clean, very spacious and had extra touches such as slippers and nice toiletries. The rooms we were in 1006/1007 looked like they had been newly refurbished. There was no noise at night and the beds were very comfortable. The Hotel Bar - The Bali Bar is on the roof and was very impressive. It was very well decorated and was quiet when we were there for happy hour. We had a look at the Hotel restaurant, which looked lovely but had quite a limited menu and was no use for our fussy Mum. We booked two tours through the hotel travel desk, a full day Po Lin Monastery and Big Buddah tour and a half day city tour. Both were an excellent way of seeing Hong Kong when you are on a tight time schedule. We visited the night market and Ladies market which were both excellent and bargains were there to be had!

But once I went to hong kong and checked in to this hotel, i used the tap water to boil water daily to make tea. My girlfriend's parents thought it was okay. On the 4th day, I opened the boiling water pot and noticed it was all rusted inside. DISGUSTING. I took 2 pictures for you all to see. I suspected this is what caused my stomach to ache, but of course, could have been the tap water also. Nonetheless, this is a serious flaw in that the housekeeper should have known and/or caught it. Cause she did emptied the water pot daily and washed the tea cups. So my tip: please check out the coffee/water pot pot before you use it. Wash, rinse it, boil water in it a couple of times before using and most importantly, check for rust, contamination, or skip entirely and drink something from a bottle.

Located in a bustling area in Kowloon where wondrous shopping opportunities abound, the Nathan Hotel has not only withstood the test of time, but also proven itself to be a solid contender in an area where \"hotels\" aren't exactly up to snuff by Western standards. We've stayed here twice, actually. Our first room was a standard 2 (twin-sized) bed room. No real frills, but it was very clean and like most Chinese hotels, slippers, toothbrushes, cheap shoe shine kits, and the like were also provided. Unlike some other hotels in HK, the room was not a sardine can. There was also a minifridge, that like most minifridges, if you consume anything from it, you're going to pay a premium. Go pick up some drinks outside at 7-11 and stock it yourself. The second stay we had was in an upgraded 2 bed room that we received as a free upgrade. The room had a sitting area with a loveseat and a chair. It also had a 2nd TV and a hanging rack for clothes. A nice touch, however do note that there is no iron in the room so either bring your own or pick up one for cheap at a local store. The front desk staff was very young, but attentive and helpful in helping us locate particular areas of interest. Internet access is available via a couple of computers on the ground floor with a pricetag of 50 HKD for 1 hour access.

I set up a corporate account with these guys, and I can't imagine putting my 300lb boss in one of these phone booth size rooms. Looked like it had been recently refurbished, and the staff was very attentive. Had 2 bad meals in the restaraunt, I would not recommend eating there. Very poor service for both dinner and breakfast, and really bad steak at dinner. if I stayed again, I'd go out. I won't say don't stay here, as the room was very nice aside from the size, but know what you're getting before you book.", "Date": "March 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alaska, Oregon, China", "Title": "\u201cRoom almost the size of my Walkin Closet !\u201d", "Author": "arcticnite", "ReviewID": "UR4607352", "Content": "Be careful with this hotel. Location is good on Nathan Road, but you can be booked into a room almost the size of my 'walkin' closet ! There appear to be two wings; a 5 floor section and a larger 15 floor tower. I was in the 5 floor section. The larger tower may not have received the recent million dollar remodeling; as the front desk indicated these were the 'standard' rooms. Usually stay at the Shangri-La, but recenty my visits have only been for 12 hours, so am looking for an affordable alternative to the fabulous Shangri-La. This is not it. I booked thru Expedia's Asia partner...eLong. They promoted a Deluxe Room for about $100. The room turned out to be exceedingly small. Alright for one person; two people would be stepping on each other. The marketing is deceptive; which resulted in my poor rating. When I questioned the front desk they said it was a 'Deluxe' room. I was skeptical. The Floor diagram (Fire Escape information) shows a couple of these rooms in the 20sq meter range, the rest on the floor appear to be in the 30+sq meter range. Appears they save the small rooms for Internet reservations. I would expect more of these rooms on each floor. The room was recently remodled and the furnishings, carpet and bathroom are quite nice. Coffee service in room and a limited mini bar with a beer and soft drinks. Nice high tech control box next to bed which allows you to monitor and control everything from lights to air conditioning. The lobby of the hotel is sparce and small. No reason to lounge around. Its either to your room or on the street. Starbucks is attached, so coffee is a snap, athough they don't open until 7:30am. There is no CNN; only CNBC and Bloomberg Financial english channels. Room service is avaiable from 7am until 11 pm. The restaurant is located on the 15th floor.", "Date": "March 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cGreat location - ok room\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4352705", "Content": "The Nathan is right off of Nathan - the main street in Hong Kong.

The rooms are circa 1970 - especially the hairdryers! The beds are comfortable though and there was enough space to open 2 bags and still walk around. The staff were very helpful and friendly.
