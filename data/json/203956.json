{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Just lovely! Our family (two parents and two college-aged children) just returned from a trip to Italy. Our daughter finished a semester studying in Florence and we met her there to begin our trip. We stayed 3 nights at the Hotel Principe where we were greeted warmly and made to feel at home right away.  Our rooms were lovely - one overlooking the charming garden and one with a balcony facing the river. Both bedrooms and the private bathrooms were clean and well decorated with nice touches such as a heated towel rack in the bathroom. Breakfast was a treat in the beautifully appointed dining room, with gracious service and a good selection of food on the buffet.  Any questions we had or requests we made were handled promptly and graciously. We left the Hotel Principe to travel through Italy, but returned at the end of our trip for 2 more nights. It was like coming home. Once again we were greeted with smiles and warmth.  On both of our stays we found the location to be very good. We walked to the Duomo and other important sites in the city, as well as sites along the river including the Ponte Vecchio and Oltrarno. We walked to everything including wonderful restaurants!  We highly recommend a stay at the Hotel Principe.", "Date": "Jan 2, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR200327575", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "tantetravels"}, {"Content": "I love Hotel Principe I recently spent some time in Florence on a vacation with friends.We stayed at Hotel Principe, as my good friend spends a lot of time in Italy on business and has always raved about this hotel.Needless to say , I was not at all disappointed. Not only was the staff and family absolutely charming and professional, but they upgraded our room , so we had a beautiful suite with a view of the river..... one of the best experiences I had in Italy to date !

I originally chose this hotel because it was closest to the American Counselate, and I was in a situation with a temporarily-lost family member. I am so glad It happened to be the one I found because I couldn't have found a better choice. All the staff went out of there way at every chance they had to help me. Especially the manager and the young man who worked at the front desk. It was like a home away from home, everyone was so very accomadating and wonderful. Not to mention the hotel is beautiful, like old-country Italy style. The view is right over the water with a nice balcony, a gorgeous sight with ducks and beavers swimming around. The housekeeping was very thorough, detail oriented, and so friendly. Breakfast was served in a beautiful antique inspired room, with white gloved coffee/ espresso service. The artwork, the old-fashioned furniture and decor was so beautiful. Set in a convenient location close to the strain station and nice restaurants, yet off the main streets to give it a more authentic old town experience. I plan to go back to this hotel when I visit Italy again. I definetely recommend this hotel if you find you're planning to visit Florence.", "Date": "Nov 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR986401271", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "tina1225"}, {"Content": "Great hotel We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights.Yhe atmosphere there is fantastic.

We opted for the larger room as they were the same price (the smaller room really was very small!!!). I was also allowed to use their computer to surf the internet for no charge (again, main stream hotels would charge for this privilege) .

Family run, well suitated in the city of Florence We were booked into the Hotel Principe by Airmiles and were so glad that they made this booking for us.

Firstly it was really good to stay in a small hotel owned by an Italian family rather than a large international hotel . The owners and staff went out of there way to make our stay a great experience. The hotel was friendly, very clean and comfortable. Florence is a buzzing typically noisy city, the hotel is nicely located on the River Arno and we can highly recommend the rooms overlooking the garden to the rear of the hotel which gave some degree of tranquillity from the city noises even with the windows open. Amenities such as rail and coach terminals, plus city centre and all facilities e.g. shopping, restaurants and sight seeing were all within walking distance.

Again, the staff is 5 star.Staying at this hotel, a traveler can experience what it was like in Florence in the 18th Century. Authentic period rooms, furnished with period pieces. Just what my husband and I wanted for our stay.Bathroom was magnificent, bigger than large, with luxury towels. Breakfast was wonderful having a continental breakfast that includes eggs if requested. The only drawback we found (not the hotel's fault) was the smoking. As this hotel is small, non-smoking floors don't exist. Guests should know ahead of time that the quests in the adjoining suite might smoke, and there is nothing that can be done, even if you requested a non-smoking room.Overall, a great experience.

The Hotel Principe, a four-star hotel that is family-owned and run, sits on the Arno River two bridges down from the Ponte Vecchio. It is a charming establishment with old world charm and grace. High ceilings, airy sitting rooms, fabulous straight-on river views, immaculate quarters, lovely private garden and scenery viewing deck on the roof combine to give the guest a sense of welcome security....a home to return to after a tiring day of trying to see all the amazing masterpieces in Firenze. Our room was very large and included a nicely furnished sitting area and wall hangings that are a signature of Tuscany. It had a large window that opened out on the Arno River with amazing views of Florence: the Ponte Vecchio to the left, the Pitti Palace and the Cahedral across the river (that we couldn't get into), the beautiful countryside in the distance on the right. The sunsets were wonderful. Breakfast was served in a beautiful dining room and every attempt was made by the staff to provide us with whatever we requested, such as eggs prepared to order. We received excellent suggestions for restaurants and tips for sightseeing from the staff. We found its location to be ideal, within walking distance of...well, everything! We were grateful that it was not situated on an inner-street for we found those to be dark and somewhat noisy. Our hotel is about a block away from the Grand Hotel Continental and the Westin-Excelsior and for less than half the price of staying in those hotels, we had a bigger room, the best view possible and a place that is molte familiare (forgive my spelling), classy with old world charm minus the ostentation of the nouveau poseur hotels.

This is the only reason I gave it a rating of 4 instead of 5.", "Date": "Jun 8, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR794680185", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "S.Cool"}, {"Content": "Il piacere dell'accoglienza   showReview(22241953, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR141163036", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "tatamilano"}, {"Content": "\u9288\u5e7f\u506a\u9289\u51a6\u5120\u9287\ue1bc\ue1f3\u8e47\u6ebf\u4f05\u93c8\u20ac\u6942\u6a38\u4ef9\u9287\u6b0d\u20ac?#x201d;   showReview(19172711, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR617896423", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "4\u9287\u3086\u69e6\u9287\ue1bc\u58ca\u9287\ue0a0\u5136\u9289\u7b3a\u5064\u9289\u5a3f\u5122\u9289?#x201d;   showReview(19169619, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR431273104", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Tr\u732bs bonne adresse bien...   showReview(11406245, 'full');", "Date": "May 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR622111597", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Il tiutotale \u732b persona molto...   showReview(11406246, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 4, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR451921108", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Das Hotel war eine gro\u813de...   showReview(11406247, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 28, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR418006006", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Decisamente positivo il...   showReview(11406248, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 24, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR194932480", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "La prossima volta che ritorner\u8c8c...   showReview(11406249, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 20, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR918420629", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Hotel tr\u732bs bien situ\u8305 et...   showReview(11406250, 'full');", "Date": "May 21, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR648714611", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d203956-r23211141-Principe_Hotel-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "203956", "Price": "$259"}}
