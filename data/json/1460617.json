Our standard apartment was nice and very warm and comfortable, nice kitchen, new carpets and new curtains which was a relief because of the review we had read on tripadvisor Kitchen was nice, they have a daily housekeeping service, we loved the location, Hyde Park is just across the street and metro station and bus services outside the door. We thought it was very good value for money, lift was small but we didn\u2019t mind, my sisters superior 3 bedroom Apartment had all refurbished very nice furniture and directly looking in to Hyde Park and the Lake. We liked our apartments and had a very good time staying there.

On the downside, the lift was not very big but this was not a major problem as the apartment itself was very nice and comfortable with facilites of a good standard. Our apartment was on the second floor, overlooking Hyde Park with a fantastic view of the Park and the lake. The master bedroom had an en-suite and there was a separate shower rooom as well as a good sized kitchen which was well equipped and clean. The service also included a maid who used to arrive daily to clean up. The apartment was situated in a convenient location as there was access to bus routes and the underground just opposite the building. Overall, we had a very pleasant stay in this apartment considering we had read some negative reviews. However, it was a nice apartment and we really enjoyed our stay. We will definitely be staying here again next time we visit. I have recommended it to all my family and friends who are planning to visit London.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "uae", "Title": "\u201cExcellend Location\u201d", "Author": "Hassan u", "ReviewID": "UR124213863", "Content": "The appartment was very clean, staff freindly and very close to Hydpark and underground.

Our apartment stank so badly of smoke that my 8 year old cried and didn't \"feel safe\". There was no hair dryer, the sink drain and remote control were broken, there was a body hair on our sheets. When we complained, the head cleaner was defensive (though they did address some of the problems).The following day, the cleaners were confrontational--we just wanted to relax and could have done without the drama.

It was nice having a large flat right at the top of Hyde Park and next to the Tube (which was closed almost every single weekend I stayed there! Very frustrating!!), but I don't think the apartment was anything to write home about. Two of the bedrooms were facing Lancaster Terrace and got all the noise from the street, but the back bedroom was quiet and stayed dark in the morning. The kitchen is more than adequate with all the appliances you could need, plus plates, pot/pans, silverware, etc. There was also a washer/dryer combo which took FOREVER, but better than nothing I suppose. The living room area was ok; had a flat screen tv on the wall, DVD player, two couches, coffee table, and a dining table with 4 chairs. The cleaning crew came three days during the week and always did a very thorough job. I did not find the front desk staff to be overly friendly, but it's not a hotel and they are not a concierge, so I won't give them too hard of a time on this review. A couple nights there were drunk people screaming in the hallways (knocked on my door one time) and the intercom system to the front entrance is annoying as people rang my room at random hours. I would recommend the Fountain House to all people in all situations, but it could be a good fit depending on your circumstances. The location is excellent. Hope the pictures give you a good idea of what the flat is reaally like.", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aussie", "Title": "\u201cGood Location\u201d", "Author": "SpitzieAussie", "ReviewID": "UR70416386", "Content": "Our stay at the Fountain House appears to mirror those of a number of other reviews I have read. We were traveling with two young children (8yrs & 4yrs) and therefore the location being so close to the park and also the tube station was great. The size was good and the bathroom and kitchen quite new. The carpet had a number of burns where someone had dropped an iron while doing their clothes, some curtains & blinds were broken and the couch had a lot of stains. This was not in itself terouble as we understand that you expect some of these things in an apartment used by numerous different people, but we did come back one day to find that the covers on the couch and cushions had been removed and replaced by sheets. I am guessing to have them cleaned, but they were gone for nearly three days and no one said a word to us. A lady did actually come in to check on the broken curtains and noticed that the couch covers were missing and said she would check into it. We never heard back and therefore I can't say the service was very good at all, but the cleaning was done once while we were there for 5 nights and was done very well. As our experience appears to mirror those of others who have placed reviews on 'Trip Advisor', I don't think anything is changing very quickly and therefore cannot recommend this apartment as I have previously done with others.", "Date": "July 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, decent value\u201d", "Author": "bluedog67", "ReviewID": "UR67007481", "Content": "This apartment is not a bad value for the price, relative to other London hotels/apartments.

However, the carpet and the couches were in VERY poor condition. The couches are literally threadbare. Very disappointing considering that we were told this was a refurbished apartment.

Before and after a Trafalgar Tour. It is in a central place with easy access to the subway which is across the road. Hyde Park is also across the road. There is a street with a few restaurants about a 5 minute walk behind the apartments, so in that way it was excellent. The first apartment we stayed in had a kettle that you had to hold onto the button for it to boil, it was on the fourth floor and lift broke while we were there and wouldn't stop on our floor, so when we had to leave we had to carry our suitcases down one floor to be able to get the lift. The lift is very small 4 people can squeeze into it just and it is very slow. The management is not very forthcoming with details ie when is the lift going to be fixed? Also the main shower leaked very badly. None of these things were fixed while we were there, this apartment was apparently refurbished! Our second stay was even worse. We booked these apartments through Loving London Apartments and on their website it clearly states that they book you into 1 of 6 apartments that are all of the same standard. When we arrived back at these apartments we found we had been booked into a non refurbished apartment and had to pay extra to stay in a refurbished apartment, which we did. This apartment was on the 6th floor which meant quite a few stairs or risk the lift. This apartment also had a leaking shower and every time you opened the dishwasher the kickboard on the kitchen fell down.", "Date": "June 25, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Fountain House Apartments", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d1460617-Reviews-Fountain_House_Apartments-London_England.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1, Lancaster terrace</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1460617", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/4a/b4/80/fountain-house-hyde-park.jpg"}}
