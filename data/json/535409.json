The hotel is modern and well presented and the reception staff were very pleasant and helpful. It is also well located, with the town centre only a short walk away. Secure parking is available within the hotel car park, albeit it is on a first come, first served basis. There is further unsecure parking in front of the hotel. Unfortunately, the hotel was very busy on the first evening of our stay, with many Christmas parties and this was to our detriment. We were allocated Room 1, which is located adjacent to the hotel entrance and we were disturbed until the early hours of the Sunday morning by smokers standing right outside the entrance (and our window) and revellers leaving. We booked a Heritage Break, which includes a 3 course dinner on Saturday night. Whilst the food looked the part, the taste really let it down. Would not dine in the restaurant again. We were also disappointed that breakfast the next morning was served on cold plates and the food was not hot. Having said this, our second night was much better and we slept well. Breakfast the next morning was only let down by the service, which was not great. We would stay at the Winchester Hotel again, but would request a room at the rear of the hotel and would definately eat out.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "west yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cModern hotel in fairly central location\u201d", "Author": "supersailor", "ReviewID": "UR118166732", "Content": "After a 5 1/2 hour car journey arrived at the hotel.

We ask for a restaurant recommendation but when we didn't let her make a reservation for us she became rude. After that almost anything I asked about I was told that she couldn't help me. Our room was very cold so we asked for heat but she told us if they gave us heat then the upstairs would get too hot. After much complaining the next day she finally turned on the heat for about an hour then shut it off again because people upstairs complained. The first night we had to take cold showers because the night clerk couldn't tell us how to operate the water temperature control. We had booked three nights but left after two because we couldn't take the cold cramped room or the lack of good service any more. They advertised free Wi Fi it didn't work.

The extra mattress that they put on the floor partially blocked the doorway to the bathroom. There was no a/c and we had to ask for a fan which (thank goodness) they had.

This is one of the cleanest hotel rooms I have stayed in, especially the bathroom. Very convenient to Victoria Station. We could walk there in three minutes and catch a train or the tube to almost anywhere. If you're flying into Gatwick, the Southern Rail train goes to Victoria for 10.90 pounds. There is a laundry less than two blocks away. We had a laptop with us. The wireless connection was erratic. At some times there were no issues at all. Later you would not be able to get any connection. If, like us, you are just wanting to check e-mail and upload some photos you can just try later. There was a safe in the closet that was big enough to hold my 15\" laptop. While we did not have problems with the stairs, some people might. The breakfast room is one level below ground. Our room was up one floor in the back, facing another street. On occasion there was some street noise but it was very infrequent and never bothered us. The room was bigger than I expected, but by US standards it is very small. In such a great city, we didn't spend much time in our room anyway! As a guest, the only control you have over the temperature of your room is by opening or closing a window. It wasn't a big issue for us, but could be a concern if you want the temperature just right. We were there in October and had no need of air conditioning. I would imagine that the hotel could get a little uncomfortable in the hottest weeks of the summer. Pros: great water pressure, comfortable bed, safe big enough to fit a laptop, cheap price for the location, breakfast. Cons: temperature control, wireless network connection.

The kids' tv didn't work and the hotel staff said they would fix it and never did. Our room was cold and when we called the front desk to see if the heat could be turned on nothing happened.

In the intimate theatre of accommodation it is always pleasing when a production works as well as it does here, I needed to catch a very early Gatwick Express and cast around in the Victoria area for an overnight stop. The Winchester is 5 minutes from the station rear entrance which gives on to the Gatwick Shuttle platforms. My rear top-floor ( fourth) room was small but nicely furnished - a small attic window gave an agreeable view of the roofs of Pimlico backed by the London Eye. Bathroom also small and needed attention behind the taps in the shower. But all cleverly squeezed into the space available. I had to leave before the \" Full English \" came on stream but there was no difficulty in obtaining from reception coffee, croissant & yoghourt and having it served to me there before I left. I could not trace on the internet sites I consulted any single rooms so was obliged to take a twin - perhaps the hotel could think about a rate for double room with single occupancy ?

The breakfast was good and the dining room cozy-- we got to talk to alot of the other guests. The shower had amazing water pressure and was as hot as we wanted, even on the top floor. The staff is incredibly accommodating and helpful. One issue for travellers that are not as spry as they once were: there is no elevator and stairs are required to get to the breakfast room and to nearly all of the rooms. Steep, narrow stairs. This is an old building, with all that goes with it.

Apparently the curtains here are made by the same lady who makes the curtains for buckingham palace! The room was chintzy and a bit old fashioned, but had a lovely comfy bed, was clean and well kept, and very 'english' (my first weekend away with a partner ever - it was just what we wanted!) The breakfast was great and was cooked by jimmy himself, who also went round offering baskets of muffins.
