{"Reviews": [{"Content": "lovely hostel We stayed four nights, in a mixed dorm. The hostel is well run and clean. The staff friendly and helpful. The doors to the dorm don't lock, but there are lockers for each bed. The location is great -right down the street from the Piazza des spiritu sanctu where we found great restaurants every night. The piazza also featured a large Sunday market and there were a few market stalls everyday with interest things to look at. Down the street is a very helpful green grocer, a good bakery and a good cheese and cold cuts shop. We walked everywhere and went back to the hostel at the end of the afternoon before going out in the evening.", "Date": "Jul 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR763975100", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "qcquebec"}, {"Content": "anywhere BUT HERE worst experience i've ever had at a hostel backpacking europe for 3 months!! if you like book camps w/ yelling nazis this is the place for you. they wake you up at 9:30AM, lock you out at 10:00AM and if you're still in bed they'll literally pull/throw you out (i made it 1/2 way across the room) and then kick you out w/o a refund. in addition they lock you out at 1:58AM, not the 2AM they advertise and then you have to sleep in the streets until they open up at 7 in the morn.avoid this place at all costs!!!", "Date": "Jun 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR900401144", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Mashimoto"}, {"Content": "Cheap and cheerful Cheap, easy access to florence town centre, just a 10 minute walk.

The location is central, close to the Arno in Oltrarno, so saved on transport.The good points are the hostel is very clean, with excellent showers, (for a hostel).There is a kitchen and equipment can be hired for free which keeps the budget down and there are cheap shops very near. However there is no fridge.The dorms are closed from 10 -2 but you can hang out in the living room, which by the way really needs a makeover.The negatives are, the dorm was rather cold, so a sleeping bag is recommended outside of Summer. The dorm I stayed in was large - 18 beds, so bring ear plugs and a sleeping mask to get a good night's sleep. I would definitely stay here again. What made it so good was the other backpackers were very friendly and I made some good friends while there. Hostelling is not about luxury, it is about the people you meet.", "Date": "Oct 27, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR971324411", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "MartinBrit"}, {"Content": "Friendly staff I have just return from a short trip to Florence, Italy. Ostello Santa Monaca was the possible solution for me, as I booked my accomodation on the very last minute over their internet portal. With a good city map, the place is quite easy to find, at Oltrarno, across the river from the city center. Staff is very friendly and (a rarity in Italy) everyone here seemed to speak fluent english and spanish. The accomodation itself is obviously not a five-star hotel, but for the price and the location is surely a very good deal. The bed-dorms are rather small and there is no air-conditioning, the toilets and showers were not very easy to find but were clean. There is a possibility to use internet for a small fee and a big kitchen and dining room. It is a great place if you're wishing to meet another travellers and the location is superb: very close to all the main sites of the city center and just a few hundred meters away from Santa Maria Novella train station. There is a bus stop almost next to the hostel door if you feel too lazy to walk, a few mini-markets and cafeterias around for a simple breakfast are very easy to find (everything seemed to be opened on Sundays).", "Date": "Aug 2, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR758606461", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "pjdsilva"}, {"Content": "Auberge basique   showReview(7550807, 'full');", "Date": "May 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR930048021", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Cathsoph"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d238741-r17625268-Santa_Monaca-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "238741", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
