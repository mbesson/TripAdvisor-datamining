A great, clean and friendly budget hotel!\u201d", "Author": "KNWalker", "ReviewID": "UR119670632", "Content": "After reading the latest review on the hotel I'd just booked for my first holiday with my boyfriend I was really worried what we had let ourselves in for and what to expect when we got there. My fears where eased straight away on arrival at the hotel as the staff where very helpful and friendly. We were offered a choice of twin or double room and where given a map of the area with details of the local metro system. Our room was basic but clean with a great view of the city and a great shower! Always a good feature! Breakfast was simple, a hot drink, a juice and a pastry but really nice for the price we paid. Although the area surrounding the hotel wasn't a tourist area is was by no means as bad as the previous review. The local station Legazpi, was a 5 min walk and is really easy and cheap to use, trains run every 3 mins throughout the day and 15 mins late evening. Although the city center was not walkable the metro got us everywhere we needed to go and strongly suggest a 10 trip ticket for less than 10euros is great value for money! I highly recommend this hotel to anyone on a budget city break in Madrid. I would book this hotel again.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cNightmare in Madrid ISIS !\u201d", "Author": "surjy", "ReviewID": "UR115576364", "Content": "My wife booked this - thinking it was similar to the Hotel Ibis. We arrived at the hotel. The little star(s) it had were falling off the building. Area - run down. Not a single foreigner in sight. Felt intimidated as the shops were dire, council flats in close proximity and no decent places to eat at. Reception - welcoming and nice. Room - awful! Stank of smoke. We ordered a double - but were given a twin room - not ideal for me and my wife! The bedding was stained. We were told a safe was available and working - but on arrival told it was not available! Where else could we store our safe belongings!!! There were little insects in the bathroom. We got no sleep at night as the other ppl staying in the hotel just kept making too much noise! You could hear other ppl watching TV, hear footsteps, hear bathroom/toilets being used - a real nightmare! The restaurant attached to the hotel looked ok. But food was aweful!!! The beer was the only thing worth having. 1 tube stop was hidden away in the little side streets, abot 5 mins walk. We walked there - but then safely walked back as the area is so run down! The other tube stop was 15 mins walk away! The hotel itself is miles away from the sights and delights of Madrid. We asked to be upgraded the following day to another room - but were refused. As a result we walked out and are awaiting our Travel Agent to retain refund.

The room was really clean with a large double bed and the bathroom was also really clean and spacious with a good shower. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is about 20 minutes on the bus from the city centre but the bus stop is just right outside the door of the hotel. Cost was 1 euro. Never waited for long for one to come along. The breakfast was just orange juice, coffee and a pastry but for the bargain price we paid that was not a problem.
