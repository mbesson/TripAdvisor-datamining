We were expecting basic style accommodation, we chose the location as we needed to be relatively close to Vision Eye Institute Hurstville Clinic as I had an early appointment for laser surgery for the following morning. The staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms older style, clean bed linen & towels, basic facilities and considering the highway location not too noisy. We were able to leave our car in their car-park for the day, reception arranged for a taxi.

We recently took a road trip to the Gold Coast and looked for cheap and cheerful accommodation along the way. This place was cheap but by no stretch of the imagination was it cheerful. I can only confirm what everyone else has said on this website and the words that spring to mind when I think of the Blakehurst Motor Inn are 's**t hole' (sorry, I don't normally swear but that just about sums it up). We have a 9month old son who we couldn't even put on the floor because it was so filthy. When my husband complained and asked if we could move to another room he was given keys to another room that was actually worse than the one we were in and all the lady on reception could say was \" well the hotel is quite old\". I don't understand how places like this are allowed to stay open, in my opinion it should be closed down!!!! We couldn't get out of there quick enough.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maitland, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFilthy and Disgusting!Can't beleive this place is allowed to stay open.\u201d", "Author": "niznikrose", "ReviewID": "UR113321842", "Content": "So filthy, we could not even think about sitting down on the lounge or taking off our shoes on the stained and filthy carpet.
