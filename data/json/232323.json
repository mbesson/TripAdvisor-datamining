I went to see the hotel before booking and i was pleasantly surprised. It is in the oud zuid district of Amsterdam which is the best area and where you oftern see several famous people drinking coffee locally! It is about 100m from the beautful Vondelpark, which is nice for walking in summer. The number 2 tram goes straight from central station to the tram stop at the end of the road and the hotel is just one stop on the tram to the Museumsplein (van gogh museum, rijksmuseum, concertgebouw etc). This hotel is perfect for couples/familys wanting to be in the centre of Amsterdam without being near the seedy red light district or near drunk and stoned tourists staggering home. The hotel itself is fine. Old 30's style decor, but the rooms are very warm (even when I visited in the snow and icey weather). The bathroom was a reasonable size with separate shower. My parents said that breakfast was fine, a lot of choice and was a decent start to the day and served between 7-10am. If you come in late you can make a cup of tea/coffee in the kitchen area without charge. The hotel has a small bar if you want a late night drink. The disadvantage is that there is a church opposite the hotel and the bells ring on the hour (and half hour) through the night, so if you are a light sleeper, try and get a room on the other side of the hotel or stay somewhere else. Another potential disadvantage (and something mentioned in several reviews) is that the breakfast does not run late at weekends, so if you are planning on hitting Amsterdam's vibrant party scene all night, then you may well miss breakfast! Also, I found that the family running the hotel are pleasant, the father seemed slightly grumpy, but the teenage children were very helpful. As somebody who lives in this country I was surprised with the negative reviews. Amsterdam is a capital city and if you want a modern hotel with modern decor, wifi and a pool in the centre of Amsterdam, then you have to be willing to pay for it. You get what you pay for with the Omega and if you want value then this is it.

The Omega hotel has a perfect balance. It's situated in a quiet residential area but there is a tram stop at the end of the road that goes past the city centre and straight to the railway station (No. 2 tram), or it's a fifteen minute walk to anywhere you may want to go. The museum district is a couple of minutes down the road and the park is a minute away. The hotel's location is a perfect balance. As for the rooms and service I was surprised how nice they are. simple, clean and comfy but with a worn old art deco style to the place. Nice breakfast, again simple but with some good variety. The staff that we dealt with were nice enough, but we didn't really need them much. If you want a nice play to stay, with a clean room and something to eat in the morning, for a very reasonable price. You won't do much better than this. If you want all the hotel trimmings and room service, pay for a large hotel, because you won't get that for this price. You pay for what you get. NB: It's only fair to mention the Church. Our room was on the fourth floor at the front, so as close to the bell tower as you can get. It rings out the hour during the day and evening, and one toll per half hour. It does stop during the night.

Just back yesterday. It is in a great location very close to the Museumplein (less than 10 mins). Tram into city centre to Centraal Station very close also (2-3 mins). I (female) travelled by myself and for the most part felt safe. The only thing I felt odd about the whole time I was in Amsterdam was that outside my bedroom window was a little ledge (like a balcony, but not a balcony) and also off this was a window into a room next door. I don't know if the other window belonged to a bedroom or some sort of service room but had I left my window open someone could have come from the room next door into mine. Amsterdam is experiencing a heatwave at the moment and without AC, even with the window open, it was incredibly hot and sticky in the room. My room had two beds and on the final night I changed beds in the middle of the night so sticky was it. Room was very small and would have been uncomfortable had someone been travelling with me. That said, it was clean and for the amount of time I spent in it, was fine. It cost me 65 per night but some websites were charging more. Ensuite was provided; fridge and safe in the room; breakfast included (although this seems to depend on the website you book through). Breakfast was fine - the usual fruit, cereal, bread, coffee etc and fry (although there never seemed to be any bacon). Traffic noise was non-existent at night as it is on quite a residential street. However, there is a church on the street whose clock sounds on the hour and half-hour (maybe all night?? It never actually woke me up but it would probably seriously annoy a light sleeper). There is a small but nice garden area off the bar for drinks in the evening. Encountered two receptionists - one grumpy, one nice. I don't ask for much but he could have said welcome to Amsterdam or hope you enjoyed your stay with us etc. There's a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 charge for paying by credit card. Would stay there again. Loved Amsterdam. Top tips: (1) buy your tickets for the Van Gogh Museum and the Rijksmuseum on the web before you go. Queues are hideous. I didn't go into the Anne Frank house but walked by mid-afternoon and the queue was really long (2) wear sensible shoes - trainers etc. Mine are in bits having spent a few days in flip flops. It is a great city for walking as it's so flat (3) get out of Amsterdam and go see Haarlem (4) if the weather is good go to the beach at Zaandvort. It's on the same line as Haarlem and Amsterdam-Zaandvort is only about 30 mins.

We are especially pleased with two things about the hotel: 1. They accepted our small two Bichon dogs and put us in a ground floor room where we could let them out on the terrace (not likely during the summer months, though). 2. The hotel is one block from a wonderful tram line stop Jacob Obersgraat, line 2 to Central Station. There is 1 stop to the Van Gogh Museum and 2 stops to the Rijksmuseum. Our room was small, has cable TV, a safe, an empty mini-bar where we kept some drinks. There is a small shower and adequate space for toiletries in the bathroom. The hairdryer is connected to the dresser drawer but there is no mirror near that spot. I warn Americans that suitcases can be a liability: travel light or stay in a larger hotel. The Omega has no internet connections in the rooms but for one euro per hr.you can use a desktop computer in the lobby. The PC has an English language keyboard. It works fitfully, but we did manage to get our email. There are only a few restaurants within walking distance but other shops existed: for example a tabac where the strippen karte ten-ride tram cards were sold. The best row of restaurants are along the st. facing the Concertgebouw only three blocks away. The Leidseplan (third stop from the hotel)has a plethora of eateries lining the sts. and is a center of activity in the evening. The staff friendliness and service were uneven--some clerks bent over backward, others were indifferent: the staff seemed to enjoy their work, performed any task asked of them, and refused tips. However, they were not terribly well informed about specific tourist questions (for example I asked one of the desk guys where I should go to see a major dept. store and he didn't really know). Breakfast was the usual: muesli to cheerios, breads, jams, butter, etc. A bowl of fruit cocktail was set out daily. Breakfast, served to 10 30am, included a hot section with ghastly scrambled eggs but good bacon and sausage. A limited selection of lunch meats and cheese slices rounded out the fare. Coffee, tea, hot choc. plentiful. Access (a concern to me) to the main reception was down four steps with a railing. Reception and breakfast rooms were a half story underground. The hotel is in a standard brick Amsterdam house. In the main building there is an elevator to the upper floors. Note that there is another attached house with hotel rooms: I did not notice if there was an elevator on that side, but the steps were a bit difficult to negotiate: I would not want to carry suitcases up the stairs on the far side of the DR.
