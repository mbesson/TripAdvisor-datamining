The reception staff were all very pleasant and spoke great English. Our room was huge and overlooked the canal which was lovely. We found the room extremely clean and despite another review saying it was noisy at night overlooking the canal we found it very quiet. The breakfast choice was huge cakes, eggs bacon, cheese meats fresh fruit lovely hot chocolate. The two staff serving at breakfast could not do enough to help they were brilliant. Location was great 3 mins from St Marks Square easy to find once you knew - the earlier directions given in another review were very accurate. The only thing that would have been nice was a busier bar area as we found it very quiet, only us there on both occasions we popped in but always open. The courtyard was really nice to sit in and watch the boats and gondalas go by. I would highly recommend the Dona Palace is you like small hotels with charm, friendly staff and want to be close to St Marks Square.

The staff is friendly and they bend over backwards to accommodate you. We were coming from Rome, by TrainItalia. So, we got off at the last station in Venice and took a vaporetto (you can take #1 or 2, but the #1) and get off at San Marcos-Zacaria (there are 2 stops called San Marcos). Upon getting off the boat, turn left and take the stairs. After the flight of stairs, turn in front of the church and go inside the alley. Turn right after the first store (I mean the store that is adjacent to \"Bar American\"). Follow that alley all the way, until you see an ATM machine of a bank branch. Take the turn on your left, in the narrow street, just before the bank branch and you'll see the sign that says Dona Palace. If you wait until you arrive to call the hotel for directions, you may get stuck listening to a recording. The person who is supposed to answer the phone is also the only person at the reception, i.e the one dealing with incoming guests, people leaving or going out and handing the keys, etc. So, more often than not. he/she will just let the phone ring and you risk hearing a femaile voice telling you repeatedly to press \"1\" for front desk, and getting the same voicemal again, when you do press \"1\".", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great breakfast\u201d", "Author": "kmbperdon", "ReviewID": "UR126155259", "Content": "We stayed here for one night in March 2012.

Maybe if you are in a room at the rear of the hotel, however we were in the front, along the street, and had to contend with listening to people talking in the street below, shopkeepers slamming their metal doors shut at night and then slamming them open in the morning, plus the bells of St. Marks go off long and loudly at 7:00 a.m. (I realize these sounds are no fault of the hotel - I am just saying that the windows are definitely not soundproof.)

Location: Dona Palace is located just a couple of streets behind San Mark's square. Though the square itself is packed with tourists, the little street Dona Palace is on is surprisingly quiet. One issue though - do not follow the Google Maps location for the hotel. See attached photo, the entrance of the hotel is located around the corner from where Google Maps puts you. Getting there: From Marco Polo airport, there's really two ways to get to Dona Palace and it depends on how rich you are. You can take a water taxi which costs about 90 euro and will take you 20 minutes. Or you can catch the Alilaguna (water bus) which costs 15 euro per person and takes 1 hr 15 mins. The water taxi can take up to 8 or 10 people so if you have a big group this might be worth it. The hotel has its own private dock from the canal so the water taxi can literally deliver you straight to your doorstep. The Alilaguna will drop you at San Marco which isn't far either, about 5 mins walk. Rooms: I was worried after reading some reviews about the rooms being small. We booked through eBookers so didn't get a choice of rooms (so I thought we'd get a small one) but ended up with a really spacious room with a private terrace overlooking the canal! The beds are huge, bathrooms are amazing. We had an in-room aircon but didn't need to use it as we could open windows to get the breezes. Staff: the staff at the front desk are super helpful and friendly. They all speak English. Breakfast: breakfast is included - bacon and scrambled eggs, cold meats, cheese, cereal, pastries and fruit and yoghurt. There are also two tables for breakfast on the terrace which is nice if you're lucky enough to get one! Murano Island: if you want to go to Murano, ask at the front desk about how to get there. They can organise a free trip there via water taxi - the only catch is that once you arrive at Murano you have to view a glass blowing demonstration at one particular factory. Good thing is that there is no obligation to buy anything. Otherwise getting to and from Murano costs 6.50 euro per person. You have to find your own way back in any case.

We enjoyed chatting with each day and night desk attendant, they were very helpful in recommendations, very pleasant. Our room was nice and spacious compared to most European rooms. We had 2 windows overlooking the courtyard, a little bit of the canal, yet it was super quiet- good quality glass on the windows. The beds/ bedding/ pillow were super comfortable. The bathroom had one of the best showers I have ever had, and an appreciative heated towel rack. We never heard a peep from our neighbors, I think the walls and ceiling are very solid. Breakfast was good, even after 6 times we never got bored, a decent selection of cereals, scrambled eggs, very good juices. I loved the beautiful high ceiling breakfast room. Accessability wise, there is an elevator, but a few steps up to the breakfast room. Most of this area has bridges to get anywhere of course. We did eat at the hotel restaurant once and as soon as we sat down we felt we were in a tourist trap. It is difficult to find a restaurant in the St. Mark's area that does not feel this way - I recommend eating dinner elsewhere in Venice, or for a quick Pizza and drinks, try the close by Planet Pizzaria!

Probably the best feature of the hotel is its close proximity to Plaza San Marco. It is literally 1 block away.

For wheelchair access, dock at the Hotel al Angelo, which is a sister property to Dona Palace--their front doors are just steps away from one another and they will handle your luggage transfer. The Angelo's dock is easier access for a wheelchair or if you can't climb steps. BTW, the wine bar at the Angelo is to DIE FOR! Fabulous food and even better service! If you dn't find what you want ont he menu, just ask. It's a Hell's Kitchen graduate, and was the BEST food on our entire trip! Bonus: The prices weren't extreme, either. Our room had plenty of space for the chair, the bathroom was enormous with a roll-in shower and dual rails for the toilet. We even had a small balcony (no chair access). Lots of closet space and very clean. Don't miss the continental breakfast on the 2nd floor! The room is ligh-filled and the food and service are excellent! The hotel offers a chair lift for those with limited mobility to be able to reach the breakfast room (the bar is also on this level). Tip: Call the front desk when you're ready to leave your toom and ask them to send someone to run the lift. It requires a key to operate it which is kept at the front desk. One of the best-kept secrets in all of venice is the first-floor courtyard on the canal. Cool and lovely--bring your camera for a never-ending parade of gondolas and taxis, a cup of coffee in the morning or a cocktail at the end of the day. Very private and rrestful! Just a short walk to St. Mark's, the Doge's Palace and the Bridge of Sighs (currently sporting a rather ugly advert sign). Be sure to take an evening stroll along the canal in front of the Doge's Palace and watch the gondolas bobbing in the moonlight--very lovely! This is an extremely old building that's been renovated, so some of the rooms are kinda funky in their layout, but they have high ceilings and lots of light.

I then contacted the hotel direct to arrange an upgrade to a suite (Room 12) at a reduced rate and to arrange for their 'Special Guest' Package (welcome drink, gift, biscuits and private taxi back to the airport). Prior to arrival the staff were extremely helpful by email and things boded well for the trip (our first to Venice). We used public transport to get to the hotel (San Marco Alilaguna stop) and after a shortish stroll through St Mark's, we found the hotel easily. We arrived about 9pm and were quickly checked in and shown to our suite. The Hotel. In a good location just off St Mark's Square and by the canal running up from the lagoon under the Bridge of Sighs. However, too close to the tourist traps (see below). The Room (12). Allegedly the best suite in the hotel. Clean, tidy and spacious bedroom with views overlooking the canal (and Bridge of sighs if you lean out!) and the hotel's courtyard. Bathroom fine, but nothing special and separate 'lounge' area, which was actually pretty useless with just a sofa in it. Breakfast. Part of the reason we booked the Dona Palace was for its inclusive full breakfast (unlike many other hotels). This was taken in the 2nd floor lounge and was excellent. Cold and hot buffet and possible to sit on the balcony overlooking the canal or in the air conditioned lounge. Sets you up well for the day, cutting down on the need for an expensive lunch! One drawback is that if you want breakfast in bed it is a 20 Euro (per person) room service charge! Service. The service in the hotel let it down. The hotel is part of a family of hotels and the main one appeared to be the hotel on the opposite side of the street (Di Angelo or something). This meant that there were limited public facilities and the hotel bar was not always open (not at all on the Mon of our stay), which is not good enough for a 4* hotel. Often staff were absent in the other hotel and even getting a cup of tea (at 5 Eruos!) was a chore mid afternoon. The hotel had also not arranged our pre-booked 'Special Guest' package and when I reminded them about our welcome drink (et al), the bar was closed! It was not disastrous, but we'd expected better. Restaurants. There is no restaurant in the hotel, but it has a deal on 3 local restaurants linked to the other hotel (a pizzeria, a standard restaurant and a swanky wine bar (HKs)). You get a 15% discount at these, but I would strongly recommend you don't use them! We tried Angelo's restaurant and even after the discount paid 120 Euros for a decidedly average meal. This was because the hotel and restaurants are just one street back from St Mark's. The second night we headed off the beaten track to a restaurant we found through Trip Advisor (Mascareta), which was half the price and 10 times as good (see separate review!). Departure. Checkout was 12pm and the hotel will look after your bags if you are leaving later. We left from the hotel courtyard on the private water taxi, which was excellent. A bit of weaving through the canals of Venice and then a blast across the lagoon to the airport (20mins in all). Overall. Although we expected Venice to be expensive, this hotel charged 4* rates for what was 3* service at best. You don't get any of the facilities of a modern 4* hotel either and we therefore felt a bit let down. However, it was in a great location, was comfortable and we still had a great trip to Venice once we escaped the main tourist traps.

The positive experience began even before we left Australia, as the contact at the hotel that I was making bookings with via the internet& email was very polite and thorough, and it was this level of efficiency that contributed to us making the decision to stay at the Hotel Dona Palace, as we had never stayed there before. Once we arrived in Venice we splurged on a water-taxi from the airport, and had a very romantic arrival at about 10.30pm, landing directly at the back entrance to the hotel (it has it's own mooring for taxis). Quick check-in, and the porter took us to our room, which was exquisite (from memory, room number 45?)! It was on the 4th floor with windows on three sides of the room. I was absolutely thrilled to find that when I leaned out of our window over the canal I could see the Bridge of Sighs (although sadly it was undergoing renovations and surrounded by scaffolding). We asked for a Junior Suite, and it was one of the biggest rooms we've ever had in a hotel, anywhere. Management had also arranged the chocolates and chilled wine that I requested, so everything about our check-in was perfect. With the windows and blinds closed, there was no sound from the alleyways below, although it was wonderful to open the canal windows in the late afternoons to hear the sound of singing gondoliers. It is literally a two minute walk to St Marks (ironically, it took us a couple of days to find the fastest route of all, but it was still taking less than 5 minutes going our 'long way'). And the immediate shopping area seems to have something for everyone (from traditional restaurants, to souvenir shops, to Venetian sweet stores to McDonalds!). The quality of the accommodation was great - the bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was terrific and there was lots of room for storage. The air-conditioner worked a treat as well, which we were grateful for in the heat of early August. Breakfast was included, and it was delicious. Served on the second floor in a beautiful, high-ceilinged room that had a balcony overlooking the canal, there was a selection available to suit most nations, and the quality of the food was first-rate.

We had just come from Amsterdam and Prague, where we stayed at two lovely hotels. Dona Palace was, to say the least,tremendously disappointing for the ranking it has been given and for the money that we paid for a junior suite. While the room itself was very nice - large, clean, etc. - the shower leaked into one part of the room and there was constant wetness, i.e., a puddle, on the carpet on that side of the room. We could have dealt with this if it was not for the noise and the heat. Venice was wall-to-wall tourists - and our hotel was located very close to San Marco Plaza, which should have been a plus. However, because of this, the noise from the tourists, the restaurants, the canals, and other commotion started at 9 AM and did not let up until 11:00 PM. If we shut the windows (which is what the hotel advised to keep out the noise), the temperature in the room soared to 80 degrees F - it was stifling, but quiet. If we opened the windows, we had a draft but could not sleep. However, hotel would not turn on the air conditioning. We spent two nights feeling either uncomfortably warm and unable to sleep, or disturbed by the noise and unable to sleep. Our room was also located by the hotel bar, so the loud music from that (although totally empty) was another disturbance, although reception did turn it off immediately when we asked if it could be turned down. At a room this expensive, all of this was just unacceptable. Breakfast was included in the price of the room. As I mentioned before, we had just spent time in two hotels in two different countries with large buffet breakfasts that were excellent. The breakfast at Dona Palace was horrible - the coffee was watered down and cold, the eggs may have been powdered, the yogurt was not that lovely Italian yogurt in glass containers, but a garden variety grocery story kind, cheese was in little foil packets, the bread was stale and the croissants certainly did not come from a bakery, and on and on and on. Above all, the total indifference of the front desk - with the exception of one person, who arranged for us to see a different room -was maddening. They were less than helpful when we asked what to do about the room on more than one occasion, and overall, we felt that the attitude was one of: \"Well, there are lots of tourists - we don't have time to please everyone.\" This was so different from the accommodations, concern, and friendliness that we received in the other two places that we were taken aback. We read TripAdvisor reviews all the time and our travel agent selected the hotel mostly based on the high ratings given Dona Palace. We usually think that those people who give low ratings to hotels are just \"whiny\" if all the other reviews are superior. This is the first time that we have written and now we see why. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone for any reason.

The pillows weren't very good, and the two pull-out couches were very uncomfortable. We had to ask for a second mattress for each pull-out just to get a good night's sleep. The rooms didn't have any furniture other than the bed, a small table with 2 chairs, and a desk with a chair. You would expect a suite to have more comfortable furniture for sitting and relaxing. We were more comfortable in other hotel suites and junior suites where we stayed during other parts of our trip. The rooms were not very well-lit. The bathrooms were fine. As we were warned by other reviews, the hotel really pushed their own restaurants. This was frustrating because we were there over New Years Eve and had hoped for some good recommendations for the holiday. The staff at the front desk was not helpful; they said we should walk around and see if we found anything appealing on our own. Even when we asked about restaurants we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d read about, they didn't have anything helpful to offer. They directed us to a very touristy dinner show and acted annoyed when we asked for advice. When we asked them to call to make reservations for restaurants we found on our own, on two occasions they forgot or just never did it. However, service outside of the front desk was very good. The buffet breakfast that was included with our rate was in a beautiful room. The one young woman who waited tables was very helpful and friendly. The breakfast spread was very adequate and tasty. The hotel was a little difficult to find, but when we arrived we called the front desk and they walked us through it step-by-step. Of course, if you don't have an international cell phone, this would be a problem. Once we arrived, the location was great. Very close to San Marco's square and the vaporetto stops, and in easy walking distance to other neighborhoods. The view of the canal out of our windows was beautiful, and we could even hear the gondoliers singing. It could get noisy, but shutters on the windows helped. Overall, the hotel was clean and in a great location. But at the rate of 580 euros per suite per night, it was lacking any extras and certainly had no examples of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153luxury.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We expected much more comfort and service at such a high rate.", "Date": "January 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huddersfield", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location\u201d", "Author": "Sar_hudds", "ReviewID": "UR12377901", "Content": "What a fantastic location!!

Going in November meant we could take advantage of the low season and get a good deal. We went for a canal facing suite which at 195 Euro wasn't the cheapest room we could get but were paying for extra luxury and we were very pleased with the room with three windows onto the canal, we were regularly treated to singing gondoliers going past. (only at sensible times though). The rooms were a nice temperature and it was lovely to have the extra sitting room to relax in. Breakfast was nice, although the cooked element wasn't brilliant but it isn't very italian thing to do. The rooms were clean and had lovely furniture in it. The staff were helpful and very attentive. They tried to go out of their ways with extra touches like a free welcome drink and leaving drink. The only downside was a slightly dodgy whirlpool bath. I had to get someone to show me how to work it which involved switching on the power at the circuit and then it kept coming on and off. It was funny though and very bubbly. Got the hotel taxi to the airport and absolutely loved leaving in style. Much more glamourous than the aliguna which we got on the way into Venice. It was 70 euro through the hotel which was a good saving. I loved Venice at the end of November, I've been at the end of October before and found November much more pleasant. It is much quieter, the queues for historic sights were smaller and actually non existant on the Monday. I'd recommend eating at the Alle Testierre if you like fish and Trattoria da Arturo (also listed as vina da arturo) if you want meat or vegetarian food.

I was sent a price list, but emailed prior to arrival again requesting the upgrade and said it would be worth it.

The bathroom - to reach the toilet we had to close the door to avoid injury, as the toilet was actually behind the door which swung open all on it's own. Our room was directly above the main door of the hotel. When we arrived I requested a room change immediately, but was told there was nothing available and to check again in the morning, so I did. I was told that this would cost 150 euros per night extra for each of the 2 nights. The staff checked I'd emailed and whilst they were apologetic, they did nothing to even change our room to another of the \"same\" standard. The other couple and their daughter who travelled with us also had a \"standard\" room - but this was on the fourth floor and was huge in comparison - fair dues, but the receptionist told me that theirs was the same standard as our room - it wasn't even in the same league!

Dona Palace, as we understand it, was once a residence for one of the Doges. It is right on the same canal which runs behind the Doge Palace. We had a side-view from our room onto the canal and a small bridge over the canal. When you step out of the hotel you are a stones-throw to Saint Mark's square and if you go the other way you will encounter several small bridges over a fork in the canals running behind the hotel. The breakfast room was also amazing, adding to that true Venice experience. It is probably in what was once the \"grand sal\" of what was once that Doge residence. The included breakfast was, in my opinion, of 4 star value, and in the afternoons it was possible to order a wine and sit on the balcony overlooking the canal underneath.

The only problem was finding the place initially. The street on which the hotel is on is not on any of the maps that I had sight of, however it was perversely quite easy to find. Just get off the vaparetto at St. Marks Square and walk in to the directly opposite corner, walking next to the palace patricale, then before you cross the bridge take the last left turn and if you head up that alley 50m, which then crosses another alley, then the Dona Palace is on the right hand side. It is much easier than it sounds and you will be grateful of its easy accessibility. Rialto Bridge is also within 3/5 mins walk, depending on your shop browsing! On the last night had one of the best meals ever at the Restaurante Antico Pignolo where Giovanni took extra special care of us. We arrived 5 mins early for our 8pm reservation, the table was not ready so we were asked to wait. Not really a problem, especially when we were given two glasses of champers each, then olives, then mozarella and tomatoes, then bread, then some wonderful risotto, by this stage we were thinking that we didn't need a meal. We were very pleased that we did though, superb melt in the mouth steak and sea bass, v. pricey, but so worth it!

We went for 3 nights from March 9th 2007, and the whole stay was fab. We had a standard double which was a reasonable size and nicely decorated, the only thing we found was it tended to get very hot in the room, which wasn't a huge problem as we opened the windows, although be aware of the mosquitoes. Also the room we stayed 34 is directly above the kitchen area so it can get a bit noisey round breakfast time, which can be a problem if you don't intend getting up so early or are a light sleeper. The staff were very nice and helpful, I wanted to surprise my boyfriend on his b'day with a champagne breakfast in bed, however my boyfriend is a coeliac so obviously can't have the usual breads and pastries etc. The staff were very friendly and accommodating and made sure his breakfast was gluten free, they were also very discrete about the surprise. The day after the surprise breakfast, when we went down for breakfast as normal the waiter bought out some gluten free crackers for him so they must have bought them esp after they found out he was a coeliac which I thought was very sweet. The hotel is 5 mins away from the st marks square and very conveniently located. For food we didn't go to any of the restaurants near the square, recommend walking a bit further away and going somewhere where the locals eat. We found our best meals were at the two places we went on our last two nights. One was an Oestria (family owned) and another modern restaurant. Both places had locals eating there and their menus were in Italian, no translated menus to attract tourists. The staff are more then happy to translate the menu for you, and these places were not as pricey as the other restaurants we came across near the square or the one we ate at on the first night which had average food but highly priced. Also to any other coeliacs out there worried about going to Venice, the food is not a problem. Restaurants know about the allergy and seem quite informed (the places we went to were). Alot of the tourist places do mainly pizza and pasta dishes but majority of restaurants do a fair bit of seafood and not as much pizza and pasta as you may expect. So food was never a problem for my boyfriend.", "Date": "March 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Isle of Man", "Title": "\u201cGreat All Rounder\u201d", "Author": "Cowley", "ReviewID": "UR6917330", "Content": "I was taking my Mother for her 80th Birthday, so needed a Hotel in a good central location.

When we got to Venice we found the right stand to get 'into town' after some confusion and it was raining. We had been advised the hotel was equidistant to Rialto and San Marco - we got off at Rialto but found it quite confusing to find the hotel. My advice is to get off at San Marco - longer on the boat but shorter on the legs! We had a standard room that was snug - the beds were singles (I had requested a twin room) but pushed together - we're good friends but not that good. There was some room to move them apart but not much. However the room was a minor niggle as we weren't in it much and actually paying for a basic room in a good hotel meant that we had the facilities that one would expect of a hotel with deluxe suites - the breakfast area and breakfast was excellent, as was the courtyard. Our room was very quiet. We would definitely go back. We ate at one of the affiliated hotel restaurants and would not recommend it - very ordinary and the discount still does not make it value for money. For other meals we followed recommendations in guide books and had great (if dear) food. I would recommend the Doges palace for a visit (beware we spend 5 hours there and missed lunch - but worth it - there is a coffee shop well worth a visit to break up the trip) Best bit of the trip was the Vaporetti - we spent one whole day on it and it was a wonderful way to see Venice", "Date": "March 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "lizarm", "ReviewID": "UR6893988", "Content": "Venice: Dona Palace February 2007 Reviewer: Three Female Trip Advisor members Three of us - all over sixty and interested in painting - stayed here in February.

We were a bit concerned because our room was directly off of the lounge bar/dining room but we need not have worried. Apart from hearing the breakfast being prepared at about 7am each morning, the noise was very minimal. The room was amazing....it was so big and lushly carpeted in red with a huge king size bed and loads of lovely brass lights. The huge bathroom was also amazing.....2 basins, a shower cubicle and a whirlpool bath. We had a curtesy room safe and a well stocked mini bar with very good red and white wime and bottles of sparkling wine as well as every spirit and mixer you could require and it was replenished daily. The room was scrupulously clean and the bed sheets were changed every day. The complimentary 'American' buffet breakfast was faultless. As previous reviews state there was fresh fruit salad, yogurts, croissants, rolls, jams, marmalade, cheese, boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, bacon, cold meats and a selection of cakes every morning. They supplied any type of coffee you request. we requested decaffeinated and it was no problem at all, equally you could drink cappucinno....whatever and the gentleman who oversaw breakfast truly was a gentleman who made you feel very important. Sadly, it being November the weather wasn't warm enough for us to benefit from the charming courtyard but I imagine it would be wonderful to enjoy a drink sitting there on the canal at sunset as it is a lovely setting. Reception staff varied. When we asked about help with our on line check, one receptionist simply directed us to the nearest Internet cafe although they clearly have Internet access on the desk. Later that day when the shift had changed I asked Stephanie the same question and she willingly logged on to BA.Com and checked us in on line, it taking only a fews seconds. It pays to check who is on duty. Overall we could not fault this hotel, would not hestitate to stay there again or to recommend it.

As in most European hotels, you have to put your room key in a slot inside the room to turn on the electrical. 2.
