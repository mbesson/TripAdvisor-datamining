Only 10mins walk from Termini or Castro Pretorio Metro. Otherwise room was pretty basic. The room had no air conditioning and the room fan (integrated into room) was useless. The room overlooked a busy, noisy main road so the choice ws to either roast in your own juices or be deafened by the scooters, horns and traffic. The tv in the room was stuck on BBC World service... Radio! Well, we had the tv remote but not the settop box remote. On the plus side, the room was clean, beds were comfortable. The bathroom was nice and clean with a decent shower. Make sure hen checking in you have cash as they don't take card. Also we noticed that when we went to the reception, all we need to do was to quote our room number and we were just handed our keys without any checks so please bear that in mind when leaving stuff in your room.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cstargate rome\u201d", "Author": "semyy", "ReviewID": "UR71359281", "Content": "clean,chep and near to the centre.

The hotel building is not so difficult to find. It is situated in area that has a lot of hotels near the central termini. On the way from termini to hotel is so quiet and not very safe to walk alone during a night. You would be surprise that there are several hotels sharing in the same building. You must enter to contact the check in desk in the right door. To go to your room, there will be another door up to the ground floor. That door is always NOT locked so that is not very much safe to your room as well. Please lock your luggage and do not leave any worthful things on the room just in case the robber can enter your room door. The room and toilet is lovely with good furniture. But the floor is not very clean, you can feel dusty on there. Rome during summer is bloody hot, there is air conditioner in the bedroom, but it does not function properly. I set up temp at 15 C but the working temp is just around 24 C. It is such a good idea to open the window during sleeping.", "Date": "August 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oregon", "Title": "\u201cSave your money, sleep on the street\u201d", "Author": "pdxtraveler2", "ReviewID": "UR5894066", "Content": "Worst hostel experience of my life.

The part of the hotel we stayed in had been recently renovated, so everything was in good condition and very clean. We'd booked a twin room but we actually had a double bed and a single bed. The room was quite a reasonable size (by European standards) but could get a little noisy if the windows were open because it faced Via Palestro. There was plenty of cupboard and drawer space and lots of electrical outlets. We even had a mini refrigerator which was good for keeping some snacks and coffee making things on hand. The bathroom was immaculate and the water pressure in the shower was probably the best I've had in Italy. Security was excellent as you had to be buzzed into that section of the building by reception, who had video cameras installed so they can see who is buzzing. Breakfast was as expected, a coffee and a pastry, but was included in the rate so no complaints there. The staff at the reception desk were friendly and very helpful, even when we had to check out at 4.30am to make it to Fiumicino for an early flight. All in all, given the price we paid, I was very happy with our stay at Hotel Anakin Stargate. If I ever return to Rome and am travelling on a similar budget, I would definitely consider staying here again.", "Date": "April 4, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Anakin Stargate", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d585120-Reviews-Hotel_Anakin_Stargate-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Palestro No. 87</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "585120", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/c0/5e/de/hotel-anakin-stargate.jpg"}}
