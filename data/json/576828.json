Its a 2-story hotel with no elevators. But I preferred to be on the 2nd floor because of the balcony. I felt safer considering the bottom level room lanais were open to parking lot. Ample free parking. Room was quite spacious and odorless. Could use pillow top beds and new (flat screen) tv. Stains on drapes and slow drainage in tub. *There was a bottel cap opener attached to wall next to tub.. Hmmm?? Speaks for itself. LOL! The free breakfast buffet was better than most. DIY waffles, cereals, boiled eggs. Enough to start the morning! The indian man at front desk was very helpful, cant say the same for the others. The girls should at the least smile.. Life cant be that bad, right? I would like to suggest a printer for the \"business office\" (one pc in lobby). Hotel also provided 24 hr use of microwave in lobby, as well as hot coffee/tea.

We planned to stay for only 3 days and move around the LA area, but due to the cool pool and good location to explore the city we stayed for our whole vacation. The room is a little bit run down but clean and good size for 3 person. The room facing pool is quiet, on fridays and saturdays there is lots of people by the pool though, but they close the pool at 10 pm and after that it is very quiet. There is quite good continental breakfast but at weekends when the hotel was fully booked they run out of the most at breakfast, lacking eggs, toast, no fruit and so on. The kids loves the waffel machine you get warm fresch ones every morning. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. The hotel should remove the wall to wall carpets in the rooms and the lobby and change the run down sofas in the lobby and this would give the whole hotel a huge lift. The wall to wall carpets upstairs smell cat pee sometimes. This is not a luxury hotel but for this price this gives very good value for the money. the area around is not so nice, I wouldn\u00c2\u00b4t take a walk in the area even during the daytime, but you have some simple restaurants around to get take away food and 2 food markets close by to get some drinks to your fridge and enjoy the sunset on the balcony. The best thing with the hotel is the pool and the friedly staff. It\u00c2\u00b4s nice to get back to hotel after dusty sightseeing and take a swim in the pool in the evenings. The Garden area around the pool is nice with all the flowers and birds. We were often sleeping with the door open and heard the mornings birds.

When we pulled up, I thought, what the heck, its late and Im tired from a 5+ hour drive. My wife checked us in, I observed some party type activity in the rooms with patios and balconies that were opened up and were viewable from the parking lot. Its a Tuesday, not a Fri or Sat where this would seem normal. It seemed questionable. Once checked in, I looked at the map to our room and drove around the back to park closest to our room. Again, I noticed activity that was now beyond questionable, but quite clearly illegal. I went into our room, never even put my luggage down, looked at my wife and kids and said \"No way are we staying here\", The room was old, the locks on the doors were less than secure, which raises the immediate question as to \"What goes on in this place\"? Why have the locks obviously been replaced more than an upgrade, but a repair from being broken? This place was not safe, not secure for even your belongings, but down right dangerous. There is quite evidently illegal activities going on. We quickly got back into the car, and went back to the front where the gal at the front desk attempted to argue that this was a quiet and safe place, to which I calmly said, \" You know more than I do what goes on here, and I dont think you want me to call the police and concern the people that stay here on a constant basis and disrupt the obvious illegal business that is going on here.\" Only after this, did she agree to refund our Credit Card. I would have left and taken it up with my Credit Card Co. before risking my families safety at this place. I even would have eaten the $100 for my life and and families was worth much more than staying at this place. My wife booked it based on the pictures from their website. Only after we got to another hotel, did I view the website and agree with my wife, the website is awesome, place looks nice, resort like. We paid $98 for our room, and got a room at the Marriott for $115. I would expect something like this if the room was $60-70 a night, but for $90 plus tax, you expect a decent, safe environment.

I went to open the curtains and the bolts holding the curtain rod into the popcorn ceiling came out of the ceiling - it was being held up by a prayer. I opened the sliding glass doors long enough to stop outside on the balcony, went back in, locked the glass doors, pulled to make sure the lock was in place and the entire window jam pulled away from the frame! Two chairs in the room were worn and had black arms from constant filthy arms resting on them. The walls had peeling paint and stains, as well as gouges in them. I went out to find some place for dinner and the neighborhood is horrible - tattoo parlor and low rent mexican restaurants around the corner. I felt very unsafe outside. Upon returning to the room, I shoved a chair against the door as it was apparent that anyone could gain access with a good kick. I suffered until 2:30 a.m. listening to the neighbors laugh and party. I finally had to call the front desk to complain.

The cable TV still didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work and they had to swap out television sets.

We went to 2 days of tapings of The Price Is Right at the CBS studios and it only took us 20 minutes to get there from our hotel. I highly recommend it for that because the hotels around the studio in Hollywood all range between 135 - 700 per night!!! The room was very large! Fridge, hair dryer, large vanity area with chair, lots of mirrors, large tv with tons of channels, a computer in the lobby for guest use and free WiFi, nice private patio with chairs over looking the beautiful pool area.

We stayed here so that we could be closer to the Universal Studios area and it was only about 10 miles away. Room was nice and large, had a separate area between the bed and bathroom divided by a wall which was neat, we had a queen bed and it came with a couch chair on the side for watching tv which we thought was a nice bonus. We were on the 2nd floor, so we also had a balcony which is separated from everyone else and had a great view of palm trees and the pool not too far. The slider though was very old and it was extremely difficult to open and almost impossible to close so we ended up not being able to use to balcony which was too bad as I would have enjoyed sitting out on it. The bed was fine, firm though which for my back was fine but other people might find it a bit too hard, but it didn't have any dips or lumps. OH ya and the water pressure in the shower was awesome! The best I've ever experienced! The only complaints I guess were even though the carpet looked nice, you got dirty feet so it obviously was quite dirty and they should probably clean the carpets more. Also, several times I was woken by squeely running water in the pipes in the walls, I guess since there is such good water pressure, it also makes it noisy. There was quite a few people staying in the room next to me and I think they had showers late at night and early in the morning - so I don't think that will always be a problem. The grounds were very nice, and I really liked the pool (very large, great temperature and surrounded by palm trees). The only thing that ruined it for me was that people were smoking all around the pool, and I am allergic to smoke and besides which don't want kids around it either. Other hotels we were at all had no smoking in the pool area! The pool area was large enough that they could have one corner for smokers only so at least then you could go to the other end of the pool and escape them, but I really think they should just make the pool area non smoking. Also, which was disgusting to me, there was half used cigarettes left by guests all around the pools edge (which I still can't believe people would do that). Also, they badly need someone to do pool checks with a broom and sweeper several times a day around that pool, we were there for three days, and the same cigarettes and pieces of garbage like napkins were around the pool edge the whole time. The rest of the hotel grounds and in the common area were really clean, so this is the only area that was a problem while we were there. Again make the pool non smoking and then they won't have cigarette garbage around the pool for little kids to get into or step on. As I said the pool was really nice! and hopefully in the future it will be non smoking as I would love to stay there again as the pool is always a huge selling feature for me and this is the best pool/palm tree view I've stayed at. They also had a really nice lounge area upon entering the hotel, the front desk staff were nice. They have a complimentary computer which was a huge bonus to me, as it had built in card readers so you can upload your camera pictures to a flash drive or even facebook. The only problem of course was that this one guy hogged the computer all day, even though it said (limit of 30 min.) and even when I'd point it out, he didn't care. I think they should either have a sign-in book with time started, so people will not take advantage and a timer that rings when there time is up, so the person can't pretend they didn't notice the time. I also think 15 min intervals is more reasonable when other people are waiting, as most people just want to quickly jump on and check their email or look up an address before they head out. The guy that was on it all day while we were there was just using it to pass the time all day. Continental breakfast was great also, and they have a nice large area to eat in and a tv to watch. They had one waffle maker, and then a variety of things such as cereal, toast, english muffins, danish, coffee and juices and even hard boiled eggs and some kind of scrambled egg patty. They also had onsite laundry that worked really nicely for a good price.

But for the fact that we only slept there we didn't try to change rooms, but it was a bad sign that they never responded to our detailed letter (which they did receive, per the corporate honchos) outlining these poor conditions. The lack of follow-up was evident and I encourage you to go elsewhere in the San Fernando valley.", "Date": "July 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat pool for the kids and for visiting relatives to the North Valley\u201d", "Author": "LawyerLady438", "ReviewID": "UR6521717", "Content": "We live in Granada Hills so we send all our visiting friends and relatives to this hotel to stay for a clean and comfortable location with friendly service at a great rate.

The fridge and television were old but they met our needs. The rooms could do with updating and there was a socket missing off one of the plugs which was a unsafe, but it was behind the bedside cabinet. All in all it is worth staying there if you don't want to be too far from the highway which leads you to all the sites. 45 mins to Hollywood, 30 mins to Universal Studios, an hour to Santa Monica.

We were first given a room facing Sepulveda Blvd, which was noisy because that street is extremely busy. We immediately knew that we couldn't stay in that room and asked to be switched. The second room wasn't even cleaned yet and we were relocated in to a third room that was clean and quiet. The room overall was okay except that the security chain could've been ripped out of the door frame with one good kick of the door. The surrounding neighborhood was worrisome as well as some of the guests that stayed there during the two nights (we had booked four nights but changed hotels) we were there. For example, there was a guest on the first floor who was blarring music out of his truck and grilling something on a table top barbecue at around 9pm. My biggest lesson learned from this adventure is to spend the extra money for peace of mind and safety.", "Date": "January 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat bargain... convenient location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3488129", "Content": "The shining centerpiece of this hotel is the pool and grounds.

We found the location to be ideal and centrally located with an easy ride to Six Flags, Hollywood, Universal Studios, Santa Monica/Beach in no more than 1/2 hour. The access also means that there is a bit of traffic noise on weekday mornings but it moderates quickly. There are good family restaurants nearby (within 1 block) and shopping for necessities close at hand. Serious shoppers will need to travel but, as noted above, the location makes it easy to get there.

We forgot our shampoo and there was no small bottle of shampoo like in all the other BW's in which we've stayed. We washed our hair with a very small bar of soap, and barely had enough left for bathing. The heavy curtains covered the air conditioning unit, so we had to prop a chair under the curtains to hold them up so we could get cool air into the room. When we checked out the next morning, the two men at the desk barely spoke English, so it was difficult to communicate with them. We finally gave up and just left.
