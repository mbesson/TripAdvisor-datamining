It is an average business hotel, nothing sensational, really. Very friendly people at the desk, who provided free wifi vouchers in the lobby area. Personally I am used to in-city business hotels with rack rates starting at 130 EUR do offer free wifi in the rooms. Not NH, which is a shame. The 42 EUR (!!!!) breakfast was somewhat a disappointment, with only super-softboiled eggs and no choice of coffee provided, just the standard.

Many of Berlin\u2019s tourist spots are well within walking distance from the hotel including, the Brandenburg Gate, Tiergarten and Museum Island. River trips can also be taken just behind Friedrichstrasse Station. Meanwhile, back at the hotel, I also agree with some of the other sentiments expressed. The hotel is clean, very function and, yes, the atmosphere is somewhat sterile and the carpets (on the second floor, at least) need replacing or deep cleaned. We had minimal contact with hotel staff but, when our paths crossed, they were efficient and pleasant. The hotel bar and restaurant is expensive, as is the mini-bar tariff and the internet charges; in this day and age there\u2019s no reason why four-star hotels can\u2019t offer free wifi access.

Friedrichstrasse itself is turning more and more into a tourist-magnet with some other large chains opening nearby. The NH Friedrichstrasse however needs some real improvements. First of all, staff as a rule is probably efficient enough to handle touristgroup bookings from Spain (which are quite frequent in this NH) but not at all interested in the individual traveller anymore. Individual requests (daily linnen change, extra pillows, room allocation etc) are responded to very reluctantly. Secondly, and more importantly the interior is now in need of a general make over. We had a suite (booked, confirmed but only given after having to insist - first room offered being a standard room) and the state of rooms and public areas have been in decline for some time now. Carpets are full of stains, woodwork in the rooms which tends to break easily is not restored and the bathrooms which are good enough with lots of glass panels are simply leaking everywhere since not maintained. No slippers nor bathrobes are distributed to suites anymore and coffee/tea is not replenished regularly anymore. Needless to say - welcome gifts have been skipped some time ago too.

Generally, I am not one to complain about details, but the carpets on the 4th floor are extremely dirty.

There are three elevators. When we arrive on Thursday evening, one elevator was not working. Friday night another elevator was broken. I attempted to return to my room, as I had forgotten something there, but a large group had arrive and with only one elevator working, I would have needed to wait for several cycles before I would have been able to get on the elevator. Also, for security reasons, you can not walk up the stairs. This is Berlin, a major European city. When one elevator breaks, it needs to be fixed. When the second breaks, it is an emergency.

Located literally one step away from the \"Friedrichstrasse\" S-Bahn train station. Our room was on the 6th floor, facing Friedrichstrasse, so we had no noise at all. Many times we were leaving the window open as we had a smoking room, but still nothing annoyed us terribly, neither the noise from the trains nor the street noises. Do choose it for many reasons. I would have written a huge list here with the advantages if I could! I will definitely book there again in my next visit to Berlin.

I was at the back of the hotel and unless my window was open I couldn't hear the trains at all. On the front or side of the hotel though you directly face the station and noise might be a problem. Having said that mind, the windows had the thickest double glazing I've seen in my life so you might be okay but all the same I'd ask for a rear facing room rather than take the risk. My only other caveat is an increasingly common issue with hotels. Hotels the world over I find far too hot and I like a really cool room if I'm going to get any sleep. This hotel did have air conditioning but like many you couldn't reduce the setting low enough to cool the room: the air conditioning was in effect turned off (no doubt to save money) and ll you could do was get the fan to blow out some barely cool air that made no impact on the room temperature.

Friedrichstrasse is a long street that connects the old west and east sides of the city, and used to be a crossing point when the wall was still in existence. The area has a laid back atmosphere with a few nice cafes and is a good place to return to after an evening out. From here, Hackescher Markt, Oranienburger Strasse and Unter den Linden are within easy walking distance through interesting streets. It is also easy to walk westwards from here to the Brandenburg Gate and onwards towards Tiergarten. Friedrichstrasse station has transport lines running through the east and west of the city and there is also a tram stop nearby so it's possible to walk out of the hotel, cross the road and get to anywhere in the city very quickly. The S-Bahn from Friedrichstrasse will take you west along this route to Tiergarten and Zoo Garden Station near the big shopping street of Kufurstendamm or east to Hackescher Markt (one stop) and surrounding areas. This location is especially good if you are flying into Schonfeld which has a direct train line to Friedrichstrasse station (allow 50mins to 1 hr). The hotel has excellent service; very good bright rooms that are well-airconditioned; friendly and helpful staff; and an excellent breakfast buffet with endless supplies of good coffee and a wide variety of food choices. A good breakfast can be bought for a lot less in nearby cafes so getting value from the hotel buffet is dependent on how much you're able to eat first thing in the morning. The atmosphere in the hotel is calm and relaxed and there is no discernible noise from the station in the rooms at night because of soundproofed windows.

The location is perfect, with the Unter Den Linden and Brandenberg Gate within walking distance in one direction from the hotel, and the Museum Island including the Pergamon Museum (my favorite) in the other direction. Also if you continue past the Museum Island on foot, you will come to the Hackensemarket area which has a glut of trendy restaurants and lounges within the \"yuppiefied\" Mitte district.

As my introduction to mainland Europe, Germany, and Berlin, I have to say I was pretty happy with my stay at the Jolly Hotel Vivaldi. First off is the location. You are a stone's throw away from the Friedrichstrasse S-Bahn and U-Bahn stations which will get you pretty much anywhere in Berlin Mitte within 10-15 minutes. You are about a 5-10 minute walk from the intersection of FrStrasse & Unter den Linden and 10 minute walk from \"Museum Island\". Second, the room was fabulous - a very large size for a European room, large bathroom, comfortable bed, and trendy furnishings, and well kept up. Third, the management was extremely nice and extremely helpful during my stay, providing good restaurant and activity recommendations, and helping me with a luggage problem I had at the airport. The only negative I had with the hotel were the \"extra charges\". I had no problem paying the rate of 100 Euros a night. However, I had to make a considerable number of phone calls during my stay and could not for the life of me track down a phone card anywhere until the third day of my stay, so I was stuck using the hotel phone. Also, needed to use the hotel's internet service two or three times. The hotel charged A LOT for these services (more than expected), and it quickly added another 100 Euros to my final bill. Also, while traditional in Germany, no breakfast is included at the hotel. Finally, given its location, the area near the hotel is a bit noisy - and some of that carries into the rooms. The Jolly Hotel is nice, and I would certainly consider staying here on my next trip overseas. However, I would check prices at other hotels before settling in at the Jolly Hotel Vivaldi.

However with Starbucks practically off the lobby, Adams two steps away for a nice, reasonable breakfast, and an excellent bakery across the street, this was never a problem. Much as the convenience of the location is an asset, I was initially put off by it's location smack up against the S/U bahn overhead rails and station and the Dunkin'Donuts across the street. However when I was in my room, although I could see the overhead rail, the room was very quiet. I was also initially concerned that the area immediately to the north of the hotel looked a little dodgy under the rail tracks. In two minutes though, you are walking either to the museums or across the river to Oranienburger strasse with its touching Jewish Museum as well as lively restaurants and art galleries so it was never an issue. I also ate at an excellent if pricey Italian restaurant nearby, Bocca di Bacco, on Friedrichstrasse. My major complaint was that although I found the desk staff friendly and fluent in many languages, I did not get the early morning wakeup call I had requested the morning I was leaving. I would also suggest that if you are expecting a quaint romantic hotel, this is not it. If I were returning to Berlin though, I would probably choose this hotel again.", "Date": "October 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, England", "Title": "\u201cVery Good Hotel - Ideal Location - Great Staff\u201d", "Author": "Jukebox01", "ReviewID": "UR3997077", "Content": "My wife and I have just returned from Berlin where we stayed at the Jolly Hotel Vivaldi for three nights - hotel is very clean, staff very efficient and helpful - breakfast included in our price - through Airmiles - was bufffet style and very good.

Bars and restaurants locally are very good - especially the Bolle, it is opposite the hotel and is set in the railway arches - lovely atmosphere and decent prices - noise of trains above can be a little disturbing when one of the large regional expresses goes by. Also worth a visit is the Vietnam Restaurant which is opposite the main entrance to the Freidrichstrasse Rail Station - very pleasant staff and food was great.", "Date": "October 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cLocation, location, location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3983785", "Content": "Very clean and comfortable.

Great location close to everything, lovely room with very modern and stylish decor. Right next to the railway, but the double glazed windows meant we didnt hear a thing.

Excellent value for money and we would definitely stay there again.
