We visited HK again 3 years later, this time in Nov 2008. My wife and I (both in our 30s) stayed here from Nov 5-Nov 13. We picked it again since we liked the location of the place.We booked directly from the Hotel website and we got a decent deal since were were staying for 7 consecutive nights. We let them know in advance that we would be arriving rather late..around 10 pm or so.There is a paid private shuttle bus you can take from the airport to several hotels (this one included). It runs every 45 mins up until 10 pm. The price for the ticket was about $20 per person USD and the ride would take an hour since we would stop at other hotels first to drop people off. Instead you can take a cab from HKG to this Hotel. At around 10 pm on a weeknight, there is no traffic so it takes about 35-40 mins to get here and costs about $30-$35 for the trip.The hotel front lobby is kind of small and this hotel is quite popular, so at times it can get crowded with groups of people arriving and departing. They checked us in quickly into a non smoking floor. We intentionally chose 2 twin beds since this will give you a better night sleep than trying to sleep in a tiny double bed. The room is small, but this is typical in HK since there is no space anyway. Clean room, clean bathroom, good service. They participate in a 'Green Program' where you they do not change the sheets unless you specify by leaving a card on the bed.Since the hotel is next to the 'Temple Street Market', you may hear droning noises outside the window till late at night...until 1 am perhaps. If you're tired, you'll sleep thru this...it's like a constant din in the background.The location is excellent in that you are right next to the Temple street market, 2 blocks from Nathan Road, 3 blocks from the start of the Jade market, 3 blocks from the MTR station.We did not eat or drink at this hotel since it is pricier than going down the street to grab a meal. If you get out the front door and start going Right (away from Nathan Road), you will find a 'Wellcome' grocery store where you can buy fresh fruit, produce, larger bottles of water for cheap, sandwiches etc. The hotel itself does NOT have free internet at all. But if you bring your own laptop, then you can use the HK Government free hotspots close by. It's not as convenient as your room, but still pretty good. Actually, right down the street, you will find the Kowloon Public Library. Simply take your laptop, walk in and park your butt in the kids section (first floor). No one minds and it's fun checking email while little Chinese kids around you are messing around with their story books. It's also surprisingly quiet.The Hotel staff speaks good English, is responsive and helpful. You can exchange money at the front desk and make change to get smaller bills too. Cabs are easily available. The nearest Metro station is the Yau Ma Tei which is about 3 blocks away and is easy to get to. So you can access the entire city from here. If you have big bags with you, it may be hassle to take the Metro from the airport to the Yau Ma Tei station...lots of line changes in the middle...stairs etc.The only thing I wish was better was the elevators. They are quite small so you can only fit so many people in there. Sometimes when large groups of guests arrive, you may have to wait a while to get into the elevator to get to your room.Do not expect a large room in HK. I took a look at apartments when I was there, and they have 500 sq ft apartments going for $2K US per month.For this hotel, you're getting a deal....paying under $100 US per night, getting to stay in the center of town.", "Date": "Dec 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR984693608", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Arrege"}, {"Content": "Punishing claustrophobia We were told by brochures etc and in photos that this was a great hotel..the first thing is we booked a non smoking double and got a smoking twin..ok so we stayed the first night as they did not understand much english at the front desk.

I have been to Hong Kong 15 times and with the right changes - asthetically inside and outside (uninviting) this hotel has great potential for any owner AND for visitors. THE POSITIVEDorsett Seaview was reasonable in cost terms insofar as Hong Kong hotels are concerned. Working out at around 42 GBP, 96 AUD, 56 EUR or 85 USD per night. Only five minutes walk from the Yau Ma Tei MTR station which has links into the centre. Ideal for exploring Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. Ideal for taxis if you really need them. Nathan Road has excellent bus routes. Shuttle bus service to Kowloon Airport Express Railway Station downtown. Friendly staff and room cleaned/stocked daily. Busy area seemed safe most of the time. CCTV system, calendar of events and weather report on all floors.I would recommend this hotel. THE NEGATIVEHotel could do with a major investment to do it up particularly as hotels in Hong Kong are few in number in this particular market. I agree that the decor needs to be overhauled - if only to make it update. Drab bedsheets replaced by funky ones would make the hotel more fun - particularly after a 12 hour flight. Facilities were clean however shower curtains need to be replaced. Bedroom area was sufficient however the shower/bathroom areas needs to be updated and regularly deep cleaned. Internet available however uncompetitive. Cheaper to travel down to Kowloon by MTR and have a full hour on the internet. Prices advertises should also include tax.

I stayed at Dorsett Seaview along with a group of three other friends from the 11th-13th July and from 14th-18th July. (The night of the 13th, we spent in China.) (:Location (5/5)The location was excellent. There was a night market (Temple Street Night Market) practically at our doorstep, plus several other eateries such as Hui Lau Shan, Mc'Donalds and other smaller outlets around the hotel. Yau Ma Tei MRT Station was only two streets away, hence making travelling around Hong Kong a breeze. Mongkok (Ladies Street Night Market) was also within 10-15 minutes walking distance.Cleanliness (4/5)The carpets were mostly clean, the sheets were white, and the blankets were stain-less. The bathroom was dry and clean when we first entered the room as well.A heating flask and a metallic flask for storing hot water that was provided in each room wasn't that clean, though. My friend had to scrub the heating flask a few times before it was reasonably clean enough for storing water. Whereas the metallic flask was rusty, hence we avoided using it.Room Amenities (3/5)There was a small television set in the corner, but it didn't work. (Either that, or we didn't know how to operate it.) The room we (my friend and I) stayed in for the initial half of our trip had wooden blinds that were rather difficult to use. Just shutting the blinds at night took us almost ten minutes because it was constantly getting jammed. Likewise, it was tough to raise the blinds in the morning because the whole thing just kept falling back down. Thankfully, the room we stayed in for the second half of the trip had curtains instead of blinds.The bathroom was tiny, but I didn't really mind since I don't take up much space anyway. Although it was hard to enter the bathroom and shut the door without getting my toe caught in between the bathroom floor and the base of the door.Room itself was small as well. However, it wasn't small to the extent of inducing claustrophobia because there was somehow a rather cosy feeling about it. Nicely furnished. Quite 'zen-like', in my frank opinion.Cups and free sachet drinks were provided in the rooms - but no teaspoons. So we had to swirl the cup like a conical flask in a chemistry lab just to ensure that the powdered drinks dissolved properly in the hot water.Free Breakfast (3.5/5)Food was so-so, I guess. Perhaps it is because I am easily satisfied. At least it is edible, not like some flea-infested cafeterias we can find on the streets.However, there wasn't much variety in the food. The same old pancakes, bacon, ham, sausages, porridge and cornflakes every single day - for six days we stayed there. The pancakes had a rather rubbery texture, so at times I was unsure whether I was biting into a deflated tyre or a pancake. Otherwise, the rest of the food was average.Reception (5/5)VERY friendly. Always ready to serve with a smile, and a tone that puts you at ease almost immediately. They were well versed in English as well, so I didn't really have any trouble communicating with them while checking-in and checking out. The process of checking in and out was also a relatively fast procedure, seeing how efficient most of the staff was.IN A NUTSHELLFor the price, and considering that this is merely a 2-3 star hotel, I was pleasantly surprised for the most part. I've refered to some of the reviews regarding this hotel on this site prior to my departure and was bracing myself for the worst upon checking in, but the worst never came. Perhaps I was just lucky.Either way, I'll definitely stay at this hotel again - should I return to Hong Kong in the near future.

Its proximity to the Jade Market and Temple Street Night Market interested me. But the hotel is really very bad. Rooms are extremely small, and I'm used to small European hotel rooms. Carpeting and drapes should have been replaced years ago. There is no closet, just a bar on the wall to hang your clothes.

The room we got had nothing of the sort, and when we asked at the desk we were told that the rooms were all the same and that deluxe meant you were on a higher floor than the standard rooms. So either their website misrepresents the rooms or the staff was not honest.
