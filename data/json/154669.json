Ideally located between the Plaza of the Revolution and the Colon Monument, it is within walking distance of Alameda Park, Palacio de Bellas Artes, and the Zocalo (though it is a long walk to the Zocalo). Rooms are on the smallish side, but they are spotlessly clean, the staff is friendly and there is a decent little restaurant off the lobby. There is a VIPS (a Dennys style casual restaurant) around the corner with excellent breakfasts and a number of good local restaurants within walking distance. I have stayed here four or five times and never been disappointed, it is my favorite place in Mexico City.", "Date": "Jul 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR863648052", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "photogjack"}, {"Content": "Comfort on a budget We stayed 8 nights at the Mayaland in December 2003 and loved it.The rooms are comfortable, spotlessly clean, reminiscent of the standard of a Travelodge in the UK. (That shouldn't put you off by the way!) There is very little noise from the street, and the service was very good, if not overly friendly. This is a hotel for someone on a budget, maybe a backpacker like us, who wants to spoil themselves for a few nights. Worth knowing is that the hotel offers a 20% discount to holders of an international student card. This takes the price of a double room down to 280 pesos a night. It's a bargain.It's well situated - only ten minutes in one direction to the Alameda, and ten in the other to the Independencia roundabout. It's about a 5-10 minute walk to the nearest metro stations, Revolucion or Juarez, and there are plenty of buses plying the Paseo de la Reforma heading all over the city.There are some fantastic torta vans nearby. The one just off Paseo de la Reforma on the turn off onto Alameda is fantastic. Tortas so big that if you have one for breakfast it'll keep hunger at bay till dinner time. There is a restaurant in the hotel but we didn't eat there.I highly recommend this hotel. And enjoy Mexico City! Don't let security issues put you off spending a good week in this amazing place. It's no more dangerous than any other city as long as you keep your wits about you and take the normal, sensible precautions. Have fun!", "Date": "Jan 27, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR707366231", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "This is for all you budget travelers out there! After scouting out budget hotels for half a day, finally found satisfaction with The Mayaland. At only about $30 a day it delivered just about everything we needed and wanted. Clean, newer rooms with good bathrooms, very helpful staff and a pleasant restaurant. Hotel is shiny and well cared for, with internet access in lobby. No funny smells, no insects, no noise. Rooms are adequately-sized, not big and have tv with some English channels. Taxis are always available out front and the Metro is about 4-5 blocks away. Taco place around the corner is good, cheap and open late. 24-hr Sanborn's is a short block away.
