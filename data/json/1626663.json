The desk clerk let us check in mid-morning since the room was ready. A hotel would never have been so accommodating! The staff at the front desk were always helpful. The apartment has more amenities than a hotel, including a full kitchen with dishes, a clothes washer, and a spacious balcony with a table and chairs. There are complimentary light snacks for breakfast. The location is fantastic - within walking distance of many great sites.

We made our reservation through booking.com, over a month prior to our arrival, for a 2 bedroom suite at Splendom Suites (same company apparently but not the same hotel) for 2 adults and 2 children. Upon arrival, I was told by Julio at reception that booking.com sent them the reservation for 2 adults only, and that Splendom was completely sold out so he would have to put us in Grandom Suites instead (2 blocks away). Booking.com insist they sent the reservation correctly. Julio put us in a 2 bedroom 1 bath 4th floor unit (Room 401) unit. There was no water in the unit when we moved in so we could not even use the bathroom \u2013 I was told that this was a temporary issue affecting the entire area and not just the hotel, and that the utility company was responsible. As we were still waiting for the water to come back, they voluntarily located another 2 bedroom 1.5 bath unit (Room 202) for us. We took a look at it - it had the extra \u00bd bath, and the water magically seemed to be running fine, so we agreed to move. Room 202 was yet to be cleaned however, and was being \u2018renovated\u2019. We repacked our luggage and they moved it to Room 202. The renovation plans included painting the room, AFTER we \u2018approved\u2019 it \u2013 we found that out only when we returned to the suite later that evening to the strong smell of paint. We tried taking a shower, but the water was cold. We tried calling reception, but the phone in the room was not working. Grandom Suites has no person at the reception after 7 PM, the reception desk is at Splendom 2 blocks away so we had to walk there to ask our question. Susanna came immediately and fixed the phone, and also took a look at the wifi which was not working (but was not able to fix it). I was tossing in bed all night with a headache, with the smell of fresh paint. The next day, the lukewarm water ran out when my 4-year old was in the shower, I had to rinse him in cold water. Reception was only too willing to come and take a look, as usual, and offer an explanation \u2013 that we had to wait 15 to 20 minutes between showers for the water to heat up again. So we waited an hour, and when the water did not heat up, just left after informing reception. When we returned that afternoon, we were told that the boiler needed to be replaced. That they did not know how much time it would take, because they would have to first source the boiler. But there was another room they could move us to. To their credit, they packed all our stuff and moved it, this time to room 302, with no paint smell and with plenty of hot water. However, for the remainder of our 1.5 day stay, we dreaded coming back to the hotel; we did not know what we would come back to. Other comments: Wireless internet does not work (see photo of router - not sure whether signal strength is clearly visible in photo). The door to the second bedroom does not open fully, (see photo). There is no headboard in the second bedroom, only pillows. I moved one of the pillows to find a power outlet behind it, (see photo). There is a smell in some of the bathrooms \u2013 poor drainage possibly. No alarm clock in any of the rooms. The location of the apartments is good. Grandom costs significantly less than Splendom for the same room category, when we asked for a price adjustment we did not receive a response. When I asked to speak to their manager, one person said he was having lunch. Another said he was in Madrid, yet another said he was not in yet. Everyone at the hotel was calm and polite, with a lack of urgency or empathy, that gave me the impression they knew all along that things were wrong in the apartment. We travel to Europe frequently, and have never had this bad an experience. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, friendly staff, everything you could need.\u201d", "Author": "Raquers82", "ReviewID": "UR123485582", "Content": "The apartment it in a good location in a nice area, with a supermarket on the other side of the square, cafe and a bar practically next door.The staff were very friendly and there were plenty of leaflets, booklets and maps with information on places to visit.

The second room could also benefit from some TLC in general... The apartment was fitted with 2 air conditioners that for us was needed to heat the room since the nights got a bit chilly. The area was safe and it was close to supermarket, bank, bakery and other amenities. It was just a short walk to get to La Rambla.

I found this terrific property through Trip Advisor. This is a hotel consisting of a number of fully furnished apartments. If you are looking for a traditional hotel with bar, restaurant, etc., this is not for you. If you are looking for larger accommodations for a group, then this is great! Our apartment had 3 bedrooms, 2 baths (one is a half-bath) and a small, fully equipped kitchen. It was very, very clean, nicely decorated and appropriately furnished. Two of the bedrooms had twin beds pushed together and the third one had a twin bed. A couple of the bedrooms are small, but you only sleep there, right? The living room/dining area is good-sized, and had a large dining table, sofa, chair, coffee table, and flat screen tv. There was a small balcony area, which we did not use. It was fully air conditioned. We opted to get the 10-12 euro \"Welcome Package\" of drinks and snacks, and that was a very good value. There are also free snacks, orange juice, coffee and tea available in the hotel's pantry at all times. Due to flight delays we arrived several hours after we planned to, so there was no one on duty at the entrance. But we just pushed the button to the side of the door (it is marked) and let the person who answered know we had arrived. Within about 5 minutes a lovely young woman arrived from the nearby Splendom hotel. She checked us in, showed us around the apartment, and gave us good advice about the city and sights nearby. The hotel is located in a nice area of town, reasonably safe at night, and within 5-10 minutes walking distance of the subway, Placa Catalunya and the top of La Ramblas. There are numerous restaurants and coffee shops very close to the hotel. During the day, the desk at the entrance is staffed. The person on duty when we were there was fun to talk to and very knowledgeable and helpful. He was able to get us taxis to the cruise ship on a day when the taxi system was being overwhelmed by 7 cruise ships!

Before the trip we heard a lot of stories about how dangerous to take a street taxi from airport to hotel so we arrange shuttle service with Grandom Suite. They told me it will be $60 Euro each way, $120 Euro both way. I specify in the email and asked if is a street yellow taxi and they told me no. On the day of arrival the driver pick us up from the airport and take us to his car and there was the yellow street taxi!!!! Why would I paid $60 Euro for a street taxi??? We later find out that it only costed $30 Euro by taxi from airport to hotel!!! After arrival at the suite we asked the manger about the car service, he just told me that he doesn't know and left me without any explanation. We totally got ripe-off and not happy with the way they handled this. Horrible service: One of employee Javier's attitude is unbelievable, when we had a misunderstanding of the room rates his attitude was horrible. He slammed the credit card machine and tell me to pay!!! Later he even charged it wrong and had credit back my money. It was very unprofessional. After the taxi and room rates disaster I thought the day will be better but NO. We found out our room's hair dyer was broken, we called from 5PM and ask for a replacement, Javier keep telling us to give him 10 minutes. After 2 hours, he finally showed up and tell us it's not possible to get a hair dyer. He told me he was very busy since a lot of people are checking in and there's no way he can get one for us. I flipped because first of all you don't ask for a hair dryer for 2 hours and I know you are busy with checking in people but it's really not my problem. I'm here in Barcelona for vacation not here waiting for a hair dryer. Second, when we waited for 2 hours you do NOT just show up and tell me it's not possible. After I got angry and demand him, he finally found one for us but it wasted half of the day and ruined my first day in Barcelona. No hot water after the second wash: After all the terrible things we stared to take shower and after the second person there's no hot water, we waited more then 2 hours to have not even hot just warm water again. After the forth person finish taken shower it was 2AM in the morning and we had to get up 9AM in the morning. We wasted so much time dealing with all the problems with Grandom Suite and it's not worth it. Once again we're here to vacation not wasting time on their unprofessionalism. Very small 2nd Room: The second room was very very small, the door cannot even open!!! I'm tiny already (5 feet tall) however I was almost overlap on top of my friend. Not for two adults, only for one adult and one kid or two kids. No response with my email: After the stay, I wrote an email to the manger with all the problems I had with their hotel, there's no response. Maybe I have to write a review in order for them to recognize their problems.", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seaside, California", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Place to Stay!\u201d", "Author": "JennyMac831", "ReviewID": "UR101379960", "Content": "Great location, large rooms, full kitchen and the service is great.
