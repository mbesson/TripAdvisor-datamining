He could see in his paperwork that indeed we did book for three and arranged for us to be upgraded into two separate rooms for the first night, one which was their top 2 floor suite which had a great rooftop patio overlooking the city. While it was a pain to have 2 separate rooms and not be able to completely settle in until night 2, this was a nice treat for my wife and 10 year old daughter. The beds and pillows are very comfy. However, the doors are paper thin with noise coming in from the halls, stairs and elevator (we were right next to all three in room #201) once 9am hit. If you like sleeping in, beware of this. Overnight though, it was very quiet. The room was ok in size and there was a separate water closet and shower rooms, which were very tiny. The room was clean overall, AC worked great, and TV worked well. Internet was also good to have but a pain that you needed to reenter the wi-fi log in data after each session. We didn't do the breakfast and saved the money by eating from the local area, which had plenty of options. Freshly made crepes and quiche were steps away from the hotel's entrance. Local grocery was also nearby for snacking and wine purchases. A pharmacy was also very close. If you like to run, the interior loop of Luxembourg Gardens was filled with runners and it's about 1 mile per loop... a beautiful view while jogging.

With spots on the carpet, rotten wood framing near the tub and obvious signs of wear everywhere, it is definitely time for a facelift. (I will add a couple of pictures later when I have time.) The secondary issue was service, though it may be that the drop in standards was due to temporary help during the August holiday period. The receptionist was only able to help us with train schedule after we explained the service we had gotten without asking on a previous visit. And unlike past visits, they were not very welcoming of us as \"repeat visitors\". We do not expect complimentary upgrades to a suite every time (though twice in a row was nice), but the \"superior\" room we had this time required a traffic cop for us to go back and forth between the tiny bathroom and the only place in the room where suitcases would go. As we discussed potential options with the receptionist, we also brought up the \"little touches\" like a free bottle of mineral water, extra wine glasses, in-room fridge, etc. that we had come to expect from previous visits. We were somewhat curtly informed that those only come with \"deluxe rooms\". All in all it was quite disappointing.

Contrary to the previous review, my Hong Kong hotel rooms were definitely larger than our standard room at Le Senat. There was not adequate room for 2 medium-sized suitcases in addition to the bed and desk. The bed was wonderful. The bathroom had a few cracks in the bathtub, and the much-touted Hermes toiletries weren't so impressive. It's a pet peeve of mine, but when a hotel doesn't provide conditioner in addition to shampoo, it's not worthy of boasting about its toiletries. The hair dryer was excellent. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel because it seemed much too expensive for what was offered, and there are plenty of cafes closeby anyways.

Part of that is due to its... Location -- a bit of a walk from the Metro, but it turns out that is a good thing. The area around the Metro is quite the party area and I could imagine the street noise and general shenanigans would be distracting when you're trying to sleep. Overall though this area is wonderful. Plenty of shops, close walking to fine chocolatiers, bakeries, and restaurants from sandwiches to nice meals. I'd definitely stay in this area again.

Though very quiet, one finds adjacent the Luxembourg Gardens, Odeon Theater and good restaurants (e.g. Ferrandaise). One quiet block away one finds the RER Luxembourg station (line B -- direct from both airports) and surrounding fast food shops (McDonalds, Quick, Subway), larger cafes and a variety of shopping. A five minute (or less) walk takes you to the Odeon metro stop on the busy Blvd St. Germain de Pres in one direction and Blvd St Michel (more shopping) and the Sorbonne in another. A slightly longer walk takes one to the Pantheon or Ile de la Cite. A longer, but easily manageable for most (fifteen minutes or slightly longer), walk takes one the Louvre, D'Orsay, Marais, Montparnasse. Reserved a small double (used as single) and superior twin.

The bar was available at all times and was a nice space to relax after a heavy day site-seeing. The staff were very friendly and helpful; they were patient with our attempts at speaking French, but helped us by speaking English also. For us, the location was ideal. A couple of minutes from the beautiful Jardin du Luxembourg, and a short 5 minute walk from the Luxembourg RER stop or the Odeon Metro stop. From the hotel we could walk or use convenient transport links to visit all major attractions in the city, and there are many interesting restaurants nearby in the evening. We booked with HotelConnect.co.uk and the whole process was smooth and trouble-free. The buffet breakfast was included in our package and the breakfast room was perfectly sized for the venue, providing a selection of hot food, cold food and lovely pastries to set us up for the day.

The location of the hotel is superb. It is easy to get to on the Metro and RER \u2013 the RER is closer if you are concerned about carrying baggage. Just a quick point about travelling in Paris, the public transport system is excellent but we purchased a carnet (pack of ten) tickets for the metro/bus/RER from Ashford International Station in advance of arriving in Paris and none of them worked in the barriers at Gare Du Nord. We had to queue for a long time at Gare Du Nord (this was a Sunday afternoon when you may expect it to be quiet) to buy more tickets from a machine, of which there are very few in the station and which has no translation of the French instructions. This was not an isolated problem a number of people were experiencing it and all were complaining to themselves as there seemed to be no staff available to complain to or help to sort the problem out. Back to the hotel, the location of the Hotel Le Senat is excellent. It is close to the Jardin Du Luxembourg which is beautiful, it is a stroll away from the left bank and Notre Dame. You can get an excellent boat trip from Pont Neuf for \u20ac10 each taking in all the usual sights this is also in easy walking distance.

It is much cheaper to get breakfast somewhere else and there are many places to choose from within easy walking distance of the hotel. The room was ok, it is a little small but it is an old building and that is part of the charm. The noise mentioned by other people may be worse for the people in suites on the top floors because the walls are probably thinner there. We didn\u2019t really experience noise from next door only noise from the terrace furniture upstairs being scraped across the decking late at night. The room was clean enough and the towels were changed daily. The furnishings were fairly modern. We did not have a mini bar as quoted on the internet. The shower head was broken and the head angle could not be adjusted so it sprayed water all over the bathroom, not our problem as much as the cleaners. The rooms at Le Senat are quite expensive. We saw what appeared to be very nice hotels in the immediate area that were quoting prices on their tariff boards getting on for \u20ac80 less per night which is not insignificant but we have no idea what these hotels are like generally or what individuals want from their stay.

We were looking to stay around the St Germain de Pres or Latin Quarter areas in order to be a bit closer to things, and the hotel seemed to get good reviews on Tripadvisor. The location of the hotel was great! Close to the Jardin de Luxembourg, and with some absolutely fabulous restaurants right next door (Le Ferrandaise and Au Pere Louis) you did not need to venture far to find a good Parisian meal. There were also some good local cafe bars, and all of the restaurants and bars were frequented by local Parisians. There were very good boulangeries and 'mini-markets' just around the corner which we used every day for breakfast (baguettes, croque monsieur, croissants, whatever you like, and coffee and orange juice supplied there) which for 9.30 Euro for 2 people was certainly a much better deal than the hotel breakfast at 15 Euro per person! We booked through the hotel website and booked a 'Classic Double' and were given a room (502) with a balcony which was a real plus for enjoying a glass of wine and watching the world go by. However, we had decided to book one room up from their 'standard' room, and even at that the room was small and without a balcony it would have been very claustrophobic for 4 nights! (It was certainly much smaller than the previous room we stayed in, last time in Paris, for less money) Secondly, the bed was not comfortable and after the second night we found that we were starting to waken with backaches etc and general grumbles. Third, there are real problems with transmitted noise from other rooms. We were woken on a couple occasions by the couple in the next room returning late at night - not that they were boistorous, but rather that you could hear conversations and TV noise transmitted through the wall, as well as very loud bangs of their door closing every time they went in or out of the room. We did have a great stay in Paris, and the location of the hotel certainly did make up for some of the issues such as the room size and noise, but lack of a good bed might put us off staying in that particular hotel again if we were to be in Paris for more than 2 nights - but we are now armed with names of other hotels in the same area to try next time...! I have rated the hotel a 3, but in reality it is probably a 3.5-4 so I may seem a bit harsh, but such is the reality of some of the problems that there are!

It's a lovely small hotel in a quiet road a few minutes walk from the Luxembourg Gardens which I've now realised are a must on every visit to Paris. The reception areas are fairly small as with most boutique hotels but beautifully decorated and furnished with contemporary wallpapers and fabrics offset with the kind of lovely flower arrangements that make a statement. In the corner of the lounge is a laptop with broadband for anyone to use gratis. The rooms were small but again tastfully furnished with everything you need and everything worked. Staff are helpful and friendly and very quickly knew our name. It's been reported in previous reviews that parking is a nightmare. It's not easy because the road is one way and there's no parking outside the hotel but we rang the hotel beforehand and they suggested a car park in Rue Soufflot. We parked there first and then walked our luggage to the hotel and it was no more than 5 mins. I need to review the car park as well. It was underground, heated and the cleanest car park I've ever seen. Very secure and not expensive. We joked that had we not found a hotel we'd have been quite happy to sleep in the car as there were even loos!

We wanted to stay in the Latin Quarter as we really enjoy the restaurants/night life in that area, aside from the fact that it's very pretty and well located to explore the rest of Paris. This little hotel was perfect for all our needs. We had a slight wait on our room but we did arrive at 9am or something crazy. The friendly receptionist answered all our questions as we waited and offered us an upgrade to a rooftop two-storey room (which we were able to view for ourselves) for more Euros, but we decided to keep the room we had on the third floor and save our pennies for the often-expensive Paris meals. We were, after all, only there to sleep and our room on the third floor was more than adequate with a huge comfy bed, modern furnishings, flat screen TV, small balcony overlooking the quaint street below and a wonderful bathroom full of Hermes products - a lovely touch. We chose not to eat breakfast at the hotel as it was more fun and a cheaper option to just walk down any of the surrounding streets and find a little cafe and eat with the locals. I can happily recommend the cafe on the corner - as you walk out the front door head right down towards Luxembourg Gardens and you will see this particular cafe with the red awning. We ate there on our last morning and it was not only a beautiful outlook to the Gardens but also a quintessential Parisian experience - the tables on the path all facing outwards and basking in the sunshine, seemingly no other tourists eating there and the minimal-English-speaking waiter to challenge our basic \"baguette\", \"croque monsieur\" and \"caffe\" grasp of French breakfast terminology! Oh, and the croques and coffees were great! If you're into fitness may I also suggest a morning run around the Gardens. We did it one day and it was just beautiful, and full of locals doing the same thing. While I'm recommending Paris experiences can I also say you really must catch the train out to Versailles if you get the chance - we did it this time and it was magnificent, I'm so glad we decided to as it was just beautiful, and the little town itself is very quaint with lots of great cafes, bars & restaurants.... after the hours you spend walking the Chateau and its amazing grounds you'll be up for a beer!

The hot and cold buffet breakfast which was served in the basement of the hotel was ok, although if I were to stay here again I would pick up something in one if the many brasseries nearby. The hotel was very clean, with a modern contempory decor. In contrast to some other visitors who have provided reviews we found the hotel staff to be very polite and friendly; the reception staff were helpful in providing us with tourist maps and advised us on nearby metro stations. In terms of getting we used the Metro and found a pack of 10 tickets (priced just over Euro 10) to go a long way. The nearest Metro stop is Odeon which is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel.

Reading these reviews is where the pleasure ended. On arrival the staff barely acknowledged us - let alone smiled or made us feel welcome. I booked this hotel above many other glowing recommendations in the city in the hope of getting a balcony room - which we did get in the end - but there was no promise one would be available (why not, I wonder, if you're prepared to pay for it?) and the staff managed to make me feel as though I was being rude for even asking. On being shown to the room, I was surprised at how small it was, given the price we were paying. I know Paris rooms are small generally, but you could barely get round the bed, and clearly we were not paying for charming service. Admittedly the bed was super-comfy, but I'm afraid I ask more of a hotel than a comfy bed. That evening a downpour arrived out of nowhere just as we were leaving for dinner - the receptionist reluctantly attempted to obtain a taxi for us, and when it was clear nothing would be coming (I know - such is Paris) we asked if we could borrow an umbrella...but this was obviously asking too much...the lady told us they had none to lend but would be prepared to sell us one instead!! Crazy - I do really wonder what we paid for. The sour nature of the staff carried on the next day, when we checked out - as early as we could. I wonder if the hotel didn't like our sort (we arrived early off an overnight train and used the hotel facilities to change and freshen up - our room wasn't ready), we are young, we didn't have matching Louis Vuitton luggage, and we laughed as we came in from the rain, quite late at night. I have lived in Paris before and know it very well - admittedly not as a tourist - but I was amazed by the attitude of the staff here. I advise you to pay less and have the prospect of a decent welcome from the staff - or even pay more and put up with snooty staff in return for a decent room.
