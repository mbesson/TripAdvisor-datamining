I hadn't read any of the reviews on here prior so I didn't have any preconcieved ideas. The price was the main appeal. I found the staff at reception were friendly and helpful, the room was spacious, clean and had a huge bed. I wasn't expecting luxury, but something simple and comfortable. I enjoyed my stay at the hotel and found everything fine. There is a bit of noise in the area, but I expected this given its downtown location. Sadly, after I left, the security deposit of $150 was still on my credit card and it had not come off automatically as it should have -in the end a staff error. This made me quite anxious so I contacted the hotel and spoke with Toni, she had just started that week as the new manager. Toni was reassuring and after explaining my situation, providing some proof of the problem, she rectified the problem straight away - reversing the transaction while I was on the phone with her.

There was a huge music festival and comedy festival in the city that night so all the hotels were completely booked, or we would have switched hotels. I could write on for days everything that was wrong with the hotel room but I`ll give a point form list instead. - we were on the main floor with curtains that would not close -our windows did not open -we had no AC in our room and it was 30 degrees in Montreal that day, it was far too hot for comfort with no airflow -We complained and asked to change rooms and they told us that they would bring us a fan -When they brought the fan it had dirt and hair tangled and stuck all through it, not to mention the housekeeper told us that the room was never used because it was too hot! -The front desk staff were rude, had horrible customer service and were very disrespectful -The bathroom was the most dirty bathroom I have ever been in and I have traveled to Cuba, the Dominican Republic and all over Canada and the US - The fan in the bathroom did not work Now I did call Choice Hotels when we first got in the room and our complaints to the front desk got us no where. The rep was extremely helpful, called the hotel numerous times trying to sort everything out and the front desk individual refused to speak English to him, even though he would speak English to us fine....

The hotel seems to cater to large, rude groups. I was just trying to get to sleep on my second night when the riot started. A bus disgorged a large group of late-teens / early-20s. They spent the entire night partying -- some with their room doors propped open to allow everyone else to hear their noise, with other doors being constantly opened and slammed shut -- and running up and down the stairs going somewhere else. I complained to the manager, but he could not give a rip. It was obvious that the large group's revenue was more important to him than worrying about whether his hotel's ambiance was worse than that of a college dorm during a floor party. The manager would not intervene with his rude guests, not would he adjust my room bill to account for the fact that I got no sleep that night. I checked-out and left the hotel at around 6 AM just to escape. The location was marginal, with drunks and other losers drifting merrily nearby.

This place lacked even the most basic level of service, and the staff were rude, discourteous, and full of attitude. Rooms were shabby; one of ours still had dirty towels (and a dirty t-shirt) left by the previous guest, which were not removed until 2 days into our stay, despite being dumped on the floor. They was also no wardrobe or rack - absolutely nowhere to hang up clothes or coats. One of our rooms had a locked minibar (which we wanted to use as a fridge), but no key. The front desk clerk explained that the previous guest must have taken the key, and that he would notify the manager. 24 hours later, we still had no key and, upon inquiry, were informed that it was our job to track down the manager and let him know we wished the minibar unlocked, as the manager will not 'bother us' in case we did not wish 'to be disturbed.' The wireless internet, which was supposed to have been provided, did not work a single day of our 5-day stay. When we inquired on the first day when it would be fixed, we were told told by the front desk clerk that he \"does not know,\" which was also the answer to our inquiry as to whether they were expecting a tech anytime soon. When we asked about the wireless internet again on the last day (a couple of hours before check-out - idle curiosity), we were told the same thing. If you want to have your room cleaned past noon, forget it - housekeeping does not work after 12pm, despite the fact that noon is the official check-out time. Continental breakfast is a joke - upon coming down to the lobby, one must tell the front desk the number of people in the party, and each person will be allocated two small croissants; no more. On days when there are no croissants, guests have to do with Wonderbread. On the bright side, Wonderbread dosage is not regulated, and there is a toaster that comes with. Coffee is available all day long, but cups are not (if they were, we never saw them!); it is bring-your-own for that midday caffeine infusion.

We looked at some other really nice places online, for a lot cheaper, but when we reached there, we learnt that there was no more rooms. So after trying out a couple of places, we ended up here. To begin with, I don't know how they renovated it. It was still very shabby. We reached there really early morning, at about 8 am, and check in wasn't until 9. The guy at the desk told us that he'll have to charge us extra for checking in early. We took two rooms for two nights. The guy at the desk told us that he'd charge us $70 a night and $20 for checking in early. I asked him what time check out was and he said at noon. So i asked him if he'd let us check out a bit late since we're paying extra $$ right now for like 1 hour, and he said sure, and told us we can check out at 3 pm. The day of the check out, we recieved a call at 11:30 reminding us that we have to check out at 12:00. So i went down to the reception to see what the problem was, and turned out it was a different guy, perhaps the manager. I explained to him how the other person (gave him name and all) had this agreement with us. And the manager told us that he doesn't care, according to rules, we have to be out by 12, otherwise he'll charge us extra. After realizing he wasn't willing to listen, i asked him to give us some more time to pack our stuff. He said 12:30. So we were out by 12:30. Now the hotel. Dirty carpets, scary hallways, dirty washrooms, dirty and smelly bed covers. Rooms were nice sized tho, have to give them that. But the overall look of the hotel and the LOCATION, is very depressing. Made me and my wife miss home very much, which is really not what you want out of an outing. There was not enough parking (only street infront of hotel) but we were lucky enough to find a spot on both days n didnt get ny tickets. My advice, if you book early, you will be able to get much better hotels (non-chain types) for much less. We found that out first hand when we went to these couple of really cheap places first and discovered them to be extremely nice and classy, but no rooms.

I've traveled extensively around the U.S., Europe and the U.K., Australia and Canada. First, the good points. Location was excellent for our purposes. We were within walking distance (even for me) to restaurants, the Jazz Festival, our venue (Metropolis), shops and other attractions. The room (Room 201), was very nice for the price (see caveats below). Amenities, such as, maid service, TV, Coffee, vending machines and ice were entirely acceptable and appreciated. The Complimentary breakfast was as we expected. Mostly, the staff was understanding of our requests. Second, the bad points. We arrived on Thursday July 5th, 2007 and stayed until the following Monday. After check-in, we proceeded to our room and couldn't find the safe. We had brought a substantial amount of American and Canadian cash for the four of us. We didn't want to walk the streets with this money nor leave it unprotected in our room. The duty clerk gave us a shrug as maybe our room didn't (or wasn't supposed to) have one. Also our request for a refrigerator again was met with a shrug. No one knew where the key was for the refrigerator. The next clerk didn't know either. The next morning we went to get a paper to do some Festival hunting. No papers. Again, shrugs (maybe they were all gone by the time we got there or not delivered). Only brochures were available. That morning our key cards became unusable on us. They didn't work and several times we were locked out of our room and we had to go down to the clerk to get into our room. This problem went on from Friday through Sunday afternoon when they mysteriously started working again. On Friday evening they gave us one \"Master\" card key from the Reception Desk. I though this was highly unusual. We didn't try this card on any other rooms, but I was uneasy just having a \"Master Card Key\". On Saturday, while we were lounging in our room, we were surprised by other guests opening our door and walking in on us (how did their key card work?). This was extremely unsettling for my wife and our grand daughter (as you might imagine). They wanted to leave immediately after that. Of course, the other guests apologized and went back to get another room. After the Key Card fiasco, the shift manager said that it was the \"dead bolt\" lock. But they were only able to duplicate the problem with the door open and the \"dead bolt\" turned out, not under any other circumstances. As a maintenance manager, with 50 years experience, I was highly skeptical of that explanation. The foregoing was just a prelude to our most grievous complaint. We rented a car to use on this trip. When we first arrived, we noticed that there were \"No Parking\" signs everywhere. When we inquired where we were supposed to park, we were told they didn't have any parking! Not in any description of the Lodging did I read that. We were directed to a parking lot a block away. The cost was to be $20.00 per day. When I got there I was told that the cost was $80.00 and the car would be parked for two days. I couldn't get it out until two days later! When I asked why, I was told that they didn't need my business and to \"go away\". I was also told that if I came back it would be $100.00 per night! Needless to say I was surprised that EconoLodge would recommend that parking lot as their parking lot. After two hours of driving around looking for a spot to park, I found one 4 blocks from the Econolodge. Three local persons couldn't tell me if the signs would allow me to park. It seems that there is NO parking under so many different reasons. The parking lots are few and far between in Montreal. The next morning I relayed my problems from the night before and the next clerk told me. \"No, No, don't got to that lot, got to the College underground garage for $10.00 for 12 hours\". I asked why I wasn't told that the night before, I got the usual shrug. So, after much concern and expense, I finally was able to park my rental car. Ultimately the total cost for parking was (at least) $90.00. I think I could have upgraded to a better hotel for that price! Also after closer inspection I noticed that some residents seemed to park on the street with no problem, whereas I was told the police would be called and I would be ticketed. In my opinion, I got ripped off using the Econolodge on this trip. Other hotels in this area have underground garages for patron parking. We spent absolutely too much for the Econolodge, gasoline, walking the streets too and from the parking lot and payment of $10.00 for partial 12 hour parking fees that all added up.

So I head downstairs and asked the guy at the desk if this hotel had any housekeeping, all I got was some weird looks. I then asked him for some clean shits and blankets and pillows, he returned with a few sheets and some towels. Ok so i guess we don't get blankets or pillows.

The hotel is not great, but you should know that based on the price. It's a clean bed to sleep, that's all. I am from Toronto and felt no difference in terms of safety. Hookers smoking pot nearby doesn't really sound that dangerous to be honest. I am curious whether or not the people that said they did not feel safe actually experienced something to make them think this way. The staff at the hotel were fine and helpful when I asked for bus directions and taxi arrangements.

In an area of Montreal that didn't look safe to walk in. Unfriendly staff, not a pleasant experience. Room looked out onto an abandoned gravel lot with garbage in it. Parking was not mentioned to be a fee when booked. Couldn't park on the street (all restricted areas). Was initially told that parking was around the corner and in thru the wire fence. Couldn't locate parking so asked again to different person. Was then told parking was $15 and not provided by the hotel. Small unsecured lot. I was hoping that my car would still be there in the morning!!! Did not get accomodations I had made a reservation for. Reserved a king, got a queen. Shower curtain was tied back with a piece of toilet paper. Old mini-bar hidden in tv cabinet. Breakfast consisted of Croissants, juice and coffee. Better than nothing.

Also, one of the nights we came back around midnight and there were two hookers sitting on the front steps smoking pot. No joke. One of our cab drivers said that there are alot of drug dealers in the area, so DO NOT go walking on the street late at night, for you are taking your life in your hands if you do.

As this location is two subway stops from the race track and maybe 3 subway stops from Cresent street were all the festivities are, its a great location. The price is very reasonable all in $450 cdn for four nights. Problems/Issues - One the Saturday Night an older lady started knocking my door around 7:30pm. I ignored her, surprise to me she opened my door lucky i had the emergency keychain lock on. She sreamed open the door. I closed it and got dressed when I opened she had disappeared. On the sunday Night the cleaning staff left my door not closed properly...anyone could have walked in. Everyday and night from the Thursday to sunday there were teenage/twentish young people on the pay phone on the floor all the time. Also lots of banging of doors at all hours. Other issue is that around St. Laurent station south to St. Catherine the area did not seem nice. I have been there two other times and although there were cleanliness and other problems their, this time there were many more and more extreme. I would not recommend the hotel at all for families with children. Overall i'm not sure if I will return to this hotel. I love the location and price, but the problems in the hotel and the st. laurent station/st. catherine area are probably to much for me to return.", "Date": "September 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFilthy place\u201d", "Author": "littleshrub", "ReviewID": "UR3833619", "Content": "When we arrived at the hotel which by the way is part way down a hill, the only parking there was, was on the street.

We arrived at the hotel around 6:00ish and were only able to stay the one night. Our thought was that 'hey it's only one night' how bad can it be. The room was absolutely filthy. On the floor beside the bed were beer caps - approx. 5. There was garbage behind the night table. The floors did appear to be vacuumed at least. When I went to take a bath, only the shower worked as there was no plug for the tub. There were two double beds in the room - first thing I checked was to see if the sheets were clean, and they were. If I happened to get up in the dark I would have smacked by knee on the dresser to get to the door as there was just no room to move around. No place to put luggage. The hallways did smell. The rooms were dark and dingy. Upon checking out the next morning registration desk asked how was your stay - I mentioned the state of the room and can quote her response of \"oh sorry!\" All of this for $100.00 a night!!!!!!!!
