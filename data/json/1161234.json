The communications were clear and payment process efficiently handled. We had a 2 bedroom condo on the first floor because we needed a unit in which we did not have to climb stairs, etc. It had a screened patio which made sitting at night where we reviewed the day's activities or planning activities a pleasure. The clubhouse and pool were very close..steps away. We actually felt very much at home while there. The condo was quiet, immaculate, and very well furnished with a TV in each bedroom as well as the living room. Concerned about security?

So was very convenient the two days we drove into Disney. Expect to pay a cleaning fee if your stay is less than 4 days...this is understandable IMHO. You get in the first time by dialing a gate code that was sent to you which calls the owner/manager so he can buzz you in. Ours didn't work..but all was fixed in short order when we made the phone call to the number that comes with your reservation paperwork. And I believe him that it was a phone system upgrade glitch.

We were looking for a condo that was reasonably priced. We were planning to stay all day in the parks and just wanted a clean, comfortable place to spend the night that had a pool for the girls to swim in. We found it here at LD! We arrived late in the evening on our first night, but it was easy to find with our GPS. After a few minutes trying to figure out the security gate we made it to our 2nd floor (2 bedroom) condo which was well lit and we felt safe. The condo layout is spacious and the washer and dryer was a big hit! I especially loved the big screen tv's and the private balcony overlooking the pond. We stayed for 6 days here and didn't regret it. The girls loved the pool which wasn't heated when we were there, but I read it is heated now. We had the pool to ourselves 90% of the time! No lifeguard on duty but the pool is a zero entry style and well laid out. Our only difficulty the entire stay was one eventing when returning from Disney and we couldn't get into our room because the battery on the electric door lock failed (at midnight). I called the number provided to us and left a message. Anthony called me back within a few minutes and told us over the phone how to get in - no problem. I would recommend this place to those who are looking for an alternative to a hotel/motel. The price was very reasonable which attracted us to this place to begin with. The grounds are well kept and there is a huge super Target right down the street and only 8 minutes from Animal Kingdom (if you know what you're doing). If the kids don't like swimming there isn't much else for them to do but our kids love the water so they were happy - and so were we.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLegacy Dunes--a beautiful place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "Couzins", "ReviewID": "UR125762456", "Content": "Our month-long stay at Legacy Dunes was very enjoyable.

Booked through Go Disney, a site that I had seen recommended. We found Anthony from Go Disney very helpful and easily found the condo we wanted with three bedrooms, as we have a 21 and 14 year old boy and girl. Had significant difficulty when we first arrived as the block looked boarded up in the dark and all of the condo numbers were covered with tape. We were very tired after 20 hours travelling and being up at 4am UK time and when we located what we thought was the condo the code would not work in the door. Fortunately after a few tries we managed to call through to Scott, Anthony's business partner and he managed to get us into the condo via a key box code. We did have a very stressful half an hour before this as there was no-one around and there seemed to be no caretaker or night staff at the resort. Once in the condo we were pleasantly surprised. It was lovely, clean and welcoming after such a long journey (and driving around Orlando for three hours trying to find the resort as the hire company had no sat navs and apart from the address we had no other directions). The following day it became clear why it looked boarded up as the outside was being painted and everything had been covered with paper and masking tape.We enjoyed the condo very much but had mixed views about the resort. It seems that it is not just a holiday resort but a permanent home for some people. It didn't seem to have any atmosphere and on our one trip to the clubhouse there was nothing and no-one there. The pool seemed nice but as the weather was not very warm we did not try it. My husband used the gym a few times and found it satisfactory for his needs. In the main it felt as if the condo was a little oasis for us after the bustle of theme parks and Orlando and suited our needs as somewhere to relax. My big big complaint however is in the design of the blocks themselves. There are three floors to each block and access to the second and third floors is via a metal staircase which is bolted onto the outside of the building. Every time someone came up or down those stairs the noise was horrendous. In the bedroom in which my husband and I slept the stairs were attached to the wall at the head of our bed. There was a picture on the wall which rattled as the whole wall vibrated with the movement of the stairs. This was not so bad in the daytime but at night it was very disturbing and irritating. On a couple of occasions we had an earlyish night and were woken by people running up the stairs and when the trash was collected each night the room almost shook and the vibrations came through the head of the bed. What idiot would design staircases like this. They should be forced to live there for a while and experience the impact. I imagine if you rent a condo on the other side of the entranceway you would escape this intrusion but it was very annoying. In short it was a lovely condo in an area suited to travel to Disney Parks, but resulting in a lot of travelling in traffic if you want to go out to International Drive or to the Universal Theme Parks. The resort had nothing to offer to tourists so if you are looking for a base in Orlando to travel out from this is OK, but if you are looking for more from the resort on days off from Theme Parks etc or just a place to relax by the pool with some amenities I would not recommend this as the place to stay. There are other condo rentals that fill the gap between hotels and apartments, with services for guests where you would want to chill out for a day or two.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat 4 days\u201d", "Author": "Blanca Z", "ReviewID": "UR122610088", "Content": "Great decision making my reservations to spend 4 lovely days in Orlando.

Went with hubbie, sons(14,13) and their cousin(13). I have gotten spoiled using our family timeshare and have stayed at several condos in the area. Nothing beats the space, added bathrooms and W/D!Wanted this especially since I was the only female. This time I was not using the timeshare so I was searching for a good price. Came across this condo and godisneyvacation.com. Reviews looked good so I contacted them. Prompt response from Anthony. Very courteous and booked us quickly in a 4brm/2ba condo that slept 10 for only $120/nt! That was cheaper than two med quality hotel rooms. Same price or cheaper tha some single rooms! I started to get worried because I found a forum that said they post good reviews of themselves to look good. I had already paid so we decided to take a chance. Arrived late and used code given to open gate. It called Scott who works for godisney and we heard a voicemail msg. This was concerning after a 12hr car ride. One side of the gate was ajar and we were able to drive thru. We did not leave a msg. He may have been waiting for the msg to open the gate so I can't really say if that was a issue. Nxt morning, gate was fixed. We had the dalmation condo. It's a older complex. Condo was older. Floors a little uneven but baths n kitchen remodled. A/C fan necessary to keep moisture smell away. Decor a little older but condo clean and spacious. Only complaints I had was I wish there were comforters on beds,channel guides for the tv because that was a little confusing, and better shower heads/water pressure. Also 2nd queen room didn't have tv as advertised. Condo was well stocked with basics and then some (Swiffer sweeper, vac). We did not use the amenities because we were at the parks all day.

Anthony took excellent care of our details prior to arrival and per his email regarding the front gate and the keyless entry, everything went as smoothly as it possible could.

Regarding the pricing, we could stay on Disney property, but the outrageous cost for Disney is not worth it. We had our own quiet jungle to retreat to each night.

You guys are amazing with what you offer and we are glad that we found you online at GODISNEYVACATION.COM. When we first got there I called the phone number listed because there was only one gate card and my kids were going to be joining us later on. I spoke to Scott who was very professional and very apologetic because one of the cards were missing. Within ten minutes he was knocking at the door with a replacement. Thank you again so much for such a smooth transaction and for making our stay that much more enjoyable. We are definitely spreading the word around to all our friends and co-workers and we are hoping to return again during the next few months. Just to let everyone else know. We stayed at the castle-themed condo for a few days last weekend. It was the most incredible place. We needed a place for six people and I found the condo on www.godisneyvacation.com. We paid $79 per night!!! Now think about it. There were six of us. If we had gone to a \"regular\" hotel, we would need at least two rooms. Some people would need three rooms for six people. Two rooms would have been at least $200 per night. For the $79 we kinda thought that we were just getting a place to sleep. Boy were we wrong! The condo was immaculate. There were three flat-screen tv's hung on the walls, one in each room. There was hi-speed wireless connection, a stereo with an ipod dock in the living room, another in the master bedroom and a boom-box on the fridge. The condo also came equipped with washer, dryer, stove with oven, microwave, blender, toaster, lots of dishes, pot, pans, cutlery. It was decorated very tastefully with artwork, vases and other items. There were lots of towels and linen. There was an iron, ironing board, vacuum and hairdryer. Obviously we didn't need all this but I am just trying to show the lengths at which the went to make their guests comfortable. There were even a stack of children games in the castle room and lots of books in the master bedroom. The AC works flawlessly, but because my mom was with us and she gets cold quickly we couldn't keep it too cool. If you are looking for a place to stay for your Disney stay, don't even bother to look any further. Just go on the website and book it. Don't thank me now. Just come back here and say exactly what you think about the place. We have paid a lot more for a lot less. This place is definitely worth every single penny that you will spend for it.

Go Disney Vacation explained everything to us in detail regarding the condo and everything was just as they described it to be. I loved the fact that it was in a gated community and the key pad code to the front door was an excellent idea. What a wonderful trip. One thing I wished we could have changed was the duration of the stay. Two weeks was too short. Next time we will be looking into a longer stay.

The property management company is great! They checked in with us upon our arrival to ensure we had settled in well and we had no problems during our stay. It was tough deciding on a condo to rent initially as there are so many out there, but we are glad that we found this one. If we are coming back to Florida....this will be our first choice!

We saved so much money by preparing meals at the condo. We were so close to Disney that we were able to come back to eat lunch and enjoy some down time before we went back to the parks in the evening and to watch the fireworks.
