A couple of additional thoughts: this hotel is just up from the Rogers Centre and, while in the centre of the entertainment district, it is a bit of a walk from the subway (just be warned if staying in the winter). Also, while the rooms stack up nicely to any hotel I've been in, this hotel is usually full of families, so that is more the crowd than the usual business traveler. The pool and fitness area are fine, but on the small side. The bar is pretty tiny and the hotel doesn't really serve food other than breakfast. There's a bunch of hotels and bars in the area though. As a comparison, I've stayed at the Renaissance down the street (typically double the rate and in desperate need of a reno), the King Edward (same price, but very tired rooms), One King West (modern, but TINY rooms), and the Eaton Centre Marriott (more $$$ and basic hotel room) in the downtown core, and this would get my $ any day of the week.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cComfortable stay\u201d", "Author": "Erica d", "ReviewID": "UR123450542", "Content": "I stayed at the Marriott on Christmas Eve and I thought the hotel was very clean.

Every day there were scrambled eggs, hard boiled eggs, breakfast meat (I think usually sausage), breakfast potatoes, toast, bagels, muffins, prepared oatmeal, waffles, cereal, and fresh fruit. The location was excellent. I was attending a conference at the Convention Centre, which was just around the corner. The walk was short and I liked that I got out in the fresh air each day to come and go from it. There were also lots of restaurants and shops in the area, and of course it was right near the theatres. The hotel had a few \"appreciation\" nights going on while I was there. One night they had a chef in to make pasta for visitors, and another night they had a cocktail reception with free beer/wine and snacks, along with draws for prizes. My friend and I each ended up winning 2 free tickets (so 4 tickets in total) to a comedy show at \"Second City\", so it was nice that we also got to attend a free show while we were staying in Toronto.

I arrived at 10:30pm on the date of my reservation after driving 2 hours to be told that \"a large group did not leave when they were supposed to\" and therefore they did not have a room for me. They offered to \"escort\" me to another hotel, located in a completely different part of the city. Not very helpful considering I booked this hotel specifically because it was located close to the conference I planned to attend early the next morning. When I said that was unacceptable they offered to send me to another much older hotel (not a suite hotel) for the same price. While this was going on I saw one other person come to check in who was given the same story, but accepted to be sent to the hotel in the other part of town. Yet another person arrived, was given a cookie, thanked for being part of some special program and told he was being given a free upgrade. I called my husband who called the Ritz-Carlton next door. They told him that earlier in the day they had lots of rooms available, but because this hotel overbooked so many people they had just given away their last room to yet another person who did not have their reservation honored at the Residence Inn by Marriott. Finally after about 20 minutes of this they told me that they could give me a room after all, but it would be a wheelchair accessible room with no bathtub. Really, who cares (now 11pm at night) about having a bath tub in a situation like this! They gave me a key but no information about where to go for breakfast or other basic information one would generally expect. The microwave in the room was broken. To rub salt into my wounds there was a letter in the room from Beth K Osborne, General Manager explaining that this week is Global Customer Appreciation Week. It brags that they have been rated number one on trip advisor for four years running. Sadly, I now know that is at the cost of treating some people very poorly. Not one person could explain to me why if they new some other customers had overstayed their reservation (check-out time was noon), that they did not call me earlier to let me know their would be an issue. I arrived at 10:30pm, tired and just wanting to sleep. Had they called me I would have had the option of booking another room for myself, or even staying home and coming for the second day of the conference instead. I believe they were hoping I simply wouldn't show up so they could keep my money for the night's stay as well.

Theatre, restaurants and entertainment are not really next door to the Residence Inn as you might expect from their 'Entertainment District' claim, but if you can walk a few city blocks you'll enjoy a much better restaurant selection on King Street, where I'd rather stay next time for convenience to theatre and restaurant variety. The full service Hyatt hotel on King (former Holiday Inn) is much better located with at least ten upscale 'in' restaurants right across the street. The only really close restaurant to the Residence Inn Entertainment District hotel is a very good Indian restaurant called '259 Host' and it's right next door adjacent to the hotel (reviewed below). The SoHo Metropolitan hotel is also closer to restaurants and entertainment, and right across from the Wayne Gretzky sports bar. The Residence Inn doesn't have a taxi stand so you might have to wait for them to call one to come...service is friendly though. Live theatre in Toronto is very good, by the way...so is restaurant choice...be sure to read through the 'Where' magazine when you check in or book theatre tickets before you arrive...or maybe you can do that online. When we were here 'Chess' was playing, as was 'Private Lives' with Kim Cattrall and Pail Gross. 'War Horse' opens Feb 10, 2012. 'Rigoletto' opera was at the Four Seasons Centre. Second City is a fun show to see. Museums everywhere and excellent shopping at all levels. Lots to see and do in Toronto. We tried the '259 Host' restaurant next door and really enjoyed it...quite upscale and they will deliver the bill to the Marriott which I thought would earn Marriott Rewards points but it doesn't. The whole bill for two came to just $105 plus tip for a shared appetizer Panir, shared garlic Nan, shared plain basmati rice, lamb medallions entree, butter chicken entree, 2 glasses wine, 2 mixed drinks, no dessert or coffee. For downtown Toronto, I thought it very reasonable and would go again. If you are a Marriott gold or platinum elite you won't get the extra benefits staying here and only half the points as you would at the Marriott full service hotels. Local phone calls at the RI are $1.50...even for Marriott Elite members, so bring your cellphone. Room WiFi is free at all lower level Marriott's and worked well. Widescreen TV's are still only analog so everyone looks fat. I hated their TV remotes as they don't have a 'sleep' button, so I was awakened at 4 am by a noisy infomercial as I fell asleep without turning it off. Administrative staff 'attitude' was not very pleasant. Front desk and reception people are rushed off their feet and I found them and the operators very abrupt and not friendly like most 'Marriott' trained people, probably as a result of understaffing. This is a Residence Inn with a difference as it has bellboys and valet parking attendant (you must use valet parking - $30 a night plus tips). Room decor is pleasantly different as well. We had a 1 bdrm suite but on check in the gal told us the better views were in the studios. I am a Marriott Platinum Elite but got no upgrade even though they were far from full. Room A/C was set for 70 degrees but we froze all night, had to turn it off and then we got too hot...why are hotels like this? I was in the room when the maid came but she took less than 10 minutes to clean up with no vacuuming as we were staying 2 nights. We were on a high floor and the elevators are extremely slow even if you don't stop. There's a comfy bar facing the reception area...looks ok but very few people in it at happy hour Friday night...and nobody when we returned at 9 pm from dinner. Each morning breakfast can be had just down from the front desk. Nice seating in both areas. The buffet was quite nice except at the bottleneck for toast and pancakes/waffle you have to make yourself...they need more machines. Scrambled eggs were very plain and tasteless, potatoes were terrible mixed with onions and peppers (no hash browns!), sausages were gluten free-- but after eating I had to rush to the bathroom. A little later my guest had to go several times as well. Hmmm. I'll stick to oatmeal next time. At the bar area they offer some food on some work nights...such as 'baked potato night with all the trimmings with salad and cookies'; 'chili night, dessert and dessert'; 'soup and salad night'; etc. FREE on Monday to Wednesday. I don't know if this is just for hotel guests or walk-ins. Newspapers are NOT delivered to your room as in other Marriott's but available if you go down yourself to the reception area (none on Sunday, but the Saturday Globe&Mail is excellent). So if you like your morning cup of Joe while reading a paper you'll have to get dressed first. :) And go early...the newspapers were all gone when we went down for breakfast at 10 am Saturday...but the bellboy managed to find one.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent if you need a place to stay before a hospital visit!\u201d", "Author": "shinystar1300", "ReviewID": "UR119391194", "Content": "The rooms are clean and very open.

We had spent nearly a fortnight here in Aug/September 2009 (when the hotel was about six months old) and this year's stay cemented the favourable impressions which we formed two years ago. The hotel is ideally located; just off the tourist bus routes, an eight minute walk from the CN Tower and the Rogers stadium (Bluejays); 20-minute walk from shopping at The Bay, Yonge Street and the Eaton Centre (big retail mall in the middle of Toronto); 15 minute walk from the main train station. We drive enough in the UK, so we always aim to walk/bus/train/fly when we are overseas. We took a suite on the 19th floor. Peaceful, spacious, comfortable, well-appointed. With the fridge/freezer, microwave and cooker, you could easily set up home here. The welcoming pack of microwave popcorn was a nice touch. Excellent bathroom with a nice deep bath. If you take a suite on the East side of the building, you look out on a huge electicity sub-station and, to the right, on a new construction site in line with your view to the bottom of the CN Tower (which is your navigation point ANYWHERE in the city). Big deal, we never heard a thing from these two sites! Breakfast is served on the ground floor, adjacent to RECEPTION. This is a city-centre hotel, and the value of land is reflected in the small-ish dining area. This dining area is adequate, but expect a five-minute wait for a table at peak times. On the ground floor also is a small bar; this has a habit of closing before 9pm but this is solely dictated by the level of patronage; if the bar is busy, he'll stay open. If not - \"use it or lose it\". The Reception staff were universally helpful, as were the door staff and the cleaning crews. Negatives - there are only three lifts (\"elevators\" for the yanks in the Colonies!) and, EVEN WHEN ALL THREE LIFTS ARE WORKING, there can be queues for the lifts. This shows up the Achilles heel of this hotel - the reception area is long and narrow, from the entrance to past the lifts. When were there, the middle lift got stuck on, I think, the 4th floor on at least two occasions. Memo to Mr Marriott - next time, this size of hotel needs four lifts and a squarer reception area! This was our second trip to the Marriott Residence Inns Toronto Downtown Entertainment District - or \"255 Wellington Street West \" for short. Travelling back to the Airpor? for two of you, let the hotel book a taxi - a Limo rolled up, and cost us CDN55 for the trip back to Pearson; less than the CDN39/head cost of the Airporter service.

We stayed during the summer season and so it was very crowded. Therefore, there was frequently a wait for a table at breakfast during peak times and for the evening reception, I saw quite a few tables with one member from each party staking out their claim of a table by sitting there while the others stood in line for the food. But this was a small sacrifice for a very nice breakfast and evening reception. Parking was rather expensive at $35 per night. It was relatively easy to find someplace nearby that was cheaper, but the there were two advantages to the higher price -- valet parking and in/out privileges, so there was one $35 fee no matter how many times you used your vehicle. If you do not plan to use your vehicle for the time you are there, it might be cheaper to shop around. Having stayed in quite a few Marriott Residence Inns, this hotel was comparable to the others -- nice staff, clean, and good service. The pool was clean, but since it was summer, it occasionally did get crowded. The fitness center had good equipment and was also kept clean and the equipment worked well. The free internet was easy to use and worked well. I did however leave there on a sour note when we received our bill. Since we were from the U.S., we opted to use a phone card instead of paying roaming charges on our cell phones. We were shocked to find out that there is a $1.50 charge per phone call, even for local calls to a phone card number. Unfortunately for us, we made many calls home over the course of a week for a variety of reasons. Charging for local phone calls seemed to be quite a contrast to free internet. We stayed at two other Residence Inns in Canada over the past year. The previous one did not charge for local calls. After leaving this hotel we stayed at another Residence Inn in Niagara Falls and saw that they charged $2.00 per call. Although this amounted to a relatively small charge relative to the total bill for our room and parking, we definitely left feeling taken and this one experience shifted our entire perspective of what would have been just another good stay at a Marriott Residence Inn.", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cExactly what we wanted!\u201d", "Author": "lilmissgiggles1", "ReviewID": "UR115751733", "Content": "We stayed in the residence inn over a weekend.

Not being familiar with the city, naturally I wanted a hotel that would be convenient as well as comfortable. Using the Trip Advisor reviews here coupled with having used Residence Inns before, we chose this one. Proved to be a good choice. The hotel's location worked out to be a very practical \"base\" for our sightseeing. We visited various attractions in different locations around the city. Some, such as the CN Tower, were eaily \"walk-able\". Some we drove to. That was easily done since this hotel is 1 block way from a major north-south street, parallel to some major east-west ones and close to the expressway. We also used a taxi one night and a \"hop on/hop off\" bus. As for the comments in other reviews here on the cost of parking, yes, it is expensive. But in that, Toronto is no different from other major cities, so it did not shock me. The parking here was \"in and out\" meaning you pay the daily rate but could take your car in an out as needed which is what we did. The valets were friendly and efficient. Because the hotel is just up the street from the stadium, there are public lots in the adjacent blocks. But should you consider them, keep in mind whether or not there is a home game being played or the few dollars you save may cost you in lost time getting acess to your car. We booked a one King bedroom and at check in, were given a choice of floors. We opted for a top floor corner room. The room was nicely furnished and I especially appreciated that the sitting room furniture had been chosen for the comfort and convenience of us guests, not just the convenience of the hotel. Where that made a noticeable difference was at the start and end of our days. It was really nice at the end of the evening to be able to come back to the room and sit and relax in comfort in a nice setting versus having to choose between flopping on the bed or using a hard back desk chair. Likewise, my wife and I normally keep different morning schedules. And whereas she pops out of bed in the morning like a piece of toast, I start up are more like an old car on a winter's day. So we took advantage of the sitting room and the daily free breakfast buffet by her bringing a selection to our room where I, not having had to make myself presentable for public viewing, was able to sit and enjoy her company over coffee, etc. Then to her added delight, we just left the dirty dishes in the sink and voila! Housekeeping took care of the rest! The front desk staff could not have been more helpful to us in making our visit a pleasure. They gave us concierge type assistance in \"sequencing\" what we saw each day based on what was close to what and when each was open. They were especially helpful with practical advice on the best ways to get around town; not just directions but whether it was easier to drive or take a cab. For the former, they looked up the nearest parking (enormously helpful to an out of town visitor!) and for the latter, what the fare would be. Let me note that this was not just one person but a dfferent staff member each day. All in all, we felt like this Residence Inn contributed a good dealto our having an enjoyable stay in Toronto.

Not a major issue, but it forced me to walk inside to the front desk and wait in line, only to be told to go back outside and wait for the valet parking guy to appear. I prefer to always park my car myself, but valet parking is the only option, and $35 a day is a rip-off! Plus, the guy was not very friendly. So, my first impressions were not that good. I didn't find the lobby very inviting -- lots of dark wood and it consists of a very narrow hallway in front of the main desk. Once on my floor, the decor was brighter and much warmer. As other reviewers have noted, the rooms are large and very clean, and the beds/pillows are very comfortable. The front desk and dining room staff were friendly.

The \"Market\" commonplace to most Marriott properties was just inside the main entry doors, next to the front desk. It seemed well-stocked, but with a small grocery store less than a half-block away, it was easier - and cheaper - to walk down there to stock up. There was a bar area opposite the \"Market\", though - despite the promotions on TV - I never saw it open for evening social hours. Adjacent to it was the breakfast area. I cannot comment on the breakfasts, as - due to the frequency of my stays in Marriott properties for work - I largely ate off-site for variety's sake. As for the room itself, I had a corner studio room with a king bed on the 15th floor, with a view facing east towards the CBC Broadcast Centre a block away. The room was the best part of the entire stay. It looked and felt new, and was quite a dramatic difference from what you experienced walking into the lobby. Lighting was more than adequate throughout the room. Everything from fixtures to appliances was clean and in good working order. There was a large-screen TV on a console/dresser that divided the living and bedroom area, which could be rotated around easily to wherever you were viewing from. The bathroom and vanity area was spacious with everything in a functional place. The bed was well-appointed and extremely comfortable. Free internet access was available via both wired and wireless means. If there was a negative with the room, it is that the walls - particularly closest to the hallway - were thin, so noise from there easily carried into the room. Fortunately, the noise was not constant, though if a guest or housekeeping let a door slam, it sounded as if they did it right in your room. I did not use any of the other facilities at this property during my stay, so cannot comment on their quality. Customer service on this stay was mixed and overall could be best described as \"unremarkable\". I am typically more sensitive to customer service anyway, but given the frequency with which I stay at Marriott properties for both work and leisure, I have come to expect a certain standard. I already referenced the front desk staff, which was average. The housekeeping staff was very friendly. An especially nice touch came on the first full day of my stay there, after I left the \"no service\" sign on my door. I returned later in the day to have a very pleasant voicemail message on the phone from the housekeeping supervisor saying that although I didn't request their service that day, I could feel free to contact them if I needed fresh towels, bedding, or any \"touch-up\" service in the suite. The concierge staff was also mixed in terms of customer service; the ones present when I checked in and checked out were quite friendly, responsive, and courteous. The ones present during the rest of my stay seemed to barely acknowledge anyone coming in or out of the hotel; on my last night there, I actually saw one a couple doors down from the hotel grabbing a quick smoke. In terms of location, I could not have chosen a better facility for this travel. My primary reasons for visiting Toronto were to attend a show taping at the CBC Broadcast Centre, which - as already mentioned - was a block away. I also had a ticket to see a performance at Second City, which is roughly two blocks away, next to Gretzky's Restaurant (a great place for dinner or socializing). The CN Tower and Rogers Centre were a short, easy walk (definitely under 10 minutes by foot). Other downtown attractions were an easy walk for those who are up for it. Otherwise, cabs are very plentiful, and the nearest Metro (subway) station is about 2-3 blocks away from the hotel, which will get you throughout downtown and to other attractions just out of the downtown core. Numerous restaurants, clubs, shopping venues, and theatres are also within easy walking distance. On the subject of cabs, I chose to take a cab to/from Pearson International Airport. In rush-hour traffic, it was about a 40-minute ride; in early-morning weekend conditions, it was about 20 minutes. The fare - without tip - for both rides was approximately $54. All in all, I was pleased with my stay at this Residence Inn. I suppose with some of the other unremarkable factors - lobby/general facility, customer service - I could have been swayed to give an overall rating of \"Average\". However, the room quality/cleanliness and location were so much a positive that I have given this stay an overall \"Very Good\" rating. When I visit Toronto again, I would be very much inclined to stay at this facility again because of the room and location, and my hope is that the other factors would rise to the same outstanding levels by that time.", "Date": "January 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sherborne, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDeserving of No1 spot\u201d", "Author": "roseoakhil", "ReviewID": "UR92384063", "Content": "This was our last stop on our 3 week trip to canada, Its goes without saying we chose this based on the reviews, location and price, im glad to say it all lives up. we had a fantastic suite overlooking the cn tower on the 19th floor (my 1st high story hotel experience, little scary) the i kitchenette & good size bathroom.

Because there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an office tower right next door the view is somewhat limited (we could see people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cubicles from our window) if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re facing south.

We ordered take-out and had it delivered and was happy to find glasses, crockery, paper towels and even a little dishwasher soap on hand in the kitchen. The bed was soft and cozy with ample pillows. The second room we were in was all-in-one but still very spacious and comfortable.

We actually stayed at this hotel during the G20 Summit and security around the City was unbelieveable, we have never seen so many police but even though there was some trouble in the City we never saw anything only whilst watching the news! Many shops and restaurants had closed but we always found somewhere to eat and drink and found the whole experience quite exciting really... Breakfast was provided in the hotel which always set us up really well for the day with lots to choose from like fresh fruit, yoghurts, cereals, pastries and bread Oh! and even waffles... as well as cooked breakfast like scrambled egg, bacon and sausage I think I even saw pancakes!! There was also plenty of fresh fruit juices as well as tea & coffee. This was certainly more than adequate for what we needed and was positioned well with access to many bars, restaurants, shops, CN Tower & Steam Whistle Brewery.", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zurich, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cPerfect value\u201d", "Author": "ZrhWorldtraveller", "ReviewID": "UR71442229", "Content": "Stayed in the Residence Inn with friends for 5 nights in July, we got a very good rate and I was very happy with the style and the overall equipment of the room (some of the equipment is quite noisy such as ventilation and ice machine) The view though was not nice.

The suites have everything in them from a kitchen with cutlery/dishes, etc., wine glasses, coffee-maker, microwave, etc. Upon arrival, there is a little welcome kit with coffee and popcorn. They also have comfortable beds and a TV that swings that can be watched in the bed area or in the sitting area. Most importantly there was a small window you could open to get outside air. Well, I say that is good, however, the night we were there, the City of Toronto was setting up for the G8 and the sound of fencing being put up and dropped at 4 am was a real pain. Location: One block from the CN Tower and the Rogers Centre. The Entertainment is actually a few blocks away closer to the Eaton Centre. A great city to walk or to get hop on-hop off tour bus. You can see everything in one or two days. Don't forget to take the ferry over to Toronto Island park. The breakfast has lots of options plus there is an afternoon appetizer - both free (well part of your room price). One day they had Indian food from the restaurant next door - well needless to say, we didn't need to go out for dinner. Only paid for lunch that day. My only criticism is the price of alcohol (especially wine) at the hotel bar. I don't get why hotels want to rip you off so you don't buy a drink instead of making them affordable or by having a happy hour at the least. I did not drink here because of that. It would have been nice to have a drink with our appetizer, but very few even bothered. The Airport is a $55 ride either by taxi or limosine (town car). Watch it though, when you order a limo, the doorman contacts his friends (gets $10) and the other limo driver, unbeknownst to you, waits there and is told the customer took a cab to the airport. Not really fair, but I've seen this in many hotels in many countries. The real positives for travellers at this hotel is the free business centre, free wi-fi in the room and an onsite laundry mat. The gym is also very nice and open 24 hours per day. the pool and hot-tub, although I did not go in them, looked really inviting. This hotel has everything you need.

However, there is a clock radio/cd player/mp3 dock that I used for entertainment. 2) The vending machine took my change and didn't dispense my soda pop. They weren't able to refund my money because they don't own the vending machine. But they did give me a free can of soda from the bar. 3) The walls seem to be really thin because I could hear loud music, yelling, screaming and laughing coming from my neighbors room. 4) Parking is ridiculous $35 for valet service.

When I checked into the room it was nice and spacious and clean as I must credit the hotel for their decor. Further on to my experience.....the evening we came back from dinner we stopped by the front desk to ask for a wake up call as it was around 11ish and was surprised to see two clerks arguing with each other about who was going to stay on later. I guess they did not see us coming in which is surprising as the hotel lobby is very small and intimate. We asked for a wake up call and moved onward to our rooms as we had a very early presentation the next day. To put it precisely....only one of my colleges received a wake up call out of my group. Luckily I used my in room alarm clock and was able to rectify my early start but it did put a very bad taste in my experience. I approached the front desk in the morning and had asked to speak to a manager. A new clerk said that she had not arrived yet. I asked was their anyone else I could speak with that was a higher rank than her and her reply was that the Assistant General manager was assisting the staff in the breakfast room. So I asked if she could come and speak with me and the clerk said that the Assistant General manager couldnt because the staff levels were low that morning. Surprise Surprise.!!!! At this point I simply expalined my issue with the wake up call and wanted the Assistant General Manager to call me on my cell in the afternoon as I was in a rush to appear for my meeting. At this point i was just so upset as it was the straw that broke the camels back. As the day went on I did not receive a call from anyone at the hotel level and when I returned to the hotel I thought that maybe i would have received a voice mail in my room phone. NOTHING!!!!! I called the front desk and asked to speak to the Assistant General Manager and the clerk told me that she had gone home for the evening. I was asked If I wanted to speak to the front office manager and I jumped at this opportunity as it was a miracle that I got to finally speak with someone so that I could address these issues. As I introduced myself and my means of choosing the hotel and my schedule on business in Toronto I explained my distress from the beginning of check in up till my current experience. The lady seemed to be very helpful and offered me Marriott rewards points. First and foremost this is not why I was calling. If i wanted points then I would have asked. It seemed that she had no recourse and wanted to just offer give aways instead ...what I was looking for was for someone to take ownership of the situations I addressed. Now this was over the phone and she seemed to cut me off almost everytime I was trying to talk or suggest anything. It was quite frusterating and at this point I simply replied with \"Thank you for trying to breed the situations at hand but i dont think you simply understand what you are able to do\" and I wish you a nice evening\". Again I must stress that I travel quite abit and I chose this hotel because I saw the spacious rooms and wanted to try something new. Yes the hotel offers breakfast and internet and dinner some nights of the week but all of these perks are not going to over compensate service. I would rather pay a full room rate and feel welcome and respected. I guess this is what you get when you pay a low rate. All I can say is that I tried this hotel and I will never use it again or reccommend it to any one of my family members, friends or trusted corporate partners. I hope for anyone who travels like me and decides to choose this hotel receives a more professional trial than my collegues and I received.

We selected the hotel based on the rave reviews it had received on TripAdvisor, and we were not disappointed. The trip to Toronto was to celebrate our son's 14th birthday (taking in a Leafs game, a Raptors game, and some shopping at the Eaton Centre during our stay). We booked a basic king suite, the least expensive room offered at this property. We arrived at 10:30 a.m., well before the hotel check in time of 3 p.m., as the Raptors game started at 1 p.m. We decided to find out if we could park the car before we officially checked in, to avoid having to search (and pay) for parking at the Air Canada Centre. Parking was included with our package rate of $209 per night (this included the room, valet parking, buffet breakfast, and $25 Petro Canada gift card). To our delight, the very friendly and accomodating staff member at the front desk offered to secure us a room right at that moment, so we could unload our belongings and get settled in without having to wait until after the game. Fantastic! She even placed us in a corner room with a view of the CN Tower, to ensure we had as much space as possible. The room was (as others have said) as well laid out and equipped as any apartment I've ever been in. The room was very spacious and had a very \"homey\" feel. The quality funishings in were in excellent shape, and the full kitchen had everything you could need, including a dishwasher. It was spotlessly clean and maintained. Probably one of the most immaculate rooms we've ever stayed in. We frequented the pool and hot tub area daily. It is small but perfectly adequate, particularly since we never saw another single soul in the pool or hot tub the entire time we were there. Fitness area adjoins the pool, which seemed to be utilized by guests at all times (pool is open until 11 p.m., however the fitness room is 24-hour). Again, these areas were maintained to a fault....they were spotless. Showers were well stocked with shampoo and shower gel, and again immaculately clean. Tons of towels were on hand at all times. Plenty of seating for those not swimming. Beautiful bright lighting overhead. The hot tub was piping hot (sooooo nice!) and the pool temperature was very, very comfortable. The buffet breakfast was absolutely fantastic. Make-your-own waffles (with syrup, fruit sauce and whipped cream for toppings), breakfast potatoes with cheese sauce on the side, bacon and/or sausage, scrambled eggs, hard boiled eggs, hot oatmeal with multiple toppings, fresh whole fruits, fruit salad, cold cereals, yogurt, muffins, donuts, every kind of bread you can think of were unlimited each day. Day two also included pancakes in place of the bacon (sausage was the only meat offered that morning). Three kinds of juices, white milk (with Nestle Quik on the side), coffee and tea were offered as beverages. We always found seating (no difficulties there, as others have reported) though some mornings it was reasonably full. The buffet was replenished quickly and efficiently as supplies dwindled, and the staff was very attentive in cleaning away plates and prepping tables for the next guests. The room itself is very welcoming and inviting, with a large TV set to local news and traffic. We found the valets to be fast, friendly, and extremely helpful in loading and unloading our belongings. Our car appeared within moments of requesting it. Always a genuine smie and a kind wish for a good day in Toronto. Location wise, it was perfect. A very easy 10-15 minute walk to Union Station and the Air Canada Centre. The walk to the Eaton Centre was longer, but still doable (cold in January though, would recommend this for warmer weather!!!). We saved ourselves a bundle on parking by simply walking where we needed to go. Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday evenings, there is a light buffet served in the breakfast room in the evenings. We frequented this \"Manager's Reception\" on the Monday evening, and induldged in mini hamburgers with all the fixings, grilled chicken skewers, falafel, cold pop, coffee and tea, homemade cookies, and nanaimo bars. The menus for each Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday night for the current month are handily listed on the fridge in each room, so you'll know ahead of time if you're interested in what they're serving. The Tuesday evening we were there, it was \"Sports Night\" and they offered bratwurst, pretzels, veggie dogs, etc. Other themes included soup night, fajitas, etc. All complimentary to guests. Wireless internet was free, easy to connect to, fast and reliable. There is a small business centre next to the Fitness room with two computers available, and a 15-minute time limit posted. Children are prohibited from this room. The day we checked out, we chatted on the way home about what I would say in our review of this hotel. We gushed to each other about how bright and clean the property was, how perfectly is was located in the downtown, how friendly everyone was (from the cleaning staff to the front desk). So when I asked the hubby and son what NEGATIVES they could come up with, the car became very quiet. After a few moments, my son said quiety....\"well Mom, I guess if I could find one bad thing, I'd say that the cheese sauce on the breakfast buffet could have been warmer\". If that's the only thing we could find wrong, I'd say we picked a winner. Congrats Residence Inn Toronto Downtown, you have three more loyal customers.

It was spotlessly clean, lots of lovely fluffy white towels every day and the housekeeping staff were great at getting extra towels if we needed them. Breakfast was buffet style with plenty of variety to suit all tastes. It was busy over the christmas period with an Islamic convention and it was difficult to get a table for the couple of days, however it was possible to bring your breakfast to your own room if you didnt want to wait for a table. Leisure centre with pool and separate exercise room was small but well maintained and very clean. Again lovely fluffy white towels. No restriction on hours of use - pool was open till 11 pm and exercise room open 24/7. Access is by your room key card. There was a wash room on the 17th floor with 2 washers and 2 dryers and a detergent dispenser - wash and tumble dryer cost 2 dollars each and powder dispenser was 1 dollar for each product. It was also accessible by your room key card.

Yan at Reception was Mr. Wonderful and helped make our holiday very special. Shawn, Paul & Kevin were also wonderful as were all the staff but these 4 were our main contacts throughout our holiday. We had a bit of a scare on New Years Eve/Day at 2 am when the Fire Alarms were set off on the 11th floor [by young revellers staying at the hotel]. My 11 year old was a little upset but the staff handled the situation with calm professionalism and everything settled down as soon as the Fire Chief had given the all clear. This incident was not of the hotels making but they dealt with it without fuss and kept us advised of what was happening. The area is quiet but exactly what we had wanted. Within a couple of minutes walk to the entrance of the CN tower and Rogers Centre and a further 5 minutes walk to the Quay area. Our nearest subway was at St. Andrews and was easily accessible by the path just a few hundred metres away from us in the Metro /Roy Thomson Hall. We did ice skating every day at the Queens Quay Natrel Rink and a couple of times at the Nathan Phillips Square. Hire of skates was $7 CAD at the quay and $9 at Nathan Phillips. Both well worth the money. Family day pass on the subway was only $9 and it was a great way to travel. Did all the sights on the City Pass. Again well worth the money.

Started with check-in, when seeing that we were a family of four (two daughters in their 20's wanting to do a mini-vacation with parents...nice), guest services representative offered a complimentary upgrade to a two-bedroom suite, and he did so with great pleasure. Later, I thanked him for doing so, and he replied, \"If I can make someone's stay better, I'll do all I can to do so.\" That attitude carried over to every staff member I met over three days, from desk, to housekeeping, to maintenance, to management. Award winning approach to customer service. The hotel itself is very comfortable. Our suite was the biggest hotel room in which I've ever stayed; two-bedrooms (one with King bed, other with Queen), two bathrooms, two vanity areas (important with two \"20-somethings\"). Had to have been close to 1000 square feet. Breakfast was, as others noted, indeed crowded at times, but that's pretty much the norm at most Residence Inn's, if they're running close to a full house. Hotel is two or three blocks from most restaurants, small grocers, and the Provincial liquor/beer/wine store. About 1 1/2 blocks from the nearest subway stop, which will whisk you all over Toronto. Parking is expensive, but I found a parking garage about a 10 minute walk from hotel for $12 per 24 hour period. For me, a 10-12 minute stroll is worth saving $23 per night on a three night stay.

We arrived after a grueling 8 hour drive from NY to the hotel. We were greeted at the door by the doorman who helped us with all of our luggage and advised us about parking options. We decided to valet our car, but there are numerous parking lots all around the hotel. I checked in at the front desk quickly and we were then directed to our room on the 20th floor. The room was HUGE! The room had a king size bed, 2 lounging chairs, a desk and chair, a pull out couch and a full kitchen with a dining table and chairs. The room was spotless and smelled fresh and clean. The heat was up very high when we arrived. We turned the thermostat down to 67 degree F, and we were still quite comfortable. The bedding was clean and warm, and the bed was roomy and comfortable. The bathroom was large with an amazing shower head. I have very thick hair, and it was so easy to rinse the soap and conditioner out of my hair with the water pressure from the shower head. My children swam in the pool. It was small, but good enough for a swim. My husband enjoyed the hot tub, which he found very relaxing. There was a gym right off the pool area which was small and had a couple of machines and some weights. There was also an office with a couple of computers in the same area. I only had two complaints about the hotel ... One was the towels in the room. They consistantly left only 3 towels in the bathroom when we had 4 guests. Two was the free breakfast. It;s a great concept, but unfortunately, we never got a chance to enjoy it because it was so crowded. We could not get anywhere near the buffet area. The room where breakfast is served is VERY small and cannot accomodate the number of guests in a 22 floor hotel. Parking did cost $35 per night if you valeted your car. Wayne Gretsky's restaurant is right around the corner, and the Hockey Hall of Fame is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. We ate dinner at Jack Astor's Bar & Grill where we had delicious food in a fun and festive atmosphere. Beyond these two complaints, I have nothing bad to say about the hotel.

On arrival, I was driving and couldn't spot the hotel entrance before circling the block a few times. (Hint, drive south on Wellington and stay in the left hand curb lane). There is only a small marquee and no one was outside. You have to onload at curbside, and at 4pm there were only three porter/valet parkers for the hotel. The lobby is so small that two families checking in at the same time would fill it. More about the public areas: There is a breakfast-reception area which sports free food every morning, plus buffet dinner on Monday thru Wed nights (Not on Thursday now). The food is very good! A frugal family could eat a big (good) breakfast and a decent early dinner here Mon-Wed and not spend another thing on chow. And unlike most free hotel buffets, the hotel allows and even encourages guests to take food back to the room. On the minus side of this, the area gets crowded, and one might share an elevator with folks balancing their heaping plates of food. One more thing about the crowded public spaces. Besides the lobby and food area, there is a small bar open until 11pm. All of these areas are served by only two one-person toilets. And, the poor concierge has her little desk jammed in between these two toilet entrances. In summary, one should not expect a high level of service, or elegance and formality at this hotel. If this were a blog I would expect to be flamed at this point. But in my defense, I will assert that I smile at everyone, enjoy the multi-kid families (who all also seemed smiling at their travels to this hotel) and tip happily. But there are so many pluses here. The rooms are large, very well equipped, clean, well decorated, quiet, with nice beds and linens. All of the staff are friendly. The maids arrive every morning to clean, and do the dishes too. The hotel is very close to baseball and convention center. The hotel information book recommends the Kit Kat, a happily crowded small mid-level Italian restaurant around the corner, which was so to our liking that we dined there three times. Try the mussels. For joggers, trot south on Spadina and then go west on the bike trail. As far as you want. I made it to Humber Bay parks, but I think you can run another dozen miles at least...The fitness center at the hotel has eight high-end machines, small pool and hot tub. So...other local hotels have the breathtaking lobbies and fuller service and this Residence Inn will be a better or worse choice for you, depending.

It was also cheaper than 2 separate rooms plus more convenient. One room had an ensuite, the other a bathroom right across the small hallway within the suite, so very similar to having your own facilities for each couple. Or if you had kids and they could share a bed (both rooms had a large double bed, I am not sure if any of the beds can be split into twins or there are some with twin beds?) you would find it better than having the kids in a different room, and much more spacious than one room with a couple of extra beds crammed in. We didn't use it much but there was also a very impressive kitchen facility so were you a family with kids this would be a great place to cater for yourself or just eat in with catered food (there was a menu provided of local places that would deliver). Very large refrigerator, plus cooker, microwave. Some evenings (not sure how many) there was free food provided from about 530 to 7 which could mean you could even skip dinner if you wanted, breakfasts were very good (and included in our room rate.) The breakfast area got pretty busy but we did always (just) manage to get a table, really its a little on the small side if the hotel is full as it was when we were there and I did see a few people having got their breakfast take it up to their rooms so you could always do that if you preferred it, or pick a time outside the \"rush hour\" of 830 through 9. In the immediate area is the CN Tower, a baseball park (Rogers Centre/BlueJays) a very nice 'clubby' area a couple of blocks away with clubs, restaurants, bars and a very good vibe. The Eton centre was about 20 minutes walk away. Other places like the RO museum and the renovated brewery area were a $15-$20 cab ride. Reception was friendly and check-in efficient, the rooms were kept very clean by a good maid service. I booked directly with the hotel on the Marriott website, we paid about $370 Canadian per night for our double suite, it was the same price at other websites I looked. There were cheaper hotels in Toronto but none that had as nice 2 bedroom suites that I could find. Our rate included breakfast for 4 adults, free valet parking for our stay, and some RO museum tickets. Compared to other places and taking the cost of extras such as breakfast and parking, that seemed like a good deal especially given the excellent location. There were some PC's provided with printing capability (we checked in online from them and printed out our return boarding passes) but at times internet access was so slow as to be useless and we had to come back a few hours later (annoying when you are trying to grab some good seats on a flight otherwise wouldn't really have mattered). Also a small gym and swimming pool neither of which were usually busy when I looked.

Some nights are BBQ night or pizza night! Last, the staff is unbelievably helpful and friendly. We travel a lot, and we had never received such great service.

Even the most cynical traveller would be hard pressed to find anything wrong at this property. From the moment we arrived at the front desk, for an early check-in, my friends and I were impressed. Mary, was more than pleasant and she had already arranged a complimentary upgrade from a studio to a one bedroom suite. The room was lovely, spacious and immaculate, however I had originally requested a King bed and this room had a Queen. When I called from the suite, Mary was only too happy to upgrade us once again to the two bedroom suite. Upon returning to the front desk for new keys, she had already swiped the cards and had them waiting. Pleasant and efficient! What more could you ask for? The two bedroom suite was HUGE and again, immaculate. Perfect for three gals who were in the city to enjoy some live theatre. After a matinee performance of Dirty Dancing (excellent!!!) we had a lovely dinner a Penelopes and returned to the hotel just in time for the tail end of the Manager's Reception. What a concept - the Manager, Beth, was actually AT the reception and mingling with the guests. She sat down at our table and we had a lovely conversation with her. We filled her in on what a fantastic hotel experience we were having thus far. Her pride was evident in both the property and her staff, as it should have been. After a wonderful night's sleep on comfy beds, we enjoyed an excellent hot buffet breakfast. If I HAD to find some way this hotel could improve, it would be this minor suggestion, and one that mainly comes from an environmentally friendly standpoint: The shower curtain liners are too short, or the bars for the shower curtains have been hung too high. The result is a pool of water on the floor that is unavoidable when you shower. I would guess that at least one towel from every occupied guest room is used just mopping up the floor. What a huge savings in laundry over time if this small problem could be eliminated. I hesitate to even write one negative thing in this review, however I am confident that Beth and her staff will accept this criticism in the spirit it is intended and endeavour to correct the problem. I am returning to Toronto in February for another theatre performance and will most definitely be staying at this Residence Inn again.

It boasts a brand new building, new furniture, friendly desk staff, in-room amenities, and is one of the few city hotels that has a pool. This review will be a long one, so I will break it down to the best of my ability. Also, feel free to look at the pictures I have included with this review also. Location: The Residence Inn (Marriott affiliated) Downtown/Entertainment District Toronto is nestled within the Financial, Entertainment, and Fashion districts of Toronto. The property is located on Wellington Street, which is a one-way street that goes in the West direction. Other streets connected to Wellington within sight of the hotel are Spadina and John streets. One block north, and connected to both of these streets is King St. West, which has many many different bars, restaurants, and attractions such as a theater that was showing the Sound of Music during our stay (End of December 2008 - Beginning of January 2009). The hotel is fairly easy to find, but there is not much of an overhang in front of the hotel, so if you arrive by a car and there are a few others arriving at the same time, you may be a few yards/meters away from the entrance of the hotel. Arrival and Check-in: As you arrive (we arrived by car, so this is the only experience I can solidify), you must park your car on the left side of the street near the curb in front of the hotel. A bellman will greet you (or as in our case, you may have to go into the hotel to grab the attention of one) and will load up your suitcases and belongings onto a cart. He then gives your keys to another person who parks your car (parking is only valet, at a partially reasonable $30 CAD a night). Check-in was as breeze, as was asking a few questions about the surrounding area. The desk staff had maps and would draw out where the location of the hotel was and would show you how to get to the location you were wanting to go to. Then the bellman took up our bags to the room with us. There are 3 elevators in the hotel and 22 floors total. When the hotel is busy (on New Years Eve, it was 100% full and waits were around 5-10 minutes) the waits get a bit long, but when it is normal, you usually only have to wait 1 or 2 minutes. We were on the 19th floor, room 1914. The Room: Our room was the One-Bedroom Suite. It was very well laid out, one of the biggest city hotel rooms I've ever stayed in. You could probably fit about 2 or 3 roll away beds inside the living area easily. The living area had a sofa-bed with a lounge chair. It also had a 32\" LCD TV and a desk and chair, along with a sitting area with two chairs. Connected to this space was the full kitchen. It had a toaster, full size 2-door Refrigerator/Freezer, small dish washer, 2 hot zone stove top, and a conventional microwave. The drawers and cabinets had everything you could need to cook and eat - bowls, pots, small and large plates, glasses, wine glasses, silverware, etc. They also include dish soap and a powder packet for the dish washer. The queen bed was separated into another room, by a door. It had a 32' LCD TV in it and night stands, one holding a fairly nice alarm clock (no iHome though). The one bathroom in the whole \"suite\" was in the bed room, which was a bit of a hassle since someone was sleeping on the sofa bed and had to come in to use the bathroom. The sink area is also separated from the toilet and shower, which I believe is the Canadian style. Also, another annoying thing was that the fan came on with the light for the toilet/shower room which woke us up every time someone used it during the night. The queen bed was more on the soft side, which we liked so it was perfect. The sofa bed was- well, lets just say, like any sofa bed, uncomfortable. Also, the sheets that were stowed away in the closet for it were damp, so we called down for new ones (which were brought up promptly). The Hotel's Breakfast and Surrounding Area: As mentioned in many of the reviews of this hotel on Trip Advisor, the hotel's breakfast area, dubbed the \"hearth room\" is very small for a hotel of this size. I do have to agree with that statement as well. Although not very much of a burden, the breakfast in the morning is very busy non-stop. Each day of our stay, there was always a good 5-10 people up at the buffet area waiting to get food. The good thing was was that for our stay, they lengthened the break fast hours so instead of having it from 7:30 AM to 9 AM, they held it until 11 AM (12 PM even on New Years Day!) which helped a lot. As I mentioned before, the hotel was 100% full New Years eve and so the hotel planned ahead and swapped out small tables and replaced them with much bigger tables to accommodate the larger crowd, consisting of many college aged people whom were dressed like they just got out of bed (pretty funny actually, but don't worry, they all checked out New Years Day). Anyways, the breakfast, while the same each and every day, was for the most part very good. They offered the typical scrambled eggs, sausage (had bacon once), home fries, cereals, fruit and oat meal, and pastries. They also had a waffle iron in which you can make your own Belgium waffles (they even had strawberry topping for them which you could add to your waffle at your discretion). They also had milk, and four juices to choose from. Around the hotel, there were a few choices for food. We ate at this Indian restaurant called Aroma, which was very good (located on the intersection of Kings St. West and John St., a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Also, there is a very good flat style gourmet pizza restaurant, Pizza Rustica, a short walk in the West direction down Wellington st. and crossing it at the first street you come to. Also, right next to that, is a small convenience store which sells many food items as well as magazines and DVDs. This is the same store that the hotel uses to get groceries for the guests at the hotel (the Residence Inn allows you to give the desk staff a list of groceries you want, and they will get them for you for only the price it cost for the items you wanted). On a side note, the CN tower is a easy walk two blocks away at most from the hotel. The Pool, Gym, and Computer Area: All located on the second floor of the hotel are the Pool, Gym, and \"Business Centre.\" While small, the pool is very nice and although I did not swim in it, I heard that it was nice. It also has a small jacuzzi right next to it. right next to the pool is a gym. The gym has two treadmills, two bikes, and a cross trainer along with weights. It has a television on the wall, but on the two bikes, there are integrated televisions so you can watch your own program. Right next to the gym is the \"Business Centre.\" It is basically a small small room that has two adequate computers with internet access so you can check your email and other various things. The room also has a printer. If those two computers were occupied, there was also another computer in the hearth room, next to the bar area. A side note here is that you must be 16 or older in order to use the computers and I believe it is the same for the gym or there has to be an adult with the child. You also need your room key card to use any of these. Check Out: Our experience was quick and painless (aside from an additional room phone charge misunderstanding, which was easily subtracted from our bill) and got us on our way quickly. The bell man was just as attentive as he was when we arrived at the hotel. We paid $179 a night Canadian a night which was a great deal, through the hotel's website. Overall: This hotel was great and I will definitely recommend it to anyone who is going to travel to Toronto. It isn't #1 on TripAdvisor in Toronto for nothing.", "Date": "January 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ann Arbor, MI", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "JulesKW", "ReviewID": "UR22729271", "Content": "Had tickets to a concert at the Air Canada Centre and started looking for a hotel.

No 2 bedrooms available when we arrived, but we could PAY for a cot each night, she said. I forget how much it was, but it was over $30 a night! I said no thanks. It would have been nice if they had included that, since they knew I wanted a 2 bedroom and was given a 1 bedroom, but oh well. $ 300 night, plus the numerous taxes and valet parking... close to $400 a night.

Breakfast was WAY too busy for the size of the space. This hotel is too big for what it has to offer. They even tell you take your breakfast to your room, as there isn't enough space. We had to wait in line for awhile. Not the staff's fault, but the eating area is way too small. Valet parking only. $30 a day. When we went to get our car, we were told to go to the desk, not to call ahead, as they have no space to leave your car when they bring it up. There is NO parking or \" stop area\" at the front of the hotel. So we got our car and it was COVERED and I mean COVERED in bird feces. We couldn't see out of the window, so he turned on the wipers and smeared it all across. It was obviously left under a bird perch or something. It was ridiculous. But he just left it like that.

I've stayed there twice before and enjoyed it each time. Every room I've stayed in comes with a full kitchen (fridge, dishwasher, stovetop, dishes, utensils) and at least two work spaces (great when I travel with my wife). I did quite a lot of work in the room - I found the wireless internet a little slow at times, but nothing disastrous. Each room also has a sitting area with a funky chaise-lounge couch and a recliner - the large flatscreen tv swivels so that you can watch it from your sitting area or from the comfy king-sized bed. It was great having a comfortable sitting area and nice tv - on nights I didn't feel like going out, I could entertain easily in my room. The hotel does not have room service but they provide you with plenty of order-in options. They'll even go grocery shopping for you if you want - the cost of the groceries appears on your bill but the shopping service itself is free. And there's a little \"market\" in the lobby with snacks and such (very overpriced but handy in a pinch). The layout of the room made it easy for me to unpack and keep my things organized - I really appreciated the ample storage space in the room and in the bathroom. The room was always clean and fresh - I have bad allergies that are made worse by Toronto's occasional smog, but the climate-controlled room cut down on the amount of Benadryl I usually have to take. I appreciated that the cleaning staff cleaned around my things without disturbing them. The front desk staff were always very helpful and the staff at breakfast were very friendly. Breakfast is included in the room rate - your usual hot and cold hotel buffet but enough variety that I could have something a little different every morning. The front door/valet parking staff were super as well - always got me where I needed to go! From a location point of view, there were lots of coffee shops and restaurants to choose from - it was a short walk to theatres and movies and only a block from two major streetcar lines.

Well, the Marriott chain has outdone itself with this Residence Inn location. I believe it is newly built which is why the room is spotless and not showing any wear yet. Although the hot breakfast buffet is pretty standard fare you can't complain - complimentary breakfast is better than none. Everything about the room was amazing: upgraded lighting fixtures, super-comfy bed with high thread count sheets, granite (or something like granite) counters in the kitchen and bath, upgraded work desk and table, large bathroom, flat panel TV (that swivels almost 360 degrees), easy to control room temperature settings, nice kitchen appliances and kitchenware (not the cheap stuff). Super comfortable - truly a home away from home. We're used to less than stellar service from Torontonians in the service industry, but the staff here are friendly, well trained, and efficient. A total surprise for us! Maybe Toronto is changing its ways. The only complaint is the thin door and huge gap at the bottom of the door which makes any hallway noise seem like it's coming from your own room. I usually save 5 star ratings for very high end hotels but this one deserves it!

(Another day, our alert maid told us we had left our room door ajar the day before and showed us how to close the door all the way. DUH!!) A few tips: 1. Most maps won't show it, but there's an easier way than Blue Jays Way to walk to the Tower. From the hotel's street corner, look southeast and you'll see the CN and the ball park. Walk that way abnd you'll cross the RR tracks via a pedestrian bridge. 2. There's a small, 24 hour grocery store on the corner of Blue Jays a block north of Rogers Centre. 3. Wellington is a one-way street, but it's not congested. 4. Don't repeat my stupid tourist trick. The first morning, I didn't see a newspaper bin.

All the staff were incredibly friendly; whenever we stepped into the elevator, if any staff member was there also they would smile and say Welcome, and ask how our stay was so far. The cleaning staff were utterly outstanding. I wanted to pack them into my suitcase and bring them all home with me. Kind, efficient, excellent! Our room was perfect in every way, including the view, and I was truly surprised as to how quiet it was! We're fairly certain the floor was concrete under the wood subfloor, which made for a very quiet stay. We barely heard a peep from anyone else. The decor of the rooms was fresh and nice, and the kitchen was clean and well-equipped. The bathroom was a tad small but it certainly fit one person at a time. The pool and hot tub are smaller than they seem in the pictures and you need to know the floor of the pool area has about 1/10 inch of water within a 12\" - 18\" perimeter around the pool. However, we spent many evenings there and so did other families, and we all had a blast. Just don't expect a large space and don't wear your socks to the area. There is free breakfast every morning and also free dinners some nights, which was a wonderful bonus. The bartender, Randolph, is also a magician and entertained our young son greatly. The location of the hotel was awesome; a couple of blocks away from the CN Tower, Rogers Center and the subway. Toronto's transit system was impeccable and we were glad for the close proximity of the subway to the hotel. There are also a number of small grocery stores within a block or two of the hotel so you can easily stock your kitchen. The whole area was great. Oh, and if you're there before September 2008, the Diesel Playhouse around the corner is featuring Evil Dead: The Musical. A must see, if you liked the movie franchise! Have I mentioned how friendly and accommodating the staff were? It cannot be said enough. They were really something. Two small caveats: 1) Local phone calls cost $ 1.50 each. We didn't know this. After 9 days we'd racked up $ 30.00 in phone calls! No biggie, but it would have been nice to know this beforehand. So now you know. 2) The mattress on the sofa bed was the kind of mattress I have on mine at home; the kind you utilize in order to keep company from staying too long. It was thin and the springs made it lumpy. I made the bed using the cushions from the couch also, and my son liked it then. Otherwise, if a larger person sleeps on it (larger than a 7-year-old) you might want to request extra comforters and towels for padding. Neither of these concerns put me off my rating of 5 stars for this hotel. I will gladly stay here again and have enthusiastically recommended to everybody I talk to. I'm glad to have found this place; it made an awesome trip into a perfect trip. I have such good memories of this vacation and a big part of it was thanks to this hotel.

We chose it because of the positive Trip Advisor reviews, its newness, and the good rate we found. The hotel didn't disappoint - it looked new and modern throughout, and the rooms are great. Rooms Since it's a Residence Inn, the standard rooms come with more than the average hotel room: a kitchenette and 2-seat table, a small sitting area (couch, chair, and coffee table), plus the usual king-sized bed, and a large bathroom. The flat-screen television rotated so it could be watched from the couch or from the bed, which I thought was pretty cool. Everything was spotless and very new-looking. Hotel Front desk - staff was very friendly and helpful, and we checked in and out with no trouble at all. They also gave us maps and reliable directions for getting to the main sites. We used the gym one morning - small room with two treadmills, two bikes, an elliptical, and some free weights. The usual hotel gym setup, with a tv hanging from the ceiling. Equipment was clean and all in working order. We didn't use the (indoor) pool, but the gym looks right out on it. Pretty small, but it looked like there was hot tub too. Breakfast - part of the room rate, so we had it the morning we left. Nice layout of breakfast standards: scrambled eggs, bacon, pastries, as well as cereal, yogurt, and some fruit. Most noticeably, the servers at breakfast were very friendly and helpful, even though they were very busy with a room full of hungry, sleepy guests. Location Pretty good for tourists. Nothing really within a block of the hotel, but only a few minutes walk to the CN tower, the waterfront area, some nightlife, and we even walked to the Distillery district - about 25 minutes, but pleasant even on a cold day because the sun was out. Parking As I recall, the hotel charges $30/day for parking, and the garages nearby are similarly priced (and sketchier), so this can add a significant amount to your bill, just be prepared.

It was $4/half-hour all the time, with a $13 max 6am-6pm, $10 max for evening event parking, $5 overnight, and then it starts again. Overall we had a great stay. Very clean and new hotel.

We picked this hotel because it was rated as the #1 Hotel in Toronto....plus it is new and that is always a bonus! I also found the rates a bit high. We were traveling for business and pleasure. We booked a 4 night stay and requested a high floor with a decent view...about 2 weeks ahead of time. Upon check in we were told that there was a note to be upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite if available...of course this excited us, my son was ecstatic! Unfortunately there wasn't one available, but we could check the next morning for an upgrade. We were sent off to our room only to find out that they stuck us in the tiniest room with a view of some sort of fan system (absolutely no sunshine)....oh and the room was on the lowest floor possible!!! The room had empty candy wrappers all over the room (at this point I am now thinking that the room is not as clean as it appears)! Of course I am now very disappointed that I gave up a great deal to stay at the Sheraton Centre (Club Level). I phoned the Front Desk and was told that they really didn't have any rooms with great views...if you stand outside of the hotel it is very clear that they do in fact have a great view and it is of the CN Tower\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6apparently this is not considered a great view. They did say that they could move us to a room that was a bit larger (if a guest is staying for 4 nights why would you put them in the smallest room possible anyways?)\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I opted to stay considering I was told that the chances of us getting upgraded to a 2 bedroom the next day was likely. Later that evening (11ish) we were getting ready for bed only to find out that the sofa bed was bare with no sheets or pillows in sight? Supposedly you need to request this service? If there is 3 people staying in the room and there is one bed and one sofa bed, where do they think the 3rd person is going to sleep? We ended up waiting about \u00c2\u00bd hour before getting the sheets and pillows.

The suites are a deal as the beds are big enough for 2 to sleep comfortably and the pull out sofa can accomodate 2 people. The kitchens allow you ample room and kitchenware to cook - micro, dishes, big fridge, coffee pot etc. Perfect set up if you don't want to eat all your meals out. 2 large bathrooms in the 2 bedroom suites with ample towels and bath products. TVs are flat screen and good. Hot breakfast is nice. Evening happy hour has some good snacks and if the Tin Whistle Brewery is hosting FREE BEER!!! 2-3 blocks from Rogers Centre, CN Tower and walking distance to good restaurants and entertainment.

If you are in Toronto to go to plays, Second City and the symphony, this hotel is right there within walking distance of everything. It's five blocks to the subway, but only a block and a half to a cable car that will take you to the subway. The Airport Express bus doesn't come to this hotel--leaves you at the Holiday Inn on King about a block and a half away. HOWEVER, during our nine days there, we had use of all three elevators only three days. There is no service elevator, so the staff was always using the guest elevators--they were very accomadating--if there were guests, the staff got off without a word, but it was very inefficient and I always hated that they couldn't get their work done because 1) not all the elevators worked and 2) they didn't have an elevator of their own so they could get where they were going without having to wait. We tried to use the laundry in the hotel and there was no soap in the vending machine. There was no soap anywhere in the hotel. Again, the staff was wonderful--they went to a store and bought a box of Tide for us and then left a nice little gift in our room as an apology that we had to wait 1/2 hour to do our laundry. It's not a big thing and we're not downgrading the hotel for it, but it's a symptom of a bigger problem, I think--lack of planning.

It is located within walking distance of various arenas, restaurants and bars and very walkable to the trolley or subway (is about 10 minutes). There is a parking garage on the alley behind the hotel, where we parked for a much better rate than valet, if you leave the lobby and walk to the right of the hotel, it is in the alley to your immediate right. The check-in staff was quick and professional and assigned us a room just as we requested. Our room was incredibly nice, just as everyone had stated in their reviews. As you walk in there is a full kitchen with all the amenities including a toaster, glass top oven range, fridge, microwave, dishes, paper towels, dish soap, everything you would need to cook a meal. There was a nice desk with chair (no free high speed, which was incredibly disappointing, as I thought all Residence Inn's had free high speed). There was also a fold out sofa, another chair and some tables (including a kitchen style table), so there was plenty of room to spread out. The studio suite had a nice large king sized bed that was high off the ground. Only peeve is that it was literally a foot from the windows. Noise wasn't terrible from the outside (since we were so high up), however we did get woken up a few times throughout the night with sirens and things. We didn't hear much of any inside noise, except for a few people in the hallway, so the construction must be good. There was a nice mix of feather/poly pillows on the comfortable bed and the linens were clean. There is a fantastic LG TV that had a ton of international channels with CC, it was in analog mode, but still looked quite nice. There is a large closet with ample hangers and nice new iron with ironing board. Ample drawers for your things. The bathroom was a good size and including a vanity outside the toilet/shower area. Nice soft towels. Was clean and had good water pressure. The free breakfast was wonderful, eggs, sausage, waffle maker, yogurt with toppings, oatmeal, toast, Danish, juices, coffee, etc. The wait was crazy the first morning and there was a line, I just wanted to take something to the room, and didn't want to wait. The next morning, luckily, no line. They provided a tray so I could carry my goodies to the room, was excellent. There is a business center next to the pool, was a bit too small with two PC's and printers, and the ink was out while we were there. Too many kids using it for e-mail and since it was tucked away, there was no regulation. Indoor pool looked nice. Didn't get a chance to see the exercise room. There is a Tim Horton's right around the corner (thank goodness!) and we ate at a Quizno's one night out of desperation. The snack shop in the hotel is not great, they really need to add more snacks (candy, chips, pretzels, etc.). Luckily there is also a grocery store across from the hotel. My two complaints with Toronto, a lot of the places we went to (including the subway) aren't taking credit cards just yet, so bring a lot of cash with you. Second, some of the locals don't tend to tell you how long of a walk you are getting into. A few blocks to me usually means like 3-4. We were sent on a few wild goose chases that ended up being 1-2 miles. Just be sure you map out where you want to go and understand the walking you are getting into \u00ef\ufffd\u0160 Overall, this is a clean, newer hotel in a decent part of town.

The most memorable part of our stay was the impecable service. The Marriott team is to be praised for their attentivness and politeness. Everyone from the Valet that meets you at the door to the team at the Front Desk are the most professional group that we have encountered to date (and we have stayed at MANY hotels over the years). Thank you, Marriott, for making our trip to Toronto the best.", "Date": "August 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201c5* quality\u201d", "Author": "bear79", "ReviewID": "UR8484123", "Content": "I was so excited when I arrived at this brand spanking new hotel. The King Studio was bigger than my 1br flat in London!! The room included a kitchen with everything you'd need, including dishwasher, ice machine and microwave. You get 1 bag of microwave popcorn in your room and there is even a 'popcorn' button on the microwave. They've thought of everything! The bed was super comfy and the air conditioning was much quieter than other hotels I've stayed in over the past couple of months. Breakfast had quite a good selection and there were no issues with taking a plate of food to your room to enjoy. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough! Toronto's a great City and I hope to get back to the Residence Inn again one day. (NB: We paid $140 (including tax) a night which was dirt cheap for the quality of this hotel)", "Date": "August 23, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Residence Inn by Marriott Toronto Downtown / Entertainment District", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g155019-d647813-Reviews-Residence_Inn_by_Marriott_Toronto_Downtown_Entertainment_District-Toronto_Ontario.html", "Price": "$186 - $317*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">255 Wellington Street West</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Toronto</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">Ontario</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">M5V 3P9</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "647813", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/47/a5/47a597954405cdb3cfb7f08d02d8ff541large.jpg"}}
