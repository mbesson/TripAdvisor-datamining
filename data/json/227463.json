It was very easy to get to from the airport, you take the bus and get off at Plaza Universitat and it's a 2 minute walk away. There is a metro station at Plaza Universitat too and you're also only a 5-10 minute walk from Plaza Catalunya and the top of La Rambla which for us was an ideal location to explore the city from. We were pleasantly surprised, having booked an economy room, that when we opened the door to our room it wasn't a box and actually seemed very spacious. However, I am not sure it was actually an economy room since the hotel website went to such great lengths to explain how much smaller the rooms were...We didn't have a view but weren't really bothered, it's a city afterall. The room had two large single beds, wardrobe, desk, chair and tv and a large bathroom with sink, bath/shower, bidet and toilet. It was all very clean and comfortable and you couldn't fault it. The only annoying thing was the hairdryer where you have to continually hold the button down to make it work but these seem common in hotels in Europe anyway! We paid slightly extra when we booked to have breakfast as we didn't want to waste part of the morning looking for somewhere to eat. Breakfast had a good variety of cold meat and cheese, pastries and cakes, yogurts and bacon and scrambled eggs as well as tea and coffee and was always being restocked. We found all the staff in the hotel to be polite and helpful, particularly those at reception, and had an enjoyable stay. This hotel isn't a luxury stay but for a comfortable, clean base in the heart of Barcelona you can't fault it.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel Aviv, Israel", "Title": "\u201cI feel like the hotel rob me\u201d", "Author": "Avi S", "ReviewID": "UR125538282", "Content": "This is a 3 star hotel.

The room is without ventilation and opening the window will bring the kitchen smells from the smokestack to your room. The photos on the website are giving the impression of big hotel but the front desk, entrance and room are very small. Actually I blame myself and Booking.com about that. I feel like someone robs me. The booking information at Booking.com is very selective and doesn't give you the full picture about the full price and services. This partial information maybe is a good marketing strategy by booking but not a good service to the guest. - the only point that I can give to this hotel is the good staff.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cMust stay hotel!!!\u201d", "Author": "HappyCampers2617", "ReviewID": "UR125359876", "Content": "Ok so just like you, I went through a bucket load of reviews of different hotels trying to find the best one for our trip to Barcelona! This really is the best and most useful true way to do it. This hotel gives you an excellent location right in the heart of Barcelona. 5 mins from Catalunya Square which leads to all the shops and traditional market and also bus tour routes throughout the city. Our stay at the hotel was definitely one to remember for all the right reasons. The room was smart and stylish with modern facilities including a magificent bathroom and great view of the street and bars across from it. If you are considering a short stay in the city then this is the place to be! Quiet location considering it's central spot, prime location to all tourist facilities and very good value! I'd like to add that it is definitely worth getting transfers as it's a weight of your mind and our driver was very knowledgable and willing to suggest places to eat and drink as were the staff at the front desk of the hotel who were very polite and knowledgable also!

There is an underground train station just around the corner for getting everywhere else in the city. The hotel itself is well presented, clean and tidy. Room service happened every morning while we were there. The breakfast (extra charge) is pretty good too. THE NEGATIVES: The walls of the rooms are like paper! You can hear a lot of what is going on in the room next to you. If you get a room to the front of the building be aware that it can be quite noisy a lot of the time, which may affect your sleep as was the case of a couple who were with us. Above the hotel is private apartments and while we were there the apartments were having work done. The work started at the crack of dawn and had us up from 8am! Some of the staff are not very friendly, although others were more than happy to help us if we had any requests. When we were checking out we had a rude woman who accused us of using the phone and the mini-bar. None of us did either of those things.

This small hotel is nicely furnished, rooms are good-sized and bathrooms also. Bed was comfortable, but I did not like blankets and linens. Inside room view is not nice, but in Barcelona you don't stay a lot in a room. The other thing which I noticed is that room door does not provide good protection from noise in the corridor. It doesn't have a bar or a la carte restaurant, only the breakfast hall, but breakfast is mostly not included in the price. It is better to buy it in hotel than at booking because it's cheaper.

The rooms, though small, are kept clean and tidy by an attentive housekeeping staff. Every day we came back there was always fresh bed sheets and towels. The bed was firm but comfortable and the general finish was very nice. The bathrooms are very nice with excellent powerful showers and a very nice range of toiletries which includes a sealed and new razor and shaving gel, 2 sealed and new toothbrushes with toothpaste as well as the usual soap. shoe polish, vanity kits etc. I've stayed in 5 star hotels that didn't have as nice a selection as this. The hotel is in a good location near the heart of the city, literally around the corner from a metro station and about 10 minutes walk from Catalunya square and Las Ramblas. There are a few bars and a club nearby but we didn't have much trouble with noise with the windows closed. We did have an issue with the air con on the first night not working properly so the room was really uncomfortably warm, but we were so tired from our long day that we opted to sleep through it and complain the next day. The air con then fixed itself before we got a chance to bring it up. Once it was working we were a bit scared to turn it off again so we let it run and it actually got pretty chilly after a while! I cant deny it was wonderful to come back to after a day out in the hot sun. The only other problem we had was that the walls are thin and the plumbing noisy. Every time anyone went in or out of their room or used their shower on our floor we knew about it. This was mostly a problem in the mornings as the girlfriend and I preferred to sleep in. On balance a pretty good hotel considering the location and the cost.

(It was a dream vacation!) We were also supposed to stay 1 night prior to the cruise, but our American Airlines flight was canceled and we arrived to Barcelona only hours before we were to embark the Brilliance of the Seas. Needless to say, the hotel charged us for the night even though we were a no show due to circumstances beyond our control. But that does not impact my review of this hotel. I booked with the Apsis Splendid based on the very positive reviews on Trip Advisor. I knew this hotel was not a 5 star property and that the rooms were rather small, so I had my expectations set appropriately. Overall, I was still a bit disappointed. First, the street this hotel is located on is a bit on the \"seedy\" side. It literally smelled of urine right outside the hotel. The pictures on the hotel website don't truly reflect what the hotel looks like from the outside. They must have been taken right after the shrubs were planted and the outside walls and sidewalk thoroughly cleaned with a high pressure hose and a lot of detergent. The lobby is extremely tiny--about the size of a small bedroom. There is room only for two tiny chairs from Ikea, and a tiny table for a floral arrangement, then the front desk. The personnel were overall polite and professional. The guest rooms are as tiny as our cruise stateroom. Literally, there was only room for the bed and a few suitcases. Since this is my first time in Europe, maybe my point of reference is not good. But believe me, the rooms are very, very small. The best part of the hotel is that the bathrooms are unexpectedly nice. They are tiled in marble and are very modern and clean. That is the saving grace of the Apsis Splendid: great bathrooms! We did not pay for the buffet and ate our breakfast at the local farmer's market on La Rambla. We had a 2 egg breakfast with potatoes, sausage, toast, orange juice, and coffee for 7 Euro. I imagined the hotel as being steps from La Rambla, but it is a walk to get there. It does take about 10 minutes to get to the main street. There is a bar directly across from the hotel, but it never was a problem for us. Although our window faced the street, it was quiet and we had no problem falling asleep. This hotel is very interesting in that you must insert your room key into a slot in the wall to get the electricity to work in your room. Consequently, when you leave the room, every electrical device turns off (including the air conditioning.) Only the TV and refrigerator remain operational without the key in the wall. Also, getting ice for your room is a bit of a mystery. There are no ice machines for guests, so you have to either call down stairs or go there your self. They have you wait as the scurry off somewhere and then a few minutes later, they reappear with the tiniest amount of ice. Once, the maid literally gave me a small glass with 3 ice cubes and asked if that was enough. So, they are very stingy with their ice. Another problem is the mattress. They feel very low quality and are very hard. I am used to the Hilton or Marriott mattresses in the US that make you feel like you are floating in a cloud. These mattresses are like sleeping on a piece of plywood with a little bit of padding. Regarding pick pockets in Barcelona--please be very careful with your wallet and baggage! We were warned of this, so all our money was carried in a money belt. We did not carry wallets in our pockets. One poor guest arrived at the hotel in tears, telling the front desk that she had placed her luggage down for a second to look at a map, and two guys grabbed her bags and ran off with them. She was understandably shaken. Be very careful and you should have no problems. They have all kinds of con artists--especially ones that work with accomplices that form a diversion to distract you--such as street performers or people asking for directions. So, overall, I was a little disappointed. I wanted to like this hotel and thought it would be a secret gem at a bargain price. Who knows, maybe compared with other hotels in Barcelona at this price range, it is a gem. But I think travelers should be aware of the drawbacks. I would give this place only 2 1/2 stars.", "Date": "July 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in good location\u201d", "Author": "KazandEz", "ReviewID": "UR17307093", "Content": "22-27 June 2008 Just returned from a very enjoyable trip to Barcelona staying at the Apsis Splendid Hotel.

The hotel has a great location very close to the Universitat metro stop. If arriving by bus from BCN the aerobus 1 stops at Placa Universitat and the hotel is a short walk away. Our first room was a double and was quite small but it was clean and nicely decorated. We were wakened at 7:30 on the second morning of our stay by water dripping from the ceiling in the bathroom. This was in no way the fault of the hotel as the above floor is not part of the hotel. We were immediately moved to a twin room on the same floor which was actually a much bigger room so we were happy with the result. The hotel is about 5 mins walk from Placa Catalunya and Las Ramblas but is far enough away so that a good nights sleep should be no problem. There is an open top tourbus literally around the corner and tickets can be puchased at hotel reception. They are \u20ac20 for 1 day or \u20ac24 for 2 consecutive days. This is a great way to see Barcelona's main attractions and would be recommended if this is your first visit to Barcelona. The best way to get about Barcelona however is by the metro. A single journey will cost \u20ac1,25 per person but there are multiple journey tcikets available. The one that we used was the T-10 ticket. This gives the user 10 journeys for a price of \u20ac6,90 euros and can be used by more than one person. We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel as there are loads of cafes close by. I would recommend this hotel to friends and family and would stay here again if travelling to Barcelona.

The metro is also literally right around the corner, as is a wonderful bakery and even a Starbucks if you need. Placa Catalunya is between a 5-10 minute leisurely stroll, or one easy subway stop and the shop and restaurant-filled streets Rambla de Catalunya and Passeig de Gracia are just a few minutes walk or one subway stop as well. Having this hotel as our base was so easy because of the fantastic location right by the metro, which we used several times a day with a 4-day pass. The hotel itself is a little smaller than I expected, but the rooms, although very small, were well-apointed, very clean, and the beds very comfortable. One downside was that there were no English channels whatsoever (sometimes, CNN International came in fuzzy) - this wasn't a big deal for us as we weren't in the room that much, but I mention it for those who might care. We opted to not take the breakfast for 7 euros a night, so I cannot comment on that, and instead found very good bakeries all around the hotel with croissants for just over 1 euro. There were also several convenience stores and supermarkets in the immediate area, which was nice to be able to keep water and other things in the minibar fridge (although it did not keep things very cold, it was better than nothing). I was never able to get the wireless internet to work, although I know it exists. But on the first floor there is a free computer terminal which was fine to check email, research restaurants and public transportation, and the like. There were 3-4 different people at the hotel desk that rotated throughout the day and they were very kind and helpful whenever we had a question. It is one of those hotels where your electronic key turns on the lights in the room and then you give the desk the key when you leave for the day. We never had any problems with this. All in all, for under 100 euros a night for a clean and comfortable room in such a perfect location, I think it is hard to beat. It has the amenities of a bigger establishment but the friendliness of a smaller establishment. Our room faced the street and we still had no problems with noise. It wasn't particularly hot but the room got a bit stuffy at times so the a/c was nice. We had a problem with the a/c and also the TV remote stopped working and the front desk sent people to fix both problems pretty fast, so I would say the staff was very friendly and helpful. One nice touch was that when we checked out to leave at 6:30am, the man at the desk told us which way to go to walk to Catalunya to avoid the drunkards. As two women in our 20s, that was a nice little comforting touch that made our stay at the Apsis Splendid memorable and positive. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone, especially if you book early with the hotel directly on their website and get a good deal.

Handy for tourist spots but not right in the thick of things so not too noisy. Hotel plus points. Location. Rooms basic but clean. Our room on the third floor was spacious. Breakfast excellent.

Plenty of choice with fresh fruits, ham, cheeses, cereals and english breakfast staples. Negatives. No view at all from room. Windows looked out onto other facing windows. This made the room seem dark at all times. Not too much of a problem as we spent so little time in the room. Basically it was just somewhere to sleep. Bathroom toiletries were half empty when we arrived so had already been used by someone else. Didn't get replaced until our last night. So use sparingly! When checking in they don't tell you that you have to pay extra for room safe (3 euros a night) so you go all the way up to your room and then have to come down again to sort out. Would be better if they just told you at the start. The best bit about the hotel was the reception staff who could not have been more helpful. Joseph and Albert in particular. Nothing was too much trouble. They gave lots of helpful advice on where to go etc. From the aiport in taxi cost 27 euros for 4 people and 4 small cases (cases are extra) though our meter was already running when we got in it. Not sure if this is normal practice. We decide to brave the bus going back as by then we were more aware of our bearings. Bus goes from nearby square (5-10mins away) and costs 3.90 euros each. Buses run very regularly. We did the Barcelona open top bus tour (orange bus) which I was disappointed with. Commentary was by headphones which was a little boring. Noticed another bus company were doing live commentary which I would have preferred. Wished we had done that one. Fountains of Montjuic were worth seeing. Try to go at night to get a better effect as they use lights as well as music. La Ramblas very interesting at all times. Lots of live entertainment.

We were really pleased with the hotel, the Reception staff were friendly at all times, our room was very clean and cleaned every day during our stay.

You can buy a ticket that you can use 10 times in one zone and we found it didn't expire after a day and ended up being able to use it for 3 days, which came in very handy when our feet were aching. I would recommened the bus tour as this is a great way to see the best sites in the city. We tried seeing the sites ourselves for a few days and didn't see as much as we did on our 1 day on the bus and gets pretty tiring doing it on foot! The bus does get quite busy but is definatly worth it. The evenings we mainly stayed around Las Ramlas area as this was close to our hotel and where we found plenty of restaurants. We did eat in one restaurant on Las Ramblas (its upstairs and looks posh) that we were quite disappointed with, we had to wait 20 mins for our table but as it looked so nice we didn't mind.

Well I did it this time and overall I must say I enjoyed the stay but with some minor issues. Generally speaking, the hotel is clean and tidy with contemporary furnishing and the marble bathrooms are simply beautiful, much like how the website describes. Best yet, the location and the price is unbeatable if you book it early from the website - 60~65 euro for a 3-star hotel double room per day. Can't beat it! However, this is not to say the hotel didn't have its problem. The third floor where I stayed at is in the midst of roof-repairing so the whole ceiling throughout the hallway was ripped out and construction started everyday early in the morning. The guestroom I was given is somewhat problematic - while the room is spacious, the wall is bit bang up and the carpet is not quite as clean. Also the noise from other guest rooms at 2:00am was really annoying...... Overall, I will still consider this hotel above average, I just wish I stayed at a different floor with a different room then my experience would have been greatly enhanced. Hopefully my next return to this hotel would be a much better experience.", "Date": "January 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami Beach", "Title": "\u201cGreat value if you reserve ahead.\u201d", "Author": "InMiami", "ReviewID": "UR6183321", "Content": "We stayed at the Hotel Splendid for 4 nights in mid-October. I made the reservation 9 months before our trip to get the best rates. I used their internet site which was easy to follow except for one issue; ordering their breakfast. If you opt for their breakfast buffet at time of reservation a half-price option is presented. At the time of our reservation that would have been 6 dollars each. I missed that screen which was unfortunate because it would have been a good deal. Our double room cost 89 Euros for a Wednesday and Thursday and 105 Euros for Friday and Saturday. As the date for our trip approached I continued to monitor the hotel internet site and the price eventually doubled! The tip here is to reserve as early as possible. The room was on the small side but nicely furnished and quite comfortable. Free Wi-Fi was available in the room as well as air-conditioning, small frig and cable TV with the all important English CNN. The modern, elegant bath room was done in wall-to-wall marble with double sinks and a glass enclosed shower/bath. Our room faced a small air shaft that was quiet but certainly had no view. The area is near Plaza Catalunia which is close to all the sights and in a relatively safe area. The university is one block away. All and all we liked the Splendid.

Hotel is very convenient to Airport bus when arriving-bus (\u20ac3.75 each) stops at Gran Via-Universitat. From there walk back on Gran Via for 100 metres, turn left into Calle Muntaner and hotel is left hand side of street. Arrived before 12 noon but there was no problem checking in. Front desk was very friendly and helpful at all times and offered us a choice of a bright room in the front of the hotel or a dark quiet room in the rear. We took the quiet room knowing how noisy Spanish cities can be late at night and figuring that we wouldn't be spending many daylight hours in the room. The room was quiet,was clean and perfectly adequate. It was cleaned each day but we returned on the last day we were there at 4.30pm- after a long and warm day walking intending to get showered and changed before going to see La Font Magica in front of Palau Nacional (don't miss this)and then on for a meal-and the room hadn't been serviced. We went back out and returned at 6.30pm. and all was perfect-think this was purely a glitch given that the day (Good Friday) was a public holiday. We didn't have breakfast in hotel so can't comment on quality or price. There is coffee/hot water/teabags all day in the breakfast room and internet (slow) access on a computer outside the breakfast room. The hotel is conveniently located -the Universitat metro station is about 200 metres away, Placa de Catalunya and the Ramblas about 10 minutes walk, and La Barcelonetta is about a 30 minute walk. Returning to the Airport the best option is probably a taxi as the Airport bus departs from Placa de Catalunya outside El Corte Ingles-and the train also departs from there. It would be possible to take the metro from Universtad (lifts to platform) to Catalunya (lifts from platform to street level).
