This hotel however has quite good sized hallways, rooms and bathrooms. Bigger than most. But, that is where the feeling of luxury ends. The hotel also serves as a language center which might be the reason why the cafe and restaurant areas are dark (to save electricity perhaps?) and very very basic. The hallways smell clean but the chemical smell is rather \"in your face\". For food a small shop next to the lobby area sells fruit juices, some sandwiches and some local foods, for anything more you really need to go out. Out is about a 15 to 20 minute walk to the famous Orchard street with it's many Starbucks and other western brandstores. That is also where all the public transport is. With the temprature being what it is in Singapore, that means taxis are needed and that can be a problem. The hotel is not on a busy street and the only service the hotels offers to help you is that a sign and a revolving light by the roadside are lit so that passing taxis know there are people waiting. There appears to be a shortage of cabs because several times we had to wait for more than 20 minutes. And when it rains, everyone wants a taxi. Unlike other hotels in the city, whos names you see on umbrellas all around you, this hotel does not have umbrellas for its guests to borrow which I found strange during the rainy season.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gr\u00fcningen", "Title": "\u201cGood and Big Roms, poor breakfast, away from Public Transport.\u201d", "Author": "Felix T", "ReviewID": "UR125776524", "Content": "The rooms are big and kept in a good and clean condition.

No room service. There are snack bars with minimal offerings. A decent, very inexpensive continental breakfast can be constructed from Red Bean Buns (buns with a sweet and tasty bean paste filling) and coffee at the ground floor snack bar.

I was given a room in the non-smoking floor and it was as seen in the website. We had an extension area (sort of a balcony) which was great - although for those who may want open windows...their windows just open partially more of a safety feature I think. The room was very clean and did not smell musty, CR fully working too along with water heater and other amenities. The hotel was fully booked since there was a convention (RELC is a regional language center) yet it still maintained its tranquility and the staff were inobtrusive yet helpful. The complimentary breakfast though is not so exciting, we had noodles, boiled eggs and congee for breakfast the 2 days we were there. Though for the non-picky, the fare is ok and you can just opt to go for a sumptuous lunch and dinner in the city. For those who love the quiet, this is a good place to stay. After walking so much and doing sightseeing OR even a day's training or work in singapore......the quiet area of orange grove is ideal. There is a regular free shuttle that brings you to main orchard and should you opt for taxis, the area is not too isolated so there will be taxis coming along every so often. The location is not too far also from the shopping malls, in the map it may seem so far but in reality it is not. But then location of the place to stay will also depend where one opts to go so they can be nearer. Will I recommend? Why not?

The location is pleasant, but quite far from anything you'll want to do. Orchard Road is about a 10 minute walk. The worst of it was the broadband internet connection which was ludicrously expensive in a city where you can find free hotspots all over the place. Take my advice, and take your laptop to the nearest Starbucks or Coffee Bean, and work there. Finally, I have to say that it just didn't feel like a hotel at all.
