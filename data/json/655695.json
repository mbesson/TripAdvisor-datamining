And, for the same price as Sea Club, you can get a condo with a hot tub, sauna, gym, and much more.

They are nicely furnished with quality items and a decent TV. The living room converts to a bedroom at night using a wall bed. There was some debate about the linens. My wife thought they might not be clean because she found some hairs but I think they were clean and they were just some random hairs. Besides that, the atmosphere is very relaxing. The kitchen was perfect. The bathroom in our room was just average because the tub was older and the water took a while to get hot upon first use. The staff was nice but not overly friendly. For instance, there was a major storm approaching when we did a random stop to ask about vacancies. They would have been fine not to mention the storm at all to the unaware, which seems too strictly business for my taste, but that's what it is after all so caveat emptor. The place felt very safe although we saw cops pull over a vehicle at one point in next hotel over. It's Datona Beach so probably just some teenagers acting stupid.

We negotiated a good price and checked in the following day. I was a bit taken back at first by the size (small) of the bedroom. It had a bed (queen, or was it just a full?), one nightstand, and a small dresser with a TV on top; also there was a decent closet and a small window facing out to the exterior hallway. No pictures on the wall and no chair to sit on. The balcony was also very small. Most of the units here have a nice size balcony, but our unit, at the middle of the V (room 204) had a small wedge of a balcony, but at least it did have two chairs and a small table. All the balconies are oceanfront and have nice views of the pool area and beach. The living room was pretty decent, with both a queen size sleeper and a queen size Murphy bed, so this one bedroom was rated to sleep six, more than most one bedroom units at other resorts. There is no jacuzzi at this resort, a big negative in my book, but the pool was warm enough (and I understand they heat it to 82 during the colder months). The employees were friendly and helpful, something you don't always see at timeshares. The resort is run by a board of owners, not just a timeshare company like Diamond Resorts or Bluegreen, so the board is trying to keep expenses down, but also make the place nice. Not too many amenities other than the pool (and, of course, the beach). They do have BBQ grills, shuffleboard, free wireless internet, and even a computer in the lobbby available for free use. There are no VCRs or DVD players in the room, but they have a limited number than you can check out (for free, but with a $50 deposit). Another plus is that they have very nice (thick and new looking) pool towels and they allow you to bring down any or all of your towels & linens for exchange any morning. Our kitchen inventory was complete. We had a couple minor room problems, but the maintenance staff handled them in a timely manner. Parking is limited, but easy. No underground parking here. You do need to watch, though, for palm tree droppings which can damage your car's paint job. So, by the end of our week, I had kind of adjusted to the small bedroom and balcony.
