I later flew out from Dallas with an assurance that someone from the claims department will get in touch with me shortly. After waiting for 2 days, i had to call them to follow up. Later in the day i received a call from their claims department that they checked with thier housekeeping department and found no cash( Ridiculous!! how can someone find cash when it is stolen!!) and hence nothing they could do about it. While i understand trusting the employees, it is equally important to trust your customers too. I was told i will be sent a 100$ gift card, which i could care for less. I dont need any gift cards, i need this to be addressed and give me my hard earned money back as simple as that.

Do I hold the seat up? It seems I'm losing my focus on the matter at hand... I'd better just find another bathroom... Third, cleanliness. Room flyers say sheets are to be replaced every third night, to conserve. I can appreciate that. But...

It is on a toll road so every time you leave the property you must pay the tolls- a very annoying 55 cents/ 40 cents. The room was ok the evelvators where horrible and the parking cost $10.00 an annoying expense for Dallas where most hotel parking is free.

We had a great time. This was a gift from friends for us so this was special. I loved the free shuttle service. I thought the hours were resonable, after all you did not have to burn your own gas, pay for a cab, or lose your parking space and that I'm picky about. so we went to the galleria and into a 3 story macy's well, the mall was 3 storys. had excellent service there and to truluks steak and seafood on beltline road. I've been there before, but I promise if you go, you never want to go to red lobster again. It is worth the money but it is pricey for most people.I felt this hotel was a little overpriced since it did not have microwaves and refrigerators in the room but found out you can ask for one I don't know if you have to pay extra or not. We tipped everyone who waited on us so expect to bring a wad of money thats how good they are and friendly. We had pizza in the room one night and it was good and the free breakfast was great they made fresh omeletts and waffles at your request. We did not use the pool but it looked nice I thought it would have been to cold but the outside is heated. I liked the little gift shop I found a nice thank-you card there.Not many channels to watch on t.v., but who is here to watch t.v.? The big beds were soft and so were the pillows.our room was a little stale at first, but they fixed that and we had a little misunderstanding with the check-in people about there polices but they sent a bottle of wine and a gift basket up to the room soon after, which was nice of them. There were a few things that could have been better. I think the parking was to expensive. Also don't stay on the window side of the tollway next to the toll booth, it will keep you up all night cars racing all night long, very irritating. And it was to late to move to another room. this was after midnight and lasted until around 5:30 in the morning.The room card also did not work. they were touchy you had to try several times and get it just right or you were not getting into your room.overall It was nice since it was free, but I probably would not stay there again since they have courtyard marriotts all over the place that are just as nice and once you've stayed at the grand hyatt at the airport or Somewhere in Las Vegas you won't want to stay anywhere else.", "Date": "September 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas", "Title": "\u201cnice place\u201d", "Author": "n6877", "ReviewID": "UR15517810", "Content": "pretty good hotel an good location put some family up when they came to visit they did not spend alot of time at the hotel but it was clean and service was good", "Date": "April 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chandler, AZ", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel & good location\u201d", "Author": "AZ2323", "ReviewID": "UR11613083", "Content": "We are from Phoenix and spent two nights here because my son han a gymnastics meet.

A couple of features set this hotel above its competition as a business hotel. First, the mattress is the best I've slept on - better than a Heavenly Bed, better than a Ritz. And not just because it beat sleeping on the floor of the airport like 3,000 of my fellow travelers! Second, the hotel actually acknowledges that you need to do work and so has a great electronics console as a sort of backsplash to the desk - lots of outlets, phone lines, and other plug-ins for all your gizmos so that you don't have to move appliances or crawl around on the floor. Finally, instead of a $5.00 cheapo clock alarm or one of those new weird pre-programmed radios (I hate those things), this clock radio had an iPod docking station attached to it. The room also had a flat-screen TV and wonderful uni-sex orange-scented amenities. And the nice man at the desk gave me a free toothbrush so I wouldn't have socks on my teeth the next morning when I got up to schlep back to the airport. And a free bottle of water, not one that cost $6.00 like the hotel I stayed in the night before. Also - compact flourescents in the guest rooms!
