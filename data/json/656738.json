Tucked away just 5 minutes' walk from the railway station, accessible through a gated archway, it proved to be an excellent choice and a great way to finish the holiday. The desk staff were fantastic, speaking excellent English and happy to take the time to provide maps, directions, and advice on how to get where and also nearly places to eat. Although the place has a spare, humble look to it, everything was spotless, beds were comfortable, plumbing, windows and a/c worked fine, and the breakfast was delicious and attractively served in a charming breakfast room. Great European coffee served with a pitcher of hot milk. Our room was very quiet although there was a lot of foot-traffic on the sidewalk outside and all the rooms were occupied. The hotel has combined new windows with the old windows, resulting in about 4 layers of open-able windows! Our overlooked a small interior courtyard. There is a typically tiny European elevator to take you up to the second floor. For me, one of the best things about the De' Medici was the free fairly fast Internet available at a computer in the lobby. Helpful staff give you a password that is yours for the duration of your stay. I loved this little hotel and i overheard other travellers saying the same thing. From it, we walked easily to the Accademia, the Ufizzi, the Duomo, the market, the bridges, and the bus garage by the station to catch a ride to the airport. This is a great spot.", "Date": "Nov 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR591750523", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "DLCAlberta"}, {"Content": "wonderfull On our recent trip to Italy, Florence, we were staying in COSIMO DE MEDICI a wonderful hotel in the centre of Florence.

This hotel is located in the most convenient location in Florence. It is right across the street from the train station (Santa Maria Nouvella) and it is steps away from the great sites situated in Florence. It is definitely a comfortable hotel, as we stayed in a quad. If you are looking for a quaint place to stay right in the heart of Florence this is the place for you. And be sure to visit the restaurant a few doors down from the hotel for some of the best pizza. Although from the outside it may look a little unsafe, this hotel is truly a safe place to stay because they locked the gate at night and you had to be buzzed into the hotel after a certain hour.

The hotel was very convenient, San Lorenzo Market and Mercato Centrale were just around the corner.

The bathroom is miniscule. there is nowhere even to put a brush, let alone cosmetics. the shower is narrow and tiny and you are lucky if you fit into it. in our room, the tv barely worked and we could not access cnn or any other english network. as for that apartment that some people write about, the mattress is actually a boxspring, and the loft sleeping area is at the top of steep stairs. the bathroom, of course, is downstairs. For $165 a night, it is ok. you might be able to do better, but the only reviews i can agree with are those that say the staff is helpful and friendly.

The rooms were back from the street making them very quiet in such a noisy city.Unfortunately the saying - you get what you pay for, really showed in this hotel. I did request mid range priced accommodation in Florence as it was very expensive to stay there. I found the room very dark and old but adequate. The lighting needed brighter globes, the window opened up into a small central area that people above strung their laundry across and the air conditioning units worked from. The bathroom had a little mildew on the wall and was very small but clean. The cords near the television had some exposed wiring so we had to be careful when using the outlet to recharge our phones etc. I found it a little depressing whenever we came back to our room but we spent most of our days out and about anyway.As I commented earlier you get what you pay for.", "Date": "Jun 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR640047688", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "funnycarsummer"}, {"Content": "Charming, Friendly  Hotel Cosimo de'Medici is a wonderful quant/warm hotel.

The bathroom doesn't have ventilation except for the fullsize door/windows which if you like your privacy you won't have open while taking a shower.
