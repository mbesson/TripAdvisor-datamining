It is definitely a budget hotel. No carpet, and the beds were uncomfortably hard (and I like a firm mattress), so much so that I used the extra blankets in the closet under my sheets for a little more cushion. The room was clean and tidy, however spartan, and the location was safe and quiet. We had no noise issues except for a group of young adults arriving in a night. Once they settled it was fine. We did not opt for the breakfast. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and spoke English just fine. We had a bit of trouble finding it off the train, but I think that was because not being familiar with Barcelona, we may have gotten off at the wrong exit. It was not too far from a different stop so that we could go anywhere we wanted during our stay. It is about a 20 minute walk from La Sagrada Familia, and there are a lot of shops and restaurants along the way. Overall, if you are on a budget, this is a excellent choice. I would probably stay elsewhere the next time and spend a bit more for the comfort factor.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nicosia", "Title": "\u201cGenerally a good place to stay\u201d", "Author": "KATERINA A Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR124625376", "Content": "The location of the hotel was very good, also the rooms were very clean and the personnel there was very willing to help.

For this one nighter, I was looking for inexpensive, clean, near a subway line. Abalon fits the bill. It was the cheapest hotel I could find in Barcelona for the night I wanted. I was a bit worried about this and was relieved by how nice the hotel actually was. It was very clean, had good mattresses, updated bathrooms, and nice double-glazed windows that open. Each room has an individually adjustable radiator for heat, two chairs, in room phone, television, and a long shelf-type desk with two chairs. There is a computer near the lobby for guest use.
