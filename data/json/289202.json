We arrived from Rome by train and the Antiche Figure is right across the canal from the train station. The bridges in Venice tend to have lots of steps however so we did need to hire a porter to lug our four bags across the bridge on his cart (15 euro). The building the hotel is located in is a 500+ year old small palace. It used to have frescos painted on its front exterior, hence the name. We entered this small hotel and were warmly greeted by the desk staff. Our desk clerk took great pains to acquaint us with her city as well as the various means of transportation available. We took her advice and rode the vaporetto (a water bus) all the way around the Grand Canale (6.5 euros). We then walked around St. Mark's Square and returned to our hotel on the #2 vaporetto, a speedier version of the water bus that makes fewer stops. This gave us a great overview of the city. On our last morning, we took another porter and walked to the \"peoplemover\" which got us to the port. Unfortunately, it was the wrong port. Our friendly hotel staff failed to mention that there are two ports from which cruise ships sail. However, some entrepeunurial gentleman at the \"other\" port got us transportation which delivered us to a water taxi that took us to our ship, the Seabourn Spirit. None of this cost us anything and we arrived in plenty of time at the ship. Other than that one hitch, we loved everything in our hotel. The breakfast that is included is ample and will get you going for quite a while. The staff was equally friendly at meal time. If you want to be on the famous St. Mark's Square, this is not the hotel for you. However, if you would like to be close enough to walk and far enough from the hubub, you will no doubt enjoy the Antiche Figure as much as we did.

We were not disappointed! The hotel is ideally located opposite the railway station and close to the bus station. Clearly this makes it easy to get to when you first arrive, but it also brings another advantage: wherever you are in the city, you just need to follow the signs for \"Ferrovia\", and they lead you right back to your hotel. That is a BIG plus point in Venice! The hotel itself has clearly been renovated quite recently, and to a very high standard. Our room was a good size, with very high quality fixtures and fittings, both in the bedroom and in the bathroom. We had a room to the side of the hotel, so no view form the windows. However, I think this made it significantly quieter than a front-facing room would have been. And if you want to view the Grand Canal (who doesn't?), just sit outside the hotel sipping a Spritz, or else spend an hour on the steps of the adjacent church, watching the world float by. The hotel staff are wonderful - every staff member we came across was very friendly and helpful. It is clear that they all enjoy working at the hotel, and I guess this stems from high calibre management. There was a good selection of food available at breakfast, and the buffet was constantly replenished by the staff. In the evenings, the hotel bar has a good range of drinks available at reasonable prices. The only things that could be improved were mentioned in another recent review: (1) it would be good to have WiFi in the bedrooms, not just in the lobby and breakfast rooms and (2) teamaking facilities in the bedrooms would be good.

To get to your cruse ship, depending on where it is docked, you can go back to the Piazzle Roma and use the people mover or use the water bus to drop you off at the dock. We used the bus as our ship was not docked where most of the larger ships are placed. I booked this hotel because of trip advisor's reviews and it was not wrong!

Overall, this hotel met all our expectations (which were already set high based on the reviews we read). Each and every staff (from top to bottom) are super professional, kind, and always in \"how can I help you\" mode. Very reactive and very attentive indeed. We booked the hotel from their internet site, had no problems with reservation, at check-in or check-out. They were quite reactive in responding to my emails (re transport etc.). The hotel is very strategically located, within a very short walk from train station or taxi drop out point. This is important to minimize walking time when you first arrive (as there is no land traffic in Venice). However, for San Marco square, you need to take vaporette or walk (about 20-30 mins walk). We did not think it was a problem, as there is no really ideal place in Venice (including those right next to San Marco square). I booked a room with a canal view (and preferably one with balcony), and was put initially on first floor, but then changed to 4th floor, which we found more pleasant. Plus the room with balcony probably would not have made much difference (given the size of the balcony). The windows of our room were quite small, but the side view was quite nice (despite the restoration of nearby church). The room and bathroom were nicely decorated, and very clean. The room sometimes got too hot (despite outside temperature being between 1-3 Celcius). But setting the thermostat too low (around 18) does the trick. Breakfast was not anything special, and the breakfast room was a bit small (with bar being used as an overflow room), but the friendly service compensated it. On a final note, one might have expected a small gesture (of any kind) for a special event such as 70th birthday, but well, nobody is perfect \u00ef\ufffd\u0160", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Franklin, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cExcellent choice\u201d", "Author": "Cindy528", "ReviewID": "UR123123410", "Content": "Beautiful decor and clean hotel.

However, I wish to emphasize the one key benefit of this hotel. For tourists, the LOCATION can't be beat. It's simply impossible to do better: - 3 minute walk from Piazza Di Roma, where the ATVO airport shuttle drops you off. So you get off the bus, you walk literally 3 minutes, and you're at the hotel. No expensive water taxi or hauling your suitcases across town from Piazza Di Roma to find your hotel. This benefit obviously applies when you are leaving as well. - 1 minute walk to the train station (right across the Grand Canal, and the bridge is right there). If you intend to take the train to go to Padova, Verona or Milan, the hotel is perfect. Also, if you want to take a Vaporetto water bus to get to the landmarks, the Ferrovia train station stop is directly across the Canal. - 15 minute walk to the Rialto Bridge, 20 minutes to the big landmarks, like Piazza St Marco and Accademia. - Right next down the street, there is a public laundromat. If you are traveling for an extended period of time and you need to do laundry, it's right there. It's pricy: A 6 kg load will run you around 13 euros. But it's still totally worth it to me.

The hotel is situated almost exactly opposite the rail station and on the Grand Canal. For those who fly with Ryanair into Treviso airport the coach station is around 2 minutes walk away also, crossing over the bridge to the station, and then across the canal. In terms of the location it is very convenient, maybe 20 minutes walk from Rialto Bridge and San Marco, albeit the walk is not particularly easy without a good map; the winding avenues of Venice can get confusing. When we visited in winter the absence of crowds meant the avenues felt at times slightly intimidating, something i did not expect from the city. This however is no reflection of the hotel whatsoever, and there is a boat station literally one minute walk away, from which regular 24 hour boats go to San Marco, Rialto and other main areas of the city. This issue would also be the case irrespective of a location stayed in. Some rooms will overlook the canal, and we were offered the chance to upgrade from 30 Euros a night, having had a chance to look at both rooms before hand. The hotel itself looked slightly shabby i felt from the outside, although inside was immaculate. The room we were allocated was spacious, outstandingly clean and had all of the mod cons you may expect such as a mini bar, tv, hair dryer etc. There was even a chandelier on the ceiling for a feeling of real class! The bathroom was also very large and very welcome in comparison to many tiny bathrooms at other hotels. At night we did not hear any noise whatsoever. The hotel also had a small bar area, and two breakfast rooms which also had an attention to detail. The bar was well stocked with some nice wines, and always had some peanuts and crisps free to nibble on. Breakfast was a standard continental fare with croissants, cereals, hard boiled eggs, some fruit and some cakes. The milk wasn't particularly cold as a very minor criticism. Others have mentioned the excellent customer service and we found this to be true. From the moment we walked in the staff were professional, attentive, friendly and helpful. From answering minor requests promptly such as more towells, to giving guidance to queries on attractions to visits, they were first rate. They even gave some tips we were unaware of which were really useful. The staff had a smile on their face throughout and genuinely seemed to want to make your stay good. Even when we were leaving they happily stored our bags away and were helpful until the second we checked out. Overall a very positive reflection of this hotel and i would happily stay here again. My main recommendations would be that the boat is the easiest way in winter to travel to the main attractions, and if you are walking then it is best to cross the Grand Canal where the walk is more lively and less littered with narrow alleyways.

I had a fantastic breakfast and headed out for the day. I walked easily to so many things and caught the water taxis to all spots of interest. They scheduled my visit to Morano, where I bought a beautiful piece of art. I traveled on a very tight budget and never expected to stay somewhere as nice as this.

The breakfast rooms were bright, clean and comfortable. The hotel also has a small bar with tables out on the terrace. We were invited to bring our own wine out to the terrace, they supplied the glasses. This was not our first stay in Venice, so we went to Murano and Burano. I strongly recommend buying a 12 hour Vaporetto pass. You can take a tour of the Grand Canal, go to the F.te Nove stop where you should catch the LN line to Murano, then head to Burano for lunch. Burano was by far our favorite attraction in Venice. It is a small, picturesque village with beautifully painted houses, plenty of cafes and shopping, but the photo opportunities are worth the trip! Getting there: We travelled from the Pl.Roma, following a cruise, so we had to cross two small bridges. There are strong, young Italians who will gladly carry your luggage to the hotel.... for a tip. I think it's worth it! They quickly swept my bag over the bridge and for a 3Euro tip, saved me a lot of strain! If you chose to do it yourself, go to the bridge through the market area rather than the bridge closest to the canal. The bridge is behind the Hotel Chiara, not the one in front of it. It is longer, but lower and has long low steps making it easier to roll your suitcase over. Unfortunately, the Italian luggage carriers don't want to work early in the morning or in rain. :o/ It is a better way to get back to the Pl. Roma to catch the shuttle for the airport. The shuttle is 5E per person to the airport, you must handle your luggage on the bus and it takes about 20-25 minutes.

It is elegant but not overdecorated in the typical Venetian baroque style. People at the reception are friendly and helpful. The room was nice, but a little on the small side, in spite of being a suite. Not many room space for luggage. Everything was spotless, although there was a slight smell of dampness in the bathroom. Nothing outrageous, though, and I suppose that it is almost ibnevitable in a city built over the water. Breakfast is good although not spectacular.

Very easy access and no need for an expensive water taxi. Staff very welcoming and very helpful. Room was not ready on arrival as we got there at 10.30am, but not a problem. Left luggage in reception and went to explore. Sat down at a nearby restaurant and ordered one Bacardi and coke and one lemonade. Nearly fell in the canal when the cost was 17 euro!! Seems to be an average price so you will need a lot of euros if you intend to drink. Street vendors offer drinks from 1 euro for water upwards to approx 2.50 euro for cans, a bit better value. Venice is easy accessible by foot or water bus. We purchased a 12 hour ticket at 16 euros each which gave you unlimited travel on any route all day. Good value if you want to visit all areas of Venice. The water bus stop is just outside the hotel on the opposite bank. Around every corner is a picture and certainly a lovely city to visit. A gondola is a must but book it on the small canals rather than the grand canal as it can get very busy. A tip is ask a price then walk away.

The service was top notch - better than we've received in most 4 and even 5 star hotels - as they were very attentive to our needs and great to offer recommendations.

You get an OK view, but you can get that same view and better by just walking anywhere along the Canal. Much better to spend the money on the Junior Suite which was nice, cozy, clean, and newer - even if there was no view. Side Note The hotel may offer you to visit the nearby Island of Murano (where the famous glass factories are) with a \"free\" boat ride to one of the factories. Personally speaking, it's not worth the free trip to the factory as once you're there it's just a big sales pitch the whole time (and the glass is actually not as interesting as that you'll find on the rest of the Island - it's also MUCH more expensive than what you'll find in the main part of Venice or the small shops in Murano). Once you're at the factory, the factory will keep you there and tell you that the rest of the island there's nothing to see. . .they'll push to send you back to the main island or to another nearby island just so you don't see what the rest of Murano has to offer. We were foolish enough to spend half of a day looking at a pretty lame factory and then being shipped off to Burano - a nearby island known for making Lace which is not worth the visit. Complete waste of time. Would recommend (if you have 3 or 4 days in Venice) to take the public boat over to Murano and checking out the Island on your own. There you'll see much nicer glass works and not feel the sales pressure from the Factories.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location and service\u201d", "Author": "travelfun16", "ReviewID": "UR116394661", "Content": "Stayed here for 3 nights in July 2011.

If you arrive by bus, the Roma terminal is only a 10 minute walk (5 minutes if you don't have a suitcase). Being so close to these stations means you don't have to wait in line and get on the Vaporetto to get to the hotel which is very convenient when arriving or departing from Venice.

They take pride in servicing their clientele, and it shows -- and they have earned Trip Advisor's award with every fiber of their being. Don't let their three-star rating fool you. It's likely due to things that they can never change (hotel size, location, amenities, etc.), but our experience there was better that BOTH the other hotels in Rome and Florence combined. Besides that, their location is ideal, being right across the channel from the train station and a short five-minute walk to the bus pick-up to get you to or from the airport.

Having spent many a night reading reviews on different Venice hotels, this was the most expensive (149Euro) of the hotels we considered (I am sure you will see some of the ones I considered in the Venice forum) and I know that we could have got a canal view room in a different hotel for this price or less. If I'm honest, the one reason we picked the Antiche Figure in the end was the location. We knew we would arrive into Venice early from the overnight train to Paris and we didn't want to maul with our bags and spend time getting lost trying to find our hotel, so for this reason we went with the Antiche Figure. So easy, walk out of the train station and it is infront of you. Walk left, over the bridge, turn right and it is there on your left. Staff were amazing, letting us check in straight away and having our room ready for us. We weren't offered an upgrade and it was my partner's 30th birthday, however they were very busy. We did have an (almost) canal view if you turned your head to the right and hung out of the window slightly, but we weren't expecting a canal view as we didn't pay for this so it may have been wishful thinking! The advice of the staff was great, recommending the best way of getting around, to a nice restaurant for somewhere to eat for my partners 30th, to the best way to get a taxi to the airport, nothing was too much trouble. Rooms were clean and tidy and huge compared to our room in Paris, and the bathroom amazing, water pressure great too. Breakfast is continental, but probably the best continental I've had anywhere in Europe. Breads, pastries, juices, cereal, meat, yoghurts and coffee (either out of the machine or fresh). The two women who run the breakfast setup are amazing, very efficient. For the English man who became quite arrogant when scrambled eggs weren't included in the buffet, please do your homework!! We were embarassed to be English, read what a continental breakfast is before complaining! In summary, would I stay here again, probably, but I'd perhaps look at the cheaper options in the little backstreets of Venice too now I feel more confident navigating my way around Venice.

The hotel is situated close to bus station and opposite the railway station being easily found but I do concur with the comments to travel light or indeed take a water taxi if you dont want to drag your many kilos over bridges on arrival and departure. Whilst this is away from the main attraction of St. Marks Square the island is very accessible by walking - but you do a lot of that as with many cities. All in all this is a very nice hotel which has more a 4 star feel than a three.", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle", "Title": "\u201cA Must Visit to this Hotel/Staff Tip Top\u201d", "Author": "DSHT", "ReviewID": "UR115192351", "Content": "I shall receommend this hotel to everyone, just over the bridge from the railway, ferries right outside for access to everywhere, not loud either.

We had planned to lug our bags across the two little bridges to the people mover and on to the cruise ship. However- a very nasty thunderstorm changed those plans. The hotel staff orderd water taxis for all the cruise ship travlers so that we could share the cost. The ushered us each out while holding an umbrella and helped with lugguage. THe morning breakfast was ample and very good. Our room was a nice size by Italy standards. Beds comfy, marlble bathroom , internet jack,what else could one ask for. The big plus of the location was being away from the St Marks Square crowd-it was so peaceful and quiet in the evening. The water buses were also very close by. Buy your St Marks tickets before you leave.(go to Venice Connected) Bathrooms are hard to come by. There are two locations in the Palace and two public locations. We bought the passes as the are one euro for each visit. Also- we bought the water bus passes before we left and discovered that it appears only the tourists use the passes. Have fun trying to get lost and finding your way to your hotel. THe Hotel Antiche is almost like cheating becasue you follow the signs to the train station, but each street is different.

Our introduction to Italy was the staff at this hotel. They could not have been nicer. A tremendous load was lifted (literally, in the case of our luggage) as they immediately took care of everything for us - checked in, settled in our rooms, a refreshing drink, etc. The location faces the Grand Canal so that was exciting. Water taxis stop immediately in front. Across the canal is the train station (although crossing on foot involves a 100+ meter walk to and across the nearest bridge - the Scalzi Bridge). The hotel is small but had everything one needs for a short stay. It appeared to have recently had a complete renovation as the room furnishings, bathroom fixtures, small things like room door locks were all new and very modern. The AC worked great. The room was not large but was more than adequate and was spotlessly clean and very comfortable, again with a great view of the Grand Canal. It was not noisy, we slept great. It's location is away from the hustle, bustle and prices of the area around Piazza San Marcos, yet we walked there in about 45 minutes, taking our time and enjoying back streets, piazzas, shops and neighborhoods of the real Venice. It's very convenient to the Cruise port as well as the train station. They have a small but nice bar with good cocktails and wine at reasonable prices and a nice seating area for a very complete continental breakfast which was excellent. Free internet at a PC in the lobby with good reception. We found sidewalk cafes within a short distance where we had good drinks and a very nice dinner. (One word of caution - if you are carrying lots of heavy luggage, take a water taxi to and from the hotel. Public transportation stops a block or two away or on the wrong side of the canal and carrying heavy luggage over the bridges is not for old and weak backs.) In summary, Antiche Figure is a great value, great location , modern, clean and comfortable. It's not the Four Seasons but for one or two nights where convenience to the train station, airport and cruise port is important, it is perfect. Whenever we had a question or a need, the staff went out of their way to get us an answer and continually made us feel welcomed and valued.

Both rooms had a television with Sky, and there is a computer in the reception.The buffet breakfast was very good, and could be taken inside or on the pavement overlooking the canal, but order fresh coffee from the waitress rather than taking it from the machine! The hotel is within walking distance of all the main areas of interest, although we found the Rialto bridge and st. Marks Square area so terribly crowded when we were there in this month (May) that we stayed well away! There were some lovely shops nearby, and we were very surprised to find beautiful leather bags of all types from only 25 lira! One morning we went into a beautiful Cathedral close to the hotel, only to discover that a wedding was about to take place, so we stayed for the whole hour and a half enjoying the wonderful music and the soloist singing Ava Maria - a great experience, and what an atmosphere! We found all the hotel staff very helpful and polite,especially reception who were extremely helpful, especially Anka who went out of her way to suggest restaurants where we could escape tourists and find the best local food. We ate most night in different restaurants fairly close to the hotel, as we found the quality of the food better, and the prices far less than any of the restaurants in the more popular areas. We arrived on the Orient Express at the railway station which is opposite the hotel and being in our 60s found lugging our suitcases up and down all the hundreds of steps of the bridge rather too much, but apparently we could have ordered a porter from the hotel beforehand, which we will definitely do next time. We returned to the airport by private water taxi which picked us up right outside the hotel at a cost of 120 euros for the four of us.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cCharming Hotel in Great Location\u201d", "Author": "Olie079", "ReviewID": "UR109267149", "Content": "We stayed at the Hotel Antiche Figure Venice after disembarking from our cruise.

The quality of the bed linens is very low and the pillows are thin lumps. The only blankets on the bed are a thin sheet and the bedspread. The walls were so thin that we would listen to our neighbor using the bathroom each night as we lay in bed. (Not very romantic!)

The location was excellent for many reasons. Firstly, it's easy to get to - we arrived by bus number 5 from the airport to the nearby Piazalle Roma, which is the cheapest way to arrive in Venice and surprisingly hassle-free, too. The train station is right across the hotel and if you are staying for a few days, like we did, you can travel to Treviso, Padua, Vicenza or Verona. Vaporetto 'Ferrovia' is opposite the hotel and if you take vaporetto 1 or 2 to San Marco or back you'll see the whole Grand Canal - just make sure you get to the front of the ship for a good view. Also, being close to Ferrovia ( the train station), makes navigating back to the hotel quite easy - there are yellow signs \"per Ferrovia\" all over Venice and you can just follow those. Finally, the area ( Santa Croce) is lovely - it's not as crowded as San Marco but has lots of picturesque little streets, campi and bridges and some excellent sights ( like the magnificent Frari) as well. A good place to start exploring Venice before plunging into the crowds and tat of Rialto-San Marco. Not all went swimmingly, though. When we arrived, it turned out that they had overbooked through a mistake, but they were extremely apologetic about this and offered us to spend the first night in a nearby 4-star hotel and then to upgrade to a better room in the annex for the remaining 5 nights. All at not extra cost for us, of course. We accepted that quite happily and it all went quite well ( apart from having to tip the porter in the four-star hotel who conveniently didn't have change) Then on our fifth day we found out that our flight had been cancelled so we needed to stay at least one more night and, fortunately, the staff offered us the same room at a reduced rate. The room we had in the annex was good. The annex is in a very narrow, quiet street to the right of the hotel. There isn't much of a view at all but on the other hand you don't get any noise from the street. The walls between the rooms are not very soundproof but it wasn't a big problem - you can hear flushing water but not conversation. The bathroom was nice, with a nice big shower and lots of fixtures. There was a good bed, a kettle, a TV and free internet. The room was cleaned to an excellent standard and it was cosy and warm, too. The only bit I didn't like was that it had a very light cover on the bed and a very thick warm blanket in the wardrobe, nothing in between. But you can adjust the room temperature. We booked the room with breakfast included and that was a wise decision. They serve continental breakfast (so no bacon and scrambled eggs) but there's a decent choice of cold meats, cheese, cereal, fruit and an especially nice choice of pastries. The staff make excellent cappuccino or espresso as well and bring it to your table. The staff in the hotel are all really lovely and friendly - they speak excellent English and they are extremely helpful - they were eager to recommend places to visit and restaurants to eat in. Generally, the restaurants in the area are cheaper than in San Marco so we tended to eat nearby. The ones we liked most was Al Vecio Pozzo (excellent pizza, good value) and Le Bacco Felice ( lovely pizza and pasta, but don't order fish). The one we didn't particlularly care for was Ca Leon - it didn't have house wine and other alcohol was really expensive and it was pricier than the other two. We had complimentary spritz from the bar on our first night and enjoyed it so went on to have a drink on a couple other nights, sitting outside, looking at the Grand Canal... It was very pleasant.

For our next day, we stayed at Hotel Antiche Figure, and was booked in one of the best rooms that had a spectacular view of the Grand Canal. The room was very cozy, romantic and beautiful. Service was likewise excellent! Best of all, the room rates were not too expensive! I would recommend this hotel to all of my friends.

Then we headed for Venice, just in time for the last weekend of Carnevale, and the crush of people felt like an assault. We stowed away on a high-speed train from Mestre, since we couldn't begin to board the normal trains. We came out of the front door of the train station, looked over the Grand Canal, and saw that our hotel, the Antiche Figure, was literally across the river. One bridge\u00e2\u20ac\u201da big bridge, but just one of them\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto cross, and the crowds thinned significantly. We were greeted enthusiastically (\"Ben arrivati!\") and our luggage was taken upstairs to our double-superior with extra bed on the 4th (top) floor. For a European hotel, particularly one in a historic district, it was a very large room (slightly cramped by the extra bed, but not too bad). There were two closets, a very large bathroom with a great shower and (mercifully) instant hot water. The windows were open, which admitted the noise of the throngs, but the windows are thick and insulating, and as soon as we closed them we couldn't hear anything anymore, including the chiming of the church bells (Venice is a city of churches and all of them, it seems, chime the hour.) And, happily (and unlike much of Europe in the winter), the room was not overheated\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit had its own controls near the light control (as in nearly all European hotel rooms, you must put your room key into a slot to operate the lights). There is a bar downstairs that is the normal price for a bar\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou don't need to go out searching for a place to have your beer or coffee\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand very pleasant service. The front desk is wonderful. They asked if we needed lunch or dinner recommendations, and their dinner recommendation (Ca' Leon, just around the corner) was great Venetian seafood and not the least bit touristy. They asked if we needed costumes for Carnevale. They doted on our little daughter. There is Internet (cable only) in the rooms; there is free Wi-Fi in the lobby and there is a computer for use near the front desk. Ask at the front desk for an access code. Breakfast was wonderful. A little heavy on the sweets\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit was Carnevale, after all, so there were pies and fritelle\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut good cornetti and bread rolls with hams and salamis and cheeses, plenty of good fruit, and good fresh orange juice. When I went to go get a cappuccino from the machine, the lady overseeing the operation stopped me and offered to go get a cappuccino from the bar for me, a real one. It was, of course, excellent (what IS it about coffee in Italy that we can't seem to master in the US?) and she was, like all the other staff, wonderful. Due to the crowds, it was about 20-30 minutes' walk to Rialto and closer to 45 to Piazza San Marco. There are huge gold signs with arrows everywhere in Venice; while you won't know exactly where you're going, the signs will point you to the right spot. Antiche Figure is also 5-10 minutes' walk to the Jewish Ghetto and about 20-25 minutes' walk to Fondamenta Nuova, from whence you can pick up ferries to Murano, Burano, San Michele and Lido di Venezia. On the way back, you don't have to worry about getting lost because you just follow signs for \"Ferrovia\" (railway station), which will put you right back at the hotel. There is a huge vaporetto stop right across from the hotel (go back over the Ponte degli Scalzi that you crossed to get to the hotel from the train station), which will take you nearly anywhere in Venice, including San Marco, Dorsoduro and the Zattere. (The vaporetto is not cheap, incidentally, compared to a bus.) It was easy to get away, too. There are two small bridges required to get to the bus stops at Piazzale Roma. Turn left out of the front door, go over the first bridge, then turn left. Turn right at the next bridge and you will find yourself in Piazzale Roma at the bus station. The coach buses to Marco Polo Airport (VCE) and Treviso Airport (TSF) leave from post D2, clearly marked on the left. Go to the ATVO office (in the building facing you, with the caff\u00c3\u00a8 and the sign for the people mover) and buy your tickets: 3\u00e2\u201a\u00ac to Marco Polo and 5\u00e2\u201a\u00ac to Treviso, luggage included (though you will have to stow it yourself in the bins underneath the coach bus). I think if we'd had to stay in a hotel back in the calli and rami, we'd have lost our minds with all the luggage. Having the hotel so close by, with such wonderful service, was a real win and we would happily stay next time we're in Venice (perhaps when it's less crowded).", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cStay here if you're arriving in Venice by train\u201d", "Author": "CatPacker", "ReviewID": "UR100055061", "Content": "Every travel guide I looked at mentioned how disorienting it can be to try to find your hotel moments after arriving in this labyrinthine city.

The buzz starts around 8am and on our 3rd Day, the sun came out and just enhanced the lovely view. We were told how to navigate around Venice and walking would be best for us to see the streets. And that's how we started walking our way through, there is a short cut from a street to San Marco/Rialto. Took us around 15 min of walk which was really decent. If you wanted a water bus, it is right opposite the hotel. Gondola? Right at the door step and don't worry, they don't harass you :) I didn't find it noisy at all, ( i kept one of the windows opened by at the at times during my evening). We had a reservation at MET and our water taxi was taken care of :) Breakfast? There is a lovely Italian lady who cheers me up with her smile and her infamous \"Would you like to have a cup of Italian cappuccino?\" Of coz I did each time :p It is a cosy breakfast room and a decent spread of cold cuts, pastries,juice, yogurt and soft boil eggs. The location is excellent since we came on Ryanair and we had around 7 hours to spare after we checked out. Our bags were with Antiche while we went around and came back to grab them before heading to P.Roma (2 mins walk :p) .

There is a lot of traffic on the grand canal but the windows are double glazed so the noise of boats (which to some might be annoying) was minimal.

The breakfast was continental with good coffee and a nice selection of ham, salami, and bread. The staff was very kind and always ready to help. The location for us was very good it is located in the Santa Croce sestieri in front of the railway station and th vaporeto stop, besides it is just a five-minute walk to the bus station, so it was pretty easy to arrive there and later to go to the airport. On the line 2 of the vaporeto it is about 20 minutes to St Mark's Square, and walking it is about 30 - 40 minutes depending on how many times you stop.

It can be quite confusing arriving in Venice at nighttime. I knew that the hotel was across from the train station but after asking 4 locals for directions and getting blank stares, I just decided to go with my gut instinct and cross the main bridge (modern design). After dragging our suitcase up and down the stairs of the bridge and walking for about a minute, we came across 3 police officers to ask for directions. Even with the name and the address of the hotel, they could only vaguely guide us after seeing the map provided from my booking. Luckily, I happened to look across the grand canal and see the hotel directly across from us. I would later discover that it is really quite easy to get to the Piazzale Roma (just have to cross 2 small bridges and you are there)! We arrived to the hotel after 11pm on the night before New Years Eve and were warmly welcomed. The receptionist helped us with our bags up to our room. The room is a step back in time....very Venetian in style. The hotel room was extremely warm, which was a great relief from the bitter chill outside. We had a side view of the Grand Canal and the area is really quite at night. The breakfast buffet did not have a lot to offer but was adequate. The hotel is really conveniently located (a lot easier to find your way in the daylight!). Across the Grand Canal is a vaporetto (water bus) stop and makes it really easy to get to St Marks. We took the vaporetto once and it was an enjoyable trip and you really get to see the Grand Canal. Venice is a wonderful city to walk in but make sure to get a very detailed map, even with one you will probably get lost. On the morning of New Years Eve, we asked the front desk to for recommendations for a restaurant to ring in the New Year. They were so accommodating- they had a lot of menus to select from and even translated them for us. While we were out sightseeing, they made the reservation. The restaurant they recommended was really nice (www.anticabesseta.it/), not at all touristy feeling and reasonably priced at 60 euro for the prix fix menu, considering some restaurants were charging over 250 euro per person. When we got back to the hotel that night, we were invited to toast in the New Year with a glass of prosecco (a really nice touch).

We used Marriott points at most of our locations but chose to stay in a authentic style hotel during our one night stay in Venice. We chose Hotel Antiche Figure based off of reviews on Trip Advisor and were not dissappointed...our stay was excellent. Location: For the purpose of our trip the location of the hotel was excellent. The hotel overlooks the Grand Canal and is a five minute walk from the Santa Lucia train station on what would be the north end of the \"island.\" We were only staying for one night but spent most of two full days in Venice. We caught an overnight train to Munich so the location near the train station was extremely convenient. We quickly got from the station and through check in so that we could begin enjoying the wonderul sights and experiences that were waiting for us. After check in we lazily walked from the hotel to St. Marks square which was an excellent experience shopping, eating, sight seeing and getting lost which was an adventure. Check In/Service: The staff greeted us with smiles and quickly got through all the paperwork. After making some suggestions on some sights to see and a few \"tour\" options the hostess escorted us to our room which was unexpected and an excellent touch. We were offered a room upgrade but did not accept since we were only there for one night. The staff working at the bar was excellent, made some great local drinks and provided some light snacks. Upon checkout the hotel staff graciously offered to look after our suit cases since our train was not leaving until late. Room: Our room was labeled a \"Superior Red Room\" with a queen sized bed. The room had all the necessary essentials and some nice touches with the fabric walls etc. The room was very clean. The bathroom had very nice features, marble tiling, etc. I will say that the shower stall was pretty small but has made for some nice conversation pieces about our trip. The AC worked well which was nice as it was unseasonably hot/humid outside. For my taste the bed was slightly hard but didn't matter much b/c we were pretty tired by the end of our sightseeing adventure. Our room was on the 2nd floor and did not overlook the canal but was very quiet. Breakfast: The breakfast was very good and consisted of Italian meats, cheeses, breads, pastries, juices and coffee. Everything tasted fresh and was very traditional. Cost: I beleive we paid somewhere in the ball park of $200. While researching other hotels this was a pretty good value and we were very happy with the cost for the service and experience we received. Overall we had an excellent experience and would definitely stay here again. We did not feel that we lost any part of our Venetian experience by staying on the outskirts of the city and it fit perfectly into our travel plans.

We got a few very good restaurant recommendations, and they were always willing to call to check if places were open or make reservations for us. Breakfast: A huge spread every morning, with delicious cappucinos and fresh pastries, as well as cold cuts, hardboiled eggs, and cereal. What the hotel does not do well: Rooms: We had one in the main building, and all the sounds carried, including hearing someone throwing up next door one night (ew). Bring earplugs. The rooms are clean but a bit worn and small, and the bed we had had broken springs throughout. The bathrooms are nice. Internet: There is only wi-fi in the lobby, and the rooms are ethernet LAN lines. Just be aware of this -- we weren't. Take it or leave it: Location: The location is arguably good because it's right by the train station, but it's also pretty far from St. Mark's and a bit of a hike to some of the better restaurants. So this is a plus or minus, depending on how you see it. Amenities: The laundry service the hotel offers is absurdly expensive -- 10 euro to clean a woman's shirt, 3 euro to clean a pair of socks.

Roma signs (you will see them everywhere) and you will eventually get to where you want to go. The hotel looks at though it has recently been refurbished to a high standard and our first floor room was very comfortable, quiet and spotlessly clean. Internet access in our room was free. We were offered the option of upgrading to one of the hotel's separate apartments - which was very new and modern, but we felt that our original room suited us fine. The apartments would be handy for anyone with a family or for a party travelling together. Breakfast was very good and plentiful with the usual continental choices. On a particularly wet morning the hotel arranged a private boat taxi from right outside the hotel to a Murano Glass Gallery and although we didn't buy anything we were brought back to the Venice Vaporetto stop for Murono and Burano. On our second evening, we dined at Ostaria al Vecio Pozzo which is an easy five minute walk from the hotel and had a great steak - not particularly Venetian I know, but they also did a great range of home made Pizzas and pasta dishes.

Our room was small but very nice and clean with a partial view of the grand canal from the window. We took the free transportation to the Murano glass factory but would not recommend it. It was basically a ruse by the glass factory people (more like a Murano art gallery) to get you to think you are getting a tour of an actual Murano glass factory. When in reality they show you some guys working with glass for a few minutes and then make you go through several glass galleries trying to sell you stuff. It was pretty much a waste of time for us as everything would be way out our price range anyway. Then when you don't buy anything they are a bit rude and you are on your own to get back to the main Venice island. That wasn't a big deal for us because we bought the 3-day public water-bus passes (highly recommended!) which include access to all the islands. We exited the gallery property through a back gate someone there was nice enough to show us and then walked around the island of Murano and had lunch there before going to Burano. We would highly recommend going to the island of Burano though using the public water buses. Again, get the multi-day water-bus passes, they're well worth it.

Great prices for Venice if, like us, you get fed up of paying for over priced meals with table cover charges, service charges and over priced drinks on top. Vaporetta 2-3 day tickets are worth getting to see all the nearby islands and all the canal network. High tides in Venice can cause problems for getting about on foot especially around the popular St Marks square which was flooded when we visited and raised walkways are used to gain access to the flooded areas. This however is only temporary. We also caught a train to Verona 80 mins away and spent the day there. Return Tickets cost 36 euro each.

After climbing to the third floor, we were surprised to find that the suite was beautifully decorated and made you feel like you were somewhere in a castle. The suite was very large by European standards. The beds were very firm, like everywhere in Italy. The modern amenities - shower, coffee maker, air conditioning were top notch. We could control the temperature in the room, which was really important at the end of June, when the weather gets really hot. At the end of each day, we arrived to a clean suite, nice and cool, and little candies on the pillows. What a nice touch! We chose this hotel based on its super location, right across the bridge from the train station. The only difficulty was in getting our luggage across the bridge with many steps, but that is something you face everywhere in Venice. At least we did not have to look for a water taxi to transport our luggage. It was that close! Getting around was easy - on foot mostly, and the water but was really close. Just a half a block away is a laundromat, which is really convenient if you want to pack light. The breakfast, which was included in our room rate, was very nice. There were different pastries, some cheese, cold cuts, boiled eggs, fruit, coffee, tea and hot chocolate. The breakfast attendant was very pleasant, making sure your needs are taken care of. The best part of staying at Antiche Figure is definitely its staff. Everybody at the hotel is friendly and eager to assist the guest to the absolutely best of their ability. The hotel manager, Alessandro, was amazing. He met us with a smile every morning, and after breakfast mapped out our day's itinerary. He is the best guide we had during our trip to Italy. He knows and loves Venice, and as a true Venitian, guides you to the best restaurants, the nicest islands, the quaintest picture spots and the best shops.

In Venice, that is not difficult to do and we had several choices. We selected the hotel Antiche Figure for convenience, based on its location right across from the train station. We were given a well-appointed corner room overlooking the grand canal (see photos). The room had everything we needed. Venice was only our second stop in Italy, so although we didn't realize it at first, this turned out to be a reasonably sized room by European standards. My original concern that it would be noisy due to its location did not materialize. The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet. The continental breakfast was definitely better than average, with a good selection of the usual pastries, apreads, cold cuts, cappucinos, etc. all of high quality and with attentive service. Although it is not located close to most of the Venice sights, we did not find that to be a problem. We walked through the maze of alleys to a few locations, and took the vaporettos to others. Both of those were great for experiencing Venice, in our opinion. The clincher for our opinion that this is a great place to stay was how we were helped by the front desk. I mistakenly left the voucher for a prepaid tour of the Doges' Palace in the room and didn't find out until I got to the entrance 25 minutes before the tour start time, so going back to get it was out of the question. As a last resort, I called the front desk, gave them permission to enter our room and described where they would find the voucher. I asked them to fax it to the ticket office. Ten minutes later, we were joining the tour, thanks to the staff's willingness to help. Overall, a strongly recommended place to stay in Venice.

The only possible downside for some people is therefore that you are on the opposite side to the main area around 'San Marco' square. This to us was actually a good thing as it was nice to be away from that whole area at night and around a 30min walk through the streets. You probably see a lot more anyway and may take a lot longer if you are traveling with your wife like me as the shops are never ending. Breakfast was included in our stay at the hotel and was lovely to eat outside as you watched Venice life walk and float by. All amenities mentioned in the brochures for the hotel are there and most importantly work well. Overall, the hotel itself is fantastic and the staff can't do enough for you.

We were a family group of 16, and arranging for 6 rooms (3 triples and 3 doubles) was easily accomplished by email. Our room was a triple--a king size (I think...maybe queen) bed and they brought in a twin. A little small for 3 adults (my husband, 23 yr. old son, and me), but would have been fine for 2 people. It was very charming and the decor was quaint. The front desk was very nice and helpful--we were 16 people pulling luggage after a 12 day cruise, and we arrived around 10 am. They stored our luggage in one room, and the rest of the rooms were ready in a couple hours. The location was extremely convenient from the cruise port. I arranged a transfer to Piazzale Roma through Princess Cruise Lines, and from there we walked (over 2 small bridges) to the hotel. Their website directions were perfect. In hindsight, I would not pay Princess Cruise Lines for the transfer to the Piazzale Rome, which was $24 US per person...a bus ride 3/4 of a mile. I could have arranged 2 water taxis for all 16 of us cheaper...and we would have been taken right to the hotel, since is is on the Grand Canal. Breakfast was OK (no eggs or bacon to the disappointment of my \"boys\"), and the staff was very nice. The front desk gave us the sales pitch to visit the Murano factory for \"free\", but we didn't \"bite\". They also explained how to find your way in Venice. There were signs pointing to The Rialto Bridge or San Marco Square, and then there were signs pointing to Piazzale Rome and Ferrovia (train station) on the return. It was very easy to get to St. Mark's and then get back to our hotel, which was right across from the train station on the Grand Canal. I made the trek twice--once when we arrived (too hot and crowded) and once in the early evening (perfect). We found a great little restaurant between the hotel and San Marco (St. Mark's) that looked like it was frequented by locals.

In fact, as soon as someone else walked into the lobby Mr. X immediately ran off to help them leaving us stranded (luckily there was another staff member that was actually off duty, but the girl was really nice and finished checking us in).

Although the view also took in the train station (as it is opposite) just being able to open the window and watch the hustle and bustle of tourists and the gondolers and water taxi's going by was an experience in itself! The room itself was beautiful and we could not have expected anymore and although we were opposite the train station, it was very quiet, so sleeping was fine. The service was impeccable and both Carlo and the Lady on reception went out of their way to find time to draw maps and advise us of the best places to go, something that I find rare these days. The breakfast which was included in the price was great, it was just a continental breakfast which we both like and there was plenty of choice for all! The location of the hotel was spot on, it was 5 minutes walk from the Piazalle Roma (the main bus station), and this was a start/end point for most main water bus routes to and from the main areas of interest. The water taxi from the airport stopped right outside which was a real bonus! Also, having visited the more touristy area, the Hotel was just far enough away to be fairly quiet but was within walking distance of St Marks, Rialto bridge etc... (about 20 to 30 mins).

The rooms themselves are variable. We were initially put on the top floor in a very small room with a noisy radiator but were then moved to a much better room on the 1st floor. The hotel is a short walk from both the main bus terminus and the railway station - this was very handy as we made several trips to the airport. Rialto and St Mark's square are a 30 minute walk - it is best to cross the bridge outside the hotel and walk through the shopping area.

Check in was quick and easy and the staff provided a very good map and they offered to help us in any way to develop an itinerary for the day and with restaurant suggestions. While we already had our days planned, I truly believe the staff would accommodate and help us any way that they could. I saw them helping many other guests. I also had a problem figuring out how to turn on the heater and they immediately came to the room to help. They were all terrific! I can't say enough about how helpful and nice all of the staff was. The room was average in size with a queen bed, two night tables, a small vanity and two chairs. There was a nice flat screen TV and BBC news and CNN were in English. The small bathroom was fully equipped and the shower had multiple heads. Slippers were provided and candies were left on the bed each night. There was also wired Internet available. Best of all for me, was the kettle with coffee and tea making supplies. Umbrellas were also provided for rainy days. The room was cleaned spotless and it was very quiet. The bed was comfortable and it was no problem getting another blanket or pillow from the front desk. We slept very well. The breakfast had ample selections of meat, cheeses, pastries, cereals, juice, fruit, just about anything you could want. The breakfast staff also were quick to offer cappacino and were extremely pleasant and cheerful. It was a great start to the day. I felt the location of the hotel was perfect. We took the bus from the airport to Piazzale Roma and the hotel was a short walk (maybe 5 minutes) away right on the grand canal. Right across the bridge was a Vaparetto stop and the train station which was very convenient for us when we left on a train to Rome. Venice is not that big and we were able to walk to all the sites, or if we got tired, it was easy to catch a Vaparetto right back to the front of the hotel (well across a bridge from the hotel). We bought the Venice Connected Card for the Vaparetto and easily surpassed the 22 Euros I paid for it. The area around the hotel was busy in the morning and at night, but quaint and quiet during the day. There were many restaurants within a 5-10 minute walk. (However the food in Venice is not very good and VERY expensive - thank goodness for that good breakfast!) It was also fun to watch all the activity on the Grand Canal and at the trian station.

Anyone who has been to Venice and was unfortunate enough to pick a hotel deep in the city will appreciate the ease with which this hotel can be reached from both the train and bus stations. Using the water bus from the airport will be a little trickier, but unless this is your first trip and you want to arrive by sea, the ATVO bus at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3 is cheaper and quicker. Excellent though its location is, the best thing about the hotel, are the people who run it. Astonishingly friendly, helpful, smiling and exhibiting a desire to assist, that borders on fanatical. We are relatively seasoned visitors to Venice, so didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really need any help and this really did seem to put the reception staff out. On each encounter we were asked was everything OK and could they be of any assistance? As with some other reviewers, we were offered a room upgrade. As we had booked a basic four night package with Last Minute, we decided to go for the very reasonably priced upgrade to one of the suites. WOW! The reasonable outlay was the best money I have ever spent in a hotel. The four night suite upgrade, including breakfast, was cheaper than the one-way upgrade for my wife and I on the British Airways flight; now that IS a mistake! Back to the hotel, the suite consisted of two rooms plus shower room, all immaculately decorated and finished. If you are a fan of the bath, then beware. If you like a shower, then the suites have the Rolls-Royce of showers! With a massive shower head and wall jets that pummel you from the side. The rest of the bathroom fixtures are also top quality (see photo). The bedroom was simply marvellous, with a large comfy bed, with some rather fancy drapes above the headboard (see photo). The rooms had very expensive fabric wall coverings, that made one feel like minor royalty. The living room area had a table sofa and an area behind glass that contained a full size fridge, sink, along with tea and coffee making facilities (see rather dark photo). The room also had two wonderful flat screen TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, a mini-bar and a safe. Truly excellent. I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on the restaurants close by, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the fault of the hotel if an establishment isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t to your taste, or you have a poor experience. They do deserve thanks for at least offering some recommendations. Finally, a word about the scourge of Venice, mosquitoes! On the first night, we opened the windows wide; thinking that as this was February, our biting \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfriends\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 would be at least hibernating\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but no. During the night, I was awoken by the shrill buzz of one in my ear and sure enough, in the morning, my wife and I had both been bitten, in quite a few places. Now this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rare in Venice, come the heat of summer and you can loose so much blood to the things, one can almost feel faint! Only in the morning did I discover a mosquito repelling device, plugged in a wall socket. It was one of the devices that is supposed to emit a sound that the insects find unpleasant. A bit like humans do when they listen to Des O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Connor. Naturally, it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work, none of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgreen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 chemical free devices do (in my experience) but at least the hotel had made an effort to try and keep them away. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been to five star establishments where suggestions about what to do regarding biting insects have been met simply with an indifferent shrug of the shoulders. The device in the room may have only served to make the little blighters more angry/hungry but at least they tried.

I booked this hotel with Thomas cook and thought it included breakfast but it didnt. So as reported by other reviewers, we too were offered an upgrade and breakfast, but in a 'your choice' kind of way-no pressure. We were given the key to both rooms and told to just ring down and let him know what we had decided. after seeing the rooms we just has to go for the upgrade. we were on the 4th floor in room 411 with a lovely view of the bridge and the canal. It was a bit noisy with boats and so on going past at all hours, but it didnt bother us one bit, and is part and parcel of venice life. nicest room I think I have stayed at!

Osteria Vecio Pozio, it was a lovely place ! Cozy and welcoming and busy!!! staff were friendly and the portions were huge, unless you are starving dont order a starter!!! great range of pizza and pasta and seafood. pizza looked amazing. great value compared to what we saw in the rest of venice!! please do tell the staff in the hotel your budget follow the staff reccommendations because on the first night we had a terrible dinner in a side street restaurant, slightly off the beaten track heading to the rialto. it looked lovely outside, but they had the cheek to charge 49 euro's for a slice of lasagne, pasta with what seemed to be tinned vegetables, a beer and a lemonade, and bread that we didnt even want! TIp- if like us you have never been to italy before, send the bread away or tell them when you are ordering that you dont want any!! and Dont eat ANYWHERE that has a menu turistico!!! most of the time we ate in a wee place on the opposite side of the bridge called BQ or BM or something. the staff there spoke like ten languages and we just had slices of pizza for one ot two euro's. italian ice cream is also amazing!!! one thing I did notice about venice was that there werent very many places to sit. Please dont bother with cheesy Gondola trips,( if you must wait till your last day- so you can see why im saying that) before I went I thought it would be so romantic, but when I saw them full of tourists who didnt know one another mindlessly taking pictures and nearly getting run over with the vaparetto I changed my mind. Instead get the vaperetto 1 down the grand canal to piazza san marco, its just as good! and get the no.2 back up again. definaltey get the vaperetto pass if you arent into walking about its much easier and less tiring on the feet to get to the main things you want to visit. please bring ID with you if you want to get an audio guide at the Doges palace etc. we didnt and they wouldnt give us one. Didnt have a very good impression of the staff at the any of the museums or places we visited they were more interested in chatting to one another or texting on their mobiles than doing their job. mostly they just looked bored and like Tourists were some sort or imposition rather than how they make their money!!! friendly and helpful they werent!! Hotel staff can help you with the trip to murano/burano or anywhere else that you want to visit. I thought the breakfast was just ok because I like something warm to eat in the morning, but my partner thought the breakfast was decent and filing. after you check in go out and just wonder about, get lost ( though you cant really just follow the signs for rialto/san marco or back the way towards the hotel to p. roma or alla ferrovia the train station) and ABOVE all wear comfortable shoes and enjoy :) I loved venice and I will definatley go back and I would love to stay at the antiche figure room 411 again :)", "Date": "February 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coventry, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat small hotel\u201d", "Author": "oggiebedworth", "ReviewID": "UR56252123", "Content": "We stayed during Carnival and the hotel was an oasis of calm.

We were offered a room on the grand canal for the same price. This room was absolutely gorgeous - beautifully decorated with a four poster bed in gold brocade fabric. The staff could not have been nicer, even taking our luggage from the Hotel Figure to the Canal Grande. In the evening, we were offered a free drink of our choice, and while the hotel yet has table and chairs outside (the request has been made to the city) we sat on the small balcony and watched the boats go up and down the canel. The location is a plus if taking a cruise, or the train. Do take the bus from the airport to Plazza Roma, and the hotel is just down the street - within walking distanct. We were able to go St. Mark square and other sites with little effort (but the crowd was unbearable, we could not stay in that area). I would recommend this hotel in a heart beat......you will not find a nicer place to stay, or a more friendly staff.

Our room was down an alley to the right of the main hotel. You may think this is a bit dodgy but really it is fine, there are loads of alley ways in Venice. It also meant it was quieter. Not really sure why it was a suite and we could not compare to a normal room, however it was very clean and had two armchairs to sit on (and another desk chair). BBC Worldwide on the TV. Powerful shower, no bath, canopy bed. Breakfast was not included in our rate but we paid 7 euros each per day to have breakfast in the main part of the hotel which was worth it. We have cereal, fresh fruit, hard boiled eggs, cold meats and cheese. The coffee was not very good from the machine however the waitress will make you one if you ask and not charge you any more which is better. Five euros for a diet coke and another five for a glass of wine in the hotel, this is the norm for anything on the grand canal - get used to it. We took up their offer of pasta on our first night, as we arrived at 10pm. It was costly and not that great but filled a hole. Directions for the hotel: If you have never been to Venice before remember there are loads of canals. The Grand Canal only has four bridges across it. If you arrive at Piazzale Roma, which is likely if you fly in then catch a bus/shuttle, you could come out of it any which way. Make sure you head for the \"new bridge\" - it looks new. However DO NOT go over it, stand at the bottom of the new bridge with the bridge on your left. Then turn with your back to it and walk forwards you will have to go over at least one, possibly two bridges over smaller canals. You will come to the hotel on your right. Please see pictures. It is right opposite the train station which is a slightly modern art deco long low building. Points of note for venice in general: Always take your map out with you (Time out is a great guide book) Check opening times and most importantly days of restaurants you like the look of so you are not disappointed when you go back and they are shut. Expect a cover charge - to include poptentially bread and sometimes service. This could be from one euro to five euros per person. Murano is worth a visit as is Lido.

We were wanting to stay near San Marco..because that is all we knew of Venice, but after reading these reviews decided to book here anyway. We could not have been more happy with our decision. The location is excellent! You will not fully appreaciate how easy it is to get to and from this hotel from the Airport until you have spent time wandering Venice, which is truly like one big labrynth. Also we took in a day trip to Rome and this was very easy as we just had to walk across the bridge to the train station. Carlos and Franchesca were there to greet us upon arrival. We had arrived from Canada earlier than expected and they acted quickly to facilitate us with a room as we were both very tired from the flight. During our eight day stay the rooms were maintained emaculately and had every emenity that I could have expected. I suspect the only reason this hotel is rated a three star is because it doesn't have a restaruant but that was fine by us. We didn't travel half way across the world to eat at the hotel. As I would learn Carlos was a native of Venice and had some excellent suggestions as to where to eat. One restaurant in particular \"Al Ponte dei Tolentini\", was by far the best dinning experience we had in Venice. Also staff made arrangement for us to attend an Opera where they were showing \"La Treviata\", the opera house was not as grande as \"La Fenice\" but it was a nice experience and the staff arranged for a water taxi to pick us at the hotel and bring us there. These little things made a big difference in our stay as we would not have been able to arrange them on our own as neither of us spoke any Italian. We spent our days wondering the foot paths and exploring Venice. We got to see alot more of it than I think we would have if we had have booked in San Marco. San Marco is wonderful and we eventualy ended up there every day, but the journey there was half the fun. If I had to offer one critism, it would be the bar tender Silvio.....but that might be because I don't like anyone younger and better looking than me who diverts my girlfreinds attention;) Actually he was great, and we enjoyed some laughs together out on the patio.

After spending three days in Venice I really began to understand just how important this location was. We saw so many tourists dragging there bags through crowded narrow coble stone streets looking for their hotels. It just looked like a nightmare. Taking the water bus also looked like a nightmare since it was super packet and water taxis are outrageous. We had the canal vie double room. The room was great. right on the water and a window in the shower which is nice. The staff is all very friendly and helpful. There are several tables outside to sit and have a drink or coffee. We spent a few hours each day just hanging out watching the gondola guys argue with people over the price. Here's a tip. It's going to cost you 80EUR so dont bother trying to hagle.in Three days i saw one couple get it for 70EUR. Its not worth the trouble. I also recommend not getting the water bus mustiples day pay or even taking the water bus. It is not worth it. you can walk to most of the places in the same time it takes for the water bus. It is much more romantic and interesting just to walk. Its very confusing to walk but you figure it out. I didnt take once water bus and i couldnt be happier. Back to the hotel's location. Its unbeatable. The main area near St. Marks is so crowded its just plain nuts and there are always cruise ships in.

We sat outside on the plaza, overlooking the canal each morning though they did have a breakfast room inside. They provided juices, hot drinks, 3 cereals, choice of pastries, bread, jam , fruit and yoghurt-plenty to keep us going all morning. Food in Venice is expensive. There are a couple of supermarkets. There are also plenty of restaurants but we found they all had pretty well the same offerings-set price 3 courses from 12-20eu ea: pasta, pizza or chicken or fish-both the latter ones with little imagination or taste. You get an entree, main and the 3rd course is salad or potatoes with the main! We found a place we went back to frequently for its value. Cant remember the name but if you continue past the rail terminus towards San Marco, its a few hundred metres down on the left. The staff all wear black & orange-bright orange caps! and they have an ice cream servery facing the street - best value ice creams on Venice! They give huge scoops so for 1.20 for one scoop its more than enough. On the other side of the shop is the pizza bar. You can choose from their menu or have made to order. We found the small size (12\") adequate to share and at 6eu great value. We bought some cheap but nice italian wine at the supermarket and sat on a jetty/pier ea night watching life go by. Theres lots to do. The vaporetto (water buses-ferries) are the best way to get around-buy day passes and go everywhere. In peak hour theyre busy so youll have to stand. Our hotel organised a 'free' water taxi transfer to Murano island, where all the fantstic glassware factories are. Be aware: they take you to the large galleries and its hard not to feel pressured to buy, but resist and treat it as an art gallery-fantastic! As we didnt buy we also didnt get a return trip back and were directed to the ferry, but we walked around the entire isalnd (its not huge)and found lots of family crafts/shops selling glass jewellery, ornaments, home wares, art etc at considerably cheaper prices but all authentic Murano. 8 eu for a trip up the tower lift in San Marco square is well worth the panoramic view from the top, and youll find loads of market stalls to barter at, as well as all the designer shops. Theres also a number of concerts held in the ancient churches in the evenings, worth going to. Friends of ours were lucky enough to 'happen upon' an Andre Boccelli full final rehearsal in San Marco one afternoon-for no cost!!! We didnt do the gondolas-most want 80eu and whilst its economical if the boat is shared (some took 6), its not as romantic, and too expensive for us. We took the airport bus from Treviso airport at about 7eu return. Take note: on return you are allocated a bus by your departure flight. We like to be at airports well ahead of time (learnt the hard way!) but were told we had to wait for another hour. I guess they need to give priority to passengers on earlier flights, and we did arrive the 2 hrs ahead as recommended, on our allocated bus. Our hotel was happy to hold our luggage after checkout, & even to use their lobby bathroom to freshen up before we left. Another note: there are lots of public loos in Venice, all serviced and all charging 1.50eu to use!! (the rail stationis slighly better at .80cents!) I was aware that many hotels are difficult to find as its so easy to get lost in the maze of Venetian streets; I did a google map of ours before we arrived-I chose the 'walk to' option and had no problems locating ours.

I think its worth it to get the breakfast because Venice is rather expensive and at least this way you can eat alot before making your way out to see the sights.

Its free, the only kicker is that you have to go to a 20 min tour of the factory and listen to a sales pitch. but you dont have to buy anything. if youre not into sales pitches, you can take a water bus to Murano and the other islands from the stop across the hotel.

The rooms are comfy, the staff go out of their way to accommodate you. They'll look after your bags if you arrive early or need to catch a late train or bus on your way out. For any brits flying Ryan Air, this is a very easy hotel to get to. The bus drops you off at the bus station, follow the signs for the train station, cross over the big bridge onto the pavement on the other side of the canal to the station, turn right and its about a hundred yards up the canal side! We had a canal view room when my wife and I went back to Venice this summer (we stayed at the same hotel on our first visit). It was only a short break (a long weekend), but we loved it. The water bus stop is just the other side of the bridge and from there you can get pretty much anywhere in Venice within 30 mins. So as far as location goes, yes it may not be next to the square, but equally, you don't have to walk through Venice with all your luggage when you arrive and depart! The only downside (really with Venice as a whole) is cost. To stay a week is eye-wateringly expensive and to be honest, once you've done the normal touristy things you'd be bored. We'll only go back for long weekends now, to sit on the water boats and watch Venice go by, have a good meal out and have a wonder down the narrow roads. Venice is lovely, but whatever you do, don't go for more than a week at absolute tops. You'll be bored out of your mind. Oh, and penny-less as well!

It's a slight way to the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Square, but there's a vaporetto stop right across the way if you don't want to walk. They also have wi-fi, but you have to ask for the code. The breakfast is NOT included, so we didn't try it. It was rather pricey and we preferred to get a small pastry on the way.

It really was a perfect place to stay because of the convenience of getting to the train station and the bus station. Being on the grand canal wasn't half bad either! The staff was very accommodating. We noticed it the most when a demanding guest insisted they MUST have skim milk (not 1%). The next day for breakfast they went out and specifically bought skim milk just for this one guest. The Murano tour that they give for free is really great, but they try very hard to sell you their extremely expensive glass at the factory so stay strong if you don't want any :) The cafe was great and we loved sitting out at the tables and ordering a cafe latte.

We booked through Expedia who offered a good flight/hotel deal. Venice hotels are not cheap and the Antiche Figure does not buck the trend but in comparison with others in the city it was averagely priced. Despite being at the other end of the Grand Canal from San Marco, it could not be more conveniently placed for visitors arriving in Venice. It lies opposite the train station just one bridge away and is just three minutes and two bridges away from Piazzale Roma where the Airport bus drops you off. The Water Bus stop is over the bridge by the station which enables you to reach any part of the city easily enough and most places are easily reached on foot through the labyrinth of alleyways and canal banks that make this city unique. Outside the front door is a Gondola pier for that must have, if expensive, trip on the traditional Venetian boat. Having got there you will be welcomed by the most pleasant, friendly and helpful staff you can imagine. We had booked a triple room which meant we would occupy a suite. This, along with a number of others, was not situated in the main hotel building but in the apartment block next door. Access was up the alley to the right of the main building and entry was remotely controlled by the hotel staff who utilised CCTV to ensure only guests would get access. This arrangement might put some people off but please don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it worked well and gave the impression of occupying an actual Venetian apartment. The suite itself could not have been nicer. There was a living area, a bedroom and a shower room. The third bed was made up in the living area which also had a small kitchen behind glass doors. The bedroom was not overly big but perfectly acceptable and nicely decorated. The shower was really impressive with water jets attacking you from all angles, though the taps had a mind of their own sometimes. The apartment is air conditioned which was a godsend on a hot, humid summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s day. We were only there two nights prior to a cruise but it would have been a perfect base for a week or even longer. Back in the main building there was a small bar next to the reception. There were tables outside, ideal to watch the world float by. The breakfast area was behind and served a typical continental style breakfast buffet for 7 Euros per head. I was delighted to find that good quality internet access was free and not used as a source of revenue by the hotel. A cable is supplied for your laptop for use in the room and a PC, along with wireless access for you laptop, is available in the lobby area. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not surprised that this hotel rates #4 in Trip Advisor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s list of nearly five hundred Venice hotels. What is surprising is that three other hotels rate higher.

The shower floor is flat with the rest of the bathroom floor so you need to navigate the water stream but how long is a shower ?!.

It was refreshing and lovely sitting by the canal at sunset The next morning we had breakfast at the outside terrace that was great . I had picked this hotel because it was close to the train station so after breakfast we crossed the bridge in front of the hotel to the train station, real convenient. Hotel also convenient to the gondola rides(right in front of hotel) across the bridge for vaporettos, and a lovely walk to St Marks square thru all the narrow and wide street full of shops places to eat. really fun. If you stayed farther in you might not do that walk. Prices are comparable to most in Venice.

We loved being able to cross one bridge from the train station and be at the hotel. The person checking us in spent a lot of time trying to get us to take a suite in the \"new annex down the street for just 30 more euro a night rather than the usual 120\"; we wanted to see our room in the main hotel but it wasn't ready. When we came back to the hotel after some sightseeing we got the hard sell again; when we finally were shown our room in the main hotel, we were thrilled and didn't bother going to see the annex. With that out of the way, the rest of the stay was near perfect. The room was small (rooms in Italy are always small) but very clean and comfortable (it was the only double bed we slept on in Italy which wasn't just two singles pushed together), the marble bathroom was small but luxurious, and being around the side of the building gave us just the right amount of light and noise from the Grand Canal (people staying in the front of the hotel should know that the Canal gets busy with boats and barges after 730 am; still, it's away from the tourist hordes around Saint Mark's). From the hotel it's easy to get around Venice, whether walking or taking a vaporetto to the train station stop. Once we got past the check-in unpleasantness, the staff could not have been more helpful. They made reservations at a small restaurant for our final night (and even called us in the room to ask the times we wanted) and drew a map. There was free and fast wifi in the lobby. One other thing, though--we reserved through Expedia, and the hotel made a big deal that we would have to pay 7 euro a person for breakfast \"through a special deal with Expedia\", where if we'd reserved through the hotel's website we would have gotten it for free. We know other people have complained on TA about this policy, and we have to agree. They should offer breakfast to everyone, or not.

I read on the Venice forum that there was a free shuttle to Piazza Rome, but our ship ( Wind Surf) docked right on the main channel, instead of main terminal occupied by mega ships. So, no shuttle and the only way to get to the hotel was by water taxi(especially with many luggage). Do not try to walk to any hotel in Venice! It is difficult to do with uneven surface and unbelievable number of bridges you must cross. There were 8 of us with 13 bags and the taxi was worth every penny at 170 euros. It delivered us right infront of hotel's dock and bellman was there to help. There is also public taxi for 7 euros which makes many stops, but you nedd to know where your hotel is and get off at nearest dock. I would not try it with many bags. Just remember, knowing where your hotel is located and minimizing distance to walk will eliminate a big frustration. Saving few euros can cost you much headach and taint your first impression of this beautiful city. The staff at the hotel was simply amazing, they could not have done enough for us.

Overall, we liked the hotel and would stay there again and would recommend it, as others have here, but in the interest of full disclosure, here are both the positives and potential drawbacks: Positives: - DIRECTLY across the train station. You walk outside, you see it across the canal. Walk across the nearby bridge and you are \"home\" - Staff is very friendly and helpful -- they will do whatever is necessary to make your stay enjoyable - The room is clean and the bathrooms are nice. We didn't pay for a canal view room, but that was fine since we were never in the room to enjoy it. - Free internet access in your room through a LAN cable, by wi fi in the lobby, or on the hotel's computer in the lobby. - More of a \"residential\" part of the city, which is good, because the restaurants nearby are where the \"locals\" eat, the food is very good, and the prices are much lower than what you would pay for similar meals near the Rialto bridge or St. Mark's square. Walk the area, find a local place, and you'll eat a great meal most of the time. We stumbled across \"Muro\" our first night as we got lost in the maze of streets nearby and had a fabulous meal with very inexpensive and good wine (the hotel recommended a tourist place in St. Mark's square; we didn't eat there but the places around it were much more overpriced and charged higher service fees and a \"cover charge\" the local places often did not). Negatives: - Area can seem a little seedy at night especially since there are no real tourist attractions nearby and there are guys selling counterfeit bags on the nearby bridge. Take the canal \"bus\" rather than walking through the maze if you want to get to St. Mark's or the Rialto bridge area. It costs about 6 euro, and gets you to St. Mark's within 30 minutes and you get a nice canal cruise to boot. - The hotel nickel and dimes you when it comes to the \"free\" breakfast. If you book through the hotel, the breakfast is free. Even though we paid the same price for our room as the hotel wanted to book with them directly, we were told that breakfast would cost us 7 Euros (\"half\" of the normal paid price) because we booked through Expedia and the hotel had to pay them commission. I think that is simply the cost of doing business and I shouldn't have to pay for breakfast if the guy sitting next to me, paying the same price for a room, gets to eat for free.

One might need to know that if you face the canal, when the large boats hit the curb there is a grinding sound. The train station is just across the canal, so this is a major hub of boats and traffic, and one can hear the grinding until late at night and early in the morning.

Previous correspondents have not exaggerated the charm of this hotel. The building is full of history and appears in some of Canaletto\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s paintings but it has been tastefully modernised and offers every comfort. The location may not be in the centre but we found this to be a bonus as it is so convenient for arrivals and departures, being close to the bus and railway stations and with 2 bridges crossing the Grand Canal nearby. Gondolas may be hired right outside the hotel and the vaporetto stop is just on the other side of the canal.

We chose this hotel based on the wonderful comments we read here on Trip Advisor. There was no exageration. The hotel, location and staff are absolutely great. This was our first trip to Venice and the location close to the train station seemed like a good idea. When we arrived it was lightly raining and knowing it was a very short walk to our hotel was a relief. We literally could see the hotel when we exited the train station. As luck would have it, however, the sun came out within minutes. We were graciously greated and brought to our room by Michael. Our fourth floor, corner room overlooked the grand canal. It was a wonderful view and was mezmorizing to watch the coming and going of the various boats on the canal. The room was nicely appointed and very clean. Venice itself was fascinating. A maze of narrow alleys and canals. So much fun to get lost in. Forget the maps - it's impossible to figure out where you are. My husband kept saying... \"Oh, I think we've been HERE before, when trying to find out way back to a location... only to find out we were in an entirely different area than we thought!\" Just keep wandering, you'll get to where you're going eventually. Food is extremely expensive in Venice! Two cookies and two small coffees in a lovely little cafe cost more that 20 Euro! They WERE good, but we only did that once. Take the free shuttle to Murano Glass factory. It was fantastic to see the craftsmanship and beauty they produce there. We did not find them at all pushy, but more than willing to spend time showing you every detail of any piece you showed any interest in. In closing, we were so glad we chose this hotel.

Yes, the friendliness of the staff is quite amazing, you feel that you have come to visit old friends. You only had to ask for something and it was done straightaway. The location of the hotel is perfect - our room overlooked the Grand Canal and there was such a great atmosphere when you stood on the balcony and watched the world go by. One reviewer commented that there was a lot of noise from the water buses on the Canal, however we found the double glazing extremely effective in excluding the noise and were not at all affected by it. The staff were also so helpful in advising where to visit, the best way to get there, when to go and went to great pains to point you in the right direction. Apart from the excellent hotel, we absolutely loved Venice, the sights, the sounds, the atmosphere - all were so thoroughly enjoyable and so uniquely Venice! Do make sure you wear good walking shoes though, as we were told the best way to see Venice is to get lost there! You can see so much more if you wander down all the little back streets. But take a map! Also there is just nowhere to sit down unless you sit at one of the many cafes but you have to order something, you can't just rest for 10 minutes. One thing to bear in mind - Venice is very expensive! We were expecting this and as we live in London thought we should be used to that but were quite shocked when we visited the renowned Cafe Florian and the bill came to 60 euros for two coffees, one diet coke and one chocolate cake!!! Plus you are charged extra (6 euros per person) for the benefit of listening to the music being played outside! Still you have to do these things once in a lifetime at least. We also did the gondola ride, 80 euros, but again if you go to Venice you just HAVE to do it. Do visit as many of the churches as you can fit in, they are all so awe inspiring. We were only there for 2 days and felt that we should have stayed at least another day, hopefully we will return at some point in the future and make sure that we add an extra day.

I cannot imagine a nicer place than the Antiche Figure. We took a junior suite in a separate building a few steps down the calle away from the noise and bustle of the Grand Canal. The bedroom was bright and airy with a small separate sitting room and tiny kitchenette built into the wall. Perfect. Carlos, Jani, and Michel took care of every request, serving us a Spritz Venezio in the early evening in front of the hotel where we could watch the boats ply the canal as the sun set, and then suggesting a restaurant for the evening meal. Make sure you get directions and be prepared to wander and ask for help, but don't give up, these guys know their restaurants and clientele. We had the gnocchi and crab sauce at \"Giorgione\" on their recommendation, with a bottle of Paladin Salbonello. Wonderful! The next night was a bottle of Valpolicella Brigaldera at \"Fontego dei Piscatore\", where the owner, Mr. Lolo, insisted we try the cuttlefish pasta. Wow! Breakfasts were a quiet simple delight. Make sure you go to the first stop to get vaporetto #1 for your Grand Canal cruise; you'll be sure to get a bow seat in the open. (Francesca advised us to do this.) The trip to Murano for a glass factory tour is worth it just for the private water taxi ride out to the island. The sales pitch after the tour is relentless, but the glass is astoundingly beautiful. The Anitche's location is the best in Venice, just steps from the train station and a nice walk to everywhere in the city.

The location is great. It's a 20 minute walk to St. Mark's but honestly, that isn't where a visitor to Venice should spend much time. Instead, wander the side streets and canals and get as lost as possible! For this experience, Antiche Figure is perfect - it's location across from the Ferrovia makes it easy to find your way home no matter where you are since there are signs all over Venice for \"alla Ferrovia\". Plus, the hotel's location on the Grand Canal makes it easy to access the vaporetto, train, water taxi and gondola. You don't have to worry about dragging your luggage all over the city when entering and leaving Venice. The hotel itself is beautiful - we stayed in two different rooms during our 7-night stay and both exceeded our expectations. The first room was in the main building and was decorated in traditional Venetian style with Murano fixtures and a lovely marble bath. However, the room was small for three people so we moved after three nights to a suite in the adjacent building. What a gem! These rooms are more modern but very luxurious from the floors to the linens and even the ceilings. There are some minor drawback to staying in this building: is there is no elevator and if you're on the top level expect to climb two flights of stairs. Also, the bedroom of the suite was dark...additional lighting would be welcomed. We found the beds to be harder in the newer rooms but the front desk can provide a soft pad that solves the problem - be sure to ask for it if you're not accustomed to a very firm mattress. The marble bathroom with modern fixtures was fantastic - we enjoyed the shower and it had very good water pressure. Lastly, I can't say enough good things about all the staff at Antiche Figure, specifically Carlo. They are all so warm and friendly and speak excellent English. Carlo became our new best friend in Venice and never failed to be there with helpful advice on sightseeing, restaurants, and everything in general. Staying at Antiche Figure was a huge part of our wonderfully perfect Venice experience and we are eternally grateful to the staff for their role in making our trip so memorable.

The staff contine to be extreemly friendly and helpful and go out of their way to ensure you have a good stay. At breakfast you are offered a cup of 'proper' coffee rather than that from the instant coffee machine in the breakfast room. The selection at breakfast was more than adequate for all but those guest who think if it's not what they have at home then it's not good! The location of the hotel is ideal, being only a couple of hundred meters from the bus station with its direct transfers to and from the airport (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac3 each way). Getting about on the water bus is easy but I would recommend walking, as even the small back streets have signs directing you to Rialto or St Marks (or Ferovia to get you back to the hotel). The range of shops you can find in these small streets are amazing and you seem to find a different route and different things to see each day.

Went to Harry's bar, which was most definitely a rip off (15 euros for a smallish Bellini and nowhere to sit) - stay well away.

We had requested 2 rooms with views over the Grand Canal. Both rooms were very clean and furnished to a very high standard. High ceilings, and thick cream carpet. My only minor disapointment was the fact that the LCD television was not picking up any channels in our room. This was not important to us as we had no intention to spend any time in our room watching the tv when one of the most interesting cities in the world lay outside our hotel. We didnt bother to report it to hotel staff. However, I am sure had we done so, the matter would have been resolved immediately. The staff in the hotel were second to none. They could not have been more helpful or friendly. We were given great recomendations in terms of restaurants, sightseeing locations and airport transfers. I cannot speak highly enough of the staff at this hotel. The manager, the concierge, the cleaner were all very approachable and made you feel very welcome. The hotel is located in the north of the city near to Ferrovia, the train station. A Waterbus terminal was literally a stones throw from the hotel. We tended to catch the water bus back to the hotel at the end of a busy days walking. Part of the fun of Venice is walking through and over the narrow side streets and bridges. Plenty of hidden gems lie in wait in the form of churches, shops and world class photo backdrops. This city is truly unique and a must visit to any true traveller.

We stayed in room 312, overlooking the Grand Canal. What was best is that the room had apparently just been recently renovated, as the room smelled of freshly laid carpet (and yes, you could tell it was definitely new carpet). First and foremost, the room was incredible: greenish marble backroom, with antique-style fixtures; the bedroom was presented in very relaxing colors, beige, blue, gold, and yellow, with a lovely chandelier and sitting area; windows looked out onto the Grand Canal (see photos). The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, greeting us every morning with a \"Buongiorno,\" and ending every night with a welcoming phrase (thanks to the night manager, I think named Enrico ?). The hotel was well positioned up near Piazalle Roma and the train station, with easy links to the mainland. There were also plenty of gondolas and water taxis around as well, and the hotel was happy to arrange. I think the best thing about this hotel was that you had excellent access to \"off the beaten path\" Venice. So, easy access to the historical Jewish Ghetto in Cannaregio, wonderful shops around the Grand Canal right across the Ponte degli Scalzi, short walk to the famous Casino de Venezia (wear a suit or sportscoat, guys), and more, and more, and more. I'll be honest: crossing the Scalzi bridge and walking along the canal, you are talking a 30-40 minute walk to the Rialto Bridge, then a further 10 minutes to the Piazza San Marco. However, we found the areas in the more touristy neighborhoods to be overrun with people, busy, and loud. It was a welcome change, after a long day of photos, sightseeing, walking tours, boat rides, and cappuccinos, to come back and find a nice, lovely, quiet hotel waiting to welcome us with a much needed night of recharging sleep. And the walk to and fro the hotel alone was worth it, making your way through side streets, past the many hidden churches towering in the dark and through the labyrinthine passages that make Venice such a special city (and often at night, when the ghosts of the past really come alive). If this sounds appealing, then Antiche Figure is the hotel for you. So, here is my advice. Read all the reviews, listen to all the opinions, check out all the photos. But the fact is, put aside the hype and rating, and the fact remains: this is an excellent hotel, with excellent value, in an excellent location, and for what it's worth, for us, there was no better place to be in Venice.

The Hotel is not in the prettiest part of Venice - it is quite a way from the centre but travelling by water bus into the centre is a great trip on its own.

The hotel rooms are well fitted, immaculately clean and the linen and towels of first rate quality, although the rooms are perhaps a little on the small side. Although it was an old palace the whole place is fitted to a great spec. The public rooms are too small - the lounge area and the breakfast area are actually quite small, however, wherever we went in Venice the intenal areas are not large. This is not a capital city like London, Paris, but anybody who is a romantic at heart will adore the place - it epitomises charm.

I booked after looking at the hotel website and checking everything out on Trip Advisor---which was so helpful for planning our trip there and to Vienna. The front desk was very good about emailing all info and confirmations. I even wrote a few days before since I booked the room months in advance; they always replied promptly etc. They genuinely wanted us to have a good stay. The front desk staff was very accommodating---gave us names of places to try for eating, gave us an early morning cappucino and continental breakfast at 5:00a.m. the day we left for an early flight. They offered us a room upgrade for a nominal amount, which was really worth it to be facing the Grand Canale. We were there when it was cold, so the tourists were not there enmasse, loud etc. It was great room . .. great coffeemaker in the room fully stocked with teas and coffee, and fantastic amenities like shampoos, toothbrushes with paste etc. So nice since it's such a pain with the airline restrictions now. Flat screen TV. The hotel has recently been remodeled; it's clean and lots of marble in the bathrooms, nice decor. Even the inside room we looked at was nice, but a good deal cozier (small) than the one we ended up with. Either way, they have nice rooms. The staff couldn't have been kinder and more helpful! (They will make you a nice cappucino in the bar and bring it to the breakfast area if you ask, and then will just charge it to your room. It's lovely, better than the coffee machine, which isn't terrible either) The bar also has some little sweet treats to buy and maybe even some sandwiches; I didn't check. No full restaurant service tho, but a cute little nook in the lobby across from the bar, if you want to enjoy something downstairs, which people did I noticed. The breakfast I thought was very good---quite a big spread of all kinds of baked items, boiled eggs, fruit, cereals, yogurt and so forth. A lovely big breakfast room--enough to handle all the clientele. The staff weren't pushy, either, about getting you out of the breakfast, which was nice since you're on vacation! They arranged the FREE water taxi to Murano (you can take a water bus home) which was really nice, although the taxi takes you to a small, artist gallery glass factory which is pretty pricey--the cheapest thing we saw was 60 Euro, but we did enjoy the little demonstration and looking in the showroom. NO obligation to buy; the hotel staff even mentioned that, but you do have to steel yourself for the sales pitch. The last demonstrations were around 3 or 4:00 in the afternoon, so watch the timing. It's a short walk from there up the hill to the main street and canal where there are plenty of other shops and restaurants. You catch the water bus from there. One thing to watch in the restaurants--especially near San Marks Square. There are two menu prices in many---one for take away items, drinks etc. and another price for sitting down, which can make it considerably more expensive. We were there without the big crowds, which was sooo nice. We enjoyed touring the Basilica and the Doges' Palace--esp. the prisons (very foreboding), but we enjoyed wandering around the streets just as much! Got a lot in because there was no waiting time, but it was chilly and probably felt even colder because you're on the water, so we were glad we had heavy coats and cashmere!

We took one look at the large bridge we would have to cross with the bags and decided to make it easy on ourselves and hired a water taxi right away. They quickly hauled our bags and us across the canal right in front of the hotel. We were met by Johnny who took care of us for our 3 day stay. Johnny recommended that we upgrade to room 511 which is what we did and what a great suite it was. We liked the sitting room with the sofa and extra desk, the bathroom was very spacious and the shower had some extra devices on it which made it more than just a shower. Antique Figure has a very well thought out breakfast each morning - all I can say is it was one of the best breakfast's we had during our entire 12 days in Italy. The hotel is in a perfect location and right near two vappereto stops. We got a 36 hour pass and used it for most of the time we were there. Riding the vappereto's around Venice is really a great way to see lots of Venice - they can get a little crowded at times - try and get seats at the bow or stern for better viewing. Of course we took the mandatory gondola ride and found one available right in front of the hotel. It was a 40 minute trip around the main and side canals - worth every bit of the 80 Euro charge, so good we added a nice tip as well... Learned quite a bit about Venice on that ride. There are lots of places to eat near by the Figure Hotel so you have that covered. By all means choose this hotel when you visit Venice. Since it is small be sure to book way ahead of your arrival date. When we visit Venice again of course we will stay at the Antique Figure again.

We were in Venice for a few days before leaving on a cruise on the Zuiderdam. We arrived on September 27 after flying from NY through Madrid, taking the 3 Euro \"blue bus\" from the airport to Piazzale Roma (the only place in Venice that vehicles are allowed). The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from Piazzale Roma (it would have been five minutes as they suggest, but we were each pulling two large wheeled suitcases up and over the two bridges which were a bit challenging). When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by the manager, who offered us a choice of two rooms - and insisted that we go up and choose. The rooms are beautiful (even though we had one the lower cost \"red\" rooms) and the bath was marble with a wonderful shower. Once up and the room chosen, our bags arrived in about two minutes. We then went down (it was 2:30pm) and asked the manager if there was anywhere in the area to grab a quick lunch. He directed us down an alley next to the hotel to a series of small shops including a bakery and pizzeria. Having eaten, we returned and asked if there was a short walk we could take before we started thinking about dinner. He pulled out a map, told us how to get Vaporetto (water bus) tickets (a 3-day pass), and mapped out a route for us to San Marcos via water and then a walk back. It seemed aggeressive, but it was perfect! By the way, you can pretty much throw your map away in Venice. Despite what you read, you are never really lost. You see yellow signs everywhere for San Marcos, Rialto, Piazzala Roma, and Ferrovia (train station). Since the Antiche Figure is near both the train station and Piazzala Roma, just follow the signs until you get to the Grand Canal! The staff sent us to Osteria al Veccio Pozzo for dinner, a simple restaurant where we got the simple light meal we needed before crashing. The next morning, we went to the Antiche Figure's breakfast room where we found just about anything you'd want - from delightful pastries to cereal to juice, to meats and cheeses, boiled eggs, etc. The hostess was consistent with the rest of the staff - going overboard to be helpful - everyone was even asked whether they wanted cappuccino! Back for more advice from the staff, and then a day's run around the city. Their recommendation for dinner was Trattoria Antica Bessetta, where we eventually resorted to a map - it's not easy to find! But was it worth the effort! We met the owner, who told us about a trip that morning to the Venice Pescheria (open air fish market near the Rialto) where he found the perfect turbot, which we ordered. He brought it to the table in the foil in which is was baked, and then worked like an artist to prepare the perfect presentation on our plates. This place is well worth a visit, but make reservations. It was fully booked when we left.... Another restful night at the Antiche Figure, followed by check out and detailed directions on how to find the free shuttle bus that runs between the Piazzale Roma and the pier (we had previously contacted Holland America Line and they told us that there was no such bus) which was right where the staff told us it would be. Visiting the Antiche Figure is like going home, even though it may be your first visit. The staff makes you feel like family, and they have practiced their art well. We spoke to others who had stayed at other hotels - even one in famous Bauer for more than twice the money - and none could rave about the hotel, its staff and service, as we could.

Great breakfast, great location away from the crowds (you won't regret the 20 minute walk each night to walk off all the gelato you eat) and a very hospitable staff. Our room was adorable; the 5-head shower alone was worth the price, and we slept very well. Alessandro and Francesca were wonderful with restaurant recommendations, telling us what sights to see (although definitely plan on getting a little lost in Venice) - Alessandro even gave us a restaurant recommendation for Florence when he found out we were heading there next. Read the bad reviews in context - it's a city, of course there's graffiti. That has nothing to do with the hotel, or how nice and modern the buildings are inside. Part of the fun of traveling to Europe is that it is very different in a lot of ways than other places. Just enjoy it. NOTES: In terms of food, there are a lot of very touristy places. Seek out the smaller looking ones, where locals are eating. There is really good pizza (served on wax paper, by the slice) on the left hand side of the narrow street that leads you into the square right before the Accademia. The best gelato we found was La Boutique del Gelato. We took the hotel's free taxi to Murano.

They furnish robes, slippers, the whole nine yards! A nice buffet breakfast is furnished. A small bar off the lobby provides alcoholic libations as well as cappucinos and cafe Americano.

It's about a half hour walk to St. Mark's, but it's pleasant with numerous shops to browse around in or small cafes to grab a cappucino. There are a lot of cafes nearby, so going hungry won't be a problem. Overall, I couldn't give a higher recommendation to a hotel. Beware that everything in Venice has to be offloaded and transferred to a boat before delivery, so extra expenses are involved.

Once you put your 3 euros in ( it gives change), validate it in another machine near it before the bus comes. When you arrive at Piazza Roma (very busy area) you have a decision to make before going to the hotel. How will you get there. We are in our 60's and pulling our luggage over 2 stepped bridges nearly killed us. If you are young, you could walk to the hotel. If not,. take a water taxi at the Piazza. ( Even young people were struggling with their luggage) The hotel was fantastic and the room 411 overlooking the canal was so much fun. When you take a shower, you can open the bathroom window and look at the beautiful green dome right next to you. There are two windows that you can open over the canal and see and hear all of the action, but once you close the windows, we couldn't hear anything. Amazing! We could see the Railway Station right across the canal. The breakfast in the morning was typical European and we loved the little cappicino machine. Take your breakfast out to the tables in front of or the side of the hotel to eat. Don't miss the action. We couldn't understand why people would eat in the breakfast room.

I would like to keep the hotel a secret but that would not be fair! They deserve the business. The staff made my stay very special. By far this was the best hotel that I stayed at in Italy. I would recommend you choose this property for your stay for the following reasons: The staff - From the minute I arrived I was treated with the utmost courtesy and professionalism. All of the staff (I apologize I do not know all of their names) were wonderful. Each guest is treated like a valued customer. The lovely lady at the front desk was so pleasant when I arrived. She took the time to explain all of the main sites and options for accessing Venice. Linda (the very nice lady in the breakfast room) makes you a great cappuccino in the morning and is very pleasant. It is a nice way to start your day. The breakfast selection was great (meats, cheeses, cereals, pastries and juice). The location - it is right across the canal from the train station. You exit the train station to the left, cross the bridge and turn right and you are at the hotel. You do not have to drag your luggage on boats and canals. It is very convenient. In addition, the vaporetto stop (Ferrovia) is across the canal so you can easily access all of the sites. Tip:you can buy a 48 hour ACTV pass for 26.00 Euros or a 72 hour pass for 31 Euros. Walking is also possible with the signs that point you to San Marco and Rialto. I recommend a walk at night in particular. The room - I was upgraded to a beautiful suite which was located beside the hotel. It was spotlessly clean with excellent housekeeping service. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was large with a shower/tub combination. The suite had a full kitchen and two TVs. The toiletries were very nice and replaced daily. The hotel also has a very nice bar and at night you can sit at your table and enjoy a glass of wine while overlooking the canal. TIP: I enjoyed a lovely meal at Trattoria al Ponte Tel: [-] Address: Ponte del Megio (Calle Larga), Santa Croce 1666 The sea bass was excellent! I cannot wait to return to Venice and to this hotel.

It was wonderful to just go over one bridge and the hotel is right there. You will appreciate not having to walk far with your luggage. Noise from the outside was minimal, and any noise we did hear from those talking outside or from those passing by at night was rather comforting and lulled us to sleep. Honest negatives if there are to be any... no iron in the room but they will provide one if you ask, we had a couple spotty cleaning days (first time in the room--garbage in the bathroom wasn't taken out although we overlooked this) and then our room garbage wasn't taken out on another day we were there--but promptly removed after mentioning this to the front desk. It may have just been an \"off\" day for the cleaning staff, and may be a one-time thing. Only other negative would be having a direct view of the train station and canal, and not the canal and other Venetian buildings, but that is not a fault of the hotel, more so just a preference for some.

We read these reviews before booking the room and trust me (a complete stranger) staying there was one of the BEST decisions that we ever made. The hotel is on the northern portion of the grand canal adjacent to the Scalzi bridge. We hadn't been to Venice before, so we didn't know what this location meant. It's within a very short walk from the bus stop from the airport (Piazza le Roma) and across from both the train station and a vaporetto stop. This means that you can actually take the bus from the airport (~3 Euros/person), be dropped off at Piazza le Roma, and reasonably walk to the hotel with a small suitcase. (In full disclosure you still have to cross two bridges, though). We're young and found no problem making the walk. We can't imagine having to lug our suitcases around to the hotels further down the canal. Our room was on the top floor (deluxe blue decor, check out the website) overlooking the canal. It was really beautiful and they have an elevator which made the trip up easy. The room was very nice. Nice furniture, well lit, spotless, and it appeared newly renovated (not sure if it was, or if it has just been well taken care of). It was larger than the hotels we stayed at elsewhere in Europe. The bathroom was top notch, large, beautiful with marble and Murano glass fixtures It also had two sinks. Everyone at the front desk was friendly and helped us navigate through this beautiful city. They spoke excellent English (we started to feel guilty because we don't speak Italian) and took great care to make sure that we were happy with our stay. I wish we could have stayed longer, but alas the boat had to set sail. That brings up another point. While the cruise ship port is relatively close, it is too far to trek on foot. You can either take a water taxi (they are literally parked directly in front of the building, or you can walk to Piazza le Roma and take a bus provided by the port authority (our bus was free). Less than 5 minutes drive to the cruise terminal. Breakfast consisted of breakfast meats, cheeses, coffees, and breads. It was very good. We made use of the free computer in the lobby with internet access. I think that there is wifi access in the rooms (but don't quote me on that). We were pressed for space so we didn't pack a computer. We will definitely be staying here again when we return to Venice.

I made the right choice, so many thanks to all of you who stayed there before us and wrote reviews. The hotel sits on the Grand Canal immediately across from the train station, which is very convenient. We lucked out as we were crossing the bridge and a young many offered to carry all our bags for 10 euros. It was a bargain! (Note: If you're coming from Piazzale Roma, there is a porter service via boat that will take you and your luggage for 35 euro - also a great bargain given the number of bridges you have to cross.) I splurged on the deluxe canal view room and was glad I did. While it is true that straight across you see the train station, that is definitely outweighed by the opportunity to watch the passing traffic in the Canal. The rooms are generously-sized, exactly as pictured on the hotel's website, immaculately clean, AND the bathrooms are huge, particularly by European standards. Every staff member with whom we interacted was professional, pleasant and helpful both before we arrived, by making restaurant recommendations and reservations, and after we got there, by answering our numerous questions and arranging a water taxi to get us to the airport when we departed. Francesa and Michele were lovely and tried to anticipate our needs. There is a computer for guests' use in the lobby, or if you travel with your own notebook, as we did, you can request a network cable at the desk to use in your room. The breakfast was excellent. We laughed when an American family came into the breakfast room, inspected the food, turned up their noses and promptly announced there was \"nothing to eat.\" I don't know what they expected because both days there were hard-boiled eggs, several kinds of meat and cheese, three types of cereal, abundant pastries, croissants and breads, juices and freshly-made cappuccinos and espressos. Both evenings we were there, we sat out in the little \"cafe\" area they have facing the Canal and had grappa while we watched the passersby. All in all, it was a lovely ending to our three-week trip. We will certainly return to Venice - it's a fabulous city where walking everywhere is safe and doable - and when we do, we will stay at the Hotel Antiche Figure. One last note: if you're going to Italy, learn some Italian. I did, and it was most rewarding to see how appreciative the people were.

We had requested a room for three people and I was a bit apprehensive of what we were going to get, but could not have been more pleased with the room we were given. Upon check in, the staff was very friendly and gave us a briefing of where we were in relationship to all the major attractions. We were offered an upgrade for a suite in an adjacent building for a few more Euro, but opted to keep the room we booked. It was a beautiful room that fit a queen size bed and roll-in twin comfortably with a very large bathroom that looked like it was recently renovated. It was done in beautiful stone tiling with ample counter space, glass sconces, a shower, and bidet. If you stuck your head out the bathroom window, you could actually see the Grand Canal. The room itself was very clean and decorated accordingly with the old world charm of Venice. To some, the location may seem far from places like the Rialto (a 10-15 minute walk) or Piazza San Marco (a 20 minute vaporetto ride), but it proved extremely convenient to the train station (from where we arrived) and to Piazzale Roma where all the taxis and shuttles depart from to the airport (from where we left.) The only word of warning is that you will need to carry your luggage over the Scalzi Bridge (around 80 steps) from the train station) and two other bridges if you're heading to Piazzale Roma. It's a small price to pay for the great location and sure beats rolling your luggage to a hotel around Piazza San Marco or lugging it onto a water taxi. The area felt very safe and easy to find your way back after wandering all the streets and canals (just keep following the signs that say Ferrovia). Getting lost is the quintessential experience in Venice and it's how you discover some amazing architecture, shops, and restaurants. We had breakfast at the hotel on our last day and enjoyed the simple buffet of pastries, fruit and coffee. The free internet terminal in the lobby was also a nice bonus.

After staying here, i think the answer is: you walk away with nothing to complain about and you realize how rare that is. This hotel was great - not the best hotel of course - but for the price, it's great. I guess it is the absence of bad reviews that puts this hotel in such a high position. There wasn't any one thing that was great - but everything was above average. And if you're spending your own money, you won't feel like you overspent here. This hotel charges you for nothing extra (the internet wi-fi for free was a big plus) except late-afternoon beverages or drinks and mini-bar items. It's refreshing to walk away from a hotel and not have a bunch of extra charges on your bill. I've read all the reviews and everyone seems to be in agreement - staff is fabulous, location is excellent. The only things I'd add: yes, the floors/ceilings are thin. Hearing the water running (loudly) through the walls/ceiling was surprisingly loud. Not worth a bad review, but worth a mention. And yes, beds are extra firm - could have asked for another room probably, but wasn't worth the energy. Also, on the plus side: there's a laundromat right behind the hotel and right near the residences (where we stayed). It's great to have access to a washer/dryer even if you don't think you'll use it. And when you check out, they actually ask you if you have suggestions for them - and sound like they really want to know, which is great!

Shower was nice and hot and plenty of towels. The lack of bath did not bother us. The bed was large and comfortable and we had a great nights sleep. The only minor thing that stops me giving the hotel an \"excellent\" rating is that we had a glass light fitting which clinked and rattled when ever the person in the room above walked around.

Dry toast, hard boiled eggs, cold meats, cheese, various fruits, cereals, juice, tea etc. They will make you a fresh cappucino at their little bar in the front of the hotel and bring it back to the breakfast room. The room was small but very comfortable with the best bed we had in Europe. We were offered a canal front room when we arrived for 30 euros extra but stayed with the smaller back room. It was just fine considering every waking moment we were out. The cheapest and easiest way to get around Venice is by buying a pass for the ferries that go about every 10 minutes. Buy a pass for the number of days you are there. It will save you heaps. If you are coming to Venice by plane it is cheapest (2 euros) and possibly quickest to catch a bus (15 minutes).

The hotel is located almost directly across the Grand Canal from the train station, which was extremely convenient as we were planning to continue on to Florence by rail. Hotel Antiche Figure also has a charming Bar / Cafe area to accomodate their guests day and night with cafe tables located inside and outside the hotel. For a small fee you can include breakfast in the cafe during your stay...something I strongly recommend! As beautiful as the Hotel Antiche Figure was, it would just be like any other hotel without its wonderful staff! Everyone we came in contact with was friendly, polite and most important, helpful. From Alessandro and Francesca at the front desk, to Michele, who went out of his way to make my daughter 'the best hot cocoa she has ever tasted', to the chamber maids, everyone was fantastic!

Add \"kind and patient\" to the glowing reports for front desk personnel. Here is some extra info: 1. Booked 3 \"superior\" rooms 5 months in advance via hotel website and expedia for pre-cruise stay. Our rooms on the 2nd. 3rd and 4th floors appeared exactly as shown on website. Very firm beds. Adequate size for us. Anyone over 6'2\" and 300 lbs might find the superior rooms a tad small. Walls are padded to reduce noise. There is a lift. Guests may use one computer in lobby for free internet access. TV has English language news channel. 2. Breakfast is included with room rate if booked via website but cost 5 euros ( a bargain) if booked on expedia. Ask server to make you a cappucino (no extra cost) or use the coffee machine. 3. Arrived via \"blue bus\" from Marco Polo airport to Piazzale Roma (bus terminal) in the pouring rain. Bus terminal is an open-air bus stop, not a building. Cheap plastic rain ponchos are assets during the rainy season. 4. To get to hotel by foot from Piazzale Roma, look for the white stone bridge or the green metal bridge directly in front of the \"terminal exit.\" The exit is lined with small souvenir shops. There is a public WC. The bridges cross the Rio Nuovo (small canal) and consists of about 40 to 50 steps (no ramp). Once you cross either bridge, the Grand Canal will be on your left hand side (you can't miss it). Keep walking along the Grand Canal. The hotel will be straight ahead. You need to cross another small bridge (about 30 steps) before reaching the hotel. The walk takes about 10 minutes, depending on how well you drag your cases over the bridges. We had 3 elderly travellers who were able to negotiate the \"step\" bridges with their cases with assistance. 4. To get to hotel by vaporetto (public water bus) or water taxi: wouldn't recommend vaporetto. Too crowded. Water taxi stand is just steps from the terminal \"exit\", along the Rio Nuovo, and takes you to a landing right in front of the hotel. Costly but worth it if you have mobility problems and lots of luggage. 5. To get to the cruise port: there are two cruise ship ports. find out which one you need. Ask front desk about sharing water taxi to the port. Elderly members of our group rebelled against walking back to Piazzale Roma to catch free port shuttle. Shared taxi fare with 7 passengers- total cost of 110 euros (about 16 euros per person) to \"Stazione Marittima.\" We were met at the port's water taxi landing by cruise staff who efficiently handled our cases.", "Date": "November 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location in Venice - Michele ROCKS!\u201d", "Author": "Gerta01", "ReviewID": "UR10750367", "Content": "We would recommend this hotel to ANYONE and EVERYONE traveling to Venice.

Michele was an excellent host and local resource for us. He recommended two wonderful restaurants which we enjoyed each night of our stay and Antiche Figure had a warm and inviting atmosphere. They are not kidding when they describe the balcony as \"small\" but having the view of the Canal and large windows to enjoy the canal activity and landscape of Venice was an excellent treat. A cautionary word for travelers interested in visiting Murano. One of the things that I really wanted to do while in Venice was a visit to a Murano glass factory. The front desk informed us that we could arrange a private pick up from outside of our hotel and the driver would take us directly to Murano, free of charge. If you are into handsome Italian men, this place is for YOU. Our Italian Stallion ushered us into the factory to watch a SHORT demonstration of glass blowing by a master (who was drinking beer at 10:30am inbetween demonstrations and seeking tips for his 5 minutes of work). Then we were escorted into the show room where a well-dressed 50-something man invited us to look around and choose something that we like without worring about cost. Although we chose a piece to remember our honeymoon trip, it felt a little like lambs to the slaughter. This became extremely evident when it was recommended that instead of returning to Venice right away, we should make our next stop (another free boat ride) Burano where they make lace. We only had 3 days/2 nights in Venice and didn't realize that this excursion would require 4+ hours. Burano is beautiful and we would say that this is worth the time if you have time.

The front rooms are suites and face the canal. Ours was off to the side but we could still see the canal well. Breakfasts were standard fare: cereal, pastries, fruit, hard-boiled eggs, cold cuts, coffee, tea, juice, etc. The staff is very nice and language is not a problem. There is a lounge on the first floor where guests would sometimes gather in the evening for a drink or just conversation. I think a major plus for this area is that it is on high enough ground where there is no flooding during high tide. We could tell who got flooded by where the elevated walkways were placed.

Our booking did not include breakfast but because we had booked through expedia breafast was only 5 Euros instead of the normal 15 Euros. There was ample to eat:- cereals, yoghurts, cheese, ham, boiled eggs etc. Coffee was from a machine but it was fine. The hotel also runs a free water taxi to and from the island of Murano where you can visit the glass factory. Our room did not have a canal view but we were shown rooms that did have this view. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and they spoke excellent English. This is information that I found extremely helpful when arriving in Venice. 1. After picking up your luggage turn left in Airport entrance and buy a 30Euro 3 day pass for the water buses (vaperetto) and the airport bus. This pays for itself after day 1. 2. This info was given to me by another trip advisor member but it was so handy. Take the number 5 bus from the airport to the Piazzale Roma (the main bus station). This takes about 25 minutes, runs every half hour and the 3 day pass covers the fare. Stamp your ticket in the orange box when you get on the bus. When you get off the bus, go straight ahead, down the steps towards the canal. Turn left, cross the bridge, turn left and then cross another bridge. The hotel is now only a short walk away. 3. If you have a short stay ,use a day to visit the islands in the lagoon. The hotel taxi service will take you to Murano, then you can use your 3 day pass to go to Burano. This is a must. A beautiful island which makes lace. The houses are all brightly coloured. Plenty of places to eat. From there a short hop to Torcello where you can see Venices oldest cathedral. Beautiful mosaics.

The staff were very friendly and helpful, and we were always greeted with a smile. When we arrived at the hotel, a member of staff gave us a map, and spent about 10 minutes giving us useful information, such as how to use the local transport, things to do and see, and where to eat. As a result, we were able to make the most of our stay in Venice, and felt very comfortable about asking for information as and when we needed it. The hotel itself was stylishly decorated, clean, warm (the weather was quite cold when we visited Venice, so if you go in October like we did, take jumpers, scarves and gloves, as well as a good coat and sensible shoes!), and there was a good variety of fresh food for breakfast. We were upgraded to a newly refurbished room, with a canopied bed, and an ensuite with a power shower with side jets of water - very sumptuous, and romantic. The room had all the facilities we needed, including a safe, hairdryer and minibar. There were fresh towels , and even sweets on the pillows every day. Attention to detail, with Italian style and hospitality, is what made this hotel a real winner. We had a lovely time, and would certainly recommend it. Tips: Make sure you take mosquito repellant, and those plug-in things, as mosquitos are rife in Venice, and be aware that eating out can be quite expensive. A great restaurant to eat in is the Alla Madonna, on Calle Alla Madonna, close to the Rialto bridge, where the food is amazing - but get there early, as there are often queues to get in. (Opens at 6.45pm) Also, if you are staying for a few days, it is a good idea to buy a local transport ticket, which you can use on the vaporetta around Venice, and the bus service to and from the airport . We were hopping on and off the Vaporetta a lot, and we reckon it saved us a lot of money. (We paid 30 Euros each for a 72 hour ticket, but it paid for itself in the first day.) Also be aware that Venice can flood occasionally, making it difficult to get around. It wasn't too bad while we were there, but we could see that it could get quite tricky in places if there were exceptionally high tides. The locals put up raised wooden walkways when flooding occurs, which partially solve the problem, but could be difficult for some people to climb on to.

Seeing this hotel is located right across the Canal from the train station all you have to look for is yellow signs that say \"FERROVIA\"....in English it means...\"Hey, your hotel is thatta way!\" This is a huge advantage. Plus, your right near a valperreto stop and a gondola hut. Stated many times but worth repeating...customer service. Very attentive, kind, and speak English very well. Overall appearance of the hotel is very nice. Everything is well maintained and very clean. Bad: hate to point these out... The church located right next door is going through a renovation.

It was a fairly easy walk even with 2 large bags and 3 carry on size bags. We had a canal view room on the third floor and it was breathtaking. The view up and down the Grand Canal was all I expected. There is some noise from the boats on the canal but with the windows closed it was not noticeable. The buzz on the Grand Canal was part of the \"Venice experience\", in my opinion. The water taxi is just across the canal and St. Mark's square is an easy 30-45 minute walk. The directions from the front desk are easy to follow and the walk is very worthwhile for the shopping and dining. This area of Venice is less crowded with tourists and has more local flavor than the area around St. Marks. When leaving, we walked back to the bus terminal and took a blue airport bus for 3 euros.

The one big advantage of the Antiche Figure is that you can get there by foot in about three minutes from the station, saving you the need to fight your way onto a vaporetto with bags. The first impression of the room was not good, since we were bowled over by the smell of cigarette smoke when we opened the door. I went down to reception and was told they had no record of a specific request for a non-smoking room (although they knew we were travelling with a young child). Overall, we enjoyed our stay. The breakfasts were very good.The room was air conditioned, comfortable and not too noisy despite facing on to the canal, although you won't be able to sleep in much beyond 7.30 am when the boat traffic really starts up. There are plenty of vaporetto stops outside the station which makes exploring the city very easy. There also is a high-speed internet terminal in reception for clients, which I found useful. The one thing that did bug me was that every time I was in reception and guests came in, I seemed to hear them being told their apartments were ready or that they were being upgraded to a suite at no extra charge.

Cereal, fruit, croissants, eggs, cold meats, pastries, fruit juice - and we finished our breakfast by taking our last cappucino and a slice of fruit pie outside to watch the world go by on the Grand Canal (worth 5 Euros alone!) I have no idea where people would go to get a better value breakfast in Venice The hotel is a vaporetto ride from St Mark's Square, but we found this to be beneficial as the squares and canals behind the hotel were much less crowded and interesting to explore. Great location for the train station or the Piazza Roma where we left our car (just two bridges to negotiate) Staff were excellent and informative, and sitting at one of the tables in the evening drinking Prosecco or Peach Bellinis just people watching is one of the highlights of our honeymoon Absolutely intend to return, but with less baggage!", "Date": "August 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely The Best!\u201d", "Author": "LoveTampa", "ReviewID": "UR8249775", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at this hotel for two nights in mid-July based upon other reviews on Trip Advisor. Once again, we were not let down! This was the greatest hotel we stayed in out of 5 hotels during our trip to Europe. We drove a car to Venice and parked in the first public parking garage that you encounter on the right when coming in on SR 11. From there, it is about a 10 minute walk to the hotel, which is located on the Grand Canal. It was a bit of a haul, trying to pull our luggage across two bridges with stairs only, but well worth not having to catch a crowded water taxi boat. Upon arrival, the front desk staff ladies were extremely friendly and we were upgraded free of charge to their newly completed suite, located in a rear building back from the Grand Canal. The suite was beautiful, sparkling clean and had a great massage shower with several shower heads that shoot water out at you from the side of the shower. Video cameras at the entrance to the suite building and within the stair wells provide a sense of security and allow the staff to see who they let into the building after you push a button on a keypad. The bed was the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in!! All of the staff went out of their way to accomodate us and were by far the best we encountered during our three week stay in Europe. One morning we missed breakfast by 45 minutes and the desk clerk personally served us cappucino's, croissants, and other pastries while we sat outside at a table people watching. For the best dining experience, don't eat around St. Mark's Square. Get off the tourist travelled paths and dine with the locals. Try Ristorante Bai Barbacani located at Calle del Paradiso, 5756 (telephone 041.521.02.34), north of St. Marks. We were walking along a canal when we saw a couple dining in an open window/terrace overlooking the canal. We walked in and were able to sit in the window as the guests were just leaving. The staff were extremely friendly and we had the most romantic, candlelight dinner of our entire trip! For an authentic Venetian hand crafted mask, visit La Bottega Dei Mascareri, located at the foot of the Rialto Bridge. Sergio and Massimo Boldrin are considered some of the best mask makers in Venice and made the masks used in the movie \"Eyes Wide Shut\". Again, Hotel Antiche Figure was absolutely fantastic and we will definitely stay here again if we ever return. One last comment. Many people told us to prior to our trip that Italians are rude to Americans. We did not encounter a single rude person in Italy (Verona, Florence and Venice), and in fact, our first encounter with a rude individual was upon our return to the US! If only American hotel staff could be as friendly as those we met in Italy!!", "Date": "July 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "topeka, kansas", "Title": "\u201cDelightful\u201d", "Author": "tandum", "ReviewID": "UR8243134", "Content": "We had a king bed on the top floor facing the Grand Canal.

Plus, Venice is so small we had fun just walking to places like St. Mark's, being that it would only take about 20-25 minutes to walk there (And who doesn't love walking through Venetian cobblestone streets!) The hotel was a 5 minute walk to both the ATV (water bus) and to Piazzale Roma, which is where we had to pick up the shuttle to the cruise we were taking from Venice. To get to the airport you can either, very easily, take the ATV to the airport or pick up an actual taxi (driven) from Piazzale Roma, which is connected by bridge to the mainland. Another benefit was the hotel was right next to one of the only three bridges that crosses the Grand Canal, so we didn't have to walk far to get to the other side. The only downside to the hotel was the 5 euro breakfast. It served cold lunchmeat, cereal and fruit, not enough to fill our bellies before walking around for 10 hours.

The hotel is lovely downstairs. There is a small lobby and a bar area. The breakfast room is also on this floor and is very nice and quite adequate for all of the guests. But the best seats are outside at one of the many tables right on the canal. It was a lot of fun to sit and watch Venice go by!

We slept with the window open and could hear the water at night and in the morning. After 10pm, it was very quiet outside except for an occasional boat.

I chose the Antiche Figure after browsing TA for a reasonably priced (by summer Venice standards!) hotel that sounded like a good match for myself, wife and 11 year old daughter. The high rankings of the Antiche Figure made me book a room. Venice was the last stop on our Italy vacation and by the time we arrived we were dragging a bit - the proximity to the train station (where we arrived) was a BIG plus, as was the warm welcome of the front desk staff. (It should be noted, however, that even though the hotel is a short bridge crossing from the train station, the bridge has no ramps - you'll have to 'lug' your luggage up and down stairs. No slight on the hotel, of course, but older travelers may want to know this). As stated the front desk staff was friendly and professional througout our stay - they took the time to welcome us each time we entered, and spent a long time orienting us to Venice when we first arrived. The room we received was the smallest of the four we stayed at in Italy, and looked out on an alley rather than the Grand Canal. Although I'd asked and hoped for a front-facing room I was told (or interpreted from the web site?) that if you have more than 2 persons the rooms don't face the front (don't take this as absolute - I *think* this is the case). Our alley-facing room was not a surprise, but I would have preferred and paid for a front-facing room if it had been available. It was clear that the room we got, with a 'matrimonial bed' (two twins pushed together) and another twin for our daughter, was originally designed for just the matrimonial bed. The large bed was pushed out of alignment with the headboard (attached to the wall), and one side bedstand had been turned sideways so they could stuff the extra twin in. This made the drawers on the bedstand useless (they were blocked) and the extra twin blocked what would have been the desk area. Not a great setup but we didn't let it spoil our stay (perhaps we should have complained?). As long as we coordinated our movements through the room all was OK. The hotel is far from St. Marks, but as Venice is small and I enjoy the vaporettos anyway this wasn't really a negative - could have been a plus due to the relative quiet. On the other hand the hotel is very close to the train station (as noted), a major water taxi stand, and the Roma (?) parking lot/bus stand which we used for transportation to the airport. The hotel breakfast was standard Italian and was offered both inside and out on the patio - a nice touch. My wife and I found food we liked but they could probably provide a few different items for children (pre-sweetened cereal, for instance). A free computer with Internet access is available across from the front desk - though with just 1 computer we could have had problems waiting we didn't have this happen during our brief checks of email. I would recommend this hotel to others who like its convenience, and would suggest that time is taken to clarify just what kind of room you receive in advance, so as to assuage any disappointment.", "Date": "June 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cAN ITALIAN DREAM\u201d", "Author": "NewlandsLondon", "ReviewID": "UR7973523", "Content": "We stayed at this excellent hotel for a week and found the facilities excellent.

We had a side room (314) which was a bit small, but beautifully appointed with fabric walls, murano glass chandelier and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in on holiday. The bathroom was beautiful and the towels were changed daily. I would say not having a room overlooking the canal was an advantage because the traffic on the canal can be noisy and is ceaseless - think of the M25! The staff are wonderfully friendly and helpful but not intrusive - spending time with you on arrival advising you of places to go and where to eat and will book tickets for concerts or the doges palace for you. Take advantage of this as we never got to the basilica because of the queues. Don't go to Venice expecting to be wowed by the cuisine. We found the restaurants to be plentiful, but mostly offering the same dishes and at very expensive prices. Expect to pay around 50 euros for a 2 course meal for 2 with house wine, but service charges are added usually at around 12% so there's no need to tip. Go over the Scalzi bridge outside the hotel to the Cannaregio district in the evening for a stroll. The area is lively and bright with glass shops and street artists. You can walk all the way to the Rialto bridge along a main street with wonderful shopping opportunities and views around every corner. We found the prices and variety here for glass and jewellery to be the best in Venice but don't be afraid to keep looking until you find what you really want as no two shops are quite the same. Murano is very pretty and very clean. There's an abundance of glass shops and we found the staff to be friendly and happy to let you look so don't be pressured into buying anything you don't want.

I was also a little concerned whether the view of the railway station might not exactly be the best in town, but I needn't have worried. The Grand Canal is something else, a liquid main street, and the hustle and bustle on the water and beside it is so engaging. Our hotel room was on the top floor at the front, overlooking the Grand Canal. It was beautifully decorated, very comfortable and, with the windows closed, completely peaceful. The bathroom was excellent. We received a lovely welcome from Francesca at reception who gave us lots of information about exploring the city.

They were booked for us by the hotel and the staff at the restaurants welcomed us and looked after us very well.

A couple of tips - take the bus from the airport to Piazzale Roma. The hotel is just 5 minutes walk from there. It is quick and cheap. Take a gondola ride, but book it yourself with the gondoliers outside the hotel, it is cheaper than the hotel arranging it. We did a night ride and I would thoroughly recommend doing it then, you see the city in a different light (excuse the pun). Take the free water taxi from the hotel to Murano (paid by the glass factory). The water taxi is a great ride but expensive if you have to pay it yourself. You just have to make your excuses at the factory for not buying their glass (phenomenally expensive, like thousands of Euros for a single piece) - but that was part of the fun!

The first trip, we relyed on Hotels.com to help us find a good hotel, and we were so pleased with this wonderful, little hotel. First of all, it has a fantastic location. Our first trip, we came in from Marco Polo Airport, via the bus, which dropped us off at Piazelle Roma, which is a transportation hub. We hopped a vaporetto (water bus) to find our hotel, and there it was, on the right side in full view! We got off at the first stop, Ferrovia,and walked across the bridge to the hotel. We couldn't believe that it was that convenient. It is also across the Grand Canal from the train station, which also came in handy for both of our trips to and from other cities. Remember that Venice is unlike other cities where one can hail a cab and be dropped right in front of your hotel. Their location is fantastic! As we walked trhrough the front door, we were greeted warmly by Alessandro, the hotel manager, who was very helpful in orienting us to the city of Venice, as well. During our three day stay, we were always treated like a member of the family by this warm and friendly staff. They all spoke English, too. The rooms are very pretty and comfortable. It is my understanding that the Grand Canal side rooms are larger, and that was where we stayed both visits. The bathrooms are very nice, too, with a bathtub and shower and a nice sized vanity. As I said earlier, we just returned from our second trip to Venice and a big reason for returning was the Antiche Figure. We have sent friends to stay there, as well, and I highly recommend this hotel. As a final note, I celebrated my birthday there last week and planned on a gondola ride, which Gianni, at the front desk, arranged for us. He escorted us to the gondola (again, right out in front of the hotel) and then quickly went back in to their bar and returned with an ice bucket and my favorite white wine, courtesy of the hotel!

We booked a canal view room (Room 111). It was a fairly large room with a view of the Grand Canal. It was clean & nicely decorated. The room looked just like it shows on the website. The bed we had was 2 twin beds pushed together (very normal in Europe) however the beds were not quite an equal height. The side closest to the door way was slightly lower and a bit worn. In fact the foot of the bed had a rather big indentation. I wanted to mention this to the hotel but my husband wouldn't let me (it was his side of the bed). I was just a little disappointed considering we paid 239 euros for the first night & 299 euros for each of the next two nights. I want to clarify that the hotel is nice but I didn't see why the reviews are as incredible as they are. I must give props to the staff.

Getting lost is a real treat in Venice, even at night. Also, being on the Grande Canal opposite the Ferrovia boat stop means there are no fewer than nine different boat routes that will take you back to the hotel (in fact every boat on the Grande Hotel stops opposite the hotel). This means you can enjoy the boat trip from St Marks Square to the hotel late at night, when Venice seems so much more peaceful. You wouldn't do this if you stayed in an expensive hotel near St Marks. You can also catch a boat direct to Murano from opposite the hotel. The hotel staff are very helpful, and can book almost any ticket for evening concerts (at no extra charge) as well as recommend excellent restaurants (usually those recommended by other visitors).

First impressions were that it was just adequate. It was easy to get to from piazza roma where bus depot is.

My room was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac239(\u00e2\u201a\u00ac60 extra for canal view) a night plus basic breakfast. The hotel will probably dissagree but in my opinion it was basic. Now I have been in a lot of cities around europe and most hotels I have stayed in are of a much better quality for a more reasonable price. The noise levels throughout the night were overbearing, banging doors, drunken people on street, bin men empting bins etc.We asked for a restaurant recommendation and were sent down alleyways with open sewers(because of road works) and came to this dark empty restaurant beside roadworks. It was about as inviting as a morgue. We were disgusted with the restaurant recommendation by the hotel. Now this hotel is not I repeat not near St.Marks Square. Between walking to, waiting, travelling on water bus it takes about 45 mins. The hotels around St Marks Sq are a lot better value for money. They are near all the good restaurants, shops, attractions. Now I am not too particular but the restaurants around Hotel Antiche Figure are awful. Dirty, cheap furnishings, all obscure menus, ignorant staff. If you want to have a good a time as possible in Venice, stay near St.Marks Square not at Antiche Figure. Also when we were leaving we were asked was everything okay during our stay, we mentioned the noise and were told if we said something we could have swapped to another room.First of all hotel was fully booked(according to night porter) so how could we have, secondly why was a room with such bad soundproofing being rented by hotel, it should be worked on.

This was our second stay here, our first in the summer last year and most recently at the beginning of February with our parents. Both experiences were of the highest standard - where do I start? The hotel was so simple to find and incredibly convenient. It's directly opposite the train station (a very nice train station - not unsightly at all!) and just 5 minutes walk and a couple of small bridges away from the Piazzale Roma (the main bus station, connecting you to the mainland and airport). Right from the moment we arrived (we were early both times) we were greeted by Gianni who was very friendly and couldn't help us enough. We were shown immediately to our rooms. We paid extra for the canal view which I believe was definitely worth it. Room 412 on the top floor was particularly lovely. The rooms are clean and beautifully furnished in typical Venetian decor. Comfy beds, gorgeous bathroom, mini-bar, tv, hairdryer etc. Cleaned every day including little chocolates left on our pillows. Only TINY gripe was the lack of tea/coffee making facilities in the room. Having said that, you're in Venice where there are more cafes than you could shake a stick at. There's only so much caffeine one can drink! I presume that the rooms over looking the very tiny side streets are just as beautiful - it depends whether or not a room with a view is important to you. If you didn't have a great view, no matter as there's a lovely little terrace downstairs from which to sip a coffee or a glass of prosecco and watch the world go by. Breakfast was a basic continental spread (cereals, yoghurt, juice, pastries, cheese, ham, eggs, bread rolls and tea/coffee) but there was plenty of it and it was fine for setting you up for a big day of sightseeing. We were recommended a fantastic restaurant around the corner (Osteria Veccio Pozzo) which apart from the incredible fish does the BEST steak ever (surprising for a small island!). Gianni also booked for us to see a wonderful concert in a palazzo 'La Traviata - Verdi' where we moved to a different room for each of the 3 acts. Alessandro (the manager) and Elena were both really helpful and couldn't do enough to make our stay more welcome. The rest of the staff were the same (sorry, don't know names!) This really was what made this place so special. We've stayed in some amazing hotels in our time and most would need to take lessons from Alessandro and the rest of the staff! We felt welcomed and comfortable and as if nothing was too much trouble. Our parents LOVED Venice and it was made that bit more special by having such a fabulous hotel from which to be based. We never return to the same hotel as we love to visit new places but we have made an exception in this case. We're very much looking forward to staying in the new suites (which are part of the hotel) and are currently under construction - ready in April 2007 I think.

My sister and I accompanied my mother on her first trip to Venice, to celebrate her 80th birthday. Mum is fit but has two artificial hips and finds steps difficult.

The hotel is a five minute walk from the Piazzale Roma where the airport buses terminate, and even less from the railway station. It is very easy to find, as it looks over the canal opposite the station. It is almost at one end of the Grand Canal, so you can hop on a vaporetto and travel the length of the canal in one journey. At the same time it is not so far on foot to Rialto, with its shops and restaurants. The hotel itself is run to the highest standards. It is clean, comfortable, tastefully and appropriately decorated. We had a triple room, and whilst not large, it was adequate. The bathroom was beautiful (though I would agree with a previous reviewer that a shower screen would be an improvement). The linen was spotless, snowy and luxurious and was changed daily. The staff were all helpful and friendly and ready to help with restaurant suggestions, and other enquiries. The breakfast was varied and plentiful. The amenities it offers may warrant a 3 star grading, but their quality is well in excess of that. At the price we paid, it was amazing value. It is hard to fault the hotel.

The room was superb with a huge bed - could have done with coffee/tea making facilities in room and our room (111) being directly above the bar/reception meant a little noise and smokey smell, which was odd because the hotel was non smoking I believe?

Would also recommend Ignazia restaurant (the one the hotel recommends) for great traditional service, La Patatina for reasonably priced pasta, the Jazz bar for a late drink and San Lucia snack bar over the Scalza bridge for a decent priced drink (Guinness 5 euros, Peroni 3 euros) and a warm welcome, also small Italian snack bar directly in front of you as you go over the Scalzi for coffee and marmalade brioches for breakfast but not Harry's Bar, I know every one says you just have to have a Bellini, but it's a total rip off and as cocktail bars go it's pretty basic and grossly overrated - 32 euros for 2 Bellini's - they're having a laugh.

The hotel is in a very good location, on the Grand Canal, right opposite the Railway Station and Vaparetto stop and just a short walk from the Airport Bus Terminal in Piazzale Roma, although if you're not fit, you should be aware that there are two small bridges to cross, which is tricky with heavy luggage. When we arrived we were given a very warm welcome by Gianni and he explained about the hotel and gave us maps with the phone number of the hotel in case we got hopelessly lost during our stay and needed rescuing. My friend and I both had double rooms for single use, at an excellent 'Winter Special' rate of 72 euros a night, including breakfast. We chose superior rooms as we didn't want to pay more for canal view deluxe rooms but we were very pleased with what we got. They were beautifully furnished, spotlessly clean and the large beds were comfortable. There was plenty of wardrobe space, an electronic safe big enough to accommodate my laptop, a suitcase rack and a minibar/fridge. The TV had CNN and BBC World in English. The marble bathrooms were lovely with full baths and efficient showers. Breakfast was the usual continental buffet and was served in two pretty rooms at the back of the hotel. Each morning we were warmly greeted by a lovely smiling lady who made sure there was ample food for everyone. The bar is adjacent to the front desk and there are also tables and chairs outside where you can sit and watch the world go by on the Grand Canal. It's also handy for smokers since Italy implemented a smoking ban. There is a free Internet terminal in the lobby for guests' use and free broadband Internet is also available in the rooms if you have your own laptop. The hotel is totally delightful but what makes it so special is the staff - Alessandro (the Manager), Francesca and Gianni on the front desk, the lovely men who served us in the bar in the evenings and the friendly lady who cleaned our rooms. Nothing was too much trouble and they offered extra touches that make you feel like a truly valued guest. For instance, I didn't have the correct cable for my laptop so Alessandro lent me one for the duration of my stay; when it was raining, we were offered hotel umbrellas without asking; it was pouring when we left but Alessandro came out with us, right to the water taxi and helped us on board with our luggage.

It was also useful having a minibar fridge in the room to store small food items. Our room had a safe for any valuables. The location of the hotel is superb if you are travelling into Venice by bus. It is literally a 5 minute walk from the main bus terminal at Piazalle Roma. With its location directly opposite the Rail terminal (Ferrovia), it is easy to find after your days sightseeing. The vaporetto (water bus) is less than 5 minutes walk from the hotel and will take you to Rialto and St Marco in less than 20 and 40 minutes respectively. Its really easy to walk around Venice as it is very flat, so we appreciated Francesca's advice to only buy a vaporetto ticket for one day for 12 Euros.

Neither my wife nor I are handicapped, but I sure felt immobile after dragging 5 luggage bags up and over the stairs. In Venice, you apparently have to have a license to transport luggage or goods over a certain distance. Our options were to take the water Taxi across the 10 yards (I could literately throw a rock at the hotel) of water to the other side for 35 Euros or drag the luggage over the bridge. As you can tell I am still happy about it. The hotel has a small bar and breakfast area on the first floor with a public computer. Our room was on the second floor over looking the Canal. The view is great, but I would recommend a room at the back of the hotel because of the noise from the boats. The room was clean and adequate. It had a tub/shower and large sink. The lighting is poor for women, but it was clean and covered is nice grey marble. The bed was firm, but comfortable. The hotel has free DSL internet and local TV.

The best thing about this hotel is the location. When people say it is across from the train station next to the green dome, they mean directly across the grand canal from the train station. I forgot my watch and looked out the window at the train station clock for the time. When leaving by train, just walk across the bridge, no hassle worrying about being late for the train. If getting in by bus it is a block or two walk so if your luggage has wheels, no problem. I went to the right instead of straight and to the left where the bus dropped us off and went to the side canal which is pretty big and thought it was the grand canal. Just asked where the train station was and got pointed in the right direction. If staying for a long time, there are better hotels in quieter areas on side canals. There are no real balconies where you can hang out and watch the grand canal and the windows are just a little too high to get a good view. Breakfast is plain, don't think of it as a big meal.. just enough to get you to lunch. The staff is very nice. They will only recommend two restaurants and the one in back which is accessed on the alley is cheaper and I thought it was better than the more expensive one by the first bridge which is a step up in class but harder to find. They were just puttin up their website and it wasn't in English yet but should be ready by now. If you book directly with them they will give you a better deal if you upgrade your room. The room they booked for us was too small and we upgraded to a bigger room with a canal view. If anyone makes a suggestion they try and implement it. Someone wanted internet access so they put a laptop by the front desk you can use free of charge to access your email. There are better hotels, but if you only have a few days, the location and clealiness make this a solid choice. It takes you a day to figure out the vaporeto schedule, but they start the line a block away by the bus stop so walk down there and you always get a good seat, often in the front or back rather than inside. Avoid the #1, take the #86 whenever possible and don't worry, almost every one stops at the train station to get back if you don't want to walk. As you are at the far end of town, it makes you get out and travel. We walked from here to St. Marks but only one way and takes awile. Get off at the Rialto bridge which is the most crowded stop and walk to St. Marks. Safe at night so we went there every day and night and usually got back midnight to 1am and the desk clerk didn't mind.

Only took 15 minutes in total. Ten of us arrived at the hotel at 9.30am, eight were staying and the other couple we travelling from Venice to Rome by train at 1pm. On our arrival Alessandro was marvellous he allowed our other friends to leave their luggage until they left on the train and that allowed them to explore Venice for a few hours. From the moment we walked in Alessandro was only too pleased to assist us with maps and information on Venice. We stayed two nights (not enough) and that afternoon we bought a 24 hour Vaporetta ticket from across the Canal, good value. Only takes 10 minutes to get to St Mark's Square and it is an exciting way to travel around Venice, especially when you do not have much time. We also used the ticket to go over to the island of Lido, what a pretty place, it even has cars and buses. Before our arrival at the Antiche Figure I emailed them and asked if they could book the Secret Itinerary of Doge's Palace which they did so without any bother. Francesca emailed me a booking number and all we had to do was arrive there and go to the Information desk and get out tickets. This tour takes you to parts of Doge's Palace that the general tours do not take you. Well worth it. Two of us had canal view rooms, and the other two couples had the other rooms. All four rooms we great. My room was 411 and every morning I would stand at the window and look at all the traffic and goings on on the grand canal, loved it.

The staff were terrific and on arrival organised a trip to the Murano Island to see glassworks. Also a gondola ride which we took in the evening - a tad expensive but worth it (E90). Very romantic and lovely to see the canals at night. The hotel also recommended some excellent restaurants. This hotel was easily the best hotel we stayed in during our European trip.

We chose this classy small hotel based on the glowing reviews we'd read on trip advisor. The hotel lived up to our expectations because it truly is a charming little hotel (more like a B&B), dramatically located on the Grand Canal - offering breathtaking views of the Grand Canal. Our family had two rooms (#412 and #211). Both were beautifully furnished with stylish fabrics and were very spacious as far as European rooms go. They each overlooked the Grand Canal and had elegant bathrooms. The television sets are tiny (they should consider adding 25\" tv's), however, we weren't there to watch tv. The tv's carried CNN News and BBC (really the only two English speaking channels available to us). The best thing about the hotel - other than its favorable canal front setting - is their personable front office staff. Elena, Franchesca and Alessandro were top notch! They were friendly, informative and helpful. Franchesca recommended a nice little restaurant to us which was located only a couple of minute stroll from the hotel (the \"Ostaria al Vecio Pozzo\"). Its nothing fancy, as its located in a small alley way, however, the food was very good and reasonably priced. One of the things we learned while dining at restaurants around the Mediterranean during our cruise is that you should expect to pay a \"cover charge\" to eat in the restaurant. Most of the cover charges ranged from 2 to 3 euros per person (that's right, it typically costed us $2.50 to $3.50 per person just to sit down in the restaurant - a ridiculous fee, but one that seemed to be standard wherever we ate). Plus, you could expect to pay a \"service charge\" of 10 to 13 percent (which we were consistently told was to pay for the restaurant \"ambiance\" and the rolls they brought us when we sat down). THEN, you are expected to leave a tip for the waitstaff! Europeans should never complain about eating in U.S. restaurants because they won't be hit with these same types of fees! The Antiche Figure has a small breakfast room where a complimentary continental breakfast is served (traditional european style continental breakfast with hams, cheeses, cereals, croissants, rolls, juices, coffee, teas, etc). Nice, but nothing fancy. Elena was very helpful in arranging a water taxi for us to go to the airport in the morning. Let me point out a few things which will be helpful to you in terms of the best ways to get around Venice from this hotel...As you know, probably the best way to explore Venice is by foot! The hotel is a 15 minute leisurely walk from the Rialto Bridge (a very overrated sightseeing attraction!). The Rialto Bridge is a 15 minute walk from San Marco Square (the major tourist attraction in Venice which was always mobbed with tourists). We had fun feeding the pigeons there and shopping in the seemingly endless glass boutiques! As previous reviews have mentioned, it is VERY EASY to find your way back through the maze of small side streets, because you simply follow the signs for \"Ferrazzi\" (not sure on the spelling of it) - which means \"train station\". The train station is located directly across the canal from the hotel, however, you really don't hear any noise from there other than the occasional street singers/musicians who perform at the base of the steps. Franchesca advised us to take Water Taxi #1 (located only a two minute walk from the front of the hotel) in order to have a nice cruise down the Grand Canal. The water taxi ride was 5 euros per person and enabled us to go down the entire Grand Canal (we got off at San Marco Square and walked back). She also recommended that we use the services of the gondoliers located outside the front entrance of the hotel, since we wanted to experience one of Venice's famous gondola rides. The 40 minute gondola ride we opted to take cost us 100 euros (which seemed on par with what two other gondoliers near San Marco Plaza had quoted me). The gondola ride was very fun and definitely worth taking in order to experience Venice's small canals! Plus, if you take the gondola ride from the guys located in front of the hotel, you know you'll get your money's worth! The most economical way to get to Marco Polo Airport is via bus (the bus fare is only 3 euros per person from the bus terminal to the airport). The bus depot is only a five minute walk from the hotel - however, if you are dragging/carrying luggage, be advised that you have to cross two small bridges. Our family opted for the much pricier private water taxi ride (which cost us 120 euros in total) only because of the convenience of it. The water taxi picked us up right outside the hotel entrance and only took 25 minutes to get to the airport! We had lots of luggage, so it made sense to take the water taxi (despite the much higher cost). Allesandro was very helpful getting us settled into the water taxi in the morning. If you are travelling alone or with one or two other people, I would strongly advise just taking the bus. Also, please be aware that once you get to the airport via water taxi, you still have to walk about four minutes from the dock area to the airport terminal. It's a very ease walk though. When our water taxi pulled in, we were asked if we wanted help taking our luggage over to the airport. Be aware that the porters/luggage handlers were looking to charge us 4 1/2 euros per bag for this service. We quickly decided to haul our own luggage instead (the airport has small luggage carts that you can use at no extra charge). We enjoyed our stay in Venice very much. It's such a quaint little city and truly unique with its endless canal system. Like nothing you'll ever see anywhere else in the world! We all said that we'd definitely return to stay at the Antiche Figure hotel when we return to Venice. If you are looking for a hotel with more amenities (like fitness equipment, a dinner restaurant, etc), you are probably better off staying at a bigger property. However, the Antiche Figure is a great value because of its high level of personal service and great canal location (even if it is a 30 minute walk from the main tourist area of San Marco).", "Date": "September 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oakland, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place To Stay In Venice\u201d", "Author": "Porsche_Guy", "ReviewID": "UR5727000", "Content": "In early June we spent several nights at the Hotel Antiche Figure.

I don't think you could find a lovelier hotel with rooms facing the Grand Canal even if you were to spend mega dollars. The fact that you look across at the unattractive train station is mediated by having a room that faces the Grand Canal and seeing all the action that takes place on the Canal. The airconditioning is excellent. The major downside is that there is no internet available in the hotel and the internet cafe has unbearably slow processing which really means no internet while you are in Venice. We just returned from staying there 7 nights and were delighted to be there. All of the staff is delightful.

But if you want a charming boutique style hotel with clean comfortable accomodations, the charm of Venice, Murano glass fixtures, a great location to explore Venice from and incredibly friendly customer service (with excellant English) then the Antiche Figure is for you ! I need to start by telling you about booking our rooms. I read all the reviews in TA before emailing Antiche Figure - all the reviews that raved about this hotel were right. Customer service began with the emails we exchanged. I was booking rooms for 10 people and was trying to make everyone happy, Antiche Figure did. Not only did Alessandro answer all my questions about the hotel and its' accommodations, but he answered lots of questions about Venice. He could not have been any more helpful! Also check out their website for lots of pictures and their email address. My family stayed here in the middle of July after a cruise ending in Venice. We had 4 rooms, (3 doubles and one quad). They were all nicely decorated, with comfortable beds (they even have kings), very clean, with working air conditioning, nice bathrooms and a fridge ( it was stocked, but we were told we could move stuff to make room for our water bottles). The hotel is wonderful, in a wonderful location, especially if you want to get away from the noise and tourists around San Marco. There is even a lovely patio with tables in front of the hotel where you can sit and enjoy the gondolas etc. on the Grand Canal. It is a 5 min. walk from Piazzale Roma ( we had a lot of luggage, but were able to to get over the two walking bridges with a little extra effort - it is still easier to walk to the Antiche Figure than to get to most hotels in Venice. You can also leave your luggage at the P. Roma where there is a boat that will deliver it to the hotel for several Euros a bag - but the walk was not too bad. The hotel is also across the canal from the train station. It is also near a waterbus stop We went to the hotel to check it out on our first day in Venice ( we had one night on ship and then disembarked the next morning). Alessandro helped us with maps, directions, suggestions about where to go and where to get lunch - and we weren't even checking in until the next day. We arrived the next morning around 8:30 AM (the ships gets you off early) with at least 24 bags, since it was still early and the rooms were not ready, Alessandro helped us stack all our bags next to the desk in the lobby, this is a small hotel with a small lobby so we took up a lot of space. He arranged a free taxi to take us to a glass factory in Murano. The factory and showroom were great and not high pressure, but I decided to keep looking at other shops, so I passed on purchasing a bowl that I liked, since I thought we might see something similar for less money elsewhere. We shopped some more in Murano, then took a waterbus back. I had not found anything I liked better and regretted not buying it and told Francesca about it at the front desk, she offered to get another water taxi to take me back to the glass factory, but since it was late, I did not want to do that, she called the factory for me, found out which salesman had helped me, I talked to him and with some faxing back and forth, I was able to order my murano glass and have it shipped to the USA. ( he had quoted me a price before we left that morning - he remembered the bowl as \"the one he was trying to give to me....\") this was another example of how helpful and nice they are at AF! When we returned, all our bags were in the right rooms - a real feat, since most ot them had the same last name. That evening we were able to walk from AF to the Ponte Vecchio in about 15 - 20 mins. with lots of shopping and browsing on the way. To get to San Marco, you can waterbus or walk it in about 30 mins. Walking in Venice is a must! Lots of interesting little streets, but signs on the corner of building to point you in the right direction. The breakfast is served in two small rooms and was a nice little buffet with enough choices to fill you up. Everything was fresh and nicely displayed. Overall we could not have picked a better place to end our cruise of the Mediterranean and we will go back!

The flight goes into Treviso Airport, so you have a 5 Euro, 45 minute bus ride to the Piazza Roma in Venice. As noted in other reviews, the Antiche Figure is a quick 5 minute walk from the bus station, although I will note that you do have to carry your bags over two bridges. Our room was not yet ready, but reception was very accomidating and took care of our bags and gave us maps and hints to start our exploration of the area. When we returned mid afternoon, our room was ready, on the top floor in the corner, so we had three windows overlooking the Grande Canal. No balcony, but the view was really neat. The room was very, very nice. One quirky thing I had never seen before was a key card slot near the door to operate the lights in the room. They had not told us about that at check in, and we could not at first figure out why the light in the room did not work. Then I saw the key slot on the wall by the door, inserted my room key and all the lights came on. We had planned to get a waterbus pass for our time in Venice, but after that first day we realized with a good map, knowing your primary end destination (i.e. San Marco) and willing to make a few wrong turns, you can travel the city pretty well on foot, so we skipped the water bus passes. Venice streets were very crowed, but it appeared that so were the water busses. I did not give this hotel an excellent rating, as my wife and I agreed that the breakfast, which was included, was only so so. The juice was only red juice, the coffee came from a push button machine and was not very good, and the food selection was pretty bland. Breakfast did not compare favorably at all to the other places we stayed in Italy during out trip. We took a gondola ride from one of the boats right in front of the hotel. We went about 5 o'clock and they were not particularly busy. It was 80 euro for 40 minutes or 120 euros for an hour. He showed us on a map what the difference was, and we did the hour. Even though they start in the Grande Canal, you soon get off the busy routes and into the smaller, more intimate canals. Our gondalier was pleasant, informative and made our ride very memorable. I had read horror stories about grouchy operators, but when we noticed the lines of people waiting near St Marks for rides, it was no wonder. Our operator said that he knows that he could make more money if he took over his father's permit at St. Marks, but he prefers to take life a little slower. RyanAir- By taking a 7 a.m. flight to Venice we were at our hotel by 9:30 a.m. vs. a 6 hour drive in the car. For others in the U.S., RyanAir is like Southwest without the frills(?). They are full size jets, but fly from regional airports. You take a bus from the terminal to your jet on the tarmac.

The view was ok but not as good as the pictures from another visitor on here. We looked directly over the train station but could see down the canal if we leant out the window, not something you do all the time though and the train station isn't really picturesque. The location was ideal for when you arrive and leave Venice as its so close to the bus and train station but when you're out and about it is really at the opposite end of where the action is, however, the water bus stop is right opposite so it's not a big deal and it's quite nice to travel up and down the canal on the bus.

The view didn't spoil it too much for us as the room was so beautifully decorated and comfortable. We stayed 7 nights here and we found the location to be perfect. Ideal for getting on a train to Verona or Padova, walking to the Piazzale Roma for the bus station, or hopping on the Vaporetta. It was also lovely to sit out in the morning for breakfast and in the evening with a drink, just watching the gondoliers at work. (The only down side to this was that musicians would often serenade you, even if you did not want them to and would then ask for money for the song.) All the staff were very friendly and helpful, especially the breakfast staff, who always greeted you with a warm smile every morning. On the first day, we mentioned to Alessandro that our TV set wasn't working. It was quite late, but he apologised profusely and promised to have it fixed the next day - which it was. There is also a broadband connection in the rooms if you have your laptop with you, you just need to ask the desk staff to set it up for you.

A lot of hotels claim to be on the canal, which they are, but not the Grand Canal, so be careful. The Hotel Antiche Figure provides an excellent continental spread at breakfast time and although they do not provide evening meals this is not a problem as there are plenty of excellent restaurants close by, but be sure to ask the staff which they recommend, and be sure to follow their advice.", "Date": "July 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel with exemplary staff\u201d", "Author": "jamezyjamez", "ReviewID": "UR5411929", "Content": "Selected based on reviews posted here.

The hotel itself is small but spotlessly clean with very hard working staff who make you feel very welcome. We met Alessandro the manager and Francesa who gave us lots of advice to make our trip enjoyable. We had an excellant room (211) with a large double and a single bed, large marble bathroom and small balcony. We really enjoyed watching the world go by from the balcony - either standing on it or sitting in our room at the open balcony door with our feet up after a hard days sight seeing. The mini bar prices for water (2 euro) beer (4 euro) were about 80 cents higher than in shops but a cold beer in the comfort of your own room was worth it. We saw other hotels that we had been tempted to book but were very relieved that we hadn't as none of them had a prime spot on the grand canal like the AF, so our advice is to look no further than this hotel. It's location by the bus / train stations is ideal and despite being on the canal side once the shutters were closed at night there was no noise preventing a good nights sleep - especially after a lovely hot chocolate in the bar. We booked direct through the hotel's web site having checked tripadvisor reviews and exchanged friendly emails with Gianni before our visit. Breakfast was very good and at busy times guests sat in the bar area or outside to eat and the staff worked very hard to keep up with demand (and always with a smile). Our favourite restaurant was Marciana, in Calle Lunga Chioverette. Turn right out of the hotel walk to the Scalzi bridge; do not cross the bridge but turn right again at the bridge and it is the second restaurant on the right. The waiter Leon was very friendly and amusing and I had a complimentary cocktail for my birthday. Top tips. When arriving at the airport, do not stand in a long queue / line at the window marked public transport, but walk past to the tourist information desk where without waiting we bought bus tickets to Venice (the No 5 at 2 euros) and a three day vaporetto pass that will take you anywhere on the water as often as you like. Gondolas extra (but you have to do it!!). Outside hotel the price was 80 euros. Forget Murano and the Lido!!! DO visit Burano with it's pretty painted houses. DO book the secret tour of the Doges Palace through the hotel. You will miss very long queues and actually see far more of the palace! Wandering around Venice can be a challenge, but DO try it. Many Calles end in a canal with no bridge or a dead end. You will make friends with other lost souls. Just follow the signs to 'Ferrovia' and you WILL be fine.

The gentleman who checked us in was so helpful and gave us loads of info on the immediate area. We had booked the famous blue room with balcony and it was a joy to behold.

The breakfast was the usual continental style, but the young lady who ran the breakfast room was so kind and gave a warm and individual welcome every morning. She ran the place like clockwork and was so efficient and we began to think could this place get any better. It did. Unfortunately my wife was ill for a day or two during our stay, but the staff arranged for a doctor to visit her at the hotel. We obviously had to pay for this ourselves, but it was the kind and understanding way in which the staff assisted us which I will never forget.

A short two minute walk over Scalzi bridge and you're at the St Lucia Train Station.

There are many fine restaurants (and an Irish bar) within a few footsteps of the hotel. I would recommend Gino's on the Rio Terra Lista di Spagna. They do a marvellous Pizza Calzone.

Location - excellent as it is a 5 min walk from coach station at Piazzale Roma, opposite the train station, adjacent to the Ponte d Scalzi Bridge (one of the three bridges to cross the Grand Canal) and opposite the Ferrovia waterbus stop. Hotel - extremely well maintained, spotlessly clean, excellent decor and furnishings throughout. We arrived on an early flight, and as a room had already been cleaned, it was made available to us early so we were able to settle in, freshen up and go straight into Venice. We had a red room to the rear on the 4th floor, which had a lovely view of the Grand Canal. Staff - they were all extremely welcoming, polite and helpful. The hotel receptionist booked the Ducale Palace secret tour for us (which is well worth visiting). Breakfast - this is provided in two small beautifully decorated rooms. Plenty of choice ie: rolls, ham, cheese, cereal, croissants, muffins, eggs, yoghurts, orange juice and coffee/tea etc. Recommendations - use the vaporetta (waterbuses) - buy the tickets at the booths entering the main landing stages ie: Ferrovia (single fare E5, 24 hr ticket E12, 72 hr ticket E25) and pickup a timetable. Don't just stick to main sights ie: Piazza San Marco (St Marks), Rialto Bridge etc, but meander the back streets by foot. We also took the waterbus to other islands ie: Burano (famous for lace and has wonderfully coloured houses), and Murano (famous for glass blowing).

The bathroom had all the amenities and was really nice for a 3-star hotel. One world of caution, though. While it is literally steps from the station, it's the \"steps\" you need to keep in mind. To get over the canal, you need to go over a bridge that is all steps up and down. If you're over 50 and you're carrying a small suitcase and a tote bag, you'll be puffing by the time you get to the other side. I think it was worth it. We arrived at 8:30 p.m., checked in, dropped our bags, and went to find a pizzeria. That in itself is a typically Venetian adventure at night. To keep your bearings, just keep looking up to follow the signs for Rialto and make sure that the Grand Canal (the water) is always on your left. The rooms have high-speed internet access, but you must remind them when you check in to enable it. Also, the ethernet jack in our room was behind the TV armoire which we had to move to find. The gentleman who checked us in forgot to mention that little tidbit!

I require internet connection when traveling to be able to work, and I found one site listed this as a feature but all others didn't. I emailed the hotel and got a friendly response almost instantly.

The room and the beds are huge - even for American hotels. The bathroom is large and spacious with marble floors. Everything is immaculately clean. I truly cannot find a single thing to list as even a mild negative. I opted for the canal view upgrade when checking in and was glad I did. I was on the upper floor so my windows were smaller than the other floors, but i found that cozy. The location is the only thing that I can think that may keep the prices low at this hotel, but I found it to be an advantage, not a negative.

We booked 6 nights at Antiche Figure based completely on the high-praise for the hotel found in the posts here. Our experience is that AF is a stellar value. The day we arrived we were offered either a red room (on the side away from the Grand Canal) at our booked rate, a blue room (top floor front facing the canal, as a 25eur/day upgrade), or since we were staying so many days, the apartment the hotel owns. We took the top floor front blue room, so I have no details about the apartment, although other folks have mentioned it in these reviews. We simply decided that the original Pallazzo windows and longer/better view from the fourth floor sounded too good to pass up. *The hotel is incredibly convenient to the 3euro airport atvo-bus drop at Piazalla Roma (5mins walk down the canal to the landmark 'big green dome church' across the Grand Canal from the modern \"Ferrovia\" train station) *The room was spotless. *The bathroom was great: marble floors, walls, sizable tub with hand-shower. Nice modern fixtures. And of course the oft-mentioned beautiful murano crystal fixtures. *king-size bed (dbl-twin) mattresses). *mini-bar hidden in the desk (not cheap: 4euro cokes, but hey, it's extremely convenient and nothing in Venice is cheap :D) *a few foibles - not issues, as these aren't essential or even wanted items -- just differences compared to what you may see in western hotels: no alarmclock/radio (but wakeup calls are avail), no iron, no vending machines, no ice machine (that we saw). I mention these simply so that you can bring suitable items if you want them... *we booked through travelocity and the included continental breakfast was good. Nice array of options (croissants, meat, cheese, a nice rolled coffee cake,cereals,soft-boiled eggs in the shell, a variety of yogurts, etc...), all tasted very good, and you could eat as much as you wanted - no reason for anyone to go hungry. The lady policing the breakfast room was a pleasant blur of motion as she sailed around keeping the tables cleared & stocked. Yes the coffee from the machine is very strong, and be sure to use the 'stop' button to keep it from over-filling your cup.:D We got a table daily around 9:40am in the breakfast room. Except one day, when they had very few people checking out, all but two rooms booked and everyone decided to eat between 9 & 10 -- that was the only day that we actually saw they'd had to expand service to the tables out in the bar out front... We were there during the very slow period in Feb, but I could see where it could be a real scramble to get in for breakfast in July/Aug. Also, I can't for the life of me believe there's a review here from someone that sat in the breakfast room and waited for \"service\". It's pretty clear it's a self-serve breakfast with several buffet tables of things to eat. *the staff is great. From management to the lady that cleaned our room. They were very interested in how happy we were, actively solicited ideas for improvements, and suggested several wonderful restaraunts when we asked. On serveral occasions they offered to make reservations for their recommendations. *When you're in Venice, USE THE VAPPRETTOS and available multi-day passes! We walked everywhere for five of the six days and my feet took a heck of a beating (still got the blisters to show for it). Not to mention, Venice can be a pretty tough town to navigate in on-foot, as the chains of signs leading you from \"Ferrovia\" (the landmark train station near hotel) to \"Rialto\" & \"S. Marco\" can be very easy to lose track of as you're navigating. We got solidly lost at least once a day -- found ourselves coming back to the hotel through the soon-all-too-familiar Cannaregio section instead of the shorter Rialto route, on several ocassions. It can get frustrating. The vapprettos are easy, fast, and largely fool-proof. Just sit down and watch things go by. Not to mention they're alot less excertion than hiking.:D *We loved Ostaria al Vecio Pozzo! Ended up eating there FOUR TIMES! We had some difficulty with book-recommended restaraunts all over town (all but one of the 7 we tracked down on foot from Rick Steves' 2006 & Knopf Cityguide were permanently/seasonally closed). So whenever we got tired of tracking around town to restaraunts that may or may not be open, we just went to Vecio Pozzo! They always recognized us and greeted us warmly each visit. They've even got a web site with a large gallery of pictures, although it doesn't show the best part: the wonderful food or the people!: ---. Map at the site. As others have mentioned, it's a few blocks along the street on the right of the hotel, on Corte Canal # 656. *Another restaraunt recommended by the manager was Trattoria Antica Besseta. Very nice seafood, although the restaraunt was hard for us to find. We had both directions on our map (drawn by AF's manager) and a map on the back of the Besetta business card he gave us, and we still got completely lost and had to ask directions. 1395 Salizada de C\u00c3\u00a0 Zusto (3-4 blks NE of the hotel). *Finally, another good spot from the Knopf Cityguide, that was open not very expensive and had great food, though not particularly close to the hotel, was Osteria Ai Assassini, in San Marco, On Rio Tera Dei Assassini, #3695 (several blks north of the Fenice Opera house off of Calle D.

Another invaluable tip was to follow the signs to \"Ferrovia\" (station) to find your way back to the hotel. Finally - we paid an extra 5 euros each for breakfast which was good value.

We have also stayed at the Waldorf in NY, but the room we had there was not as well maintained as ours in Antiche Figure! The location of the hotel is also perfect: the vaporetto and railway station just in front. The area is more quiet but when you cross the bridge you are in a lively area with shops, restaurants etc., but not as expensive as in the San Marco area (E 10,-- for a sip of coffee, shame on them; please make sure you also double check the bill!!). We can really recommend this lovely hotel with very service minded staff: the breakfast lady (we think she's called Linda) fulfils are your breakfast wishes with pleasure, she's great and very hardworking. Unfortunately we missed Francesca, who was on a holiday. Gianni who helped us check-out was also a very service minded and kind guy and helped us efficiently with our transfer to the airport. We can highly recommend this lovely hotel and we would like to thank the wonderful staff and send them regards from Holland. We think Antiche Figure should be ranked no. 1 on Trip Advisor for Venice hotels!

Of course we are two females (28 and 29), and not romantics, or honeymooning. We were looking to party and there was no partying to be had in Venice. Anyway, the location of this hotel CANNOT be beat, it was so nice to hop off the train (from Florence and Milan respectively), and cross the bridge and we are at our hotel. Of course we over packed and had to negotiate the stairs, but that's ok, we didn't have to hassle with the water taxi's or figure out the water bus schedules. That was great! I got to the hotel first and my room was ready on the first floor and we were pleasantly surprised. The use of a full length mirror with two females was very handy. Also, liked having the use of a safe in the room, and we loved the shower/tub combo, since this is rare. The location of the hotel is near restaurants and the concierge was very helpful and went above and beyond. They translated for us, when my girlfriend picked up a Milan soccer player that only spoke Italian; we only spoke English and some Spanish/French. Other than the concierge telling us he was a millionaire (NOT), she was a good sport about relaying messages.

It is located on the side of the Grand Canal in Santa Croce, right next door to San Simeone Piccolo (large church with green dome). It is easily walked from either the train station (directly opposite the hotel via the Scalzi Bridge), or from the bus station in Piazzale Roma.

When you disembark the bus in Piazzale Roma, walk down the steps at the side of the Santa Chiara Hotel on to the banks of the Grand Canal. It's about a five minute walk (across two small bridges). The location is great, because you're not reliant on the vaporetto and a long walk before you get to your hotel.

Breakfast was certainly more than adequate - but there are no hot cooked eggs/bacon/sausage etc - previous writers comments have either been noted or expectations were too high.

Secondly our stay in Hotel Antiche Figure was without fault. The location of the hotel is excellent; on the Grand Canal and opposite of the main \"taxi station\" and Train station. It is also only a short walk from the Bus station which means easy access from the airport. The interior design of the Hotel is beautiful in a traditional Venetian style. Our bedroom was grand with a double bed and beautiful Chandelier. I could not fault any of the lovely staff who went out of their way too help us with our every request. (Before our stay in Venice my fiance emailed Antiche Figure to request 6 red roses be laid out on the bed for myself on our arrival. The Hotel replied promptly and the roses were there on the bed waiting for me! It was really lovely) I would highly recommend this Hotel to anybody thinking of staying in Venice. The location is ideal and the hotel incredibly beautiful and efficient. Well done Antiche Figure, and thankyou... 10/10! (I have included a photo of myself and my roses!)

We couldn't have picked anywhere better. Rooms: The room we had was very large by european standards, it was a twin bedded room overlooking the Grand Canal. We had paid in advance for a grand canal room and definitely felt it was worth the extra 50 euros per night. In total, the room cost 180 euros per night and we were there for four nights. The beds were huge for single beds, very comfortable and fresh. They were made up everyday by the friendly maid. The room also had a TV and an internet socket. It was decorated in a traditional italian style with beautiful furnishings and exceptional attention to detail. The room also has a minibar, safe and large cupboards. The bathroom was equally as lovely and was again large by european standards, decorated all in marble with two sinks, a toilet and a bath with shower. The lights were all traditional Murano glass lights. Both the room and bathroom were cleaned to a very high standard every day. Even though the room was over looking the canal, once the windows are shut you hear nothing. We could not hear the amazing storm we had, let alone the rumble of waterbuses. Staff: were incredibly accommodating. Prior to the trip they answered all email correspondances very quickly and if you phone them they speak perfect english and are more than helpful. I also heard the staff speak very good spanish and french while we were there. When we arrived, we were supplied with a map of Venice and were pointed in the direction of the main sites. We were also given a free trip to Murano and tour around one of the glass factories, which was really lovely. It was very nice to be able to arrive by water taxi, which are otherwise horrendously expensive! We just went down one morning to inquire about the trip assuming we'd have to give notice but they booked it there and then and 15 minutes later we were in the taxi. The lady that served the breakfast in the morning was always so polite, happy and helpful, as were all the other staff. Breakfast itself was a small buffet, consisting of croissants, rolls, cheeses, meats, cereals, yoghurts, eggs, fruit, juices and hot drinks. A great way to start a long days sightseeing! Location: The hotel Antiche Figure is situated exactly opposite the railway station and about 5 minutes walk from Piazzale Roma (the last place that cars are allowed in the city). It was so convenient. From Marco Polo airport just take the ATVO bus costing 3 euros to Piazzale Roma (it takes about 20 minutes) and then head for the green domed church and scalzi bridge on the grand canal. You can also get a road taxi to piazzale roma but it will cost about 30 euros. Alternatively you can arrive by water taxi, but they are incredibly expensive, usually about 80 euros from the airport. If arriving from Treviso airport, you can get the ATVO bus from there for about 4.50 euros which arrives in the same place. Always remember to buy airport bus tickets from the office at the airport or, for the return journey, from the office in piazzale roma in advance. Although on the map the hotel looks like it is far from the main hub of Venice, this is simply not true. Venice is a small place and it only takes about 15-20 minutes to walk to the Rialto and St Marks area. It is a benefit to be far away from St Marks Square as you will find that the restaurants further out give much better value for money. If you can't face the walk, the waterbus stop is right outside the hotel across the bridge. You can buy a one day ticket for 10.50 euros or 3 day ticket for 22 euros. You can also buy a card called the VeniceCard blue/orange which give waterbus use and discounts at many museums and churches. If you head up to the Cannareggio region to the north there are some lovely restaurants. One restaurant which i WOULD NOT recommend is the Mirabar between the hotel and piazzale roma. It is poor value for money and the service is appauling too! Another nice thing about the hotel is that it has a small bar which is lovely at night. You can sit outside and watch the world go by. Although not to do with the hotel, I must recommend a particular tour at the Doge's Palace, called the 'Secret Itineries' tour. This needs ot be booked a few days in advance, and can be done so on the internet or by phone. The official price is 15 euros per adult, though some websites charge a lot more. We phoned up the palace 4 days before arrival but when we arrived they had lost the reservation number and claimed it was our fault and handed it back to us. It took about 25 minutes of 'discussions' to sort it out but eventually they let us go anyway even though they said it was all our fault and not their responsibility. Half way around the tour, the guide presented us with a reference number asking if it was ours, which it matched exactly, it had been lost in the office, no apology... The tour itself however is fantastic, it takes you to all the locked rooms in the doge's palace. You get to see the torture chambers, learn all about the system and hear Casanova's tale and see the cells where he was kept prisoner. I would also recommend a tour of the theatre La Fenice. It costs 7 euros each (6 euros on presentation of a waterbus ticket at the ACTV office in piazzale roma). it is very good value and they run tours in all different languages. So, the reason I have given the Antiche Figure 5/5 is because it is exceptional value for a 3* superior hotel. I doubt you would find another hotel at this price to match the Antiche Figure. Sorry to also include other information, but felt it might be useful!!! I would recommend the hotel's website for pictures of the rooms and location etc.", "Date": "September 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "cheshire", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel - exceeded expectations\u201d", "Author": "etw57", "ReviewID": "UR3816326", "Content": "My daughter and I stayed at the Antiche Figure at the end of March.

The rooms are not huge, but very clean and well-appointed. The staff are friendly, professional, and very helpful (special thanks to Gwendolina (sp?) and Alessandro). It is well worth booking a canal view room. We arrived before our room had been vacated (checkout is noon), and agreed to stay our first night in a non-canal view room, which was small, but we wanted to get out and about. The next day we were moved to room 412, which is one of the largest rooms, canal view, no balcony, non-smoking. The buffet breakfast, which is included in the price, is from 7 until 10, and includes croissants, rolls, yogurt, cheese, fruit, cereal, cold cuts, etc. The hotel is across the Grand Canal from the railway station, and a short walk from the bus station in Piazzale Roma, but our room was quiet nevertheless. If you arrive by train, walk over the Scalzi bridge -- the hotel is next to the church with the green dome. If you arrive by bus (take the blue ATVO express bus from Marco Polo airport, 3 euros) just walk down the Grand Canal toward the aforementioned church. We highly recommend Ristorante Ribo, which is a 5 minute walk from the hotel, in Fondamenta Minotto. It isn't cheap (dinner for two, with antipasto, pasta, main course, a bottle of wine and dessert costs about 140 euros) but well worth it-- we ate dinner there twice, and the seafood is delicious.
