The owner is helpful and friendly, the location is fantastic, the cafe does superb food and coffee. Yes, the room is a little old and 'worn', but then, as long as it's clean and comfortable, that is fine. But that was the problem. On getting back from a gig in the evening I found a big cockroach had decided to move in. I decided to just live with it as I was exhausted and wanted to go to sleep. It had been a warm day, so I put on the air con to cool the room down a little. A few minutes later I hear a rush of water and, on turning the light back on, found that the air con was leaking... a lot. I went down to get the night watchman. He did come to my room with a can of bug spray and he did place the bin under the air con, but that was it. I got to spend the rest of the evening hearing the air con drip away and keeping an eye out for the cockroach (I ended up 'sleeping' with the light on both nights I was there - I don't like cockroaches). I told the owner the next day and she apologised, giving me a complimentary breakfast at the cafe. I suppose that was some compensation, but I am afraid not enough to make me stay here again.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellington, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cCentral - Rough\u201d", "Author": "221MikeM", "ReviewID": "UR126949284", "Content": "The central location and the chap on reception were nice but that is it as far as good comments.

That I ended up leaving after one night to stay at another, more expensive hotel and forfeited the $150 I had prepaid at City Crown tells you something of my experience and means you probably don't need to read much further. First, the positives. Staff are nice. Bathroom (renovated in the past 5-7 years I'd say) is simple but clean, as are the towels and manchester. Furnishings look tired but the carpet is new as is the flat screen TV. There is actually not very much accommodaiton available around Surry Hills-Darlinghurst, and what is available tends to be very expensive. Many of the older hotels and motels in this area have been converted into apartment buildings, leaving few options for travellers wnating to stay in this cool area and even fewer options for those on a budget. So the City Crown fills a big gap for people looking for basic, no frills budget accommodation in a cool and happening area - similar to Snooze Inn in Brisbane's Fortitude Valley or Hotel Saville in Melbourne's South Yarra. Another big plus is the complimentary wi-fi. Again, it shows that the most basic, budget properties in Australia are streets ahead of the 4 and 5 star properties who still charge through the noise for internet, totalyl out of step with the rest of the world. So that is a big positive for the City Crown. But, you do pay a price for those positives. In my case, it was a lot of noise. My room (12) was located right next to the front door, which meant I had to listen to it opening and slamming shut all night long, and the loud conversations of other guests arriving home after a night out. This got s bit dull around 4am. The paper thing door to my room meant I could also hear the phone ringing across the room in reception and all the details of the phone calls as well. Not to mention all the clomp-clomp-clomping of the person working on reception that night, who may or may not wear clogs. Even ear plugs did not help. So, in the end I found that the 'savings' of a budget room were not offset by the inconvenience of the noise and the no frills level of comfort for the room. I moved to another hotel which was much better for only $50 more. If the City Crown was super cheap - say, $100 a night - then I could overlook the noise and the basic facilities. But at $150 per night I think it is just not worth it.", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cBasic amenities in a great location.\u201d", "Author": "J0_mc", "ReviewID": "UR104416290", "Content": "1. Was the hotel close to things (e.g. transport, attractions, restaurants)? Excellent location. Very short walk to Kings Cross, Sydney business district, Surry Hills shops and cafes, and Darlinghurst shops and cafes. Trains and buses to anywhere also very close. 2. Was the hotel in a safe area? As safe as Darlinghurst gets, but i wouldn't park my car on the street. 3. Was there much noise at night? My room faced onto Crown Street, which is a major and busy street going all night. There was no wall soundproofing, so that caused quite a lot of pedestrian and traffic noise. I could also fairly clearly hear the activities going on in several other rooms on my floor... 4. What was the quality and cleanliness of the hotel furniture and fittings like (e.g. bed, lock-up safe, shower)? Very basic furniture that looked a bit worn, although comfortable, clean and functional. No place to hang up clothes, just a shelf. No lock up safe. 5. Do the hotel staff provide a good service (e.g. competence, attitude, availability)? Staff were very friendly and easily available. 6. What were the hotel amenities like (e.g. breakfast, restaurant, pool, bar, car parking)? Cafe downstairs was excellent. Secure car parking available underneath hotel for a small number of cars, which is a rare find in this part of the city. 7. Did the room come with extras (e.g. minibar, TV, internet, air-con, tea making facility)? Large TV, reverse cycle airconditioning, tea making facilities available. 8.

Lovely check in staff and when I returned at night and couldn't find the remote for the heater staff hunted a spare one down with a smile and let me know that I should just ring reception if the kids next door stayed noisy and said they would tell them to pipe down soon which was nice because while it was still pretty early on a Friday night and I didn't want to be a killjoy it was nice to know that it wouldn't go on endlessly. Rooms spotless with everything one needs. I was actually expecting more basic amenities based on the reviews here and the room rate which was VERY reasonable for Sydney but it definitely exceeded my expectations. Great area lots of nice restaurants and bars nearby and a quick walk to central business district. Will definitely stay again next time I'm in town.

The City Crown Motel in Sydney was one of the exceptions and was a very big part of our trip because of that. We turned up unannounced and with a car full off luggage (there are four of us traveling for a year and occasionally when our son turns up there are five) at this point there were four of us (on our return there were five). The owner Tony was at the desk when I pulled up after having tried and failed to find a place to stay at Bondi, our Navman had taken us to Tony\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s door. He could not have been more accommodating if he had been a family member. We got the car in the garage and we had two rooms at a very good price. The rooms are not super luxury but for the price they are excellent, clean and comfortable, the beds are nice and roomy. The CityLife also has the benefit of a Cafe on the ground floor and this is not some grotty little cafe as the queues at the window of the locals and local workers proved. No the food and drink served here are of the highest standard and in three months it was the only Motel we ate more than one meal at and the only place we ate because we wanted too rather than because it was the only place open for miles around, in fact there we only one day we did not eat there. There are also a big selection of free DVD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that you can borrow. Tony proved to be the ultimate host and his staff are also very friendly and helpful.
