It is hard to fault it. Our room was splendid and my partner would happily have spent the whole stay in their fabulous bathroom. We also had a wonderful view of the Park of Trajan opposite and that was particularly gorgeous when it snowed deeply over two days, to Rome\u2019s evident astonishment. One of the things that had enticed me to book six nights at Palazzo Manfredi was the promise of the view of the Colosseum from the roof terrace. We ate up there on three mornings and on three evenings and the view was spectacular. The food was also very good, if pricey. It was of the highest standard, as was the service, and we very much enjoyed the (seven course!) Degustazione Menu with wine pairing and the Valentine\u2019s Day special five course meal. Breakfast was simpler, a cold buffet, and a good start to the day, especially with the Colosseum sitting right there in front of you in the sun. I could make a few small complaints but they are so minor that I shall not. They were also things that, had I not been busy with other things and mentioned them at the time, I am confident the staff would have dealt with them immediately. The building is a handsome place to stay and very conveniently situation for the Centro Storico but the staff are even more to be recommended. The warmth of their welcomes and their politeness and attention to detail in every interaction were remarkable. We had a great week in Rome but our happy choice of accommodation made it an even greater week. And we had free, unproblematic wifi too.

It was a birthday surprise so seemed perfect - boutique style, and a room with a view (Colosseum - go on pay the extra!) I wasn't disappointed - and nor was he! Location is great - obviously overlooking the Colosseum but also walking distance to all major sights. The hotel recommended a cab to the Vatican but we walked there too - in such a beautiful city it's a pleasure to walk and there is something to look at on every corner. The hotel itself has plenty of character - an historic building - but is decorated in a contemporary style, with taste. The rooms are smallish - hey it's Rome - but not too small. The bathroom is also compact, but beautiful, and with another view of the ancient monument! Everything was spotlessly clean. The staff were a delight. Everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful. A nice touch was a complimentary welcome drink in the bar on arrival. Also, if you ask the day before they will fetch tickets for the Colosseum for you so you don't have to queue. This was brilliant - we saved about an hour and had that Business Class feeling as we sailed past the masses! We didn't eat in the restaurant - it looked nice but quite expensive altho with a great view. We ate in the city centre one night and round the corner in a little Osteria the other. There is only one downside to the hotel, which is noise. Inside the hotel is quiet, but the road outside is cobbled, and cars or buses whizzing down it at night do create a lot of noise. Good double glazing reduces this (and I always travel with earplugs so wasn't bothered) but light sleepers should be aware.

I though the selection of food was great and very high quality indeed. We also ate dinner in Aroma which was great. The only downside was the price of the drinks in the bar, which is on the terrace - it may have been nice to have more informal access to the terrace. They really were very expensive and I am used to high end bars - but I don't think the euro exchange rate was in our favour. They did bring quite a range of snacks with each drink, which was nice, though one night they brought a platter of sushi bites - we had just got back from a big dinner!

I have never had a better stay at a hotel than this one. The staff and service was top notch. Forgive me for not remembering any names but the woman during the day and gentleman at night at the concierge were so nice and helped us out with everything from making reservations, finding converters and tours, and giving us advice from a locals perspective. They made us feel so at home and were very gracious. The doorman from the US was also great - he gave us some great tips and was so friendly, which is nice to see after a long day of sightseeing. This hotel is in a perfect location in Rome, right next to the Coliseum. There's isn't a hotel closer to it than this one. Nothing beats having breakfast every morning while looking at one of the 7 Wonders of the World - its pretty neat. We walked everywhere from this hotel and it is very convenient to all areas of the city. A walk from the hotel to the Trevi Fountain is about 20 minutes, which is a very easy walk. I read a few reviews that this hotel is on the outskirts but not true at all. It's not far - take that from a New Yorker who isn't a big walker. The room were gorgeous with state of the art TV, phone, free wifi and gorgeous bedding. The tub was pretty nice too so definitely bring some bubble bath. The rooms and grounds were very, very clean which is a huge plus for me. The only negative thing i have to say about this hotel was the restaurant at the top. With a view like this, I can understand charging a high price for dinner but this was just out of control. 20 euros for a club sandwich and 8 Euros for a coffee is a little pricey - and i didnt even check the prices for a steak or other entree. It would have been nice to have dinner up there and enjoy the view but it was a little too much. There is an area on the rooftop where you can sit and get drinks at night, but without the view of the Coliseum. The restaurant and hotel are not owned by the same company but i must say, the staff at Aroma couldnt have been nicer. All in all, a GREAT stay here and I can not wait to come back here.

Turns out he was away smoking. On other occasions we noted other guests waiting for long periods to check in because there was no one at the front desk to do so. When the front desk person made an appointment with us to meet us at noon the next day to show us the other units the hotel had to offer for a future trip we were planning, we waited till 12.15 pm before he turned up. We asked for an electric kettle to make tea as room service ends in the evening. We were told they don\u2019t have kettles for guests but will organize one for us as we are staying for almost 2 weeks. Meanwhile they will provide a thermos of hot water. The next day there was no kettle. We asked again and the front desk person claimed he knew nothing about it but will organize it tomorrow. Meanwhile he will send a thermos of hot water. No hot water appeared. When we called again, he again acted like he was totally surprised. A room service person came to the room without any hot water claiming he had come to collect something so obviously the wrong message was sent to him. After more calling, finally a thermos of hot water was produced. The next day we reminded them about the kettle again. We were told that they have 2 kettles for guest rooms (contrary to their previous claim) but they are in use so they will have to buy us a kettle. Finally a kettle appeared at the end of the day. When we checked in the temperature in the room was 24 degrees C. Gentleman showing us the room said he could lower the temperature at the front desk if we want it to be cooler. We asked him to lower the temperature. That evening it was still at 24 and we asked again. We were told that it takes time to work. The next morning it was still at 24 and we asked again. This time we were told that the temperature showing in the room was not really the temperature and that they show our room temperature at 15 degrees! After a few moments we spoke to another gentleman who told us that our room temperature was at 19 degrees. Later that day it was still warm in the room (gauge still showing over 24 degrees and definitely feeling like 24 and not 15) so we asked again and the gentleman at the front desk said that it is a hot day out (max temperature that day was 28) and their system is not designed to handle such high temperature outside. We gave up. The windows are not noise proof and since it is on a very busy large road, traffic noise is continuous through the night. Did not matter to us as we can sleep through anything but for people who care about noise this would be terrible. In addition to the exterior noise there is also the noise from within the corridors that comes through the door. I put the bath towel over my head and face after a shower and felt hairs in my mouth. Upon examination, the bath towel had about a dozen long hairs (not mine) stuck on it. Closet has mini bar on one side and a set of drawers with safe on the other side so there is nowhere you can hang anything that is longer than a shortish shirt. When we checked in the TV was not working and we could not work out how the sink stopper worked. After the hotel person came he said he will have to call an engineer to check it out. Eventually the TV worked but the sink apparently was designed so you cannot stop the drain even if you want to have a basin of water to shave. There is no tub for travellers who prefer baths. The lights in the bathroom are bare light bulbs (by design). The shower is treacherously designed so it is sheer glass on one side of a tunnel and wall on the other side. At the far end is the rain shower head and you walk through this tunnel shaped space to take your shower at the far end. There are no doors but there is a step down as you go through this tunnel. Near the beginning of the tunnel are 4 small blue lights built into the shower floor. There is nothing to hold on to, to put soap or shampoo on, or a mat to provide a bit of traction anywhere in this arrangement. Bath towels are as far away from the shower as possible in the bathroom. Lots of decorative items in bathroom including empty crystal lotion dispenser bottle but no mugs to rinse mouth of toothpaste. Very small lift. We only see the hotel personnel using it.

If you are lucky enough to secure a room with a view, simply open your window and gaze upon the wonder that is the Colosseo. So close you can almost touch it! We arrived at the hotel after taking a red eye from NY. Upon viewing the building from the outside, we issued a collective \"yikes,\" as the building isn't very impressive from the outside. However, once you step inside, things are much, much better. The lobby is quite small (remember, this is a charming little boutique hotel, not the St. Regis) but nicely furnished.

It was the perfect way to welcome us to Rome. After the initial lunch, we steered clear of the pricey rooftop restaurant and dined elsewhere. The hotel's location is wonderful for spending two days visiting the Colosseo, Forum, Palatine Hill, Ludus Magnus, etc. However, it is a little further from the other sights - St. Peter's, etc. This is not a problem if you don't mind taking a cab. However, if you prefer to see Rome on foot, you may want to map out the route to be certain the walking distance is acceptable to you. Also, the hotel is located on a busy street. Several of the rooms, including ours, face the street. We weren't bothered too much by noise as the room appeared to be sufficiently soundproofed. Still, I thought this fact was worth mentioning. If you have the option of selecting a particular room, please, please, please, do yourself a favor and request a room with a view of the Colosseo. You will not be disappointed.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cGreate Views of Colosseum but out of the way of other sites\u201d", "Author": "marieny524", "ReviewID": "UR115752535", "Content": "We stayed at the Manfredi recently as part of our honeymoon and overall thought it was a great boutique hotel.

Part of our package included tickets to the Colosseum and it was truly great not having to wait online to buy the tickets or enter the Colosseum itself. The only con about this hotel is that because it is near the Colosseum, it is quite far from other sights. Although we are New Yorkers and used to living in a big city, Rome was overwhelming to us and we weren't sure what areas were safe. We would've had to cab to pretty much any other restaurants had we not dined in the hotel. If I were going to Rome for a longer period of time (we were only there a day and a half), I would probably have liked to stay at a hotel closer to the beautiful Villa Borghese and the park. Also, I wouldn't eat again at the hotel restaurant for dinner. While the view is unbeatable and the ambiance lovely, the food was extremely overpriced.

The bed was very comfortable but you are next to a very, very noisy street with no real way of opening windows due to noise and moped petrol smells. We had a warm night as the A/con didn't seem to work. Beautiful bath with view over Colliseum. Pity the bath plug didn't work either! Next morning we asked to speak to the manager and they instantly offered us the Marco Aurelia suite nearby in a side street. We quickly agreed as it was more room for us with our son. Everything taken care of and we were taken to a lovely apartment with two rooms/ hideaway kitchen and shower/toilet. Perfect. Very clean, crisp and modern. This apartment has a tiny lift too! It is worth remembering that you are in the middle of a residential property and you should expect some noise from people above and next to you. But to be honest the side street was so much quieter than the main road from the previous night we didn't notice much and I am a very light sleeper. We were just delighted and able to cope with the odd bit of foot noise form upstairs and next door. ( Maybe take ear plugs if you are an especially light sleeper!) Enjoyed 6 super nights in the suite. Park, supermarkets and taxis nearby. Plenty of local places to eat. Good location away from the hectic buzz . Night 7, volcano disruption causes us to have to stay another 5 nights. Hotel maintained rate for apartment and allowed us to keep re-booking on a daily basis. They couldn't have been more helpful if they tried! We hadn't used the wifi until the volcano erupted. Be sure to ask the reception for the alice network pass word. It occasionally goes down but the apartment care taker goes into the cupboard and re boots the router. Just ask! Used Shuttle service to and from hotel..... a bit more expensive than taxi but makes it feel a bit more special too. Holiday didn't quite go to plan but thoroughly enjoyed staying at the Marco Aurelia apartments and would most definitely consider going back again!!!
