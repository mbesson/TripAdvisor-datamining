We went to new york for our wedding anniversary and booked this hotel from reading reviews the location,and the price!!! Please remember that rooms in new york are SMALL that is a fact off life am afraid,if you want a big room you will pay BIG dollers for it. When we arrived we were told that we were on the 19th floor we went to look at the room before checking in and found that kingsize bed, fridge, safe, bathroom were all fine. BUT the view from our window was bad !!! This is not the hotels fault, but we had come a long way from the other side of the pond as they say. when we went back to reception we were offered a room on the 26th floor with a view of the empire state building, the hudson river, and the new hope towers!!! the views were fantastic and at night when lying in bed looking at the empire state building all lit up thats what makes it for me. Now to the room which is ideal for one person as it was small. But for two it was a bit of a squeeze to say the least. and there was no fridge We went on the understanding that we intended to see as much off New York as we could so the room was only for changing in, sleeping in, and showering in that was all. If you go with that in mind then the rooms are fine. They are cleaned every day ,the huge towels are wonderful and always plenty of them,a good size bathroom and shower with shampoo, conditioners,and body lotions as standard also a hairdryer iron and ironing board are supplied Trying to put up the ironing board in a room this size is something else!!! but we managed and even seen the funny side of it. Now to the hotel staff i can only comment on the ones that i came into contact with so here goes JEFFERY the guy on the front desk was first class!!! so very helpful and with our upgrade which he sorted out personally made our stay in new york this guy is a credit to the Hilton group. thank you so much for all that you did for us.

This is the best bar you will find in new york, its not a plastic pub,it is a REAL old fashioned new york bar!!!! with great beer and wonderful staff who tell it as it is.

The location was great and was a huge reason for selecting the hotel. All in all the hotel was fine. Staff was nice, I felt safe walking around alone, the hotel was clean and fairly updated. My big complaint was the size of the room and bathroom. They were SO small even compared to NYC standards (I stay here for a week every year). Other hotels in NYC can be smaller as well but this was exceptional. When we first arrived into our room we asked if we could be switched to a different room. Other friends in the same hotel had slightly bigger rooms. The issue is that the hotel is sort of shaped like a squared \"C\". The long hall of rooms (off the elevator) were a bit roomier but ours was around the corner on the ends. Not only was the room tiny but the bathroom was ridiculous. The sink was a tiny little triangle counter with a vessel sink. Because we were in the back corner (room #310 i think) a large chunk of our bathroom was cut out. (hard to explain). The sink area was so small that the faucet didn't event fit with the sink. Faucet was pushed back in the corner so much that if you didn't turn the faucet on full power, the water would miss the basin altogether. However if you turned it on all the way, it splashed all over the sides and all over the mirror. It was frustrating. The shower was a good size though. However the position of the door and faucet was annoying. You had to go into the shower to turn it on and there wasn't really a way to turn it on without getting wet. So no warming up the water first before stepping in. Our room was also pretty tiny for two co-workers. Luckily we are friends but otherwise it would have been too cramped. We had nowhere to put our suitcases and were tripping over ourselves daily. Again, our friends room had a little entry way area to put suitcases but our room did not. I think we just had the bad rooms. My friends in a room along the main hall had a normal bathroom and had no complaints. So perhaps that was our problem. We were originally in #710 and asked to be moved and they just moved us a few floors lower to the same room configuration. Not really a big help. We complained again but they insisted all the rooms were the same. Having gone into our friend's room, we knew that was not the case. I would consider staying here again but ONLY if they could assure me that I would be in a room along the main hallway not the ends.

We stayed at the hotel over the last six nights and during that short time we stayed in their best room '2608'. This is on the top '26th' floor and the views were truly spectacular.

For now, the results were average. Enjoyed the free breakfast, but they were understaffed and always running out of things. Liked the updated bathrooms, but 2 of 3 seen had mold in the showers, and the third suffers from a leaky shower door that resulted in lots of water on the bathroom floor. In trying to sort our room reservation details, one front desk person hid behind policies and such, while another smoothly resolved issues and was generally helpful. Regardless, beware the evelators, as the two small ones labor mightily to service the hotel's 26 floors. Long waits result.
