The level of service was above and beyond what we expected. The staff has to be the most down to earth and friendly people we have ever encountered in a hotel. Every staff member we encountered, even ones in the hall busy with their daily routine, had something friendly to say or just ackowledged you with a hello. The facilites were well looked after. The rooms were clean and the bed very comfortable. Only minor complaint was the noise of A/C, but this was trival compared to the overall experience. Only other complaint was the cookies. They're too warm, too accessible and too many calories. Ah well, I guess that's why they have a great gym facility down the hall I suppose. Considering where the property is compared to downtown Key West, the free shuttle is a great bonus. We found the service on time and well run. One of the drivers even let us off at his favourite breakfast haunt one morning, Banana Cafe- great breakfast with a European flair. Plus driver offered tips about other places not to miss, it was like having our own private tour guide.

Beautiful pool-side seating in good weather. Coffee/tea service in the rooms. Helpful, friendly staff (though housekeeping was in the habit of shouting at each other in the halls, which was unpleasant), and the shuttle downtown is awesome, stopping at each end of Duval Street and also honoring special requests. So all the basics of a great stay are there, but it was missing that extra something special that would launch it out of the Doubletree category and into the true Hilton experience. It's starting to feel a bit dated, and the rooms, while clean, are sparsely appointed. For the price we paid, I expected more - but it was probably because we were at the beginning of spring break.

We were given an option of two rooms: one on the top floor overlooking the pool and one on the third floor which overlooked the parking area. We chose the pool, and although the hotel has live music that plays all day, the ambience was nice, and the rooms relatively quiet when the sliding door is closed. The food in the restaurant is quite good, and not too pricey given that there is limited choice around the area. There is poolside food and drink service, and while we were by no means looking to get drunk, the drinks were very light on alcohol (our kids had the virgin versions of some of our drinks, and there wasn't much taste difference), so a bit pricey for what you get. The hotel does offer poolside massage services, but we did not partake in any. The hotel is beginning to feel a bit dated, and there was mould in the bathroom (which always amazes me given it is a relatively simple thing to control with bleach). The hotel provides you with a door-hanger card on which you can select a time from early morning to mid afternoon to have your room serviced. However, as we find this a bit of a security risk (not the best idea to hang a sign on your door saying you are not in the room at a specific time), we just advised the housekeeper on our floor that we were leaving and she could clean the room. She told us that she had to clean the rooms of those who were checking out first (so not sure why we were given the option on the card of having our rooms cleaned in the early hours), and that it would be later. However, the room was never serviced. When we returned to the room later in the evening, we called the front desk to advise them and see if we could get a few fresh towels and some shampoo. They didn't seem too concerned that the room had not been serviced, which was disappointing. Also, we had to ask for extra shampoo a couple of times, as there was 4 of us in the room, but only one shampoo left. When we did, they would hand out the shampoo one at a time like it was gold.

It's part of the Hilton family, so we had some Hilton Honors Rewards points to redeem. Overall, we really liked this hotel. The check-in process was a bit slow because there were others in front of us, but the woman who checked us in was very friendly and helpful. (We appreciated the fresh cookies and water that's a trademark of Doubletree hotels.) We loved the aquarium in the lobby. Our room on the 4th floor had a balcony and overlooked the pool area. The room was very, very nice... a bit smaller than we were expecting, but it was still quite lovely. It was clean and comfortable. With our rewards points, we were able to take advantage of the buffet breakfast without having to pay extra. (Otherwise, the buffet is $12 per person.) The buffet has a lot of food, and it's easy to overeat... hash browns, sausage, eggs, fresh fruit, yogurt, Belgian waffles, French toast, cereal, and on and on and on. You can be very gluttonous, and I was!!! The servers who help you at the restaurant are generally very attentive and helpful. One thing that is really nice about this Doubletree is the concierge service that's provided. We were able to use their assistance a few times and very much appreciated it. We were given suggestions for good restaurants, and the woman made a reservation for us for a snorkeling trip. The pool area is very nice, but we unfortunately didn't have a whole of time to use it. This time of year it gets dark early and it was a little on the chilly side, so all we really did was use the hot tub, although my significant did have the courage to jump into the chilly pool at 8:00 at night. There's an outdoor bar area that's open until 11 p.m., and we enjoyed having adult beverages in the hot tub. Loved it. Another bonus for this hotel is that, even though it is on the opposite side of the island as all the downtown Key West attractions, there is a free shuttle service that runs every hour to and from downtown. We took advantage of this both full days we were in Key West. Very convenient, and at the end of the night, we loved being dropped off at the front door of the hotel. The only downside we encountered was the sleep quality of the room. We had trouble sleeping but really couldn't figure out why. The bed was very nice, but maybe it had something to do with the air conditioning that kept turning on and off and on and off throughout the night. For some reason I couldn't get into a comfortable position so that it wasn't blowing directly on my face (which I don't like). All in all, we highly recommend the Doubletree Grand Key. It's very nice, but you won't find very cheap hotels on the island.

Grab a beverage from the outside bar, pick your lounge chair and relax.. you deserve it. The rooms offer good coffee and a smaller refrigerator. While the bathrooms could use an update, the sleeping area was very comfortable and very \"KeyWest looking\". We had a connecting room and the people next door were very loud and the children screamers, not the hotels fault, but annoying still the same. The restuarant tries to be very high end and from a service aspect, they do a nice job. The food is a little better then ok, but really.. there are to many great places in town to stay at the hotel for dinner (I was on business and didn't have time to go were I like). I will say that the breakfast buffet was very good and well worth the $13 per person +. It allows us to hang around the pool in the morning. Huge Plus.

There were a lot of marks on the wall and the bathroom was not very clean. I feel as a hotel that housekeeping should let you know about these rooms so you can at least keep them up. A little paint will go along way. The bathroom wall had something on it, rusty medal or something but it was not an appeasing sight and the doors and light switches had dirty fingerprints on them. On our first day housekeeping didn't even come until 3:00 and then we were walking in and she said she would just wait until tomorrow. I told her it was fine, we would wait, however everyday it was a wait. I had seen a few reviews with pictures that did actually show the room true to form with the paint scuffs and dirty marks and that is exactly what it looked like. The shuttle service was great and the drivers very nice. The bell staff, front desk and pool service was great!

The hotel does provide shuttle service to downtown Key West and Duval Street from 8am to 11pm, which was a real plus since parking was very difficult to find and expensive..

Gigantic beautiful fish tank in Lobby. Restaurant had very comfortable outdoor seating on patio. Very nice staff. Our room was a suite and it was very spacious and comfortable. Breakfast buffet and it was very good. Cons: Not really sure about this, we had a great time start to finish. Conclusion: My wife and I live in Miami, so we feel as if Key West is in our back yard. We have been several times. Our intentions were to see more of the city, but because the Doubletree was so nice, we ended up staying at the hotel most of the trip. The pool is super nice; it has a gradual slope in the shallow end which was great for my 3 year old son. The pool side service was fine and as a bonus, we had good weather. No complaints.

I will start with the ONLY negative about this hotel. They appear to be very strict about their 3pm check in time. The airline we arrived in Key West on only has 1 flight a day, and it arrives at noon. We called the hotel, got a very quick van ride to the hotel, but was met with a somewhat rude and distant front desk clerk who told us the check in time was 3pm and we would have to wait till then. She then turned her back on us and didn't offer any suggestions or ideas. Well, the pool area is beautiful and comfortable. We found someplace to change into our swimsuits and hung out at the pool area till check in. There is plenty of sunny areas, shady areas, and the pool bar is very convenient. I believe the bartender was \"Billy the Greek\" and he was one of the most helpful employees we encountered at the hotel. He gave us good service on our lunch and drink orders, and was full of ideas of places to visit and dine while in Key West. Our only regret of our trip was being so busy we didn't spend enough time at the pool. The rooms are adequate but very clean. Most of the pictures you will find online make the rooms appear larger than what you will actually fine. There were 2 of us so we had plenty of room, but I would think a room with 4 adults would be very crowded. The van service downtown works well. It was always punctual and is convenient. The only recommendation I have here is regarding the last van of the day. The last van leaves \"downtown\" at 11pm. There will be a huge crowd waiting, and the van will be standing room only for the last trip back to the hotel. Be prepared to fight your way onto the 10 and 11pm van as people are pushy and rude. It doesn't matter if you have been waiting 30 minutes for those vans, because once it arrives, it is a \"free-for-all\" getting on the van. In NO way is this the hotels fault or responsibility, but more indicative of today's society. The food at the restaurant is excellent and on par with prices of other Key West restaurants. Plus, can you ever go wrong with a warm chocolate chip cookie for dessert? The front desk attendants are very generous with the cookies too! Overall, this is a good hotel by Key West standards. It is nice to not have to worry about a rental car and parking issues.

The rooms were nice but nothing spectacular, our last night we were upgraded to a junior sweet which did have a nice extra-large balcony overlooking the pool. The shuttle service was quick and on time when we used it - last pickup on Duval was at 11:20 PM. One night the driver gave us a great tour of Key West and told jokes during the ride. Still there is nothing better than being able to walk back to your hotel in the afternoon for a dip in the pool or a shower and walk back out to Duval. Breakfast was included for me as a HHonors Gold member - the buffet wasn't bad. Considering Key West prices $12.95 is a fair price. Our room had not been cleaned when we went to check in at 3:00PM Sunday as a large number of people had checked out.

I was right on the money with this booking! From the start, it is an attractive resort with a dolphin statue/foundtain out front. in the front lobby is a floor to ceiling column-shaped fish tank with beautiful reef fish. We spent a good amount of time looking at the fish. We are not a family that needs to stay in the \"downtown\" area (the party district) because we do travel with kids and neither my husband nor myself consume alcohol. So for people who want to STAY in the center of the party, this location may not be for you, HOWEVER, they do offer free shuttle bus services back and forth to different locations on the island. We found the free shuttle service to be very helpful as often it was difficult for us to find parking. Occasionally we did take our own car during our 4- day stay, but, always ended up walking, walking, walking, walking in the heat when we did. Upon check in, the kids (to our surprise) were each given a back pack with some activity books, crayons, etc. It was a nice surprise. Also, the famous Double Tree chocolate chip cookies! Mmmm! And whether we are supposed to or not, each day we went back to the front desk for more! We only dined in the hotel restaurant once and although it was good, found it a little overpriced. We tend to like to eat out and about, places in the \"downtown\" district for the scenery and atmosphere, anyway. Our room, I must say, was AMAZING. Due to a booking error, we ended up with a Jr Suite and management let us keep it at no extra cost. REALLY great room for families! The main bedroom has two VERY comfortable Doubletree beds with a TV< plenty of room for our items, etc. Nice room. Adjpoining was another room (with a separate balcony) that had a dining room table and chairs, another TV, a sofa bed, cabinets, a stereo with mutliple disk CD changer, cabinets, kitchenette... It was AWESOME, like our own little apartment. Everyone had plenty of room, the decor was nice, and we were extremely comfortable there! The kids had plenty of room to run around and I highly recommend the Jr Suite. The pool area was also very nice, clean, cabanas, well kept. Large pool, also a hot tub. Sometimes my kids just like to hang out at our hotel, and so we definitely look for a nice place to spend that time and we certainly had that here at the Doubletree. There are places closer to \"downtown\" with no pools, tiny rooms, even places that don't allow kids. And I was glad we stayed away from the hustle and bustle because there tends to be a lot of drinking in Key West -- lots of bars, and my kids are too young and uncomfortable to be around all of that. So it was nice to have a great room to come back to at night to relax and enjoy some family time, away from the crazy. The manager was very nice, the rooms are all indoors - no outside access, which I like, and I highly recommend this property.

They gave out absolutely delicious, warm, chocolate chip cookies at check in and actually anytime you wanted to come to the desk and ask for them. The staff at the desk were always super nice. We flew into Key West and didn't rent a car. We took the hotel shuttle down to the main part of Key West and spent the entire day walking the city. The Butterfly Conservatory is worth every cent you pay to see it. It was wonderful, so many different colors and types of Butterflies lighting on you and flying around. We enjoyed our tour of Hemingways house and the six toed cats, the Little Whitehouse tour was also interesting. This is a very easy city to see on foot. I recommend this even for a quick trip. We only stayed two nights but the Doubletree was a great home base for everything we wanted to do and see.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cNot for your wedding anniversary\u201d", "Author": "johanjon", "ReviewID": "UR116203254", "Content": "Doubletreee Grand Key Resort is an average hotel rather used as a conference center than the stay for your wedding anniversary or honeymoon.

Free parking on the hotel property. Use the free shuttle if possible, parking in Key West can be hard. Beds were good but rooms did not offer anything spectacular.

Key West hotel prices and lodging aren't cheap and seem inflated but I would definitely recommend the resort and return. Once work was done and I returned to the property, my wife and I rode the complimentary shuttle to and from the Front Street area in the late evenings and enjoyed several excellent meals, including at the Conch Republic Seafood Company and the Commodore Waterfront Restaurant but also stayed 'home' some and enjoyed some good meals as well at the Doubletree. Parking isn't easy to find in the Duval/Front (happening) area of Key West which makes the shuttle even better and/or renting a scooter a good idea. One evening, we also took the family-oriented glass bottom boat (Fury water adventures) to the reef on a sunset trip--highly recommended. The staff at the hotel is very friendly and attentive and there's a great concierge who can arrange anything you'd care to do. As noted, I was on business so didn't have the time but noticed that many folks were at her desk arranging snorkeling, bike or scooter rentals, wind surfing, fishing, golf at the Rees Jones-designed Key West Golf Club and the like. The golf course looked great and I heard good things about it from golfers although, alas, being a business trip, it was something again I didn't get to experience on this visit. As for the location, the hotel is near the airport but we didn't hear the planes much so that was a non-issue. Wifi is available throughout the property and wired connections also are available in the rooms, which have safes and small refrigerators. There's a little convenience-style mart right next to the property where you can buy milk and other food items for the frig. While Key West is known for a lot of things--including all the cozy-looking Key West style houses, key lime pie, Ernest Hemingway, shops, interesting little nooks and crannies, fauna and its lifestyles/carefree spirits/\"Conchs\" (as locals call themselves)--it's definitely not known for its beaches. There are some: to go, hang a right out of the resort and drive past the airport (they will be on your left, with what looked to be a good array of vendors, kayaks and other rentals), but they had a lot of seaweed and aren't those wide expenses of sand you'd see in, say, Destin, Fla., or even Myrtle Beach, S.C. So it's not a place you go to if you want to go to the beach--more a place to fish, snorkel one of the world's largest reefs, enjoy a good meal and just chill. For banking, Wells Fargo is a great choice since it has two ATMs on Duval Street near Front Street and a branch in Key West, too. Like the song says, \"It 's five o'clock somewhere\" and Key West is a nice place to be. You certainly can't beat the sunsets. The Doubletree definitely makes a perfectly Grand Key West home base. Hang out at the pool and scarf a cabana in the morning while the active set is doing their thing or, rent a scooter or bike or hop a fishing charter and explore and join 'em. Just make sure you're amply funded! Bottomline: The Doubletree is not the Ritz or Four Seasons or perhaps not as ta-ta as the Marriott or as convenient as other options if you are going there for one big party. BUT it's nice enough, comfortable and a good value and the folks there seem to enjoy working there and serving others--even if they are rude German tourists with poor manners (great American patience, team!). The only negative experience during the stay was a slight issue with the Wifi one night but that was up by the time I woke up with a nice voicemail on the phone confirming the resolution of the problem.", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyable Time...Great Helpful Staff...\u201d", "Author": "DivaCee", "ReviewID": "UR115990713", "Content": "My hubby and i just returned from our 1st trip to Key West!!!

If there were people waiting, they would immediately bring another one and not make you wait another hour which was wonderful, but lap sitting in a small van filled with 16 (or more) people is not that much fun.

We were looking for a place w/ a nice pool that was reasonably priced and we got our money's worth! We made reservations last minute and ended up having to book a queen room instead of a king. I made a note on our reservation that we were going to be celebrating our anniversary and would like a king if available. When we arrived, the person at the front desk saw my note and went above and beyond to accomodate us. We were upgraded to a king junior suite (no additional cost) and given free parking ($10/per night). The employee was so sweet and genuinely wanted us to have a nice weekend. She truly knows the meaning of \"customer service\" which is rare to find these days. This was the theme of the weekend at this hotel...the room was very nice and also very clean, room service came after we left and were done by the time we returned and never bothered us, the pool was great as was the service at the pool bar. The pool is a good size and it didn't feel crowded. On Thursday and Friday, the pool had a cabana boy who was very attentive, friendly and supplied us w/ ice cold water all day long. There was even food service at the pool and if we didn't want to leave our cabana, we didn't have to. (The lunch we had from the hotel restaurant was fantastic) Speaking of the cabana, it was free and we were able to use it as long as we wanted. I highly suggest using one of the cabana's if available as it provided a nice break from the hot sun. There was a live steel drum player at the pool which added a nice touch. All of the staff at the hotel were friendly and attentive. We've stayed many places in Key West and this is one that we will definitely go back to. I would recommend it for all ages and for people with kids. The only drawback is that it's a 10-15 minute drive from Duval but the free hotel shuttle was easy to use and very convenient.

Our stay in Key West was relaxing, lazy and fun. We started the trip flying into Miami and making the beautiful drive down US 1. Once arriving at the hotel there was a short wait to check-in. The hotel is on the outskirts of Key West. Nancy was very helpful at check in explaining the shuttle service and stops as well as the pool, bar, restaurant, FREE wifi, etc. She also answered our questions about Duvall street and the tourist stuff as this was our first visit to Key West. We had a king room with a small balcony that was sufficient. We started our days drinking coffee on the balcony. There was not much of a view- it faced the parking lot and adjacent properties but it had good sun in the morning. The room itself was very small but we spent little time in it other than sleeping. The bed was very comfortable and I had no complaints. There is a small parking fee of $10.75 per day. I think its rather cheap and well worth the price as you can leave your car at the hotel and use their free shuttle service to the action in Key West. The shuttle went to Smathers Beach and two stops in Key West: one near sloppy joes and on the other end of Duvall near the Southernmost point. It runs on the hour until 11pm. If you stay out later like we did, expect the taxi fare to be about $20 with tip and most taxis in Key West dont take cards so have cash on you. I think this shuttle service is the biggest plus for this hotel even if you have to take a cab home, it saves you half the cab fare for a round trip. We also spent a lot of time in the Pool area. Its a nice size pool with a waterfall and lots of lounge chairs and free cabanas if you get there early enough. Due to the proximity of the airport you get a plane buzzing the hotel every once in awhile but I am an aviation geek and enjoyed watching them. We got a tip from a guy in the elevator about the Key West lemonades served by the bartender at the pool bar. We tried one and were hooked, they were refreshing, tasty and strong! We enjoyed quite a few of these during our stay. Prices were reasonable and didn't automatically include service charges or anything. This is the place to stay in Key West. Even though its far away from Town, everything is accessible with their shuttle and if youre in KW to party like we were, you dont have to worry about driving!

There is an hourly shuttle to town which you need to go to dinner. You can bike in the daytime but need to rent bikes through the concierge.

The rates were very high for these two nights - $339 the first night and $399 the next night. I saw that the rates dropped to $189 after new years. This is the price that this \"hotel\" should be. We stayed on Hilton Honors points - 80,000 for two nights. A great use of the points during high season price time. As a Diamond member we received comp'd breakfast each morning and free parking. Also internet was free for us. A nice perk for loyal customers of Hilton in their top tier. Even though this is Key West which is known for it's expensive accommodations, there is no way that this place is worth anywhere near what they were asking, yet it was a full house - fully booked. Wouldn't spend a penny over $200 for this place. HOTEL The rooms were what you'd expect in a Hilton Family hotel. Clean, decent size, in working order, very comfy bed, but nothing special and no wow factor at all. Nautical color theme - white, blue, yellow. It was decent and had no complaints but a bit dated. The pool is quite small and only a max of 4 feet deep. Plenty of lounge chairs and other chairs. The pool is definitely not heated. It felt like it was about 70-72 F. Too cold if it's not a hot day. It was only about 72 F outside the day we were there. Air conditioning in the room was great. Great shower. Fridge in the room but no microwave. Our room had only a \"juliet\" balcony facing the pool so you could open a patio door but not go outside. The common areas including the lobby, restaurant, pool bar and pool are average. Nothing fancy. Nothing bad. FOOD The hot breakfast on day one was exceptional. As I mentioned the $12.95 each breakfast was free for us, including made to order omellettes if you are a diamond member. There was so much choice and everything was so good. We said that it was the second best hotel breakfast we had ever had. Interestingly enough though, the second day was so different. The \"fresh squeezed\" OJ from the day before seemed to be replaced by what seemed like Tang. The scrambled eggs were inedible and the sausage and bacon weren't good at all where the previous day they had been excellent. The service on the second day was terrible too. Funny how one day can make such a huge differance. The restaurant itself is not open in the afternoon but you can order food from it out at the pool bar. We had chicken fingers and fries and a pita wrap with fries and both were excellent. Drinks were reasonably priced for what we had. 2 for 1 MGD for about $3.95 I think. One note, dogs were allowed outside in the outdoor breakfast area. This seems non hygenic to me. They were just small lap dogs but still.... dogs should not be in restaurants either inside or out. SHUTTLE We had great luck with the shuttle. We went to Duval street and back twice with the shuttle with hardly any wait. Did not use a taxi at all and saved money. They say it only goes once an hour but we were picked up twice downtown about 40 minutes early. This could vert depending on demand. SERVICE Everyone we encountered with the exception of day 2 at breakfast was awesome. Check in was great. Front desk always great. Doormen. Billy the Greek at the bar. We did have to call for housekeeping at 4pm even though we had no sign on the door and had been out of the room all day. LOCATION Very quiet away from the hustle and bustle. ONLY downside is having to count on shuttles or taxis to take you back and forth to where everything is on Key West. We had ZERO problem with shuttles though. In closing I would recommend this hotel for a visit to key west but in no way expect any thing that resembles a \"resort\" like you would find in Mexico or the Caribbean... not even the very small ones. This is a hotel and it is a bit better than average. It is in no way Grand.

The hotel is on the quiet side of the island but there is a VERY timely, well-run, and well-designed shuttle service to take you to both the beach and both ends of Duvall Street, where all of the action is.

The hotel also has little things that help to make it very nice, like showing movies twice per day with fresh-popped popcorn and other little niceties like that. The hotel is starting to show its age. The rooms are not quite as nice as we remembered them being (we got a 2nd floor room, next to the elevator, with a horrible view, despite being Hilton Diamond Elite members, so maybe we just got unlucky with the room assignment this time around), some of the common areas need some basic maintenance, the nice gift and convenience shop they used to have in the lobby is now closed and a few other little things like that. This is nothing that a good refurb effort couldn't fix in a hurry, but it is a little unpleasant to see a hotel that we both love this much show these traits. The room was somewhat loud at night, both with sounds from the hallway and the quite loud A/C unit kicking on and off. So...the Doubletree is still awesome and we will absolutely be back. The hotel is showing its age, but the excellent service provided by the staff makes up for this. If the hotel can get a decent refurb effort underway to fix these minor things before they become more serious, that would be wonderful.

They were very timely and we had no trouble getting where we needed to go.

They were always on time to pick up from those locations too. Last shuttle leaves at 11:20 from Duval, but we partied later than that a few times and the taxi ride was still dirt cheap.

Not a big deal, just not something I'd expect at a hotel like this. It makes me wonder how \"clean\" the rooms actually are. Key West is not a place you go to hang out in your room, and overall it was a nice, safe place to come home to every night. The pool was great! Zero gravity that was great for kids, because it eases into the water very subtly. We don't have kids yet, but our group did and the kids seemed to love it! The food was decent, nothing to write home about. There is no where to eat in walking distance, so if you're too lazy to ride into town, it was an easy, casual meal or buffet. And, again, the dining service was great. Another plus is that there is a convenience store right next to the hotel - we needed to use it several times for various products, water & beer runs.

You get them at the same stand where they are renting chairs and umbrellas for $10 each so that is a very nice service.

Consequently, my customer service standards are extremely high; however, I have to say that the hospitality and kindness displayed by your Guest Services Manager Kevin Hill deserves nothing less than the highest praise possible. During an impromptu bridal shower, our gathering became a little noisy. Mr. Hill very respectfully explained the situation to us and offered to move us to another location so that the celebration of the bride could continue without bothering other guests. Obviously, Mr. Hill could have approached the situation with a strong-arm but in his wisdom, kindness and patience he fostered a spirit of cooperation that produced a result conducive to all involved \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not an easy feat when dealing with dueling priorities. Again, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even feel that my words adequately express our gratitude. Mr. Hill is a warm, generous, kind, gracious and patient man.

The check-in process was normal and smooth. When I arrived into my room there was a maintenance person who was trying to fix the bathroom light. After 30 minutes of entering and leaving the room and leaving the room door wide open with us in the room, the man left the room and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even tell us he was leaving. In addition, the light did not work the entire time we were checked in since he removed the light (not referring to the light bulb). I am referring to the light fixture. After an hour of still trying to get myself settled into the room housekeeping was now trying to enter the room. After a 4 hour drive the last thing I wanted was people entering the room. In addition, I called the front desk to advise what was going on and they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even know that maintenance was in the room working on the light. Later in the day the front desk manager called my room to find out what was going on. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that a maintenance person had done this. I explained to the manager if he called to find out what happened then I would tell him, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t call me a liar on the information I am giving him.

The first visit was for a four day vacation weekend with a friend. Didn't get any upgrades with Hilton Diamond status since the hotel was sold out for Martin Luther King Jr. weekend. Had a good stay overall and my friend had a good time also. The hotel is just down the street from the airport, but on the other side of the landing strip, so airplane noise was never an issue. Plenty of parking since it helps to have a car in the Keys (unless you only stay in Key West). There is an hourly shuttle to ferry people to Duval St. and back to the hotel. As someone who used to live in the Keys, I would recommend this location over the more rowdy atmosphere closer to Duval St. You are on the quieter side of the island and right down the street from Smathers Beach. Very comfortable beds and the regular rooms are fairly spacious. All rooms include an empty minifridge (bring your own drinks and food). TV's are 27\" tubes, so those could use updating. On my second visit two weeks later due to some family business, I was upgraded to a two queen suite. Good size sofa bed and big balcony overlooking the pool along with the amenities above. What made the second visit better was the great service I got, particularly from Kevin, the night manager. He was instrumental in helping me and my family get two different rooms upgraded after a misunderstanding after our first night.

Process was fine, but when I asked, to confirm that we would have a shuttle available to get us to the Ft. Jefferson Ferry at 7:00am as I was promised, I was told \"Uh, Maybe, That depends. You will have to check in the morning to see if there will be anyone here to take you.\" This is not what I was told by the hotel reservations agent. (I made the reservations directly with the hotel, not Hilton for this reason. To verify shuttle, and I did tell them I already had tickets purchased on line.) When I noticed the concierge (Debbie) at her desk, I asked her the same question. She checked her log of people going on the ferry, she asked my name and then said it wasn't on her list. I told her, as I had told the reservation clerk and the desk, that I had purchased the tickets a week before making my reservations at the hotel, and was told it would not be a problem. She said the hotel can only guarantee transport to the docks, leaving an hour earlier than normal, if the ferry tickets were purchased through the hotel. After chatting with her a bit she said she would try and have transport available, if the airport driver was there to take us. Not to worry as the ferry never leaves on time (8:00am) Spouse and I went out the dinner and while out near the docks I checked with the office of the ferry. They said they leave promptly at 8:00 or earlier if everyone is there. People not there at 7:45 may not have a place at all if they are booked up. Wife and I discussed this and decided not to take chances and drive in, park in the garage for $13.00 just to be sure. When we came downstairs the next morning at 7:00, there was one sleepy looking clerk on duty, no bellmen, no concierge, no one to talk to. We left at 7:10, parked, walked to the docks, checked in, boat left at 7:55. Room- this was the first rom I have ever paid more than $49 for, that did not have 2 night tables and lamps on both sides of the bed, which is nice if you both want to read. One has light and the other needs a booklight. Come on. I was told we had a balcony. Right. A balconey 18\"deep which was used by former guests as a smoking lounge for their non smoking room. Butts were still there and probably will be there forever. Maid service stops at the curtains. No room for chairs (non available anyway), just a 12\" round table. Found out that the reason our room wasn't big enough for 2 night tables was because of this miserable excuse for a balconey. The room next door with no balconey had 2 night tables ( I looked). The 18\" outside wall indentation for the balconey negated that for us. Pool in the middle of summer was about 90 degrees. Refreshing when the air is 92 with 80% humidity. Shuttel drivers were nice and informative, bed was comfortable and air was good (but NOISY) except that it alternately froze you or your feet when on, or it was deafing with it's silence when off. Plus, as is becoming more common, the hotel charged $10.00/day for parking and added insult to injury by taxing the parking fee an additional 7.5%. I am going to start looking very hard at tese little extra charges. I can understand airlines charging for bags when they are competeing on fares, but parking costs hotels nothing. It is gravy and there is no excuse. Especially when you are already paying 250 per night to stay there as I did on Marco Island. Oh, Room Service, The room across from ours had room service our first night there. Tray was there when we left in the morning for our ferry trip and was still there when we got back that afternoon.

Some evenings when we came back from old town it was too cold to sit outside and the indoor bar was only open at weekends.

First of all, this is a Doubletree and includes all you would expect from this line of hotels, including the fresh, hot, cookie when you check in. This hotel is located on the quiet side of Key West. This island, either the best or second-best known of the Florida Keys, depending on who you ask, has a quiet side (the east) and a loud side (the west), which features Duvall Street and all of the bars, culture, restaurants, and parties that it is known for. Having stayed on both sides, both have their place. This hotel is on the quiet side and it is pretty quiet. It is a big resort with ample facilities. Our room (401) was spacious, clean, comfortable, and offered a view of the water, which was wonderful. It has a very nice and relaxing pool and poolside bar and restaurant which is very convenient and relaxing (you can also get a massage right by the pool in some private tents). To get to most of the Key West attractions, you need to go to the other side of the island. Walking is not ideal as it is a few miles to the festivities. The Doubletree has a shuttle service that leaves every hour for both downtown (two stops, one at the north end of Old Town and one at the south end) and the beach (Smathers Beach, which is the biggest public beach on Key West and home to the normal aquatic adventures of snorkeling, parasailing, etc, - however be advised that Key West is not a beach island; this is a fairly small and fairly crowded beach!). The shuttle is very reliable and the drivers are very friendly and knowledgeable. The only downside is that the Old Town shuttle service has its last pickup to the hotel at 11.20pm so you cannot have too much really late nights. We were there on New Years Eve and they extended this two extra hours so we were able to relax and enjoy the craziness downtown without worrying about getting back.

I was a little worried about the whole \"shuttle thing\" but it was always there on time. The hotel was also available to bring you back and forth to the airport which we took advantage of. Since I was there during Xmas week, Key West was very busy so a car would have been a pain. We were always able to get extra towels when needed and they also were great about letting us take pool towels out of the hotel on our excursions. When we returned we simply gave them back at the front desk. We booked a junior suite, since I was traveling with 2 kids. It was in good condition and had a wonderful terrace overlooking the pool.

The evenings were quiet. The staff was consistently helpful and professional. The food in the retaurant was a bit hit or miss. The conch chowder was wonderful and the shrimp cocktail was excellent. I wasn't as excited about the cobb salad, the hamburger or the breakfasts. That being said, I was in Key West for business and didn't have time to go downtown to eat every night. For people in KW for vacation, I would recommend eating at some of the old town hot spots and probably skip dinner in the hotel restaurant just to make sure you experience as much authentic Key West flavor as possible.

They recommended this hotel on Key West and confirmed we could have 3 separate beds in room for no extra charge. After the first hiccup (below) they were right. We had a 9 hour drive from Orlanda via Tampa to the keys and arrived late at night. We'd booked a room with 3 beds through our travel agents but apparently this had not commuted itself into the hotel's booking system and we found ourselves in a 2 queen bed room overlooking the carpark. We asked the receptionist (who came up with our bags) where the 3rd bed was and was told that due to Fire regulations we weren't allowed a pull-out and that no hotel in KeyWest did 3 beds in a room. We could either pay for another room at $140 a night or pay to upgrade to a suite, or two of us share a bed. Now we're friends but not that friendly! We politely but firmly asked to speak to manager who without quibble said he'd sort it and we should go to the bar (sadly no complimentary drinks). When we went to our room later, a substantial put-up bed had been left standing on one end (and no we weren't charged for the put-up - they wouldn't have dared by that time I think). We had to move and lower bed into position ourselves then phone up again to ask housekeeping for extra pillows, overblanket and towels. Not exactly the kind of welcome we were expecting (although cookies were exceptional). The following day chased the tired blues away - perfect pool, perfect pool service (boy did we make friends with the pool waitress fast!) and seranaded by one man steel band this was exactly what we'd come for. The poolside massage was well worth the $120 and we were so impressed - we never moved from the pool for 2 days. The minibus was great and suited us perfectly - although we went partying - because we work so hard normally - we were actually happy to take the 11.25 shuttle back to hotel at night as we were so tired from fresh air by then. It is under KeyWest airport flight path but the flights weren't intrusive to be annoying during the day (either that or we're just too used to London aircraft noise) and didn't happen at night. Yes hotel food is expensive (although lunch itself was reasonable) and nothing to shout at but there are some lovely restaurants especially around Mallory square which are reasonably priced and great grub. Recommend to do: Champagne sunset cruise on clipper ship, day's snorkelling/kayacking via catamaran, Mallory Square for cabaret when sun sets, drag shows - biggest laugh we had. Tip you wouldn't think of: If going to Ernest Hemingway's house - literally cover your legs in jungle fever or anti-bite cream - I've never been more bitten by cat fleas than when I toured round the house (and as I have 3 cats myself - that's saying something!). Not so hot: Hard Rock Cafe - what atmosphere? Bit lack lustre and so chainstore. Car park charges for the hotel \u00c2\u00a310 a day and we weren't warned about this by travel agent. In fact, we only used our hired car once to go to Everglades - rest of time didn't need it but I thought it was a bit of a cheek to charge for carpark considering it's not in town and the rooms cost enough.

I would stay at this hotel again but next time leave the car and fly from miami airport to key west airport.", "Date": "December 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel in Key West\u201d", "Author": "ufalum90", "ReviewID": "UR22577987", "Content": "Outstanding hotel!

We are big travelers and would hope the the Doubletree brand would take care of this and make us whole. We did not receive what we paid for and that is not right.

It had a good size...not that big though. But ok... The bed was alright, not too great. But the room and the whole Hotel was very clean. There was a quite big and very cold fridge in the room and a comfy TV-Chair. The TV itself was small and very oldschool. But you're not coming to Key West to watch TV anyway... The bathroom was quite small, funny painted but clean. The room had very big windows, so a very bright room (We stayed on the fourth floor). The pool area looked nice. It was pretty much empty all the time. Maybe because they don't have any umrellas! There were a few Cabanas you can stay in, if you need some shade. The pool was nice, but on the first day the water was filled very low, not too great that day. We didn't really stay in the Pool Area anyway. Firstly because we didn't come for that anyway and secondly the pool Area didn't make us feel like laying around. If you wanna enjoy the Beach, Smathers Beach is very close. But the time we went it was very smelly there....and quite brown water. The beach itself was clean with nice white sand. Just for getting some sun it was nice....but not to go swim in the Ocean. The staff in the Hotel was very friendly. Check-In was fast. They have also nice people working at the Pool area and friendly drivers (from the Shuttle). If you come by car like us, you can park your car very close to the Entrance, good if you have lots of luggage. If you're lucky, you might not get charged the usual 10$ parking fee (a day). The hotel provides a free shuttle to Smathers Beach and to Downtown. The last one to go back to the Hotel leaves at 11.20pm. So be there on time, if not you'll have to take a cab. This service was a very big plus!! Altogether we were very happy with our choice. Just the Pool area wasn't really great, and swimming in the Ocean not really an option too.

Although we usually like to stay in Old Town, this was the only resort available with rates that were reasonable (at least for Key West!). Upon arrival, the front porch that runs the length of the lobby was a very nice welcoming, lined with rocking chairs and lush foilage. Check in was a breeze, and up we went to our room, which was a King. The room was very nice, done up in a \"Key West\" color scheme (yellows, blues, and white), and the bathroom was a very nice size. There was also a small couch and table for relaxing, and our room overlooked some of the new condos on the Atlantic side. The pool was located outside of the lobby, down a wide flight of stairs. It was very large, very nice, and there were plenty of lounge chairs available for the guests. There were also some cabanas at the far end of the pool for those who like a little break from the sun. At the top of the stairs is a very nice and well-stocked pool bar, and there are waiters and waitresses walking around should you need a drink while you are at the pool. The Doubletree also offers shuttle service to town, as parking there is at a premium, and if you do happen to find a lot with an empty spot, they charge you out of the ying yang to park there. One bad thing about the shuttles is that everyone is waiting around for it, and despite who was there first, people push and shove their way on board. The good thing is that they have a back-up shuttle if there are far too many people. They will drop you at Smather's Beach or at the Conch Republic (near Mallory Square), but the other down-side is that the last shuttle runs around 11:00 p.m., so if you want to stay in town longer, you will need to take a cab back. The shuttle is free, except for the driver's tip. We did not eat lunch or dinner there, but we did eat breakfast out on the veranda that overlooks the pool, and the food was quite good, with excellent service and moderate prices.

There is an hourly shuttle though. --Housekeeping staff were pretty bad. Took them a long time to get the room done, they twice left cleaning supplies behind and didn't actually finish cleaning the room, and they were seen regularly just hanging out in the hallways gabbing. --The restaurant is mediocre at best, but priced high (as is everything on Key West it seems). Breakfast is a bit weak, and the upgrade from continental to full gives you just two things - powdered eggs and bacon. --The resort does not have its own beach, it shares one with other resorts - but the concierge said that because of its location, its constantly overrun with seaweed and not a great beach.

The only positive was the shuttle that runs on the hour to downtown Key West. And the hotel security responded pretty quickly when I complained of a major party next door at 2am (spring break!).

The choice of booking at the Doubletree was made as I found a great rate on their website - I figured being away from downtown was worth the saving on the room rate I made. Having never stayed in a Doubletree hotel I was not sure what to expect. When I arrived at the property I wasn't disappointed. The exterior looked to be in good condition and there was ample car parking available close to the entrance. The checkin desk was well staffed, and the personnel very helpful in providing me with my welcome cookies, room key and some complimentary water. I was given an upgraded room for my stay. This had a small balcony and a view of the pool deck. The room itself was a reasonable size, clean and had the usual selection of hotel literature and gadgets. One thing I did notice was that the decor in the room was a little tired in places - with a few scuff marks on the door and walls. The beds and furniture, however, were well presented. Owing to the late arrival time, I opted to have dinner in the hotel restaurant which was pretty much empty at the time I visited (around 10pm). I don't recall what I had to eat, but it was reasonably well presented and seemed to offer good value for the price paid. The food wasn't outstanding, but it wasn't disappointing either. The hotel shuttle service was excellent, and really made getting to the heart of Key West easy. The timing of the shuttles was also quite good, with hourly departures for much of the day. A word of warning - be careful to board the right shuttle - 1 goes downtown whilst the other goes to the beach club! I didn't realise this and ended up at the beach club on the first morning! Overall I was pleased with my choice of accommodation for my trip to Key West.

I am a Silver HHonors member. _____ Overview: This is my second stay at the Grand Key but my review will only focus on our most recent stay. I was very impressed with the package we selected (Honeymoon Package @ $309 a night) and the staff could not have been any more friendlier. Overall, I recommend this resort for your stay in Key West. If you want a place away from the action and actually want a good night's rest, this is the perfect hotel on the island that never sleeps. _____ Pros: As I had a choice this time around to stay at the Grand Tree or the Westin Resort, I decided to stick with the Grand Tree. Price was not a factor as we are still in our honeymoon stage, and I'm very glad we stayed with this hotel. Note that the Westin can range in price from $250-$1,100, while the Grand Tree ranged from $164-$380. - Hotel was beautiful inside and out and very clean - The wait staff was excellent and the front desk were all very attentive to our needs (water pressure too low and there was no hot water...each was taken care of promptly) - The cookies...yes the cookies are excellent! Warm and chewy...I want another one! - Bellmen (when they were there) were all very nice and courteous...offered to help with bags and opened doors. They even hold your baggage when you check out so you can go around the island for a bit before you leave - Concierge was very helpful and friendly and helped us with our package deal (we got a Sunset Champagne Cruise and 2-hour guided Kayak) and even helped us book for a Dolphin Sightseeing/Snorkel adventure (highly worth it!!! we had a blast!) - The food at their Palm Haven Restaurant was actually exceptionally good!!! Our package had a free buffet breakfast for each of us and also a 3-course dinner for two every night. Now, it is very pricey to eat there, but that's what made the hotel package worth it. The seafood was superb and the two-person cheese fondue appetizer was to die for. I had chicken marsala one night and NY strip the other. They were very tasty and excellent. The desserts were fabulously presented and tasted good. The breakfast buffet was lacking, but I was very surprised at dinner. - The free transportation to Duval Street courtesy of their shuttle was a welcoming break from the long drive (we drove about 7 hours). The island is relatively small - 4x2 miles, but walking in the hot sun can get exhausting. - The bed was very comfortable and the comforter was welcoming since my husband likes to have the thermostat down to 60 every night. The room was spacious and the bathroom was a decent size. - There is no ocean view, but we did have a lovely pool view from our balcony. A very scenic garden surrounded the pool area. - There was nightly music playing at the bar and most of the time people were dancing away _____ Cons: We really enjoyed our stay and there wasn't that many cons during our stay, but I don't understand why they call this hotel a \"resort\" because it is not one at all. The name can be slightly misleading, so be sure to understand that this is not a resort at all. There are no shops and only 2 restaurants. - $10/day for parking...but we weren't charged for it, either way I hate paying for parking so this goes in the con section. :) - There really wasn't bell service. It was a hit or miss, so plan on carrying your luggage up to the front desk and to your room. This wasn't a problem for us as we only had three bags, but I can see this as being a nuisance for people who 'expect' to have bell service. - Our room didn't have any water pressure nor hot water, but this was quickly taken care of by the front desk. I only listed it here so you could see that there was a slight inconvenience during our stay - While the restaurant had excellent service and wait staff during the dinner hours, the breakfast buffet was nothing over the top. It was very basic with scrambled eggs and sausages, with bacon and ham as well as grits and oatmeal. They also had watermelon, a few pastries, cereal and french toast. The breakfast food was ok. The prices were absurd ($11 for breakfast buffet), as our dinner prices each night with tax and gratuity came out to $124, $116 and $132. Luckily, we didn't pay for it because of our honeymoon package. I think we got a steal on this one. - Not really a con for us, but I can see it being a con for people who like to be \"in the middle of the action.\" The hotel is located opposite of where all the action on Duval street takes place. You do need to take a shuttle if you don't want to walk (I don't recommend driving, you'll spend hours searching for a parking spot) and the beach is located about 1 mile down the road. We didn't mind it at all because 1.) Key West is not the best place for swimming 2.) Who wants to hear rowdy and drunk people yelling and screaming with bands playing at 4 AM? Not me, I'd like my sleep. But if you want to be right near Duval Street, then this isn't the hotel for you. _____ Recommend? I recommend staying here if you actually want to get some sleep away from the action of Duval St. It gets really loud and rowdy especially once the sun sets, so if you need shuteye I highly recommend staying here. Even when we were visiting Westin Resort (which is about one block away from Duval) the noise was so loud we were glad we weren't staying at the Westin. The sevice was exceptionally friendly and they were very courteous and nice. Not once did we run into an impolite staff...and even the maids said hello and asked if we were enjoying ourselves. The cheaper rooms are a good deal if you don't plan on eating at the hotel and you plan on spending most of your time in town drinking and visiting the shops. We opted for the honeymoon package because it took care of a few things we wanted to do. We got a passport package (lets you visit several of the attractions for free) as well as the sunset cruise and kayaking. It also took care of breakfast and dinner for us and let us take care of lunch. Overall the value we spent would have been the same amount or more if we decided to book them all separate. Once again I don't know why they call it a resort, but if you want a place to sleep that's away from all the noise then I recommend this hotel for you. The courtesy shuttle is a nice way to go especially if you are going to town to hit bars. You don't need to find a designated driver! I hope my review helped. If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me, I love staying at hotels and making it a pact to review each one I stay at.

For a family, The Doubletree was a delight and a bargain. Many Key West devotees insist that you MUST stay in the heart of town, but Doubletree's FREE shuttle was actually fun to ride, so that whole argument seemed a non-issue to me. Coming back to the calm hotel felt good to me after being squeezed up with hundreds of Hemingway impersonators at Sloppy Joes. BTW there is no hidden resort fee that makes up for the free shuttle. The shuttle ran every 20 minutes like clockwork, and the driver was a wellspring of information about Key West. The hotel is meticulously clean with a nice airy island feel; the pool area and bar offer plenty of fun, and the concierges were most helpful. Many posters insisted that for my price range ($150 per night) I needed to stay at The Southernmost Hotel since it is in the heart, but honestly I thought it looked a bit run down and certainly lacked the amenities of The Doubletree. I was also freaked out about all this talk of cats all over the place (I saw more roosters), so I absolutely did not want to run the risk of being in any place that had a cat on the premises (sorry both dh and I are allergic). There truly is a dizzying array of types of accomodations in Key West, so I hope this helps someone in the same boat that I was in while choosing a hotel.", "Date": "August 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cLoved it, so relaxing!!\u201d", "Author": "ArieTheNetherlands", "ReviewID": "UR8356737", "Content": "As i use Tripadvisor a lot myself i rather write a review too.

I stay in hotels just about every week of the year and most often, Hilton properties. First off, this is not a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcresort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as I found most places in Key West like to call themselves. It is a hotel with a pool! Nothing more, nothing less. Upon check in, the staff was very unfriendly and not helpful at all. As I mentioned before, my stay was free because I was using Hilton points. They claimed I had to show a certificate to get my stay. No big deal, but they were in no way helpful to help me find that certificate #. They told me to call the Hilton line and have them fax it over. Still not a huge deal, just a bit of an inconvenience. The Hilton line says it happens all the time but the hotel will usually call them to get things squared away. Not at the Grand Key Resort though. It delayed my check in about 45 minutes and if it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for me getting it done for them, I would have been waiting for 2 hours to check in. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a case of them checking me in so my wife could relax in the room while we sorted things out, it was both of us waiting until it was complete. Not exactly what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d call accommodating a guest. Next, the hotel lounge was closed four of the five nights we were there. The outside tiki bar was open, but if you wanted to sit inside and enjoy a few cocktails, you were out of luck. Again, not a huge deal unless it is rainy or cool out which it was, so who wants to sit outside. In other words, if you were not downtown, you could enjoy a cold beverage, but in the comfort of your room. The food\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.the food was marginal at best. Slow service and with servers standing around talking rather than waiting on customers. This is certainly not how you run a restaurant. With only 2 other tables dining, it took us 20 minutes before our server said a word to us. An hour later, we had our food. As far as good things, the hotel concierge was very good as were the bartenders they had outside. Very nice and knowledgeable. The rooms were clean and the hotel was in good shape. The shuttle service was also very good. They ran on time and they did a great job. It seems the management and staff are the issue here. Quick and polite service should be a given when paying what they ask at the DoubleTree Grand Key Resort. In conclusion, I do travel a lot and I do consider myself a good judge of food and service. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find my experience to be very good anywhere in Key West. Basically, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect repeat business out of their customers, and therefore they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put much effort into food or service. If I were a manager at this resort or any restaurants in Key West, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d sent the crew down to Mexico to a resort and have them shadow their people for a day or two to figure out what the service industry is supposed to be like. It may come off as a bit harsh but I call it like I see it. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not a very experienced traveler, it may be just fine for you. But if you feel that you should get what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paying for, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend staying closer to Duval Street at one of the local Bed & Breakfast spots. We talked to several couples that had done that and paid less than $200 per night. The only thing you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be missing out on would be the pool. If that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not important to you, stay somewhere else. Key West would be a great time if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on a Cruise ship and stopping in for the day, but for an extended stay, go somewhere where they will appreciate your business.", "Date": "April 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Port Charlotte, Florida", "Title": "\u201cWill never stay here again\u201d", "Author": "Portcharlottefl", "ReviewID": "UR7428018", "Content": "Check in was a horrible experience.

I am afraid perhaps that some people on here may expect too much of the casual, laid back environment they are visiting in Key West.

We had booked two rooms. We chose the Doubletree in Key West, rather than staying closer to the Square, because of the baby, and because, in my experience, staying on this end of the Key provides larger accommodations. The experience started off rocky, with some miscommunication about the reservation upon check-in. That, coupled with a screaming child and lost luggage (American Airlines) combined for a tense check-in process, to put it mildly. I'm sure I was not a pleasant consumer. However, to their credit, the staff at Doubletree rallied to provide excellent service and remedy for all of our real, and perceived, harms. Chris, an assistant supervisor on the night shift, provided a pitcher of milk for the baby (back-up formula in the lost luggage), soda for the mom and beer for me, gratis. Toiletries and anything they could think of was provided to us immediately. Comps for drinks and breakfast were provided for the first part of the stay. And throughout our week at the hotel, the staff continued to check-in on us to make sure that our vacation would end-up being what we had envisioned it to be. Rhonda and Vanessa were excellent as well. The hotel manager, who makes a mean conch chowder, even personally checked in on us and provided my mother with a comped sunset sail. The pool is very nice, with an \"entry ramp\" on the one entire end, which makes up for there being no baby pool. The hotel has a shuttle which will take you back and forth to downtown on the hour and makes a car unnecessary. We used the shuttle everyday and found it convenient and timely. Smathers beach is an easy mile and a half walk out the front entrance on new sidewalks (beginning of March they were still fixing the sidewalks, so a little dusty). For us, if we travel with the baby again to Key West, it would be a no-brainer to stay at the Doubletree. As a side note, I did hear from some of the staff that there were \"new changes\" recently to management.

The hotel was dong everything the could to help everyone staying at the hotel. They were trying to find other hotels for all the guest to stay at.

They were handing out tickets and if your number was called or somebody that was near your room you were aloud to go. The fire department only had 2 carbon monoxide monitors.

We were a little concerned as our flight arrived a little pass 2pm and check in time at the Double Tree is not until 4pm. We were lucky our room was ready and we were able to check in right away. Check in went nice and smooth. EXCEPT.. Don't forget to ask for your chocholate chip cookie. He didn't give us ours and I had to ask for them. They were yummy and nice and warm!! We were checked into room 411. There are only 4 floors in this hotel. Our room was very clean and had a king bed. We had a balcony room that overlooked the side parking lot, the million dollar condos, and across the way in the distance you could see some water. The room was average size. Roomy enough for my husband and I. Bed was very comy. The only complaint that I had about the room is the noisy a/c. Every time it kicked on it made a loud noise. The hotel was quite at night, excpet for we heard some drunk people come back into there rooms at 4am yelling all the way down the hall and laughing and giggling. That was to be expected as we were traveling during Key Wests Annual Fantasy Fest. We saw a lot of guests at the hotel dressed up in there costumes heading for town. If you have young children keep them in the rooms after dark. Some of these guests were barely wearing anything!!!! The next day our room was cleaned with no problems. I read on here that some guests had problems not getting there room cleaned. We went to town and when we came back that afternoon our room was cleaned. The hotel has a shuttle that also goes to the beach area (we didn't go to the beach). Heard it was small and not very clean there. The shuttle also goes to town with two stops one at the Conch Republic Resturant and the other at the end of Duval street. The shuttle can't stop there so it is actually a few blocks away from Duval but, within walking distance. We always got off at the first stop the Conch Republic. The shuttle leaves the hotel at the hour and does it picks up 20 after the hour. We never had a problem getting the shuttle to town or getting the shuttle back to the hotel from town. The hotel has a computer room (very small). There are two computers that guests may use at no charge to surf the internet and check emails from. There is a sign that says 15 minutes if guests are waiting. Some lady was in there basically all day and night. We just checked our mail and printed out directions to go somewhere. The pool area is very nice. It's big and there are a few cabanas that they have that you can use. My husband and I sat in one and read our books. The pool is nice, but very COLD!!! I only put my feet in and that was it. We ate lunch and had a few drinks at the pool bar. The service was good as was the food. It is expensive, but worth it. My husband and I shared a meal. The check out went smoothly. No problems. We asked for a shuttle back to the airport as we needed to pick up our rental car to head up to Key Largo. The shuttle took us to the airport right away.

We arrived around 1:30 p.m. We checked-in but were told that our room would not be ready for an hour. I asked about paying extra for an upgraded room, but was told that none were available even though I saw upgraded rooms available on the internet. I told them our car was parked outside and they said that was fine. We took the shuttle into town and when we came back, we checked into our room (clean and functional but very small). Later, as I was passing by the front desk, I heard a different clerk instructing an incoming guest to put a pass on their dashboard. I walked over and mentioned that I was also parked outside but the previous desk clerk hadn't said anything about a pass. This clerk gave me a pass and said that it was very important to have it on the dashboard or the car could be towed. Wow, I'm glad I heard him giving the pass to someone else so that my car wasn't missing the next morning. I also noticed other clerks giving breakfast vouchers and the famous chocolate chip cookies everyone receives upon check-in. Apparently, along with the parking pass, our clerk had also forgotten to give us our breakfast passes and our cookies. The next day at breakfast, we were seated and waited about 5 minutes and finally just went and helped ourselves to the breakfast buffet. After another few minutes, I approached a waiter about getting coffee and juice and, before I could say anything, he asked if we wanted our check. I said no, that nobody had ever even come to our table. He said he would send our waitress and, even then, it took another 5 minutes for her to come over. Later, we took the shuttle to the beach (Doubletree apparently has control of a sliver of beach just off the main road -- the beach is nicer if you walk out of the Doubletree area). The shuttle is supposed to pick up at 10 before the hour so at 15 before the hour, we were heading to the shuttle area only to see the shuttle speeding away 5 minutes earlier than scheduled. We called the hotel and rather than radioing the shuttle driver to turn around (he had only been gone 2 minutes at this point, and it was still prior to his scheduled departure time), the hotel said they would send somebody else out to get us. It took about 30 minutes more in the hot sun before the second shuttle showed up. Then we got back to our room, from which we had been gone for 5 hours, only to discover that it hadn't been cleaned. I called Housekeeping and was told that we were supposed to leave a card indicating our preferred room cleaning time. Sorry, I hadn't seen the card when we entered the room and I've always found hotels just clean the room in the morning when the guest is away.

We are fussy, four-star or better hotel people. The Doubletree met our standards. The rooms are a little on the small side, but no one goes to Key West to stay in the room anyway. In the more important areas the rooms were exceptionally clean, especially for a property near the water. The linens were crisp and new, and the maid service was prompt and thorough. Everything worked in the room; although we did have to call to have the light fixture above the vanity repaired. The balcony is small, probably not much wider than a couple of feet, but again, why would you sit on a balcony in Key West? The convenience of the small refrigerator was particularly useful as we were traveling with baby and toddler. The hotel is well-constructed so the rooms are generally quiet. Although we rarely do laundry while traveling, an emergency with the children found us looking for laundry facilities. They were conveniently located on the second floor and were in pristine condition. The hotel staff was courteous and well-informed. The children in our party were particularly impressed wth the huge salt-water acquarium located in the lobby, and the cookies, delivered warm at check-in, were a hit with everyone. I noted complaints about beach conditions with other reviews. Those going to Key West for the first time should understand that it is not a \"beach experience\" location. If you want beaches go north of Miami, or even better do the Gulf of Mexico beaches near Ft. Meyers north to St. Petersburg. Even better beaches are near Panama City, Destin and Pensacola. In Key West the water activities involve deep sea fishing, snorkling, scuba diving, moonlight cruises and personal water craft. You can spend time wandering the historical sites around town, and even browse the local \"tourist traps\". Actually there are many art galleries where the displays are somewhat impressive. Just do not schedule a day at the beach because you will be disappointed. We did not use the shuttle service, but we never left the hotel without seeing it in the process of picking up guests so we assume it operates consistently. The $10 parking charge is quite ridiculous, and seems cheap and low-class given the room rates at the hotel. We just do not expect to pay to park unless we are in a urban area where space is at a minimum. We did not eat at the hotel, but we never eat in hotels. There are fantastic places to dine in Key West, and one shouldn't miss a single opportunity to enjoy Key West cuisine by eating a mediocre room-service meal. One word of advice...we had a power outage of about two and one-half hours on the second night. We always travel with small flashlights for just such occasions, but I would be very sure to include one when traveling to Key West because we understand that power outages are not uncommon when the power is delivered all the way down to the island from the mainland. I would surely stay at the Doubletree again; although the $200/night rate will limit our visits.

The restaurant in the hotel seemed nice (too nice for young kids in my opinion so we didn't feel comfortable eating on the premises). Instead, we opted to go into town to eat at Turtle Kraals, and were pleasantly satisfied (portions were on the small side but flavor was very good and prices were ok, and kids were not out-of-place there). So, overall, this hotel was nice and I would probably stay there again, but next time I go to Key West I will first call around and try for a different hotel because I think there are better ones.", "Date": "June 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Rooms": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, FL", "Title": "\u201cJust fine, nothing out of this world\u201d", "Author": "LenaMari", "ReviewID": "UR5365665", "Content": "We stayed at the Doubletree with our Hilton points and after having read some of the awful reviews I was really quite worried. As it turned out, our stay was quite pleasant and relaxing: our room clean, the bed comfortable and the little service we needed was provided and was fine. I was under the impression that our room would have a balcony but it did not and that was a bit of a let down - it was just a sliding glass door with a rail which over looked the parking lot. However, it was a very quiet room. The $10/a day parking did not bother us perhaps because we come from an area where parking always costs. There is the free shuttle but we always just drove into Duval Street which is a 5 or 7 minute drive away. You will need plenty of change for the meters and they do ticket, which again, we're used to so no big deal. We never had a problem finding parking but then we are usually on the opposite schedule of most people who do not have young children and we were also there during the low season. As we were vacationing with our 15 month old son, we used the pool area quite often and it was pleasant though not quite as beautiful as the photographs would indicate. We did drive over to Smather's Beach but having grown up going to the Keys I was not expecting much. Upon arrival we turned right around and went back to the pool. Honestly, the Keys are not known for their spectacular beaches and this beach though groomed just had a lot of seaweed in the swimming area - not the hotel's fault. The outdoor dining area and bar was lovely (especially when dining with a child), however, the food was absolutely unimaginative, did not seem fresh, was quite pricey for the low quality and was really simply terrible! I realize there are many choices on Duval street but upon a 4pm check-in and a dip in the pool, eating dinner at the hotel seemed the most convenient thing to do and we never thought it would be so awful. The mahi-mahi (which is sooo easily caught in S.Florida) seemed to have been frozen for a decade and had absolutely no taste - their lack of salt and pepper on the fish and at the table certainly did not help. The tropical chicken was so overspiced that it made one wonder if they were trying to hide a fowl taste. Needless to say, that was the first and last meal we had from the hotel. For parents with babies: it is hard to get a straight answer regarding their cribs. What they have is a regular metal crib (with rounded hollow metal bars) but it is about 3/4 the size of a regular home crib, it is okay if your child is 9 months or less. Also, the mattress is similar to those flimsy bassinet mattresses, it is not a thick crib style mattress. Our child wound up sleeping with us as the crib seemed a bit small for him (also knowing how much he moves at night, we realized he'd be waking up quite a bit otherwise). The room does have a refrigerater and has enough space to store a half gallon container of milk which was quite helpful but did not have the microwave we were promised. FYI: the T.V. is bolted down and though it swivles to the right and left you cannot get to the back of it making it impossible to attach a portable DVD player to it. If you were hoping to do so for your child you will need an alternative. In summary, our vacation turned out great. The hotel was fine, nothing out of this world but, aside from the food, not terrible. I would stay there again with Hilton points but I would certainly not pay $250 for a room.", "Date": "June 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carrara, Australia", "Title": "\u201cMixed feelings about this hotel\u201d", "Author": "Sheryll", "ReviewID": "UR5330328", "Content": "After staying at the Double Tree in Naples we were looking forward to our two nights at Key West.

The Buffett breakfast was reasonable. They provided free shuttle into Key West and complimentary drink vouchers for a bar on the water in Key West. Wonderful service from the driver. Really enjoyed the fact that they gave you access to their beach club. The shuttle bus took you down to the beach (More like a lake) and complimentary deck chairs, umbrellas and towels were provided.

The hotel grounds, pool, lobby, restaurant were clean and well maintained. However, the nice surroundings couldn't make up for their staff's attitude of indifference, no service at all and in one case rudeness. Upon our arrival in the late afternoon, there was no one to help with baggage because a wedding party was about to depart on a bus. The front desk told us that all staff was busy with the wedding and we could either wait or bring it in ourselves. I was unable to carry the luggage up the flight of stairs to the lobby so I had to wait. I do want to mention that the young man who did eventually help us after 30 minutes did apologize and refused to accept a tip. He was definitely the exception at this hotel. A card is left on your bed asking what time you want your room cleaned and it will be picked up during the night. The room did not get cleaned until 5pm. So the next two days I left the card asking for 9am service. The housekeeper tells me on the 3rd day that she realizes that I am leaving the card for early service but that she doesn't see the card until she gets there at 5pm. That leaves us without clean towels to shower with after being at the pool or beach. The housekeeper was in the room around 4:30 - 5pm every day when we expected to be showering and getting ready to go out to dinner. The card is a joke. I've never stayed at hotel when my room was cleaned at 5pm. To make it worse, the housekeepers were in 1 room next to ours all day almost every day. It made us wonder why it took so long for that one room or if they waited there all day and then rushed doing the rooms at the end of the day. We were without towels twice, because they were behind in the laundry and we had to come back in the late evening to the desk to get some. Our room reservation was also incorrect. When I made the reservations, I was quoted a price for a King room with a balcony overlooking the pool. When I arrived, I received two doubles overlooking the parking lot and the rate was $5 higher. I only had a reservation number and nothing in writing from the hotel so I could not prove what had been told to me over the phone. So this was my fault and was willing to accept it, but when I asked to them to at least honor the rate the desk clerk called someone from the back out who said \"you are on your own\". She said this several times after each time I explained why I was quoted that rate. This was in reference to the group rate we had for a wedding we were there for. I knew that my personal rate was my responsibility and not the brides but when I booked the room for extra days they gave me the same rate since we were with the wedding party. Yes it was only $5/day difference and was not that big of a deal. But as a customer service measure, it would not have hurt this hotel to give me a $30 credit rather than argue with me rudely in the lobby. So I didn't get the room I booked and paid more money than I thought. You know I could have spent that $30 in the restaurant or bar but she wasn't going to bend an inch. Several wedding groups were there the same week as we were. A notice in the lobby was posted welcoming each group except ours. The only difference I knew of was that our reception was at a restaurant in town instead of the hotel. Again, this small gesture of welcoming our group wouldn't have cost them a thing and would have made everyone feel special. Also on two occasions in the restaurant we couldn't find anyone for more than 20 min. Once we waited 20 minutes after eating to pay our bill. The 2nd time after waiting 20 minutes for our bill we got up and left and went to our room to get a few things before going out. We stopped back by the restaurant to try to pay our bill and they hadn't even realized we left without paying. Our waitress did apologize after we explained that we had left without paying for 2 bagels and a coffee. Noise level in adjoining rooms was poor, we could hear what people were saying and they had young children who cried and ran through the room. The front desk staff acted as if they didn't care if we were there or not. When you go to a resort you are usually paying a premium for the hotel and expect good to great service.

The hotel was very clean and the staff very friendly. I made the reservations using my Hilton points, in which a standard room is usually given. Upon arrival we were given a free upgrade to a superior room. I thought the room was on the small side, especially for the 4 of us. There wasn't much in the way of closet or drawer space. There was an armoire that held the tv and had 4 small drawers below, and two closet cabinets on each side. On one side there was an iron & ironing board taking up some of the space. Opposite the sink area was a counter and below it was the mini-bar. The refrigerator had a variety of beverages available for purchase and there was plenty of room to keep your own food/drinks, which we did. Next to the fridge was a cupboard with some snacks. I think there was a lot of wasted space, since they spread out the snacks in a row and there was nothing behind them. There was a small balcony overlooking the pool area. I don't think I have ever seen a balcony so small. It was only about 3-4 feet wide, just barely the width of the Adirondack chairs and little table provided. It was a tight squeeze and I worried about dropping something over the edge everytime I moved. Speaking of the pool, the first night the water was perfect, nice and warm. The next 2 nights the water was cold, maybe the heater was having problems, as others have mentioned. I had a laugh over their idea of a waterfall. On their website they describe the pool as having a waterfall. It was only about 12 inches high. There also was a whirlpool to relax in, and a volleyball court. Unfortunately, sand from the volleyball court, got tracked into the pool area and made it look dirty. A bar was not too far from the pool, and a waitress came around to take orders. The only meal we had at the hotel was breakfast. They had a buffet setup or you could order from the menu. We opted for the \"cold\" side of the buffet, since this was included with our room. The muffins, breads and other pastries were a little on the dry side. There was fruit salad, cereals, toast, bagels. I peeked at the hot side of the buffet, but didn't think it was worth the extra $4 they charged, especially since I don't eat meat. They had eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage and biscuits and gravy. The waitstaff was very attentive. On our last day there, we needed to leave early and asked to have our meals to go. The waitresses bent over backwards to put our food together and have us on our way. The shuttle was a good way to get around, as long as you're a little flexible and not in a rush. In the morning, there was plenty of seats, though later when we went out to dinner, the bus was packed and I think a couple of people didn't get on. On your return trip, be sure to get to the pick up points early. Once we missed the shuttle by a minute or two, though our watches said otherwise. One night the shuttle arrived full at Duval Square, but a few minutes later a second shuttle arrived. The only problem we had was our 2nd day there. We had been out all day, came back around 3, and the room had not been made up. Around 4:15 the maid came by, but I had to ask her to come back later because we had just been down to the pool and needed to change. The next day, I used the door hanger with \"Please make up room\", and the room was cleaned before we returned for the day. We had a great time in Key West and I'm ready to go back.

The good things: The pool area was wonderful. The poolside massage was excellent. The general d\u00c3\u00a9cor and atmosphere of the hotel was great. They have 2 computers with internet access which is free (a must when traveling with teenagers!) They have a fitness room. The beds were very comfortable. The cold breakfast buffet for $6 was a good deal. Free shuttle service to the airport and the downtown area. The beach club had complimentary chairs, umbrellas and towels for the guests. Shuttle service to get there is free. The beach is pretty and offers watersports. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go for a swim though. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shallow and full of seaweed. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great for sunbathing, but not much else. (Key West is not known for its beaches. If that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going, change your plans and head to Maui.) Our disappointments: The food in the restaurant is not very good. There aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any other places to eat within walking distance. (There is a grocery \u00c2\u00bd block away that has some food, and Big John\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pizza delivers to the hotel and is very good.) The fitness room should be bigger. There are only 5 pieces of equipment in addition to the weight machine. 1 of the treadmills was broken the entire time I was there. This is their busiest week of the year. I had to wait to use it on several occasions. Also, the water cooler in the fitness room was empty and it took 2 days for them to replace it. There is no excuse for that. The room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t kept very clean either. The free internet access was also located in the fitness room. Often it would be crowded in there with people who weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even there to work out. They should put the computers in the lobby or something. The pool was not heated. The heater was broken during the recent hurricane. They have my sympathy for that, but I heard a lot of people complaining that the pool was too cold. My biggest gripe\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.the shuttle service. Yes, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free. They have 2 buses. Again, this is the busiest time of the year and the hotel was sold out. It was a battle to get a seat on the bus. Often we would have to wait for another. They only ran every hour. They should have been running the buses non-stop at this time of year. There was one driver who was very unhelpful. Though there were bars on the bus to accommodate standing passengers, one particular driver would not accept standing passengers. People were left to wait a long time for another bus, or to take an expensive taxi. They need to expand and improve their shuttle service and replace the one unpleasant driver. The shuttle service also did not run early in the morning, so on the several occasions where we had to be at the Marina at 7:00 am we had to take a very expensive taxi ride. My favorite part of Key West was Conch Harbor and the dining there. Worthwhile excursions: Dry Tortugas on the Yankee Freedom and Deep Sea fishing on a \u00c2\u00bd day charter (I caught a 40 lb Mahi Mahi). Both were expensive but totally worth it. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget to visit the Hemingway House. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a must see. Best part of the trip?

We called the housekeeper, she came and asked us if we would like to have some fresh air and that the problem was probably due to the Air conditionning that was not working. We had 2 guys comming to repair, while they were repairing they noticed the carpet was wet and the smell came from there. After an other 2 hours of waiting the answer was clear, the aircon was repaired but the smell will remain. Finally after a few round trips from the room to the lobby we got a new room. That one was okay and did not have that nasty smell. Unfortunatly on our second night, we had a power loss due to the hurricane Katerina that hit the hotel.

The rooms are average, the carpet was worn, and the towels scratchy. Yes, they offer fancy soaps and shampoos, but that doesn't really make the place luxury. They gave me a room next to housekeeping, so I heard lots of yelling in Spanish early in the morning, and the housekeeping carts were stored right in front of my room. They also vacuumed the hallways at 11 PM each night. The bed was very comfy; however, with the all-white sheets, I noticed hairs and threads that were not mine, so it only highlighted the possible cleanliness issues. Service was terrible, from a rude operator on the phone when I made the reservation, to an unanswered e-mail that I sent them, to the front desk who wouldn't move me to a room away from housekeeping. Sure, they give you some cookies so you don't feel so bad, but they're basically pretty rude. There wasn't even a \"thank you\" when I checked out. The whole parking thing was a joke. I knew about the fee, so I'm not going to say it was a hidden charge or anything, but lots of local people crash the pool by sneaking in through the gate near the parking lot. And I'm 100% sure they don't pay the $10 parking fee. Not only that, there was tons of parking available, so I don't really know why they had to charge extra for it. The pool itself was nasty. Very dirty, and full of locals who are the type to crash a private pool. Meaning, they left their trash all over the place, hogged rows of chairs that they didn't use, and took up lots of space. I found a used Pampers underneath the lounge chair where I was sitting. In general, people that pay to stay at a Doubletree don't want to hang out with locals who crash the hotel by sneaking in through the back door. And sitting out at the \"Beach Club\" was really not an option due to the intense smell on the beach. Yes, I know that's not the hotel's fault, but if the beach isn't an option, then maybe they should clean up the pool area and stop the locals from crashing. Or, maybe they should just advertise it as a local pool so that Doubletree guests wouldn't be disappointed.

And if the truth was known I paid just as much for my room as the other guests. Our room was ok, except for the fact that we had four tiny drawers for three guests. Needless to say we practically lived out of our suitcase for six days. I found the front desk clerks to be very rude, especially the front desk manager. Our room was infested with ants and the pool is overcroweded due to the fact that they allow locals and offer scuba diving lessons to anyone on the island so at several times during the day it was was rather hard to swim around a bunch of air tanks. Oh, and be careful of the t.v. My daughter had on a channel that offered music. After 90 seconds, it automatically bills your room, and in no way are they going to take that $11.50 charge off your bill. The restaurant was very slow and very expensive. Plan on spending at least an hour there and expect to tip bigtime, even the towel guy at the pool. The shuttle was extremely crowded and more times than none you will end up standing. There are other hotels that have better service and more friendly staff for the money. There is nothing on that side of the island so you are more or less at their mercy by eating there.

We spent 10 days traipsing throughout the sunshine state, with stops in Orlando, Fort Lauderdale and a final stop in Key West. We were travelling with 4 rambuctious boys, and I was eager to get out of the car and into a relaxing hotel room. When we arrived at the Doubletree Grand Key Resort, I was pleasantly suprised with the sense of calm that came over me as I entered the lobby. However that feeling soon vanished, when I found out that my husband had only booked one room and we were a party of six! The hotel did not have any adjoining rooms available so we decided to upgrade to a suite. We were told that the suite would accomodate us just fine. I was shocked to find that their version of a suite was not what I had imagined. our suite was little more than 2 adjoing rooms. One room contained a king sized bed, while the other room had a sleeper sofa and a loveseat. The only bathroom was in the bedroom. Try to imagine 4 boys and 2 adults taking turns in the shower every morning. We barely made it to breakfast because it took so long for everyone to get ready. The sleeping arrangements were also very humorous. I woke up one morning to find 2 of the boys sleeping on the pull out bed while my other son slept on the loveseat, and the youngest boy was asleep underneath the pull out, on top of the sofa cushions. I'm probably the only one who cared. The kids had a great time in Key west, and other than the quaint accomodations, I thoroughly enjoyed the resort and the island. The pool area was fantastic. The pool was heated and it stayed open late. At night we would all go down to the pool and hang out untill we were ready to pass out. During the day the hotel offered massages in the cabanas that were located poolside. They also have a poolside bar which my husband and I enjoyed a little more than we should have. The snacks that were served were reasonably priced and the hotel also offered a free shuttle bus to Smather's Beach, where you can rent kayaks and do many other water related activities. Key West is a wonderful place to take your family on vacation. The weather was a balmy 80 degrees everyday and there were plenty of activites to keep our kids busy. We went down to Duval street and ate some very good food followed by even better dessert. You have to get one of those giant cookies and the world famous key lime pie. We all gained at least 5 pounds before leaving Key West, but it was all worth it. My husband and I were a little worried about taking our kids to Key West, we'd heard that it wasn't exactly the most kid friendly place to go, but it turned out to be a very good choice. The water activites were the main attractions. We booked a snorkel tour down at the end of Duval St. The tour was 3 hours long and cost approx $25 for adults and $12 for kids. We travelled out to Sand Key where we saw an amazing variety of tropical fish, beautiful coral, and we also had the pleasure of seeing a school of Atlantic Dophins. We kayaked at Smather's Beach and we jet skied around the island. Every night at sunset a party was held in the square downtown. The Grand Key Resort was located about 3 miles from the action of Duval St, so we had to drive everytime we wanted to go and get something to eat or just walk around and sight see. The resort was nice but the rest of Key West is what really stood out.", "Date": "May 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Value\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3470424", "Content": "We just stayed at the Doubletree for six nights and had a good time there. For a hotel in it's catagory it is an excellent value. The quality is basically what you would find at the nicer Holiday Inn facilities but with brighter styling and a really nice pool with jacuzi. The thing that visitors have to keep in mind is that this is Key West and all things do run a little slower down here. On one hand I found myself sometimes struggling with the slow pace of service but on the other hand it has the effect of causing you to slow down a bit. The Doubletree staff was as good as any on the island during our trip. The hotel was clean but perhaps slightly dated. But it is an extremely safe choice. It takes about 15 minutes to get down to the strip just because of the slow speed limits in force but we did not find this objectionable at all. I like the fact that it is on the other side of the island so that you have a quiet place to wind down. One night some young bucks came home from the strip at 3:30 AM and wanted to raise some cane. The staff put a stop to it immediately. The free hourly shuttle is a huge benefit although it's last pickup on the strip is at 10:20 PM. So a few times we took a cab home which ran $18-20. Something we tried the last day was a scooter rental. The max speed is like 30 MPH so you don't have to worry about serious injury as long as you don't drive drunk. It gives you a great deal of flexibility and there is ample scooter parking all over the place. Financially Key West is more expensive than most resort towns. Most regular meals for two with a drink a piece will run $50-60. We did find that we could get breakfast with juice for two for about $25-30. The abience and fraternity of Key West is simply awesome. I was rather afraid that it would be as wild as South Beach but thankfully it is an over 35 crowd that is fun to be around. It was so much fun watching people in the middle of raising families cutting loose a little bit and enjoying each other's company. Sloppy Joe's is really cool-don't miss it.

That meant we unfortunately did not have time to enjoy the swimming pool, Jacuzzi, gym or the private beach serviced by a free hotel shuttle. We made extensive use of the other free resort shuttle that provided hourly transport to central downtown locations. It was always prompt when leaving the resort, and collecting us for return. The shuttle drivers were not only friendly, but very knowledgeable and helpful toward everyone. They provided directions to various sites or areas, and made good recommendations for varied activities and dining. I have been going to Key West for 21 years, so I have a good idea of where quality services or goods can be found, and know what are \"reasonable\" costs on the island. Taking a car into downtown Key West these days is nerve-wracking and expensive. By staying at the other end of the island, we had quiet during the wee hours, no traffic outside our windows.

Sure, there are a few homeless people hanging around, but no one bothered us in the least. Santa Monica, CA was far worse in that respect! The sunset thingy down at the wharf was almost impossible to do with a three-year-old. You have to choose a spot early on, and then just camp there and drink. Not possible with a three-year-old on the wharf, what with the open water and all! But, overall, we saw very few children in Key West. We enjoyed a great seafood meal on the wharf at A&B Seafood Company, the best of our entire trip. We also took a Danger Cruise, it was fantastic and the highlight of all our excursions. The beaches in Key West are a little rocky, but we still had fun lounging. We rented a couple of scooters, and had a ball.

Doubletree has easy access to a great, wide sidewalk that parallels the water and you can walk it for miles. If you go south on it after the sun sets, there is a stand of trees out in the water about 200 yards where 20-30 large white birds spend the night, very eerie looking.

I met some lovely people in Key West who were veterans of Vietnam and they may have problems but they were very kind and helpful and I think your country should do more to help them. But enough politics! With regard to snorkelling, take a trip with one of the many companies that specialise in diving and snorkelling and they will take you to some beautiful sites. All in all I had a great holday in Key West at the Doubletree Grand Key Resort Jenny James Chichester, England", "Date": "December 23, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando FL", "Title": "\u201cnot bad not good\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2850503", "Content": "For the price this was a decent hotel but like most of the reviews on here said its in a terrible part of town and there is no beach. The only way you should consider the grand key resort is if you have a car. If you drive here its a ok place to stay and a good value. I have to say though i was very dissapointed with key west in general so dirty and its full of bums and garbage. And i came here to snorkel because ive heard so many stories of how good the water is here but as i read in another review the water smells like sewage and it isnt clear at all.", "Date": "November 28, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Doubletree Grand Key Resort", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34345-d209384-Reviews-Doubletree_Grand_Key_Resort-Key_West_Florida_Keys_Florida.html", "Price": "$181 - $350*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">3990 S Roosevelt Blvd</span>, <span class=\"locality\">Key West, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">33040</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "209384", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/4e/37/4e375a1b4ec42a6bd1240c7f48db131712large.jpg"}}
