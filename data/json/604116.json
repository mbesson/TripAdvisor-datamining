The pillows were seriously an inch thick with no cushioning whatsoever. There was no foxtel in my room as they claim and most appliances were damaged. The bathroom drains were covered in old dirt and waste, but apart from that it wasn't what I would call 'dirty'. Just old and not cleaned professionally.

It turned out to be fine. Sure, if you're expecting a luxury hotel, it isn't that. It's basically one room with comfortable bed(s) (we had a twin room), a sofa and table, a smallish TV, and a kitchen unit with utensils, cutlery and crockery. It has a kettle, a microwave and a single plug-in hob. It doesn't have a cooker, though, so you won't be fully self-catering. We made breakfast there, took sandwiches for lunch when I could be bothered to make them, and except for a couple of nights when I cooked meat pies and spuds, we ate dinner in restaurants. Those more adept/enthusiastic at cooking could do a lot more there, of course. We were there for 11 days. Towels are changed once a week. Half way through the week I just added them to our laundry. There's a laundry room in the basement with washers and dryers. No powder or change (though if you're lucky someone will have left powder). Cleaning is also done once a week. This isn't a hotel. It's 10 minutes from the beach, but we went in winter so our attention was on more cultural pursuits. Personally, I find the whole Bondi area pretty depressing, so apart from the first day when we walked to the beach and the second to last day when we did the Bondi-Clovelly walk (wonderful!!), we spent our time in the CIty. But that was convenient enough. The 389 bus stops right outside (both ways) and it's a half hour trip to Circular Quay. If you have to commute you'd probably get fed up with it, but on holiday it's part of the experience.

You also couldn't change the settings on the A/C because the buttons were broken, so you were stuck in leaving it 'on' maximum all the time, which meant freezing at night. Bathroom is of poor quality and feels dirty. Kitchenette is a nice bonus, but our fridge had a foul odour to it that we couldn't get rid of. Don't forget to bring your own SHAMPOO and CONDITIONER - it's not provided! And pack a bar of soap, you'll only be given a tiny bar good for washing your hands. There is no daily cleaning service, or towel/sheet change. They only do this once per week. They wouldn't even exchange our towels at reception after a few days because they \"aren't a hotel\". The location is alright - it's about a 10 minute walk to Bondi Beach. There is a bus stop right out front, which takes you to Bondi Junction (mall + subway station), so that's the only convenient part. Also, laundry facilities downstairs. There is reliable wireless Internet access on the property ($50/week) if you brought your laptop. The hotel pool is right in the middle of the parking lot, with cars on either side. Their web site leads you to believe this is a NEW property (2005) - perhaps its under NEW ownership - there's nothing new about this place. The photos on their web site musty have been retouched in Photoshop to make them look half decent. The furniture seems like it was bought from students moving out of their temporary housing at the end of the school year. I chose this hotel because it's the only one I could find online near Bondi (except the Swiss Grand (?) which was really expensive). I would definately not stay here again - I would rather stay downtown (like at the Meriton Kent St. - same price, world of difference) and have to take transit to go to the beach.", "Date": "January 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cClean, basic accommodation in a great location\u201d", "Author": "k8mol", "ReviewID": "UR11073744", "Content": "Me and my partner booked this accommodation the morning of our arrival. Upon arrival we were greeted at reception by friendly staff. The apartments are very basic but kept clean. The main plus is the location of these apartments. Just a 5 minute stroll by lots a little cafes and shops and you're at Bondi Beach. (lovely sand and blue sea). The pool isnt the best but good enough for a quick dip to refresh after sunbathing on the deck as some people seemed to do but with the beautiful beach moments away I much preferred to spend my time there. Tip - try the wedges with sour cream and sweet chilli sauce (more than enough for 2 people as a snack) from the Bondi Beach hotel. Lovely. Also eat out at Hurricanes which is mad busy at night so be prepared for a wait if you dont book but its great for steaks and ribs.", "Date": "November 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Derby, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSafe and Satisfactory\u201d", "Author": "EPD", "ReviewID": "UR10543789", "Content": "I stayed one week at these apartments at the end of October 07 when I was out in Sydney visiting my son and daughter in law. The location is excellent as everyone has said. The bus stops right outside for Bondi Junction or Sydney centre. It is a 5 minute walk to cafes and shops (although there is a convenience store across the road) and it was a very safe area. The studio I had (number 11) was perfectly satisfactory, it was clean and had everything I needed. The bathroom was excellent - although I would have appreciated a towel change sometime during the week. The bed was comfortable and although the sheets/bedding was clean - some of it was frayed and a bit torn. Security is pretty good and no-one can wander in to the complex unless they are admitted by guests. The pool was a bit odd being in the middle of the car park but it was a pleasure to swim in. The people on the front desk were pleasant and helpful. Downside: well at night some people made a lot of noise and were crashing around up and down the stairs which was a bit irritating. With no concierge on the premises at night there is no-one to complain to and I certainly wasn't going to go out on my own and tackle the people at 3 or 4 am. At the rear of my apartment was a tennis club - which started playing about 6.30am some days! My main gripe is the large window with the vertical blinds. People passing by CAN see in if the light is on. This is because there is a gap and with the wardrobe doors being mirrors as you walk towards the studios you can actually see in the entire studio as it reflects. I was not happy about this and it needs sorting. I was otherwise quite happy in my studio but might have preferred to stay at the large hotel on the seafront if I had a bit more cash, it looked very nice.", "Date": "November 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBasic accommodations good value\u201d", "Author": "loPDXer", "ReviewID": "UR8224977", "Content": "Our experience at Ultimate was much as described in the reviews here. The accommodations are clean and basic. One appeal of Ultimate is its central location in Bondi Beach - five minutes from the beach, nestled close to cafes, shops and fooderies plus the bus stop is directly on O'Brien out front of the property. The furnishings are adequate - heat and AC are hit or miss but plenty of hot water. One caution is the staff is minimal and hard to find and facility is completely dark after midnight - stumbly dangerous at night in fact with not so much as a nightlight left burning to lite the way of early risers. In this price range and location, this is great value despite the shortcomings for basic, comfortable, accommodations.

There are no amenities such as soap but a tiny bar by the sink. ***There is NOBODY at the desk after like 5pm! Some guy just arrived at 6pm and had no call back on the number listed on the door, so he was stranded and couldn't get a room that he booked. Also, it's a gated/locked premise so he couldn't even get in. TERRIBLE! *** They also leave your mail outside the lobby door for anybody who stays there to look at and maybe take. !!
