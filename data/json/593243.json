If you are like us, were we spent pretty much 90% of our time outside our hotel and just came home to sleep at night, this was more than adequate for the price.

It was easy to reach Hotel Andreina - we took a train from airport to the Roma termini station, crossed a street after we exited termini station, walked 2 minutes, saw a yellow coloured building & followed the hotel signage to reach the hotel's reception. There were several hotels located in the same building. We had no security/safety issues with the location although it was just a few minutes away from the termini station. There were restaurants and shops along the streets around the hotel building. We took 20 mins to stroll to the Colosseum (we could have taken the train but we saw a lot more by walking). Our room for the first 3 nights was located a floor down from the reception level. Room was not very big, but adequate for a couple. Room facilities were good - comfortable bed, clean toilet, a safe, a small TV and a working table. However, it was a little troublesome to get to this level as we would have to take a small lift in the hotel or the main lift outside the hotel. We had a room on the same floor as the reception area on our last night. Both rooms' layout were about the same, but we prefered our final night room as it was much more convenient to get to. The hotel is owned by Andreina herself. We met her in the afternoons and her three other staff in the mornings - they were the best hotel staff we met in our two weeks' visit in Italy.

The personnel is very friendly and helpful (which is quite exceptional for Rome). Only minus point: As this is a very small hotel and not a lot of guests take breakfast there, they want to know the evening before which time exactly you want to have breakfast. 1 time we were 10 minutes late and the coffee was already quite cold. Anyhow, typically italian breakfast is served and I recommend to book the hotel without breakfast and get something at the close by train station. Which leads me to the next point: The location is fantastic for exploring Rome. It is literally only a 2 minute walk to the train station (Termini) from which one is connected to both metro lines and the airport. All attractions are in walking distance (except for the Vatican, which is 45 minute walk or 15 minutes by metro). However, the region around the central station is probably not the nicest area concerning restaurants and night life. The rooms are okay, small, but with very high ceilings. The bathroom was very old, but clean. It is very quiet (as long as one keeps the window closed).

We found the perfect place after many days of researches on TA. Here are the pros and cons to choose the Andreina: Pros - Room: we looooovveeedd our room, so European. We really slept well and matresses were comfy like to one I have at home. It was clean and refresh each day. We were especially pleased by the safe in the room to store our passport and computer. As more, there is AC in the room (it wasn\u2019t a big deal for us since it was November but it might be for those staying in the summer month). -Location: located near the termini, the hotel is really easy to find. The location is practical if you need to use buses, subway, trains, airport ... Plus, you can easily walk around from there. We were two girls and never found the area to be sketchy. It\u2019s just a big city. -Services: Prior to our arrival, I emailed them for informations and they responded quickly. Booking was easy. We enjoy the welcoming attitude of Andreina and Philippa (flexibility of breakfast, advice on buses, help with the Internet, speaking to us in french, etc.). -Breakfast: we didn\u2019t think we would have breakfast included from previous posts but we did and it was just what we needed to start our day (pastry, slice bread and jam, coffee and juice). Cons (they are not that deal breakers but you should be aware of it) -It may be a bit noisy at nights like someone upstairs walking in heels during the night or music from a bar downstairs. However, both didn\u2019t bother us since we were jetlagged. -Internet signal is not strong and after trying for a while, we just stop trying to go on the Internet.

The room was decent-sized with a lovely bathroom, armoire, a spare twin bed, and sound-deadening windows that looked out onto Via Giovanni Amendola and the metro stop below (a popular stop it seems). The room's ceilings are high, making the room feel more spacious. Amenities were plentiful and re-stocked daily. There were even two pair of disposable slippers -- they were paper-thin (literally) and our toes poked through after a short time of wear, but the thought was nice. After our arrival, a small plate a fruit was left for us, along with a welcome note -- another pleasant, unexpected gesture. Hotel Andreina's location is at once an asset and a downfall. On one hand, it's close to the Termini train station (aka, convenient). On the other hand, it's close to the Termini train station (a less-than desirable neighborhood).
