{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nice hotel I liked this hotel a lot. It\u9e93s small with only a few rooms but has everything you need. The room was rather big with a big bed (a bit uncomfortable - but ok) and a large bathroom with shower. It was clean and nicely decorated. There was a small breakfastroom and a terrace on which you could sit and eat your breakfast. The hotel was next to a big road with rather heavy traffic but it didn\u9e93t disturb us, the room was quiet. The hotel is not in the absolute center of the city and a bit away from the tourist area with for example the Uffizi gallery and Ponte Vechio, but it took no more than 20-30 minutes to walk. If you go down to the river you get a beautiful walk into the center with the bridges in front of you. We never once took the bus in Florence, but it was possible. The hotel is close to the railwaystation which is very good if you arrive/leave with a heavy luggage. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. I recommend this hotel if you are looking for a nice hotel to a reasonable price and don\u9e93t mind not staying in the absolute center of the city.", "Date": "Sep 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR394053461", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "SwedenMaria"}, {"Content": "Nice B Very nice BB in Florence. I found it was pretty far away from the main attractions of Florence, like the Uffizi and the Duomo, so get a copy of the bus line or call a cab if you want to get around.My room was spacious, but there was no a/c. There was a floor fan in the room that cooled it down, though. If you have a lot of luggage, beware. There is no elevator. The bathroom was pretty big and actually had a tub. The room across the hall, though, had a strange toilet in the shower set up that I've never seen before. Luckily my traveling partner got that room. Overall the room was clean and comfortable. A bit sparse, but it didn't bother me as I was only there overnight.The owners were so nice and very helpful. My lodging for Rome had fallen through at the last minute and they called ahead to a few places and made reservations at a very reasonable, nice hotel that they knew of. I appreciated it so much!", "Date": "Oct 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR323442240", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "thorpite"}, {"Content": "friendly and clean My husband and I stayed at Sogna Firenze for 3 nights in May and have nothing but positive things to say.

The bed was two twin beds pushed toghether, ok, except that one bed was 1 inch lower than the other bed before laying on it. The sheets had several holes in them, which showed that they did not even change the sheets once during our stay as the holes were always in the same place. The shower curtain had mold on it and blew in or out with the steam causing water to go all over the bathroom floor. our bathroom was connected to the kitchen which was loud in the morning.only plus was that the hotel was close to some nice small mom and pop resturants.", "Date": "Apr 19, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR730715472", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "a family hotel We stayed here in early november.
