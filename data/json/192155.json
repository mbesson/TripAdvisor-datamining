The nearest tube (Gloucester Road, zone 1/2) is a 5 minute walk on a busy main road, while others are 10 minutes. Good Points are its proximity to some of Londons most attractive sites, including natural history museum (10/15 minute walk and a few others) and Harrods (20-25 minute walk). If you dont fancy the walk, a quick tube ride and your there within minutes. For convenience there is a Sainsburys across the road, and a waitrose next to the station plus a tesco/starbucks/burger king. Bad Points are the hotel itself, sadly it has deteriorated over the years since my first visit. The rooms as people mention are extremely cramped, even the double ones when your paying three figures for a nights stay! The most abysmal part was the bathroom, which even a child would struggle for space! Although my most recent visit was off season (double room for \u00a360), I could believe my ears at the amount of traffic noise that was filtering through the windows. Despite many attempts to resolve this, I gave up and accepted a lack of nights sleep. As the hotel is on a busy main road you are fighting a losing battle here. I did try to change the room but was advised any room will experience the same problem and it doesnt look they are in a rush to sort it out! In summary if you are not bothered about hotel quality and value but want the convenience then its a good place to stay otherwise look at the other dozen hotels nearby!", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGood location - but nothing else.\u201d", "Author": "Janet061", "ReviewID": "UR124551652", "Content": "My family and I booked into 2 rooms for 5 nights - after our 1st choice was being renovated.

A double bed was sqeezed in and was against the wall so someone on that side had to climb over the other person to get out of the bed. The flex on the kettle didn't reach from the table it was on to the plug socket below so we had to put the kettle on the floor. The kettle didn't fit under the tap in the tiny sink in the miniscule en-suite so we had to fill it by decanting water with multiple fills of the toothbrush mug.

Being that I moved onto a comparable but utterly disappointing hotel for the weekend, I can assure you that it is better than others charging similar prices. The cons: Pay for the internet - their \"free\" wireless does not work. Save yourself the frustration of trying. The rooms are not very cool. I could at least open the windows and there was a small fan, but I am glad I came for the tail end of the heatwave. Small rooms. This is London though, so get used to it. All in 1 conditioner/soap/shampoo. Why do places even bother providing this? Is there anyone for whom this does not instantly turn their hair into straw? FINALLY - if you offer a wake up call, and someone requests a call for 6, calling at 6:14 is not appropriate. If you cannot effectively run this service, don't offer it. 15 min can make a huge difference. Of course, for my final morning when I pre-emptively ordered an EARLIER wake up call seeing that they had called late all week, they naturally called before the time that I had even requested. This is unacceptable. Pros: I found the rooms clean, the beds comfortable, the shower-head was appropriately HIGH, great water pressure, functioning TV, good breakfast selection, good location - well connected to both Gloucester Rd and Earls Court. In short, it is not a great hotel, but it is typical of the hotels in that price range, and the pros were ultimately more important than the cons for me. Ex. I am staying at a hotel now with a shower-head that is 5 feet off the ground.

Our superior double room (room 200) cost \u00c2\u00a3123 through a booking agent, and it was extremely large 25 ft. x 25 ft. approximately, with big picture windows overlooking Courtfield Gardens (and a building site opposite where workmen were about).

Bathroom with excellent shower. The staff are friendly, the public rooms fine although some of the sofas etc needed cleaning or replacing. Location of the hotel excellent - safe, lots of shops, restaurants, pubs, Waitrose, close to lots of museums, Royal Albert Hall etc. The main problem with the Kensington Rooms is that when the refurbishment was done, they did not install air conditioning or have the windows double/triple glazed to shut out the noise on what is basically a main arterial road into London from the west. Therefore even with a room on the side of the hotel overlooking Courtfield Gardens the noise from Cromwell Road was deafening and sleep was difficult. For the comfort of guests, the rooms need re-glazing, preferably triple glazing, but on a hot day/night, you would then need air conditioning. I suppose if you stayed in winter, and at the side of the hotel rather than the front, with the windows closed, the noise might be more acceptable for sleep purposes.

The only thing going for this place in my view is its location, which is great for the museums and Kensington area. Its also basically clean as well, although if you've got any health problems don't stay here as you are more than likely going to have to lug your luggage by yourself along long corridors and up stairs (as I found out for myself). It was so bad I decided I couldn't stay one night, so upgraded to the Copthorne Tara instead, which was excellent. If you do decide to stay here, make sure you don't get caught out by the deceptive website - make sure you ask for, and get, an Urban, City or Town room.

The breakfasts were fine, coffee, croissants, cereal, yogurts, juices...although only Raspberry Jam! The situation is excellent with Gloucester road tube and the major Childrens Museums 10 minutes walk away. My daughter loved the cool settees and seats in the loung and also the aquarium. The one thing that did let us down was the noise from the Traffic.....complimentary ear plugs would have been lovely. Ask for a room at the back or at the side never the front. If you are used to the US sizes and the Have a nice day style of American chains, then you wouldnt be advised to stay here as its very european.", "Date": "February 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cTerrible garbage of a hotel!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3100989", "Content": "Upon arrival we were greeted by the most impolite staff imaginable (see other reviews also??).

Whilst the reception area and bar are of a reasonably high standard I was disappointed to find that behind the 'hip and contemporary' front end, the hotel was of an exceptionally poor standard. I would rate this no more than a very poor 3* hotel. I stayed in a City Room on the 4th floor. The bedroom looked like it had been 'done up' on the cheap to give it a modern feel. The room itself smelt stale and I wasn't convinced that the bedding had even been changed from the previous guests! The tiny bathroom was possibly one of the worst hotel bathrooms that I have ever seen. The sink in the bathroom was dirty and some of the fittings had gone rusty. The 'power' shower was simply a trickle of water, the shower screen wouldn't close and the complimentary shower gel had already been used! Luckily I wasn't disturbed by traffic as I was staying at the back of the hotel facing away from the main road - I was however woken at midnight by 20 seconds worth of fire alarm. The inclusive breakfast is again possibly one of the worst that I have ever seen. The entire buffet includes, bread, croissant, 2 choices of cereal, apples (red/green) and warm yoghurt with a choice of tea / coffee OR fruit juice. Alternatively you could pay over 6 for a bacon sandwich! I'm glad that I didn't pay the advertised rate of 200 per night!", "Date": "January 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cRUDE and CHEATS\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3098373", "Content": "Kensington Rooms double book people and put their 'SPARE guest' in their other hotels so they can make as much money as they possibly can. I recently went to london with my girlfriend and booked to stay at the Kensington Rooms. But when I arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by building work as soon as we stepped in. When we got to the check in desk, we had to stand there for 5 mins while the two staff were chatting away in a different language. When one of them decided to serve us, he didnt not say sorry or hello. He just asked for my name and told us that we have to leave as they have double booked us so they have transferred us to their 'sister hotel' in Marble Arch. We didnt even get a sorry or an reason why they didnt contact us before hand. When we arrived to the Royal Sussex Hotel, it was in Paddington NOT Marble Arch. They Royal Sussex was dirty and old. It looked like it hasnt been cleaned for a while. The door to our room was kicked in, the sheets were dirty and covered in grease. The bathroom had hair in the sink and shower. In the end we decided to book our own hotel out of our own pockets as kensington rooms were not help us. The service in both hotels were poor and the staff do not speak a word of english.

Upon check-in we were greeted by a very indifferent gentleman who practically threw the booking form at us, making no eye contact or conversation. We were given a key for room 006 and instructed to go \"downstairs\". As we were already on the ground floor, we knew it was not a good sign. A 10 minute hunt for the room ensued, with us returning to reception and asking for precise directions... the gentleman sniggered, and sent a girl to show us the way. She told us that we could not take the usual route, as there was a meeting on in one of the rooms. Normally we would have to walk through this media room... So down a flight of steep stairs with our suitcases, through a bathroom area, down a dirty staff corridor with old furniture stacked up against the walls, and voila.. room 006 ! We entered, and yes the room was large, with nice bed etc. but when the blinds were open, we were greeted with a view of a stone stairs and peoples feet waking on the street overhead. Blinds remained shut for rest of stay. When we noticed the shower head didnt hang up anywhere, it just sat in the bath, we rang and asked someone to have a look at it. The same rude check-in man came down and basically said \"whats the problem, this is normal\". We asked to be moved and he said no we are full and left. The next morning, we went to reception again and a new indifferent man said no we are full, nothing we can do. He told us \"there are a lot worse rooms - you should be happy\". We mentioned the shower, street noise and the fact that there was no tea/ coffee facilities in the room. He stared blankly and said we will not be moving you. We left again, fuming. That night we returned from sightseeing, and i asked the initial rude gentleman for a cup of tea.. after much confusion, he said he would have it brought to room.... 1hour 30mins and two phone calls to reception later we never got the tea. Worst service ever in a hotel... 4 star? I think not. Didn't even have the basics, never mind any extras. Do not disappoint yourself by booking this hotel - we will never return.", "Date": "November 8, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cThis is a load of rubbish indeed!\u201d", "Author": "chicagoborn40", "ReviewID": "UR2623294", "Content": "This hotel is not bad if you don't mind waking up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and having to kill roaches while on the toilet!

The bizarre girl at the front desk who, upon check in would not allow my husband to look at the paperwork that I just signed to check us into the hotel. What's more this same incompetent, checked us out of our room one afternoon while we were out. The hotel's policy is to hand in your key before you leave to go out everyday. It's held at the desk and you can collect it when you come back each time. However, this ditz checked us out when we left one day (mind you, we were not carrying luggage of any kind when we handed her the key) and gave us our key when we returned. We couldn't get into our room, went downstairs to ask what the problem was, and was told, \"Oh, I thought that you had checked out.\" We asked her why she thought that, and her answer was a peculiar, \"I don't know.\" and a blank, distracted, vacant look.
