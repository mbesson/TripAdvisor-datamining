Admittedly, we booked very late and hotels in the centre of Amsterdam are quite expensive. Do they ever have a low season here? The only 2 good things about this hotel is first, it's location; walking distance from Central train station, and secondly you can get lovely hot flavoured teas at 5 am in the morning. Apart from that is a pretty awful hotel and I can only imagine it caters for the 'coffee' shop travellers who are too stoned to care. I was there with 2 friends in early February when the temperature hit a lowly -7degrees C. Needless to say the rooms were cold, the floor even more so. However, the bed were comfortable and all had very warm duvets. There is no lift and the stairs are very narrow. This place is noisy, your can hear people coming and going 24/7. Check out is at an ungodly 10 am! Essentially it is a hostel with a 2/3 star hotel price. Some of my other friends stayed at the Ibis, almost same price but in a parallel universe where comfort is concerned. Well I learnt the hard way, next time I'll stick to the Ibis in Amsterdam if I am going 'budget'.

When me and 2 of my friends booked this hotel we were concerned after reading reviews, however when we got to the hotel, we asked the receptionist if we could see the room before we paid, but she told us they do not show rooms and asked us why we had concerns, we told her about the reviews of mice etc... She was actually really nice and told us what we already knew, its an old building and if you leave food lying around your room there is a possability you might see a mouse. She told us if we did see anything we didnt like she would change our room which set our minds at ease. The room was basic and clean as was our bathroom. The 5 flights of starirs to get there was a bit of a climb but definatly quite a quirky experiance, probably did us all some good as it was the only excersise we were getting for a few days. On our last day we overslept and checked out an hour late. The staff were very nice about it. After trailing our luggage down the 5 flights, we realised we had one of the housekeepers following us with a ring i had left behind and some cash my friend had left in his pillowcase.(he had run down 5 flights to catch us) I think this hotel gets a hard time on reviews..

The room was quite grimy, but the television worked Ok once we'd replaced the batteries for the remote, the window opened, and the bed was do-able, even though they'd taken the unusual step of using a single sheet placed sideways over a double bed. The location of the hotel is great for a tourist visit to amsterdam. It's on the main road, very near to the train station and the red light district. Probably best for a long weekend though, and don't book if you have knee problems", "Date": "June 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cI beg u do not go!!!!\u201d", "Author": "missindependant", "ReviewID": "UR29765880", "Content": "We chose this hotel because we thought it would be better than staying in a hostel...So wrong we stayed on the 5th floor that had no lift the stairs was so narrow we had to lift and twist or cases to get up there.

I had read teh reviews thinking ...well I am not that fussy but if you stay there you will regret it we went on the stay at other hostels in europe which were much cleaner quieter and user friendly.

I have stayed in some pretty dodgy places in my time but none were anywhere near as bad as this! On first impression the hotel looked quite dated and run down, but we figured seen as we had booked it 3 months before we would give the place a chance. Our room was number 5009, it was on the fifth floor, up some seriously narrow staircases, the last one didn't even have a hand rail on the majority of it. We then walked through what can only be described as shabby corridors with spare pieces of wood and DIY equipment lying at the sides. When we eventually reached our room it was very small. We had booked an en-suite room which this was (only just) to get into the shower you would have had to climb over the toilet (the bathroom was no more than 1m square! The bathroom was so small the sink didn't fit into it. The sink which was in the bedroom had some brackets above it for a shelf, although there was no shelf on the brackets. The wall light next to the bed had no shade so it was just a bare metal bracket sticking out of the walls with large screws poking out and a bare bulb. The window was blocked by the bed (the window came up from the floor no more than a meter), when sat on the bed it felt as though it was going to fall out of the window into the cobbled street five floors below (the floor was slanting towards the window). What finally topped things off was when I noticed the brown smear of faeces across the radiator, I was nearly sick at this point and decided I couldn't stay. The only redeeming feature this hotel had was the helpful young man on reception who told his boss what had happened and which room number it was, who then instructed him to give us our money back! It seemed as though when the boss heard the room number he decided straight away to give us the money back (maybe this is the worst of their rooms?) Anyway all in all from the parts of the hotel I saw I would say it wasn't fit for my worst enemy! Disgusting!!!! We ended up staying in a hotel up the road called the Terminus.", "Date": "April 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "australia", "Title": "\u201cnever again!\u201d", "Author": "emma023", "ReviewID": "UR14227219", "Content": "went to amsterdam for a weekend, got to the travel hotel (which is located in the red light district) it said on the website that i made the booking on that it was on the damrak, i had payed for the \"room\" which is actually dormary room (didnt say that on web page) total rip off for prices 95 euro, lady at reception was totally useless! and manager was the same both did not want to help., walked out and got accomation at a proper hotel!", "Date": "March 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "wirral", "Title": "\u201ccan't fault it for the money\u201d", "Author": "firest0rm", "ReviewID": "UR10350896", "Content": "Just returned (26/10/07) from a 3 night stay at the Travel Hotel and having read the other reviews before we went, i was a little apprehensive to say the least. I even made a short list of other hotels in the area to try if this one really was that bad. What a pleasant suprise we had, we were offered a choce of 2 rooms, one on the 1st floor and one on the 5th. After looking at both we took the one on the 1st floor (no lift and plenty of narrow stairs to the 5th floor). The lady with the blonde hair who works there in the evening was lovely, very friendly and helpfull, she made us feel welcome. The room (number 1001) was plenty big enough for myself and my wife, we had our own en-suite shower, toilet sink, a bit dated but clean. The room was furnished ok, the two single beds were pushed together and the linen, towels etc where spotless as were the curtains. The heating was on all day and was too hot at times and had to turn the radiator off. The flooring was laminate flooring and again spotlessly clean. Overall, We found it to be a clean, warm, friendly, buget hotel within a couple of minutes walk from Central station and ideally situated within a short stroll of all Amsterdam has to offer, we had a great time, and would deffinately stay at The Travel Hotel. .", "Date": "October 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lethbridge, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFor the fit and young!\u201d", "Author": "sheer", "ReviewID": "UR6599277", "Content": "We have just returned from a long weekend at The Travel Hotel. I think it would be fair to say that we got value for money as it was only 180 euros for 2 ppl for 3 nights! We stayed in one of the very few rooms with en suite facilities. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The atmosphere in the bar was relaxed but the bed linen left a little to be desired. We did a lot of walking during our stay and the climb to the 5th floor each evening up a steep spiral staircase was a little like mountaineering for beginners!!! You should be aware that the hotel has 2 entrances, one just a few yards from the police station (although there was never any trouble or noise from there) and the other door which leads directly into the red light district. The main source of noise at night was from the local church bells which chime every 15 mins in a rather random and haphzard way....often giving the wrong time and making you feel like maybe you spent too long in the \"Coffee House\". The whole area around the hotel is a colourful maze of shops/ bars/ restaurants etc and the place has a wonderful carnival feel to it.

We presumed at 1st that it was an allergic reaction to the sheets or something he had eaten, but probably didn't take it as seriously as we should have. I started to show little red spots on my skin on the day I was leaving, and since then 2 of my friends, who also stopped in the same room, are showing the same spots. My friend who 1st got the bites is covered head to toe in red spots now and his doctor has no idea what the spots are. I am assuming they are bug bites after reading a previous review, but whatever they are, it is NOT good, and they are beginning to spread across my body, which is also NOT good. I suggest that you avoid this hotel if possible, and if you can't, avoid Room 2001. I should also add that there is a mixture of helpful staff and very unhelpful staff working at the hotel, which all in all added up to a frustrating stay. To summarise, don't go there.
