This hotel was perfect for us because the first time we arrived here we can check in early at 9.00am.

Free Parking at the hotel, but if u not sure about security, can pay the parking inside with 6 Euro per night. Swimming pool not operated because it was winter. Free wifi, 2 computer available at lobby. 200 meter from hotel there's a Lidl Supermarket, you can buy something there. Before arriving at the hotel we bought ACTV unlimited ride for bus and water taxi at the airport for 12 hours journey 16 Euro each, 24 hours journey 18 Euro. If already have a planned, it's better to book online at ACTV website, very easy and have a discount. After book online, we can go to the airport to collect the ticket from vending machine. The ACTV unlimited card also included bus ticket from bus stop near hotel to Venice. So, it's better to collect the ticket at the airport before arriving at the hotel.

There is ample parking at the back of the hotel for no charge at all and is un-monitored. In addition the hotel has another car park in front of the hotel and charge about 5 euros for a 24 hours parking limit which is monitored by security cameras. The rooms of the hotel are pretty clean and well arranged. There is an electric kettle with a handful of tea and coffee sachets too. The room also has a 32 inch LCD television with a decent amount of English channels. I although found the cushioning of the bed to be on the softer side and you almost sunk into the bed. I would although like to add that should you wish to go to Old Venice using Public transport then please make sure you leave the hotel early in the morning and plan your itinerary to be back in the hotel before 8:00 pm as there is no transportation back to the hotel from Old Venice after this time, it takes approximately 30 minutes by Public Transport from the bus stop near \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Novotel Venezia Mestre\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Piazzale Roma\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Although there are other bus services that run pretty late, they may drop you at quite a distance from the hotel and you may have to walk to the hotel for about a kilometer, the streets are pretty lonely and deserted at this part of the night and the hotel staff also informed me of some muggings that take place during this part of the night when they saw me walk in at 8:45 pm. I guess I had a lucky escape! The restaurant on the ground floor was decent; while options available were not ample there was quite a typical selection of cold meats. I must although say that the restaurant staff were more than friendly and would probably smile if you paid them to do that. Overall if you are looking for a clean and quite place to stay in, I would recommend this hotel to you. Besides for travellers who are driving this is probably one of the best options as it is right next to the Autostrade (Expressway).", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Den Bosch, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cVenice in the rain\u201d", "Author": "Johanhimself", "ReviewID": "UR119967398", "Content": "We stayed three nights, one room. In october. During our stay the Venice weather was real bad, rain all day and night. Still no problem drying our soaked gear in the hotel room without creating damp conditions, excellent ventilation! Room was good and clean, everything in good working order. For us, travelling with two young teenage children, Novotel is almost always a very good offer (Children stay in same room, no charge for extra bed an no charge for the extra breakfasts). Breakfast was good, efficient, plenty of everything fruit and drinks and it was three times a party for our girls (and an attack on my BMI.) Wifi in the lounge is free and real fast, also two two apple computers there for free. Did not test the wifi in the room (must be paid extra). The hotel turned out to be a good place for us, busstop into the Venice we came for is only a few hunderd meters away, Lidl shop at the busstop. Two points it can improve on: 1. We had one diner in the restaurant, the waiters were somewhat strangely stressed, making the atmosphere not relaxt. The food was nice enough and certainly not expensive. 2. A must to improve on: The extra bed for the children (=the unfolded sofa) had a bad matrass and the bed linnen was too smal for the matrass size. That meant trouble during the sleeping hours. A few times a night all the turning in the extra bed woke up the children and daddy. Daddy had to get out his comfortable bed to get the children coverred with bedlinnen again. It slept so bad that our youngest almost preferred sleeping on the floor. Conclusion: good place to stay and certainly worth the price we had to pay. Comparred to other Novotels we visited* over the years it's not the best we met. The extra bed really is substandard.

Lasagna arrived which was cold and returned. Lasagna No.2 also cold and returned. Lasagna No.3 arrived warm, was returned, and re-served with tell tale spatter at the edge of the plate from microwave-ing. I have to say it is the worst tasting Lasagna have ever eaten, devoid of any discernible flavor other than what seemed like 4 times more salt than is normally regarded healthy for a human's daily consumption. This 'meal' appeared to have been the poorest, cheapest, frozen ready meal known to man. Without a doubt inferior to the ones sold for 99p in my local convenience store. Big disappointment for first culinary experience in Italy. Shocking that they charged 16 euros for it - and could not even be bothered to check it if was warm before serving! Fold down bed was uncomfortable. Air conditioning had 2 options: Noisy and ineffective, or Very noisy and ineffective. Shower: Boiler not capable of suppling demand. Hot water only available at off peak times. Breakfast: reasonable. Bacon and mini sausages very salty, accompanied by strange yellow gelatinous lumps, which I deduced may have once been eggs at some time in the past before they were dried, powdered, then re-hydrated and warmed up. (But only just above room temperature). Coffee: Necafe capsule machine. (In Italy WTF!). Swimming Pool: looked nice, but was closed. Internet was slow, involved laborious registration process, and caused facebook to lock me out of my account. Transport to venice: choice of 40 euro taxi or long walk along motor-way hard shoulder to bus/train station. Did not know about non-existent shuttle bus until I read other reviews here. Billing: Our rooms were pre-paid by company. The checkout desk lost this info and tried to charge us again for the rooms when we tried to pay our bar bill. We had to get our boss to phone them to sort it out. This caused a nail biting 20 minute delay for us to get too our airport taxi waiting outside.

Mestre city centre is probably about a 20 min walk from the hotel. The bus stop to Venice is about 100m from the hotel. The busses run every half hour (from memory, 23 past and 53 past the hour) But the biggest downside is that the direct busses stop around 7:30pm from Venice. There are other busses you can catch, but you will need to get off at Mestre, and either walk (about 20mins) or catch another bus back to the stop. They provide free internet service, but are given login cards (3 Hour) and recharge cards (1 Hour)..

It is like an airport hotel surrounded by roads but you do not hear the traffic at all even when using the pool. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and the rooms were spacious and very clean. The bed was lovely and comfortable on both stays and the meals were excellent. The pool is very welcoming after a hot day in Venice. Also you can walk into Mestre town which has a lovely Piazza in about 15 minutes but this does mean walking under an underpass which could put some people off. Lidl is just round the corner as are the bus stops. Internet is free in the lobby. They also have a courtesy room for suitcases. Check out time is 12pm which is very useful if you have a later flight. The reception staff will quite happily call a taxi for you if you do not want to use local transport which is actually very efficient. TRANSPORT TO AND FROM HOTEL We got a taxi from Marco Polo airport for 90 euros return which we prebooked. This hotel is ideal for staying close to Venice if you don't want to stay in the centre. It takes about 30 minutes to get into Venice either by getting bus H1 to Mestre Railway Station then bus 2 to Venice or you can get a direct Venezia bus. The tickets are sold at the hotel for 1.20 euros. You can also get a bus to Lido De Jesolo from Mestre bus station for 7 euros return which takes about an hour, this bus also stops at Marco Polo Airport. To get back to the hotel from the Mestre station you need bus H2. You can also get a bus from Venice direct back to Lidl but you do not get this bus from Piazza Roma, you get on the small monorail across the road (1 euro) which goes to the Tronchetto, it's 2 stops, the first stop is the Marittima cruise port and the next one is the final stop. Walk to the right when exiting and cross the road to find the Preganziol bus. We also got a regional train to Verona which took about 2 hours for 15 euros return. If you do this do not get off at Verona Puerto Vescuvo which is the first Verona Station, get off at Verona Puerto Nuova which is the main station, we got off the wrong one and ended up in a ghetto! It's best to do your homework before staying here to be sure you are aware of how far it is, we looked on google earth so we knew where to go for the bus etc. We got a taxi for 90 euros return to and from the Cruise Terminal which was very convenient as you are dropped right outside the terminal.

The lobby area is nicely decorated and has lots of comfortable sofas for guests. There is also an internet corner in the lobby where one can surf for free and print boarding passes. Likewise, there is free wifi in the lobby (ask the staff for the password) but none in the rooms. The reception counter staff are very friendly and helpful, giving us information about the surrounding area and restaurants even without being asked. This was a welcome change from our experience in Lucerne where getting the reception staff to answer questions is like pulling teeth. The main downside to this hotel is its location. It is situated at Venezia Mestre, the mainland part of Venice and not Venice City itself with its lovely canals. To get to Venice, one has to take a bus or a train and cross a 5 km bridge. Unfortunately, the train station is far from the hotel, and the nearest bus stop is 10-15 minutes walk along a highway -- not a pleasant thing to do with the hot sun beating down your back. Furthermore, the hotel seems to be located in an industrial area surrounded by highways and unattractive concrete buildings, and definitely not near the centre of Venezia Mestre. The nearest supermarket (Lidl) is 10 minutes walk away while the nearest restaurant is at least 20 minutes walk. Because it was already late and the hotel was in the middle of nowhere, we decided to have dinner in the hotel restaurant instead of going into town and looking for a place to eat. This led to another unpleasant experience because apparently the other guests thought the same way and the restaurant was almost full. There were several wait staff standing around but none refused to take our order. They told us to wait for one of the waiters who was busy taking the order at another table. We could only surmise that only one of the wait staff speaks adequate English, as the other guests appeared to be tourists like ourselves and they were also impatiently waiting for the same guy. After being ignored for 15 minutes, my husband and I decided to venture out and eat elsewhere. We don't know what the problem was that night, but the wait staff should be able to accommodate a roomful of diners instead of just waiting for one guy to take all the orders. Especially since there were no other restaurants near the hotel, hence the guests would be more likely to dine within the premises. By the way, in their website the hotel stated that they run a shuttle service to transport the guests to and from Venice, but upon arrival, we learned that this was not true, so we had to take the bus. Another fail. Aside from the location and minor inconveniences described above, we had a lovely stay. Now that we know what to expect, we will probably take our meals before going back to the hotel and plan our schedule more carefully to allow for traveling time.

However, Venice is a different story. If you rent a car to travel to Venice then Novotel would be a good choice. Otherwise, you are in for a lot of unpleasant surprises which will ruin your experience in the city. The hotel is located near a highway in the outskirts of Mestre. According to their website they provide a shuttle service but only when you arrive the staff let you know that the shuttle runs only twice per day at 9:30 a.m. and at 6:00 p.m. So, they offer you the possibility of taking the public bus (line Treviso) or bus #2 , and you have to take a 15 minute walk to the Tobacco shop to purchase the tickets for the bus. The bus runs all day but the last Treviso bus leaves Venice at 8:00 p.m. You can take line 2 but it leaves you on the other side of the highway and you have to make your way on foot over the overpasses where there is no sidewalk. That is indeed quite a challenge when you are traveling with children. They hotel offers its clients free tickets to a concert in downtown Venice. However, they only give you tickets for adults and if you have children you have to pay 20 euros per child. Our experience was even worse because on July 29th it rained cats and dogs and we had to venture into the streets, and catch busses that were usually late and Tobacco shop staff that were quite rude. Another unpleassant experience was to schedule a taxi to take us to the airport on July 30th. My friend booked the taxi on July 29th and we had to leave at 5:00 a.m. to make it in time to catch our flight back to Canada. When we arrived back to the hotel in the evening (July 29th) the staff us that another family was comming with us in the van. We were quite upset at the situation because they made that decision without consulting with us. The next morning, we realized that it was not a regular taxi but the shuttle bus. We were ready at 4:45 a.m., we checked out and we were ready to board the shuttle but the clerk advised us that we had to wait for the other family to be ready before we could leave. Finally at 5:20 a.m., and after a heated argument they agreed to take us to the airport without the other family. They charged us 45 euros to take us which is quite a rip-off considering that it was a 10 minute ride to the airport. The staff at the hotel is not helpful, and the maid came into my room announced while I was taking a shower.

I chose it because of good experiences with the Novotel in Chiang Mai, and because of the price. It seems hard to find something decent in Venice under 150-200 euro's. We paid 89 euro's a night including breakfast, which I guess is cheap by Venice standards, but we usually stay in cheaper hotels like the Ibis so we expected more than that. Good things about the hotel are: the room is big, the bed soft, it's clean (although the bathroom smelled a bit odd), and breakfast is good (they do seem to serve the same items every day however, but we didn't mind as they had a big selection). There are some 'bad' points aswell. No major things, but when I add them all, it leads to the conclusion that the hotel didn't live up to our expectations and as far as I'm concerned we won't be staying there again. We arrived at the hotel at 11 PM. When we entered the room it felt like an oven and the airconditioning didn't work. When we mentioned this to the reception they just laughed in our faces and told us it's not switched on yet in April and maybe we could open the window (like the rest of the guests). This resulted in me still sweating my pants off, but my boyfriend was freezing. A lot has been written already about traveling into Venice. The bus stop is easy enough to find, as it's just around the corner, but buying tickets was a hassle. After asking where we could get them, the hotel gave us a map of the neighborhood with a Tabac on it, and told us to buy tickets there. After walking around in vain for 20 minutes it turned out there was no Tabac on the indicated place. Instead they could have just sent us to the small motel (Air Motel) right next door (behind the gas station) where they do sell them at the reception. There are two no. 2 Venice bound busses per hour, at .15 and .45 past the hour. The last bus from Venice (direction Treviso) leaves at 20.45h from stop B1. Busses can be crowded at times and the journey takes about 45 minutes. Please note that the hotel is also not in the center of Mestre. It's on the Northern outskirts next to the highway. If you want to find some restaurants, shops or an ATM, you have to walk for 15 to 20 minutes, so that's not very convenient. There is a LIDL supermarket next to the bus stop, which is open until 9 PM. We had another bad experience upon check out. We had to be at the train station in Mestre at 6.15 AM to take the ATVO airport bus to Treviso airport. We called the reception the evening before to confirm that the H2 bus would depart from the hotel to the train station that early in the morning already, as we had seen this on the time table at the bus stop. According to the receptionist there were no busses yet at that time, but he could call us a taxi. After checking out, the taxi was late, and when we got in it didn't turn out to be an official metered taxi, but just a guy (probably a friend of the receptionist who shares in the profits) with a van. After arriving at the station he tried to charge us 25 euro's for a 3 minute ride, a total scam! We paid 20 euro's in the end but that was still too much. And the good thing was, when we were waiting at the station, we saw the H2 and no. 2 bus drive by.

The breakfast buffet was ok but not great by North American standards, but actually quite good by Italian standards as it had hot items (bacon and eggs). My reference point is having spent about 8 weeks travelling in Italy over the past number of years. I also noted the problems wiith breakfast serving staff; my coffee drinking colleagues were often in a state of agitation by the time the coffee finally appeared!

Was travelling with our two young children so found Novotel an excellent value for 4 people as they allow kids to stay free (pullout double bed provided) The location from what we can tell is on the outskirts of Mestre, when you initially get there it appears to be in the middle of nowehere when the taxi drops you off, you don't see much but a freeway and a petrol station... however a short 10 minutes walk away are the shopping areas near the hospital where you can find decent restaurants and other shops (walk around the corner past the petrol station and then turn right and keep walking past the bus stop and trough the underpass and you will suddenly see shopping areas, don't turn right like I did, you just end up around a military base in a quiet resedential neighbourhood where you won't find any places to eat or ATMs!) the food prices seem cheap but they hit you with the drinks, but overall find it still cheaper to eat out there than Sydney... so I think the restaurants outside provide excellent value... not so for the restaurant in the hotel the servings are quite small and more expensive than the outside as you would expect, they always charge a premium for in hotel restaurants.. so if you don't mind the walk I recommend you eat out for a bit of variety and better value. The hotel provides an excellent buffet breakfast (included in the price of the stay) nice hot food, fresh juices, fresh bread, fresh fruit, cereal varities... gives you a good start for the day... The hotel is about a 20-30 minute bus ride into Venice , they provide a shuttle bus which gets fully booked all the time so you have to book a day or two in advance (eg. if you arrive this afternoon and want to go to venice tomorrow you are unlikely to get a spot)... the good news is there is a bus stop around the corner and the bus will take you to Venice for 1 Euro ... one tip though, the buses don't sell tickets on board so you must buy your tickets beforehand available at newsagents, petrol stations and the main bus ticket office in Venice itself.... Getting to the hotel is not the easiest as it's not close to Mestre train station (if like us, you are coming by train) , you will have to take a taxi from Mestre train station and pay about 10 euros to get to the hotel. The hotel provide maps of Mestre and Venice... the staff are polite and helpful however the hotel was very busy at that time we're there so you may end in the queue at times which is understandable.", "Date": "September 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "VIRGINIA", "Title": "\u201cNot too clean\u201d", "Author": "MM69", "ReviewID": "UR5722515", "Content": "The location was OK for us since we didn't want to stay in Venice. A free shuttle took us from Novotel to the main plaza to Venice entrance, about 15min-nice service. The smell on the hallways was strange (couldn't identify) and the room wasn't too clean. Blankets on the beds were old and smelled bad. The extra bed wasn't elegant at all, had metal edges/corners which could very easily hurt if you were not careful, plus not too much room left to walk around. Staff was OK and breakfast too. I believe 4 stars is too generous for this hotel.", "Date": "August 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cPoor Location\u201d", "Author": "stonefam", "ReviewID": "UR5494067", "Content": "This hotel is clean and comfortable however is poorly located. It is situated next to a busy onramp for a major highway intersection. Access from the airport [Marco Polo] is advertised as a 25 Euro taxi fare however our fare was 40 Euros both ways on a meter. If you wish to experience the atmsphere of a different culture and lifestyle then this is not the place to stay. It is a 20 minute walk via busy roads with no footpaths from any other civilisation in Mestre. The hotel shuttlebus to/from Venice is very good however doesn't allow you any flexibility. The restaurant in the hotel provides adequate meals however with no atmosphere. The nearest restaurant outside is excellent with great value for money dining in a very good atmosphere however can only be reached via a poorly lit walk on a busy road through an underpass that reeks of urine. There are many other hotels in Mestre at a similar price however they are in better locations. Internet access is provided on contract by 2 providors. It is problematic and very expensive unless you sign up as a long term customer. The hotel is promoted as 4 stars however I feel that is a little overrated. In the Accor chain it should be branded as an Ibis rather than a Novotel standard.", "Date": "July 21, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Novotel Venezia Mestre", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d293271-Reviews-Novotel_Venezia_Mestre-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$90 - $140*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Alfredo Ceccherini 21</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30174</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "293271", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/b4/c8/b4c801fdffcf7cd62dbff557de82cc607large.jpg"}}
