We had a Queen Studio Suite and the extra sitting area was plenty big and made the room feel nice and large. The decor is very clean, modern and highly attractive. We were really pleased with the overall quality of the furnishings as well. Some hotels don't live up to their photos shown on their website and we didn't find that to be the case with The James - what you see is what you get. The view from our room wasn't great, but that's to be expected for most hotel rooms. The free wireless internet access in the room was an added bonus and was definitely a nice feature.

There is a complimentary bottle of filtered water on the bedside table that is refilled every day, the staff is friendly and the bed is comfortable, with lovely down comforters. I had asked for a quiet room on a higher floor, away from the elevators and with a view (these are all options when you make your reservation, either online or on the phone) and that is exactly what we received. We were on the tenth floor (room 1014) and we were never bothered by street noise, other than the occasional siren.

The hotel is about the same price as most 4 stars hotel in town. But when you factor in the location, and the FREE Wi-Fi, this hotel's value is unbeatable. Also, if you book directly with the hotel, there's a good chance that you will be upgraded to a suite. I also got 20% off dinner at David Burke's Steakhouse, which came out to about 20 dollars for my meal. The hotel has a great gym, a nice bar (seemed popular on Sat), David Burke's Steakhouse in the lobby, but no pool. In the free-upgraded suite, the room has 2 awesome iphone/ipod docks, and 2 flatscreens, which is nice but... a bit unnecessary really haha. Overall this is a great choice for Chicago.

I wanted to make sure that was okay, and to be put in touch with an events coordinator. \"Of course it's okay, this is a 4 star hotel,\" was the response. Gee, thanks for treating me like a hick and sorry for asking for some details on a hotel I've never stayed at before. The events coordinator told me that no prior arrangement was needed - that there were items on the room service menu meant for parties, so I could just order those on the evening of my party. There aren't any such things on the menu, and when I called room service after I arrived, they were overwhelmed/confused about what I wanted. So, I went across the street to Trader Joes and did it myself - bought food (all cold, of course), cups, utensils, etc. I had rented an \"apartment,\" and it was nice and stylish and there was table space for food and drink and it was a great space for a get together - just wish the hotel could have helped me with my plans. Other negatives: lukewarm water only in the shower, which has no tub, a non - functioning TV, and a chair that was broken (noticed when a guest at my party sat down and almost fell over).

The location of the hotel is perfect - Michigan avenue is less than a block away and you can get nearly anywhere on a cab ride for under $10. By far the most impressive part of our stay was the level of service from the Bellhops. They were always eager to take luggage off our hands promptly, open doors, and hail cabs before we could even ask. They also had a house Audi that they whisked us into a couple times when we were heading to special parties or dinners. After spending a long time getting ready for those events it was nice to not get shoved into a crummy cab! The staff remembered our trips to specific events and restaurants and asked us how they'd gone when they welcomed us back. The professionalism of this team exceeded all expectations and I was very impressed. The rooms were comfortable - a bit smallish, but you'll experience that at generally any city hotel. The shower had good water pressure and was piping hot. The toiletries provided were spa quality and the mini bar was very well stocked. The gym is shoved away into the basement, so it's not exactly the most beautiful gym I've ever seen, but they did have a greater variety of equipment than most hotels. One of the best things about the James is that they won't nickel and dime you for extras like wi-fi and the gym - those amenities are included with your stay.

Not that that was a problem itself, but he had made such a big deal of the upgrade and the promo at the time was 'show the upgrade barcode on your phone for a free upgrade.' When we pointed out that the room was exactly what we had booked and NOT an upgrade, he insisted it was and had I not had a hard copy of the reservation, he still wouldn't have believed us to this day. Then he mumbled something about mixing us up with a different reservation and that 'oh, yes, here's yours. But sorry there are no upgrades available for that room' Not a good beginning, but the Jr Suite was adequate for our needs. There was an odd, hard banquette and a side chair made of paperclips, or so it seemed. The non-view was of exterior walls and other windows in some sort of interior courtyard arrangement. Couldn't even see the sky to see what weather might be happening outside. Location was excellent, as we knew it be, walking distance to restaurants and shopping. I made the mistake of asking the concierge a very routine question, but it just highlighted her lack of knowledge of anything outside her immediate realm of comfort and her reality. Tourists are interested in other things besides just where are the bars? Architecture and tours were beyond her and she couldn't even research on the internet very capably. Luckily, I had done most of my homework before coming, so we didn't need her. Our attempt to have breakfast one morning was met by FINALLY being acknowledged and being led to a long table for about 8. There was just 2 of us. When I asked if we could have a smaller table for 2, she said \"why, when you can have all the legroom you want here?\" So we went across the street and had great breakfasts for the rest of the week.

If a hotel puts effort into these small details, as well as, high end linens and down comforters, then they are paying attention to service and customer service too. There was a disconnect here at this hotel. The room was minimalist in every way. The bathroom was so small that only one person can be in there at one time. If you are brushing your teeth, another person can't get past you to get to the shower. We are average sized people. The room felt like a dorm room.

Let me explain, there is a pocket sliding door from the bedroom that when you open it you step into this tiny dressing area that has the closet and full length mirror and then to the left is the sink, toilette and tub/shower. This prevents possibly two people from being able to one use the bathroom and two get dressed at the same time. Liked the complemetary water bottle that was refilled daily.

There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a hook somewhere in the bathroom but only one and if it were over the portal, you could at least block some of the light. The shower has large jars of lotions/shampoos/etc. Maybe that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good earth friendly feature but a bad idea.

Came across multiple write-ups on The James in various guidebooks (Fodor's, Forbes/Mobil, Unofficial Guide, etc. + TripAdvisor), that, in general, seemed overwhelmingly positive. After also discovering that the hotel had a decent summer promotion rate available when we were going to be in Chicago, I booked four nights at The James. Wise move. The hotel is centrally located to every possible tourist destination worth walking to and only 4 blocks to an \"L\" station to take you to even more. The hotel also puts you in the midst of the restaurants and stores of N. Michigan Ave. and the bars/restaurants/galleries of River North. Our room was larger-than-expected (all we had to do was ask for it) and was kept spotlessly clean throughout our stay. Beds were exceptionally comfortable. Only minor grumble was the fact that we had to make due with the same small bar of soap in our bathroom (couldn't housekeeping see that it was melting down to a sliver and place a back-up bar on the sink counter?). The James has done away with Kiehl's in-room products (darn!) and has instead gone with eco-friendly large pump-dispenser bottles of shampoo, conditioner, & body wash that stay in the shower. A selection of almost-full-size bottles of booze were provided in the room's minibar, and a bucket of ice was left in the room every afternoon. Bathrobes & slippers were also provided. Didn't partake in the hotel's restaurant, spa, or gym, but the small bar was lively every night and decent drinks were served by a friendly bar staff. A selection of complimentary daily newspapers was available at the hotel's front desk each morning. Both check-in & check-out were a breeze.

I was looking for a smaller design/ boutique hotel as I wanted to avoid the standard choices like Hilton etc. Hence, I ended up in The James which made a good impression from the website and the reviews. However, it was a very big disappointment. The overall impression of the hotel is that it's already a bit \"worn down\" and needs a make-over. Despite having booked a kingsize room including a confirmation from the hotel, I was put in a double twin room. Apology of the hotel was very standard and they didn't offer me anything to make up for it despite an upgrade to a room at an additional rate of more than 250 USD a night. Up in the room I was shocked from the poor design and the general layout of the room. It wasn't up to design hotel standards at all and I was rather disappointed. However, this might be rather a matter of personal taste. The broken window, the broken a/c, the loud noise from the street despite being in 11th floor and the dirt on the flow however aren't a question of personal taste. This was just unacceptable. I complained immediately at reception, however, they couldn't offer me an alternative room. An engineer came to fix the a/c. He didn't really succeed. It was extremely loud when switched on, has only one fan speed and when you switched it off it got hot in the room very quickly (although outside temperatures were in the low 60s). Moreover, the street noise was very loud and you could hear the traffic during day and night. Furthermore the walls of the room rather reminded me of a cheap youth hostel instead if an upscale hotel. You could clearly hear when the people on the neighboring room were watching TV or just closing the curtains. The maids on the floor also were very noisy and you could hear them talk from 7am in the morning. Doors and walls are just very thin and just seem to serve as a visual and not voice protection. In general the staff was rather arrogant and not very helpful.

Near perfect. It contributed positively to my wonderful vacation to Chicago. Now the story...I stayed at the James Chicago for 5 nights, Aug 25 - 31, 2011 with my girlfriend. We booked a one king bed suite and just walking into the room was enough to make my day. The bed sheets were folded in an esthetically-pleasing way and the bed was so comfy. There was a small bench in a small cutout in the wall with a desk, a nice feature if you want to read a book or use a laptop. The washroom and closet were combined and separated from the rest of the room with a sliding door, better than and not as boring as your ordinary washroom door. Curtains did a good job blocking out the sun when we slept in on a morning. The hotel gives you a complimentary bottle of purified water on the night table along with two glasses. I enjoyed this civilized practice, better than drinking from the tap. Of course...in suite bar and snacks are in the drawer at extra price. There is free wifi in the room and free boarding pass printing (all other printing at a cost). All staff were very nice and courteous to us. There were at least two receptionists at all time, bellmen, a concierge and even floating employees (not bellmen) who were there to assist with anything from holding the door to helping store luggage. I felt like a king when one employee opened the door of our taxi back to the hotel and another opened the door into the hotel. My girlfriend and I were out and about a lot so we didn't have a chance to use the amenities. However, I did go downstairs to check out the fitness centre and it had an abundance of weight machines that any gym macho would feel satisfied with. There was a bar in the main floor that formal guests seemed to enjoy drinking at (even in the lobby), attached to a steakhouse. Overall, it was a great stay and I am sure anyone who can afford this will consider this money well spent. Regardless, this was a near perfect stay, but not perfect. The only knock I give this is that the bellmen seem a little too pushy when it comes to assisting with luggage handling. When we wanted to get a taxi to the airport, the bellman pretty much snatched the luggage out of my hands, called the taxi and loaded the luggage himself, all actions that a young man like me could do on my own. I tipped knowing that it was standard to do so, but they bellman should back off a little bit because not all guests wish for their services.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "illinois", "Title": "\u201cmy favorite hotel in chicago. excellent decor, excellent service.\u201d", "Author": "loungedog", "ReviewID": "UR117771022", "Content": "The James is ideally located just a block off Michigan Avenue near Water Tower.

Also, they checked us in 4 hrs early AND we checked out 4 hrs late (for $100 late check-out), which accommodated our train schedule beautifully. The only thing that keeps them from a perfect score is that the soap dispenser fell off the wall the first night. The maids took away the dispenser and the desk gave us shampoo because the shampoo dispenser broke in the fall. They were also some minor stains on the love seat. Without these two very minor issues, we would give it a 5. We loved the ease of walking everywhere but are physically fit (50 &51).

Pros: Loved the room layout. LOVED the bed!!! Huge comfortable pilows, thick mattress. Sitting area far enough away from sleeping area - both with flat screen TVs (though we never watched the TV). Front desk staff was polite and professional. We were able to check in early on Friday. Cleaning lady was personable. We either didn't have any neighbors, or the room was almost soundproof. Close to restaurants and shopping. Cons: Room temperature. There was a huge mirror propped against the air unit to hide the fact that the door was ajar and had been worked on recently. It never did get cool enough and we would wake many times throughout the night sweating. We mentioned it to the front desk and when we got back to our room that night, the unit door was wide open exposing wires and mechanic items. Could not get it below 72 degrees and that was in the living area, not the sleeping area...which was much warmer. One other issue was there is a single cup coffee maker - and a single cup for it. Two pkts of coffee, but only one cup, so only one of us could drink a cup of coffee at a time, then rinse out the cup so the other person could make a cup. Really? No fridge and though it's not a deal-breaker, it would have been nice. We ended up just going down the block to a Starbucks. Lastly for cons, when we arrived, the doorman collected our bags from the trunk and took them inside while we were paying the driver. We went inside, the driver left, and my hooded, zippered, DMB sweatshirt had been left in the trunk (along with a large striped umbrella). Doorman says he didn't see them - even thought the interior of the truck was light colored and there were no other items in the trunk. Thank goodness the front desk was able to contact the taxi service, who contacted the driver, who brought it back for me. So make sure you have everything out of the truck before the driver leaves - even if the doorman has shut it.

The general upkeep of the common areas left a lot to be desired, it took 48 hours for housekeeping to vacum up plasterboard scattered on the carpet on the level 12 lift lobby, and only after we complained.

I wanted my last night to be in a nearby location to Felix. I was in Chitown location scouting for a film, and taking in theatre and Improv. I left a message for Meg, to see if they would honor or match the rate at the Felix, and they did that, AND SO MUCH MORE, AMAZING! I thank both Felix and James on this Chicago trip (both cool eco-friendly hotels:). The James really out did themselves though. They offered me an upgrade, without me even asking. I went from a cool queen to a very cool lofty king, literally a two bedroom loft (1221). It was exquisitely decorated and loaded with TV's, a movie projector, and even an old school boom box, with a modern ipod docking station (and a loaded bar, but I am on the wagon). James also has one of my favorite toiletries, Kiehl's (check out the Kiehl's NYC headquarters at 13th and 1st). Felix and James both have Spa Asha, very nice, great massages at both, BUT James wins out for you gym rats! The gym at James is loaded, and size matters, it's huge! (I almost didn't care that neither Felix or James has a pool). The Julies at James were amazingly helpful at the front desk (the whole staff was very cool and professional). James also wins out in the 'check-out' time, they are willing to accommodate most reasonable requests (I checked out at 2:30, that made life so much easier, I was able to even catch an Architecture boat tour! Ask the concierge for anything, just ask nicely, and tip that gang well, they deserve every dollar!). I was so impressed with James, I left a voice mail message with Patrick, the GM. He returned my call within an hour. I was already in the air, heading back to Austin. Patrick left a kind message, personally inviting me back to James on my next visit (fyi-James SoHo NYC is also fantastic!). So I say thank you James Chicago, and to you travelers (of all ages), check out James Chicago!!! Chi is the American birth place of Improv. I strongly suggest you check out Improv Olympic's \"TJ and Dave\" Wednesday @ 11:00 PM in the Cabaret Theater (tickets are $5.

We remained calm even though we had travelled all day and then sat in the lobby. In the mean time, I watched and heard other people yelling at the staff...and they get upgrades! So frustrating! So, after sitting in the lobby for over an hour, I went back and they kept saying \"it's almost ready!\" Finally after 2 hours we got in our rooms - and it was HOT. We were pretty much told to deal with it. They did comp 1 night out of the 4...after that, they didn't want to hear any problems. We turned the air down to 50 degrees, and the room was between 65-75 the whole time. When it's 90 degrees out, that's not comfortable. All in all, it was too overpriced for these issues.

There was no mention of a delay, so we decided to stay in the lobby bar until they called us. After 2 hours of waiting, we went back to the front desk to check on the status. At this point we were told that they were experiencing delays with their rooms because an elevator had broken down, and they offered us free breakfast the next morning. That was fine, except at this point it was already almost two hours past check in time (2pm). We checked back again and were told the room is undergoing \"final inspection\" and were handed the keys at 4:30pm. The room was very warm and humid upon arrival, and the service door to the AC unit was wide open with a mirror that was supposed to be in front of it positioned at a 90 degree angle. We called to ask why the room was in this condition, and we were told by housekeeping that the AC had been broken, so they had to keep the windows open all day to air it out. We cranked the AC down to 50 degrees, and it finally kicked on. Upon further inspection, there was also a towel that looked like it had been left behind from the previous guests. To top it off, the next morning when we called to get our free breakfast, the room service person kept arguing with us about the number of free breakfasts we were supposed to get. She claimed it was only for 2 people, but we had been given certificates for 3 people. After hanging up, she proceeded to mistakenly call us back and ask \"how many free breakfasts is room #... supposed to have?\" (she had intended to call the front desk). Totally awkward! The only reason I am giving the hotel 2 stars instead of 1 star is that they did offer us free breakfast and free valet service for our trouble.

Unfortunately, I failed to read the reviews that do warn you of the noise, the thin walls, old furnitures and all other things that would have prevented me from booking the suite. My husband and I brought our 2 year old with us. I am a law student and he works for the military. All in all we don't money to throw away. We have been waiting months to finally save up enough money to book a trip. We were incredibly excited and we don't have vacations much so we booked a big room through James (the apartment suite) which all in all was above 200 bucks a night. When we arrived, the staff that helped us was courteous, friendly, and nice. When we got to our room, it had spots on the couch (gross) that they could have easily cleaned with a spot remover, old and broken hardboards, and the furniture were all old looking. As much as they tried to be trendy with the ikea style design, it lacked the relaxing atmosphere we were looking forward to. We got over it quickly and left to walk around chicago. My son had a viral infection so we decided to come back early to sleep. We laid in bed around 9. Much to our dismay, we could not sleep. I was already a light sleeper, on the other hand, both my husband and son are not. They sleep like a rock through any loud noise BUT we all could not fall asleep because all we heard were loud obnoxious drunks, people yelling at each other, cars honking nonstop...I could go on and on. At this point I was frustrated, cranky and disappointed. For the amount we paid, it was comparable to sleeping OUTSIDE, of course with a bed. That's how thin the walls were. It wasn't like faded noise, it was LOUD LOUD LOUD noise. I called the front desk at 3 am and the lady was incredibly rude. I am assuming because they get that complaint a lot. She said that there were no rooms available an to wait until the next day. So we decided to try again. Still, all we can hear were loud people and cars so we requested some ear plugs. As for the food- breakfast was bland. We also ordered my son burgers and it tasted like crap. We ordered a chocolate milk sized SMALL and they brought up a large, plain milk. The milk itself cost about 6 bucks. Room service did fix it but it tasted like crap. Again, bland chocolate milk. Not sweet at all an you can barely taste the chocolate. The only good thing is their location. Everything else (except the doorman outside) was either mediocre or horrible. I definitely can say that we wasted our money. Honestly, if you are looking for a place to party or go to after bar hopping this is for you. You will be too drunk to even care for the noise. However, if you want a relaxing and enjoyable stay, I suggest you go elsewhere. Last vacation we had, we booked a junior suite with sofitel. The service there was outstanding.

The James is within convenient walking distance to many of the attractions of downtown Chicago, and cabs to further destinations were plentiful. We had what I believe the hotel refers to as a \"Media Suite\", which means that one end of the suite has a projector DVD player so you can watch videos projected on the wall opposite a king-size bed situated in a fairly private nook (although it had no door). The other end of the suite had a platform king-size bed, and in the middle was a living area with a long couch that would have been fine for an adult to sleep on, had one of the teens wanted her own separate place to sleep. It was quite roomy for four people, and we never felt cramped at all. The suite was stylishly but comfortably decorated with contemporary furniture: leather seating, a table/desk with wire chairs, and end tables apparently fashioned from tree stumps. There was also a beautiful wet bar with some of the nicest glassware I've seen in a hotel as well as a mini-coffeemaker that tided us over in the morning. The James is an \"art hotel\", with some interesting installations in the lobby including a pile of about 45 suitcases containing torn-apart hotel beds. It's also a popular meeting spot in the evening, with a busy lobby bar scene. One of the highlights of the hotel was the David Burke steakhouse located on the first floor, which my family avowed to be the best steakhouse they've visited. The desk staff was polite and the doormen were very attentive and helpful for securing cabs and giving directions and advice. We felt very comfortable and welcome during our stay. Only two minor complaints: the bathroom had a sliding door that did not close all the way, leading to some grumbling from those seeking more privacy; and the room keys never worked more than one time, necessitating that we replace them FOUR TIMES in two days -- aarrgh!! Meaning that we would go to the room, no one's key would work even if they had not been near cell phones or anything magnetic, and we would have to return to the lobby for a replacement set. Four times. And we weren't even in the hotel that much during our stay.

A couple of gripes that I did have was the cost of valet at the hotel. My friend dropped us off and for him to park 3-6 hours it was over 40 dollars. A little high, but I guess thats the price for being in downtown. Another complaint that I had was they charged us wrong when we ate at the Primehouse. It took three calls to the front desk before this could get straightened out. Kinda bad service considering the caliber of the restaurant and of the hotel.

My wife and I are frequent travellers to Chicago, and we have stayed in various hotels in the downtown area. On our most recent trip, we had no preference of hotel, we just wanted to stay downtown. So, being somewhat adventurous, I booked a \"mystery\" hotel on a third party site, you know, the site that tells you about the hotel, but won't reveal the name until you book your stay. Well, my mystery hotel was the James. I immediately checked TripAdvisor and found the James had many rave reviews. I was thinking no hotel could be this good, but if it was half as good as the reviews, I would be thrilled. I'm here to tell you, believe the reviews. The James is truely a gem. When we pulled up in front of the James, we were greeted by the valet and bellman who both introduced themselves by name, unloaded our bags, explained the valet procedure to us, and directed us to the desk, where the desk clerk introduced himself by name and welcomed us to the James. The whole check-in process from the time we pulled up to the door to the time we were in our rooms and bags delivered was approximately 10 minutes. Our bellman was very informative and helpful, offering us several suggestions of things to do and directions if necessary. Our room was on the 14th floor, which was a surprize. I was expecting a small room on a low floor next to an elevator (what I usually get when booking on a 3rd party site ;-) What we got was a spacious room with a king bed and large screen tv. The bed was extremely comfortable, one of the best I've ever encountered at any hotel. There was also a fully stocked in-room bar with top shelf liquors at our disposal. I read in a prior review that the rooms did not have a clock. Our room did, and it also projected the time on the ceiling. The following morning we ate breakfaft at the hotel restaurant and ordered the James omlette. The omlette was awsome! But come hungry, it is a bit large. In my book, the James omlette is a must-do!

If you answered YES to any of the above, then The James is the place for you. This past weekend I spent my 23rd birthday in Chicago. After scouring the 'net for hotel deals (for some reason people avoid traveling to areas where it snows in the winter--being from Texas, I relish it), I came across The James at $139/night through Travelzoo.com. Alone this would be a total steal (rooms generally run ~$250/night), and ON TOP of that a $100 food/beverage voucher was included for use at either David Burke's Primehouse, their in-house bar/lounge JBar, or In-Room Dining (more on that later). A separate spiel must be made for their concierge service/staff. A week or so before arriving I had e-mail correspondence with Daisy (such a pleasure to communicate with), to have \"The Anniversary\" amenity (a bottle of champagne along with these delicious bite-size brownie morsels topped with raspberries) awaiting my guest and I in our room before arrival. However, when we arrived--the amenity was not in our room. Not a big deal, I called down and they had someone send it up in under 5 minutes. But, the little card to accompany the surprise was not included. Again, no big deal. Thought nothing of it. Fast forward to the next day, my actual birthday. My guest and I hit the town for the majority of the day, returning early evening. Upon entry, I notice the card from yesterday WITH a plate of cookies (how thoughtful, I say to myself). THEN, I turn the corner to find a plate of birthday cupcakes with my OWN card signed by the entire concierge staff? Yes indeed, the sweetness overrunneth. FINALLY, as my guest and I sit down to enjoy piping hot Giordano's (the best in the city)--there's a knock at the door. It's Mirna the head concierge to apologize for forgetting the card yesterday and for the delayed delivery of the champagne with a tray of breadsticks and ice-cold beer !!! How did they know this would be the perfect addition to our meal?!? I have no idea, I just know I love them for it. Other Pros: Kiehl's bath products. Luxurious. Nightly turn-down service. Stayed two nights, two different cookies on my pillow. Room Service.

Best room service I've ever eaten. They serve 24-hours a day too, including an enticing \"late-night\" menu which I'm surprised my guest and I didn't take advantage of--I think we passed out on the 300-thread count sheets before we picked up the phone.

The deal couldn't compare to anything else we found while researching hotel options in the location. After seeing the hotel and the room we were assigned, we were blown away by the value we got with this promotion. The hotel itself is in a perfect location with pretty much everything you can think of close by - or just a short cab ride away. The building doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you step inside you realize immediately that the hotel is something quite different from the rest. This isn't like any hotel we ever stayed in before and the chic modern design and attention to style made our stay that much more special. There is a great pizza place just a couple blocks away (Giordano's... with a 1.5 hour wait that was definitely worth it) and there's a Starbucks, bank and grocery store right across the street in case you happen to have any urgent need for caffeine, cash or goodies. All the staff at the James we dealt with were great - they helped us find our way around the City and even loaned us a couple umbrellas on the rainy days. The only complaint we have is that the free WiFi service in the hotel is inconsistent and there were a few periods over our three night stay when we were not able to access the Internet to look up City information from our rooms on either of our computers. My friend said she was glad she wasn't there on business since it would have been very disconcerting. There were, however, computers in the lobby for guest use so we were able to obtain the information we needed easily.

Greg arranged a wonderful birthday surprise--three delicious mini-cupcakes (red velvet with cream cheese icing-YUM!!) delivered to my room. The hotel is ideally located for shopping and dining--most everything I needed was in walking distance (the West Egg is perfect for breakfast). The gym was well equipped and the staff at the hotel's spa were gracious and accommodating. The contemporary room was spacious (I had a studio suite) and clean; the bathroom was spotless (the bathrobe was comfy) with excellent Kiehl products. The bed was heavenly--a good night's sleep each evening--and the turn down service is a nice touch. The mini-bar was well-stocked with great items (of course at the usual high mini-bar prices). The business center had both Mac's and PC's and the free wi-fi is a plus. If I had to give any critique, it would be the following: The bathtub was starting to peel a little bit. Also, if you want a view from your room, be sure to request an outside-facing room. The inside-facing rooms (which I had) have no view (you look directly into other rooms) and it makes the room very dark--even on sunny days. Still, these things did not detract from a wonderful stay.

The night before our stay, I called the hotel to make sure that we were NOT in a smoking room. I had read a previous post on trip advisor from someone who had gotten stuck with a smoking room. Since I am currently pregnant, I didn't feel like taking in some second hand smoke. The young lady who answered the phone assured me we had A NON-SMOKING KING ROOM. Well fast forward to check-in, guess what??? We were in a smoking room! I explained to the man at the front desk that I had called the day before to confirm and he said \"that's what you get when you book through Hotwire.\" Nice. So we had to pay $60 for an \"upgrade\" of the exact same room we were going to be staying in to begin with. We just moved up 2 floors...wow. Our room by the way was definitely not equipped with a king sized bed. It was obvioulsy a queen. The hotel decor was very modern but honestly not that impressive. The elevators were teeny tiny and you always had to wait FOREVER since they only had those two tiny elevators which had to make stops on like each floor. Room service was super expensive, but luckily I had read that the breakfasts across the street at E'leven were awesome. And they were! So overall, I'm very dissappointed with this hotel. Maybe it was because we \"made the mistake\" of booking through hotwire. And I still don't understand why we had to pay for an upgrade, yet we ended up in a smaller room two floors up?!!!", "Date": "October 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cbrilliant hotel\u201d", "Author": "kathros", "ReviewID": "UR82491491", "Content": "This is one of the nicest hotel i have stayed in.

I found a significantly better rate at the James than the conference rate offered at the Marriott, plus at the time I booked the James offered a free room upgrade and free breakfast every day either in the restaurant or in room. All in all, I was very happy with the choice I'd made. My upgraded King room was spacious and I really liked: the spare modernist furniture and fixtures; ;the nook with a small table where I used my computer; the design of the room which made best use of the space, including an ample closet with built in cubes/shelves; the art work (though I didn't much care for the used suitcase installation by the lobby elevator); the fact that my window could be opened; and the nightly turn-down service with a different type of cookie every night. There is also an exceptional gym for such a relatively small hotel with dumbells up to 75 pounds and a fair collection of quality equipment (though it's in the basement with no windows). My quibbles concerned the wireless internet service--free!, but painfully slow. When I registered my feedback with the internet provider--never botherd to tell the hotel staff--the internet provider sent me an email stating they had checked the service and it was perfectly fine, and that other guests were happily surgin the net with no complaints. I know that was BS as the speed on the desktop computers provided in the lobby--(they even had a Mac--was no better when I used it to print out my boarding pass. Other quibbles: my room definitely smelled of stale smoke, but I told the front desk when I went out that evening and they managed to improve it about 90% while I was gone. Also, my tub drain didn't work, but they fixed that too. Did not care for the flat modernist bathroom sink which was not very functional. Also I thought a boutique hotel of this caliber should have had an Ipod docking station instead of a CD player on the radio. On the other hand, the radio worked much better than most and pulled in the NPR station well. i should also mention that all the staff with whom I dealt were exceptionally nice and helpful, including the housekeepers and the room service person on night duty.

The room was a good size with a king size bed, extra seating area and a long bench for both our bags (hallelujah, no one ever has that). The room had a big high window which let in lots of light - or none if you rolled down the blind. Unfortunately our view looked down on airconditioners on top of the building across the road, but if you looked up you could see the city buildings - no biggie. The room was very modern and had a stereo and a big flat screen TV. The bathroom was pretty cool, very modern and clean. Our room was very quite at the end of a hallway. Our only complaint was that the entrance door and the door to the bathroom were very screechy which was a problem if one of us went to the toilet in the middle of the night (should have mentioned that to the hotel but we didn't). Our room included breakfast in the restaurant on the ground floor which had great service and beautiful food. We ate out for lunches/dinners. There was complimentary internet access in the foyer (love that) and the concierge staff were very helpful on a couple of occasions when we needed transport info to get to Wrigley field and a few other little issues. The hotel is close to lots of restaurants and only one block from the Magnificent Mile. The hotel doesn't have a laundry for guests who wish to do their own, but we were referred over to the Four Points Sheraton across the road, where we told them we were staying at The James and they arranged for us to go up to their laundry room (they only had one washer and one dryer, but there was no one there when we arrived).

The hotel is in an great location and is an easy walk to many shops, nightclubs and other attractions. The lobby is simple and functional the folks behind the counter were very courteous. My corporate travel department booked the king room for me. I went up to that room (the elevators are a bit small) and the room was huge, with a nice bed, big bathroom, an unusual couch and other nice amenities. It was right about then I noticed the stale stink of cigarettes - and then noticed the ashtrays. I called down to the front desk and asked them to switch me, they did not have another king room and told me the only thing they could do is downgrade me to a room with two double beds. Knowing that I would be miserable in that smoking room I took it - and reminded myself to find out why my corporate travel folks did not make sure my preferences were met. The double room was small but adequate. The double beds were comfy and the shower was good. The sink was a unusual, it was flat instead of being a bowl and the water just kind of hung out in the sink. The closet in this room was tiny and I chose to live out of my suitcase. The television, while being a nice flatscreen, had too few channels to choose from. The room had a full bar and the turn down service at night provided me with a cookie on each bed and a full ice bucket. The blinds in the room were a nightmare - they rolled up just fine, but rolling them down was a huge pain and I needed to get a towel out of the bathroom to keep the metal balls on the chain from cutting into my skin.

There had a been a couple of snags at the Monaco (neither serious, good stay overall) so we were looking forward to the James. On arrival we were checked in promptly, and were told that we being upgraded. When we went up to the room we were intially a bit disappointed- it was a bit on the small side (but adequate), and on further inspection there were signs of wear; furniture scuffed in places, messy sealant round the window, a freyed bathmat and a hole in a pillow. We had to ask for an extra robe and slippers, both swiftly resolved. None serious and didn't impact upon our stay (bathmat and pillow covers replaced. Forgot about sealant). The design ethos, minimalistic, was perhaps a bit bare but it was modern and relaxing- Monaco had stripey wallpaper and red upholstery, so James was a nice change. Couple of other small things; late check out not possible (we asked for 2 additional hours. But they did keep our bags, so again, resolved) as the hotel was fully booked and the bikes were not available (as much our fault for not booking sooner). Overall our stay was positive. In the evening the room had a nice view over the city lights, turndown service with treats (tasty choc-chip cookies), very comfortable bed and the location is great. Plently of eateries and bars round about (we ate twice at Mia Francesca on Chestnut and Bandera on Michigan. Rockbottom Brewery is good pub option, food OK). No problem with noise, we were on 14th floor, but it is the middle of a city so expect to hear sirens etc. The bar makes a good cocktail, although one of the staff members was a bit weird and kept asking if we had a tab or if we had paid. Cocktail prices were reasonable, $10-12. We didn't use spa or gym. Spa quite pricey- as in UK hotels- but loass of places round about offering a mani and pedi for $40, but don't expect luxury! Trader Joe's across the road is good for supplies- health food bent, Whole Foods market about 5 minutes. We had breakfast, and very good coffee, from Eleaven across the road; bagels, muffins, omlettes etc. Further up on Clark there is a place called Tempo Cafe, classic American breakfasts which are available all day. Transport not as handy as the Loop, but OK. Most things within walking distance anyway (within 30 mins walk).

Our room had a King bed, and I would describe the room size as spacious for a downtown hotel. The service was mostly good. Check in was quick and easy. We needed extra towels and someone had them to our room in less than two minutes. The only problem was that our air conditioning was running at full capacity on a very hot weekend. It was a little warm, but they did try to fix it and got us a fan when we couldn't get it cooled down. No big deal, but we're not real high maintenance! Overall a good stay.

For this trip, however, we decided to split our stay between the Ritz and the James, enticed as we were by a bargain rate from a private sale website, favourable TA reviews, and the James' own attractive website. We were not at all disappointed. The two hotels have entirely different vibes but have great, friendly service and amenities. The James' motto, from their website, is \"luxury liberated from tradition\", meaning without the \"traditional bonds of formality...constrained by excess and empty ostentation\". As such, the hotel is contemporary and stylish, with interesting artwork in the public spaces and rooms. The hotel was redone as the James four years ago--it was another hotel prior to that, so this is an older building, as demonstrated by the 2 small elevators that are not too speedy. Think of the W hotel chain, but with overall better service. And the hotel's staff is a major strong point--they are uniformly young and attractive, but very friendly (some effervescently so), competent, and well-trained--all we encountered lived up to the hotel's motto. The place is pet-friendly too, with a bowls of treats and water at the entrance. The location, one block west of Michigan Ave. on the corner of Ontario and Rush St., is great--lots of restaurants and shops just steps away in any direction. A big plus--a Trader Joe's market is across the street. I would not consider this a hotel with substation views. There is and adequate fitness center and a small spa in the basement (no pool). There are a generous 5 guest-accessible computers. We probably had one of the smaller room categories, and it was fine--large enough for a sitting area with a built-in settee and table/desk, plus a Mies van der Rohe-like chair and ottoman done in red vinyl. The bathroom was small but stocked with Kiehl's products and eco-friendly soap. The bed was fabulously comfortable, and the turndown cookie treats delicious. We had wanted to try the restaurant for breakfast, but it didn't work out. We did order room service twice, and it is provided by the restaurant. The menu is an abridged version of the restaurant's--the food was tasty but not outstanding--certainly better and more interesting than standard room service fare. There is no newspaper delivery to the rooms, but there are complimentary copies of several papers in the lobby for the taking. There are also several cute Paul Frank bikes in the lobby guests can use for free--alas, we had previously rented bikes elsewhere for the duration of our visit, but the hotel gladly stored them for us. All in all, we had wonderful stays at both hotels for this trip. For a luxury chain like the Four Seasons (which manages the Chicago Ritz), traditional, formal service is a better fit for us. But it is always a pleasant surprise when a boutique hotel like the James can pull off a similar level of service with a more casual, modern air.", "Date": "June 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location - Modern Casual Luxury\u201d", "Author": "Happy_TravelerMPLS", "ReviewID": "UR66989791", "Content": "We stayed at the James Hotel for a long weekend and it did not disappoint us. The hotel location is ideal. We were able to walk to everything from the hotel without taking a cab, with the exception of a couple of restaurants in the evening (nice clothes, heals -it's better to take a cab than to rough it!). The concierge at the hotel was very helpful with restaurant reservations - he was able to get us a table at the famous Charlie Trotter's restaurant with only a couple days notice. I'd say the typical clientele at this hotel was younger (20-40s). There was a lot of energy at the hotel during cocktail hour with the bar being packed every night. Even though the bar/lobby was very popular it collectively had a low key vibe that made it very inviting and comfortable. We will definetly try this hotel again with our next trip to Chicago! RESTAURANT NOTES: Charlie Trotters: Although the service was exceptional, and the food cooked perfectly, the taste was nothing exceptional and we found that it was not worth the price or rave reviews this establishment has received over the years (we are foodies and are more than willing to pay for great food). Japanais: Asian Fusion and Sushi restaurant. Very trendy decor, good food, and romantic ambience. I wouldn't classify this as an authentic asian experience, but it was a fun restaurant that I would attend occasionally if I lived in Chicago. Le Lan: Smaller Vietnamese restaurant a short walk from the hotel. Intimate decor and ambience and excellent food. If you enjoy a non commercial dining experience and Asian food, this is a good choice while in Chicago. TRU: Very Expensive, but in my opinion woth every penny. We went to TRU many years ago and I still remember it like it was yesterday. The service is second to none ( I had a chair for my purse, and I was escorted to the bathroom - a little over kill, I admit). The waiter to customer ratio for us was 1:1 for serving the food; we had 6 in our party. The waiters placed and took away are plates perfectly choreographed as a team.

Everything was just great, from the car service they use to the bath room products. And for a very reasonable price too. We had to take our son to the ER while we were there and the guys at the door really made an effort getting us a cab quickly and making sure the driver knew where to take us. Two minor hick-ups: 1. We asked for a crib, but never got one, but since the room had two large beds we never reminded them - our son would probably have ended up sleeping in our beds anyway. 2. I Got a call from front desk at 4.40 in the morning on the day of our departure, because apparently somone on the floor above (room 1515 irc) thought we were making too much noise. We weren't (we were sound asleep), and neither was anyone else in that section of the 14th floor.

Nice interior, full wet bar (and a minibar), very good housekeeping. I actually liked not having a desk in the room - but then again I was on vacation. WiFi included, might seem like a small thing, but I really cant stand it when hotels charge extra for an internet connection. We had dinner and breakfast at the hotel restaurant (Primehouse) and enjoyed it - it is however a bit pricey. But, if you're travelling on a budget there's a Trader Joe's right across the street, a Whole Foods a few blocks northwest and another grocery store a few blocks southwest.

This sounded like a pretty good deal to me. The day before Cyber Monday, I went onto the James Hotel Website to read about the credits-- the fine print stated that the credits were good for one year and didn't mention any blackout dates or restrictions. Ok, that's good because I wasn't planning our trip to Chicago until mid April 2010. The next day I went onto the website and bought $500 worth of credits. I didn't even notice that they had added one or two new sentences to the \"terms and conditions\" section- which now stated that complimentary credits were good until March 31st, 2010 and subject to certain blackout dates and restrictions, and can't be used in conjuction with any other offers. I guess my mistake for not re-reading the terms. So as soon as I realized this, I immediately called the hotel and explained that I hadn't noticed they added to the \"terms and conditions\" section, and could they please either let me use the credits two weeks past March 31st, or refund my purchase. The hotel would absolutely NOT budge or try to work with me in anyway. So I was down $500 and stuck with $1000 worth of credits to a hotel that I had to use by March 31st. My husband and I are currently living in Europe where he is employed at the moment. He has a break and we're going back to the States for the month of April. We both love Chicago and vacation there often, so that's why I bought the credits in hopes to use for April. I always think I'm being a great bargain shopper, but it often times backfires in my face and I end up wishing I would have just paid full price! So now that I was stuck with these James Credits, my husband and I talked it over and decided they should not go to waste. He said I should go to Chicago with a friend of mine so they could be used before March 31st. So my friend and I took the vacation that my husband and I were supposed to go on in April! I'm lucky he was so understanding. When I went to the James Hotel website to book our room, I saw they were selling rooms for less than $130/night... and on another travel site those rooms even included perks like a $50 GC to use toward the restaurant/room service! But because I was using my \"James Credits\" I was forced to book the highest rate which was over $200/night- so I wasn't even getting much of a deal at all! Upon check-in, I asked the front desk lady if there were any rooms larger than the others because my friend and I would be staying for 6 nights and I had heard from reviews that some rooms were bigger, and if you ask for them you can sometimes get those ones. She was pretty rude and just raised her eyebrow at me and said they're all the same. The room we got was tiny. I don't know if the lady did this on purpose because she was angry I asked for a bigger room, or if they were all just that small. Now my friend and I were both coming from Europe where everything is a bit smaller, but every hotel that I have stayed at in Europe has had a bigger room/bathroom than the James Hotel. My friend and I decided to upgrade to a loft suite for an extra $80/night. The suite was nice, although some of the furnishings seemed a little cheap to me. PROS: -Great location. If you don't care what your room looks like or how big it is, and you can find a good deal, may as well stay here because the location is one of the best. Starbucks, Trader Joe's, a sushi restaurant, and cute little breakfast place right across the street. The hotel is a block from central Michigan Ave, and a block from the Luxe Cafe... where we definitely ate a couple times.... -The housekeeping staff did a great job and were very friendly. They even organized my bathroom stuff that I had left out all over the place one day. Everytime we got back to our room, it seems like it had been magically cleaned. I think they did service twice a day (I don't know if that's because we had a suite or if they do that for all the rooms). And they somehow always knew when we weren't in the room because they never bothered us like at a lot of other hotels where it seems like they're banging on your door at 7 am and yelling \"housekeeping!!!\" or walking into your room when you're in the shower. -Beds are really comfortable (comparable to the Westin Heavenly Beds) but I like soft and squishy, so if you like firm mattresses, these may not be for you. -Kiehl's bath amenities were a great perk. I never use the toiletries that hotels provide, but this was the first time I actually wanted to use them instead of my own stuff. Really high quality products. CONS: -The whole debacle with the James Credits, which alone, will probably prevent me from returning to this hotel in the future. The lack of flexibility they showed, especially since this is a boutique hotel and not a huge chain. It would have been easy to contact upper management and make an exception to let me use the credits in mid April. Usually boutique hotels can offer this kind of \"special treatment\" in certain circumstances. -Small guestrooms, small bathrooms, small closets... the double beds even seemed to be somewhere between the size of a double and a twin, and not a true double -Much of the furniture in the guestrooms and even in the loft suite seemed cheap and flimsy... I'm pretty sure a lot of it was from IKEA -Rude and somewhat arrogant front desk staff -The bar/lounge in the lobby doesn't stay open late enough. I think it closes around 10 pm which then forces you to go to J Bar, which is more of a club than a lounge where you can just sit and have a casual drink -J Bar had kind of a pretentious vibe. Definitely saw a lot of creepy old men with what looked like Russian mail order brides-- not the hotel's fault though, obviously OVERVIEW In my opinion, this hotel has been over-hyped in reviews. It's a very average 4 star hotel, nowhere near 5 stars. It's location saves it... as well as the awesome housekeeping staff. Stay here if you can find a good deal and plan on spending most your time outside of your room- which most people do anyway- but I always love coming back to my hotel room after a long day out and about, and feeling like it's so much nicer than being in my own bedroom... and this place did not give me that feeling, I would have rather been in my own bedroom than the small, starkly furnished/decorated guestrooms at The James. I never used the gym or spa, or ate at the restaurant, so I can't comment on them. Other hotels I have stayed at in Chicago- I will list them in order of the ones I liked best: *InterContinental on Michigan Ave- great location, feels very luxurious, great breakfast buffet *Westin Michigin Ave- not quite as luxurious as the InterContinental, good sized rooms, our dog stays for free at is treated well, good location *The Talbott Hotel- now this is a true boutique hotel, smaller rooms but still felt luxurious, had evening snacks like cookies/hot chocolate which was a nice perk *The Hyatt Regency on E Wacker- great customer service, mentioned we saw a beetle in our bathroom upon check-out and they comped our parking for the entire stay (don't take advantage, people!), good breakfast buffet, unfortunately they don't allow pets and we usually travel with our litte guy I would probably choose The James over these two: *Swissotel- nothing really stands out, a bit further off Michigan Ave *Radisson Michigan Ave- not very nice rooms according to my memory Next time we travel to Chicago, we'll either stay at the InterContinental, Westin, Talbott, or try Hotel Monaco or The Fairmont- I've heard good things about them.

One is that many of the rooms are interior-facing and have absolutely no view [except into other rooms, which may or may not be OK depending on who is occupying them]. The other is the simple fact that the bar for hotels in Chicago is so high, and this place isn't quite as slick as the Peninsula or Four Seasons. That said, it also doesn't cost nearly what those places do, so the value for price is terrific. I'd recommend registering your e-mail with them on-line. I got a great e-mail offer for $129/night with a $50 food-and-beverage credit that was a wonderful bargain. The lobby is long and narrow, with a small lounge to the left just outside David Burke's Primehouse. That restaurant offers amazing lunch bargains, so it's certainly worth checking out midday. Their side of steamed asparagus with shallots is amazing. My great rate was actually for a studio suite--not just the standard room. When I first walked in the room, I wasn't sure about it, but after hanging out a few minutes, I really got to like the layout. The sleeping area is very small, far away from the door. It's really kind of a nook, with just the bed and two wall-mounted shelves that serve as bedside tables. There's also a flat-screen TV there. Most of the space in the studio suites is devoted to living area, which, when you think about it, is really where you want your space. There's also a huge bar with full bottles [not minis] of several liquors and a well-stocked fridge. There's plenty of shelf and counter space included with the bar, as well as an iPod-ready stereo. There's lots of glassware, but only martini glasses and highballs. No wine glasses or swizzle sticks. Oh, and ice is provided by room service. I'm on a campaign to get hotels to put ice machines on each floor. No one wants to have to call and wait. The room decor has a mid-century feel, with low-slung, clean-lined furniture. The color scheme is mostly brown and off-white, with big splashes of red for accent. Most of the lighting is on dimmers, so you can adjust it to your mood. All in all, it's a pretty attractive room. The bathroom is narrow with a tub/shower combo, but plenty of counter space. It's been renovated since it was the Lenox Suites, but there's a little wear and tear showing, such as chips in the bathtub molding and an unraveling robe. This was a quick trip, so I didn't get to check out the spa, gym, or JBar. Next time. Service is of the friendly and efficient type, rather than the formal and polished as at some of the highest-end places in town. Had no issues with getting what I needed, though. Room service breakfast was prompt, tasty, exactly as ordered, and in large portion. Others have commented about problems with the elevators, but I had no long waits at all. They are smallish, though. Location is perfect, two blocks from the Grand Red Line stop, one block from the Mag Mile, across the street from a Trader Joe's, and two blocks from a P. F. Chang's and a Joe's Seafood if you want chain food. If you're a hotel freak like me and want to check out some others, you're in pretty easy walking distance from a huge number worth looking at--Trump, Conrad, Peninsula, Park Hyatt, Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, Drake. The Coq d'Or at the Drake is the perfect old-school hotel bar. They started serving ten minutes after Prohibition was repealed and the bartenders all look like they've been there since that day. If price is no object and you must have the best in Chicago, check out the Peninsula.

The minute you step onto the sidewalk from your taxi The James is there for you, from opening doors, carrying your luggage, to checking you in, making sure you have all the necessities you need to ensure a comfortable stay. We were checked into room 604, which my mother wasn't too happy about since she was afraid we would be disturbed in our sleep from traffic below - but we had nothing to worry about, since we slept comfortably all 4 nights, without hearing a single peep from outside (or the hallways). The only noticeable sounds you might hear are from next door when they're taking a shower - and you only hear that if you're in the bathroom. I didn't have a problem with the tiny elevators, but they could be a little bit bigger and faster. Our room (I say \"our\" because we noticed some rooms were bigger/smaller than others when we took a peek during turn-down service) was big enough for 3, minimal, simple, and modern, just like the rest of the hotel. The bathroom was a bit small, but who cares? 'Cause the best part? The James is amazingly, fantastically, awesomely CLEAN. I've stayed in enough hotels to know that sometimes the maids get super lazy and don't give a crap about keeping the rooms clean.

Rooms are spacious, with the exception of the bathrooms, however how much time do you spend in there on a holiday? The rooms are contemporary in style with some interesting pieces of furniture, such as the chaise lounge. It is located just one block from the Magnificent Mile, up by the water tower end. So nipping out to do some shopping and then bringing it all back again is simple, without the need for taxis etc. We used this hotel as a base for trips down to Indianapolis motor speedway (for MotoGP, about 3 hours drive south) and so did not use the restaurants or other facilities, as we were always out and about. However the other good thing about the location is that is is close enough to a highway entrance / exit to be convenient, without having all the noise. If you want somewhere different to eat, try the Cheese Cake factory, at the base of the John Hancock Building. The insides of which are like being sat inside a cheese cake. The portions are massive and the cheese cakes are to die for!! However the best place to eat has to be the restaurant on the 95th floor of the John Hancock building. The view from the Signature Room restaurant as night falls over Chicago is fantastic. Better still was the Fillet steak and other courses. Book early and enjoy, its worth the price just for the food, never mind the view! The only down side for this hotel is that its not great at providing tea (The drinking sort). Being British this stuff is really important to us!!

This would have been a 4 star rating across the board, but for the very noisy noisy rooms. At first I was on the 6th floor, and the street noise (cars going by, alarms going off, people talking/yelling) was unbearable. I usually sleep through a LOT, but I couldn't even begin due to the noise. I imagine the flimsy windows have something to do with it. They moved me up to \"the penthouse\" when I asked for 1) ear plugs (sorry, don't have them) and 2) a room change (perhaps, in the morning). The penthouse was similarly thin-windowed, but being that much further, the street noise was more subdued. So my tip: visit the James, but bring earplugs for sleeping. You never know if you will get a room near the street level (even on the sixth floor it was terrible!!!) or if you will be on \"the wedding party floor\". BTW the lobby bar closes earlier than other bars, like around the corner. Strange. I must mention the excellent concierge services - they had great access to restaurant info., friendly non-pretentious, but professional service. The cabs and hotel car were super easy to obtain, and it was fun to be able to walk to a lot of terrific places. The beds and pillows were also incredibly comfortable.

We spent most of Saturday shopping and returned to our room to drop off bags at about 1 pm. The room had not been refreshed. I notified the front desk and was told someone would clean it immediately. We went back out for about 2 hours and returned to a still-dirty room. I called the front desk again. This time someone was sent to clean the room albeit while we were still in it. The night before our early-morning departure, we placed a breakfast order and requested delivery between 6 and 6:30 am. As we had to leave the hotel by 6:50 am, we had little time to spare. When breakfast did not arrive by 6:35 am, I placed multiple calls to room service (no answer) and the front desk. I was assured that breakfast was on its way.

We got a great deal on the holiday, flying from London through Expedia.com. On arrival we were given a twin room-having booked a king room. We informed reception that this was the case and were told that even though the expedia booking stated a twin room (the booking in fact showed a king room booking as we had the paperwork with us and showed it to the staff) we could be moved rooms. We were sent to another room, to then be told this wasn't the right room for us to stay in and we had to move to another floor and yet another room. We finally go the right room....third time lucky!!!! The room itself was very clean, modern and comfortable. The kiehl products in the bathroom were lovely and the housekeeping staff were very good (with a turndown service in the evening) Overall the room was very impressive and the hotel itself was very nice. There is free internet in the reception which was useful. On the day we arrived, my boyfriend had arranged a surprise Spa Treatment for me (which I highly recommend-the Astra Spa staff were lovely), However, when he went down to the concierge desk to ensure everything had been booked he saw an email on the reception's printer from my parent's company. Thinking this odd, he saw that it was asking for confirmation that the \"arrangements\" had been sorted out for our arrival. Without us knowing, my parents had arranged (weeks prior to our trip) for champagne and chocolates to be in our room on our arrival. This had not happened-in any of the 3rooms we were sent to!!!! My boyfriend enquired into this oversight. The concierge made the excuse that he was waiting for the wording from my parents to accompany the gift-not that he knew what it was at this point! Needless to say, my parents were very disappointed that the surprise meant for our arrival was not in our room nor had been actioned. My mother had indeed been sorting this out for weeks and had had to send countless fax and emails due to the failure of the staff to confirm receipt of payment/order. Furthermore, on contacting the hotel on the failure to action the request my mother was told that it was due to our room change-another excuse! (the wording had in fact already been sent over too, contrary to the original excuse) We did eventually get our champagne and chocolates (without charge to my parents) and in addition, halfway through our stay were delighted to receive a handwritten note from the management with a bottle of wine and some cheese and biscuits. A special mention must go to Jennifer who liaised with my mother on the problems and was determined to make up for the oversight. We were highly impressed with this customer service. Overall the hotel is good and the service which many people on this forum have mentioned did materialise. One thing that could be addressed is the arguing we encountered in the reception. On a number of occasions we witnessed the staff arguing (quite loudly) with each other-we felt this to be particularly un-professional. I couldn't help but feel that, as suggested before, guests who book through agents do not always receive the same customer service as those who book directly. However, having said that the staff did make up for the original mishap very well.

The storage space was perhaps a bit limited for two people (two small drawers and a hanging rail). Two small cookies were left in our room every evening as part of the turndown service, which was a nice touch. The minibar was extensive and there was free wifi access and a CD player in the room. There was a bit of noise from the street, which didn't bother us but might be a problem for light sleepers. Unfortunately, the bathroom was small in comparison to the bedroom, and the bathtub was so shallow that it was very difficult to use (about half the depth of a traditional bath). This was the only major problem with the room (and only matters if you prefer baths to showers!). The free toiletries were great, though - generously sized bottles of Kiehl's shampoo, conditioner and grapefruit body wash and lotion. The hotel is right behind the Magnificent Mile and 2-3 minutes' walk from the Grand stop on the El Red Line. There's a popular steak restaurant attached although we didn't try it. Service was generally good and they fixed a problem with our room within 5 minutes of us reporting it.

Then she offered me something called a \"media suite!\" When I got to the hotel it looked NOTHING like the old Scottsdale location. The decor was very modern and housed a wonderful art collection. When I entered the room I couldn't believe my eyes. I had a king size bed on a large platform with a gigantic TV. There was a living room with a sofa, another plasma TV, a wet bar and extra chairs. Then I discovered why this was called the \"media suite.\" There was another queen size type bed on the other side of the room with a projector that projected DVDs on the wall!!! Also, they offer Kiehl products in the gigantic bathrooms. I was in heaven. Four months later I decided to spend my birthday their with friends.

I found the Staff at the James to be extremely efficient, friendly, knowledgeable and willing to go the extra mile. EXAMPLE: Concierge Bill M. recommended a very nice Italian restaurant down the street called Quartino and called ahead to guarantee seating was available.. While eating our lunch an order of Bruschetta was brought over by someone other than our server which we had not ordered and thought was a mistake. We sent it back. Our server than returned with the Bruschetta and explained it was compliments of the James Hotel Concierge. Not only was it a pleasant surprise but we were thoroughly impressed. The other thing I liked about the staff were they did not make excuses or try to justify why something had not been done. Upon returning one day at 3 PM from shopping our room had not been cleaned even though we had the housekeeping sign on the door. I called down and the staff immediately apologized and said we will send someone right up which they did. No \" sir we are very busy, oversold etc excuses like you get from other hotels\" the James apologized and corrected the problem. The rooms are comfortable (especially the beds), clean, quiet, nicely appointed (except for the shabby little Ikea dresser in one of the closets) good quality towels and robes and Kiehls products. Location is excellent, walking distance to everything from Millennium Park to Lakeshore drive, Michigan Avenue, Red Subway line Grand Station and Restaurants galore. Trader Joes right across the street is convenient and the housekeeper explained if we wanted to store something in the honor bar just remove an item and place on the bar to make room for our items and we would not be charged as the honor bar is not on a sensor. Did not eat at the restaurant or use the spa but enjoyed the lobby bar. Jbar is nice but not our scene, tries to be too much like a club but is really just a poser bar.

They then told us that we could have a non-smoking room if we were willing to upgrade (for a fee) - which basically said to me: \"we have a non-smoking room...but not for you, since you booked through Hotwire.\" We ended up paying the fee (I didn't want my pregnant wife to be in a smoking area of the hotel) and got a room with two double beds (of course we had requested a King sized bed, but it was either that, or pay even more for a non-smoking king room).

Located in Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premier shopping district, The Magnificent Mile, this hotel is the epitome of cool. Upon entering the hotel you are greeted with the sounds of jazzy deep house dance music. The decor and the ambiance of this hotel reads uber chic. At check in I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m given an environmentally friendly room key card made out of recycled cardboard. This is the first of many environmentally friendly features that this hotel has to offer. I do have to admit that I was not fully impress by the customer service that was given at check-in. The front desk attended was very dry and unwelcoming, he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say much to me and did not explain how to get to the hotels hidden elevators. However I was determined not to let one persons dry attitude affect my over all view of the hotel. Entering the Apartment Suite (room number 1108) my first reaction is to be turned off by how small the suite is. At only 650 square feet the Apartment Suite isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much larger that the standard rooms. However my disappointment is short lived after seeing the amazing view from the bedroom. The room looks straight out to Michigan Ave. and looks even better at night. As an amenity you will receive a plate of gourmet petit fours, cookies, a 350 ml bottle of wine and a personalized hand written welcome note. The room comes complete with a fully stocked bar. The bar has everything from vodka, pop, water, nuts and even a vibrator. Thats right. If you look hard enough you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find an adult pleasure kit hidden inside the bar. In your room you can access free wifi if you bring your computer. Internet is also available through the rooms television for a charge. If your traveling for business and internet is a vital part of your stay be prepared to be frustrated as the hotels wifi is really slow. The few times that I did use my computer I found myself quickly giving up due to slow loading speeds. You can also rent tons of movies but at around $14.99 a pop, what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the point? Go enjoy the city of Chicago and buy that movie for $9.99 when you get home. When you get to the hotel try channel 42 on the TV. Can someone tell me what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that all about? Strange but funny. My favorite feature of the room is the huge spa inspired bathroom. It was expertly designed as has plenty of storage space if needed for extended stays. The shower has two heads. One that allows for the overhead rain effect and another that is handheld but can also be prepped up as a regular shower head. The shower also has a small window that houses a spectacular view of the city. There are many other areas of the hotel for you to enjoy. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the JBar that is open Wednesday through Saturday (I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to enjoy it because my stay was Sunday to Wednesday morning). However at night the hotel lobby becomes some sort of a bar in it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own right. They serve drinks in the lobby and it seems the place to be after dusk. Inside the James Hotel you will also find a high tech gym with personal trainers available, a full service spa, and the well known David Burke's stake house (sorry that I can't tell you how the food was, I'm a vegetarian so I didn't bother). Here are a few tips to make your trip even more enjoyable: 1. Although the in room bar looks great and is very tempting avoid the urge. At $3 for a can of coke and about $42 for a mini bottle of Grey Goose it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not worth it. Directly across the street from the hotel is Trader Joe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grocery store. Trader Joe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is famous for their cheep wine shop and organic foods. If organic or wine isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t your thing, less than a block and half way you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find a Jewel Osco for hard liquors and ready to eat foods. 2. Are you looking to spend a night out on the town? While the James Hotel is in a great location, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tons of shopping and restaurants nearby, but there are not a lot of bars or clubs. If you are looking for a great night out don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry. Just walking distance from the hotel you will find Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Red Line subway train. From there you can easily access the best bars and clubs the city has to offer. Take the red line to the North/Clyborn stop then take a easy walk to Weed Street there you will find a plethora of nightclubs. If your looking for Gay/Lesbian bars take the red line to the Belmont stop and you will be in Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GLBT neighborhood where you will find bars/nightclubs, lots of shopping and tons of late night restaurants. 3. Just a small heads up, this hotel charges you for your entire stay at check-in. This really isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a huge deal but what they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell you is that they add an extra $100 per night for incidentals which you get credited back to you when you check out. I stayed three nights and payed with my debt card so imagine my surprise when and extra $300 was taken out of my checking account. If you are planing a trip to Chicago I would highly recommend a stay at the James Hotel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in a great location and has many services and amenities to please even the discerning of travelers.", "Date": "July 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service, Location, & Value!\u201d", "Author": "ChiTown16", "ReviewID": "UR34491684", "Content": "I stayed at The James for almost a week in January of 2009.

The woman on the phone was extremely helpful and gave me tons of useful info. Overall, every interaction I had with staff exceeded my expectations. We arrived at the hotel at around 10am and were able to check in immediately.

Normal size bottles of booze were available with several different types of cocktail glasses and mixing implements. Also there was cd/radio/mp3 player (with an aux plug to fit non-iPod mp3 players, too). There was also a large LCD TV and great lighting throughout. I've been to many boutique hotels where lighting (lack of it) is an issue and it was not an issue here. I could have been comfortable staying here for several days as there was enough space for 3 to move around (or sit and relax) at the same time. The bathroom had Keihl's products and enough counter space. There's a Trader Joe's across the street and a Whole Foods nearby (walking distance at Huron/Erie) The door staff was great - not to in your face annoying but always close at hand to offer tips, etc. Minutes before the wedding my sister (the maid of honor) called for help b/c the DVD player being used at the reception didn't work. They needed another and the James Hotel front desk staff immediately loaned me one. This really saved the day and they didn't say a word when I walked out the front door with it!

Between the bell staff and front desk they must have shown me at least 8 rooms with various views and layouts. They all had the patience of saints and without one bit of attitude.

The initial service and cleanliness of the James did impress me and I started to think that it might be as good(better ?) than a stay at the Affinia after all.The decor was plain and simple , but comfortable, and the rooms were nicely cleaned each day.Great mattress, quiet room and free internet, were all good.There was a nice, big flat screen in the room, but the closed-captioning was on, and no amount of button pushing could turn it off. It took 3 requests and 2 days to get the hotel to turn it off. I did not go to Chicago to watch TV, but after walking around for 6 or 7 hours, its nice to veg in front of the tube and have a drink or two before dinner.The closed-cap is really annoying and for the prices charged for a room, and the James' upscale presentation, everything should work correctly , or be fixed pronto. Then the bathroom faucet knob fell off late at night, and we could not turn off the water.The \"engineer\" as they called him , did arrive fairly quickly to fix it , but it seemed forever, laying in bed trying not to fall asleep, waiting for the guy to show up. I asked at the front desk about a long distance call and was told it would be ~$4 and change. In reality the charge was $13 something on our bill. I complained and the hotel adjusted it. On our last night , after an evening of excellent dining and great blues bars, we got back to the hotel late and wanted to watch TV for a bit before calling it a night. The TV died a minute or two after we turned it on and refused to turn on again.I did not bother to call the front desk, by this point it was too late and I'd had enough of dealing with little problems at the hotel. There was also an error with our room billing charge that turned out to be another mistake on Affinia's part.

At that time I specifically requested that a large pot of coffee for two people and one large glass of orange juice be delivered on Saturday and Sunday morning at 9:30 am. After speaking with the concierge, I was telephoned to confirm this order by another individual at the hotel. When, on Saturday morning I did not get my order, I called in-room dining. They had no idea I had placed the order and stated that they weren't told about the order from the concierge. I waited another half an hour before they delivered the order to my room. They brought two (2) orange juices (more than I ordered) but I did not argue the point. On Sunday morning I received my order at 10:15 - they provided two (2) large orange juices (again - not what I ordered) and a large pot of coffee with only one (1) cup (there were two of us). Again, I did not argue but simply overpaid. In sum, I ended up paying around $60 for items that were (1) not what I ordered, (2) late, and (3) required my nagging to receive. I was further inconvenienced by in-room dining staff when I ordered room service Saturday night. First, the food was limp and uninspired. Further, I ordered the soup- which arrived without a spoon. When I called in-room dining to request a spoon, I was told one would be forthcoming. 15 minutes later, a waiter arrived with a menu. When I explained I already had food and I didn't need a menu - I needed a spoon, he had the audacity to argue with me. I respectfully requested he return with a spoon and he agreed to do so. Another 15 minutes (and one bowl of cold soup) later I decided to call in-room dining back to request (again) they send someone with a spoon. They too argued with me and expressed that they'd already sent someone with a spoon. I explained that they had not - that I had received a menu I didn't request, but that no spoon was forthcoming. Another 15 minutes later, a spoon finally arrived. I ended up paying $100+ so that I could argue over cold, flavorless food. In addition to the gross customer service, surly attitude, and sorry food, I found the room woefully lacking. It reeked exhaust fumes so much so that on Saturday night I woke up from the smell.

The staff bent over backwards for us through out the stay. From a clogged toilet to restaurant recommendations, they were very attentive. Mr. Marcellus (evening concierge) even went to the trouble to print my boarding passes for me the night before we left. We did not eat at the restaurant on site but we did order dessert from them one night via room service - it was very good. The hotel is about a block off of Michigan Ave. The Hard Rock, Rainforest Cafe, and Rock & Roll McD's are within easy walking distance. The Red Line is an easy walk and buses come right down Ontario. My suggestion is to go to CTA's website in advance and buy passes - we did an unlimited 3 day pass for $14/each that was good for buses & the El.

There is a Trader Joe's across the street, which is great if you want an in-room picnic (read on). The heart of Michigan Avenue shopping is a block to the East The decor is ultra contemporary and clubby, yet the rooms are very comfortable. Lots of great examples of modern and mid-century furniture. Beds are very comfortable with great linens. All rooms I have stayed in have been very clean and well maintained. Plasma HDTV, complimentary water, nice bath product, and nice touches like dimmer switches for most room lighting, and ipod compatible radio. The feel is minimalist, but not spare. The staff is very professional. The downstairs bar can sometimes be a good spot, but it seems to be mostly hotel guests and not many locals. J Bar, located next door, really gets going later in the evening and seems to cater to the 30-something crowd (but this 40-something has had a lot of fun with friends there too). The David Burke Primehouse restauarant has amazing steaks. Definitely worth the splurge on their 30, 45, and 60 day aged steaks. Typical rooms are of average size. The real treat at this hotel are their \"Loft Suites\". The hotel is not particularly tall and is surrounded by taller buildings, so there really are almost no views. It is also U shaped in plan and the interior rooms face a parking deck with a limited view of Wrigley Tower in the distance. Ingeniously, these interior rooms have been designed as extra-large rockstar suites - so no need for a view. The suites feature a living area with couch and a couple of chairs, a wet bar stocked with top-shelf liquor, cocktail shaker, refrigerator, etc., a small dining table, and large plasma TV. The bathroom has a large glass shower with separate tub. Great Kiels bath product. Nice robes. The bedroom is a king size platform bed in an alcove off the living area and has its own Plasma TV. Lastly, on the other side of the living area is what can only be described as a \"party pit\" - which consists of a queen matress platform surrounded by a drink shelf and with an LCD projector to show DVDs on the wall. Yeah, really. Order up the bottles of Cristal and invite the groupies. It would make a great room for a long romantic weekend.

In the bathroom the complimentary toiletries were by Kiehl's which was an extra nice touch. Let me just say, that we slept like babies for the duration of our stay, such was the comfort of the beds and the room itself.

Gurnee Mills, Shopping Mall - this is a shopping mall upstate which is a paradise for those who want to get designer shopping at rock bottom prices 2. The Grand Luxe Cafe, Michigan Ave - Great value for money and extensive menu for either lunch or dinner. 3.

We've had drinks here twice, both times in November, when the Chicago wind suddenly becomes frigid. The bar is cold. There are doors on both sides that are opening (even being held open by doormen) while patrons arrive and depart, each time allowing a *blast* of cold air to hit anyone sitting in the low comfy couches and chairs. It was really poor planning. It's a bar you'd like to hang out in - just has the misfortune of being placed in what feels very much like a mere extension of the busy lobby, and like you are part of any weather system currently hitting Chicago. \u00e2\u20ac\u201dOn to the rooms - they are fabulous. Ours was a queen studio, great couch and chair choices, large mirrors and a very urban loft type feel. Yet, everything is smart. It's all practical and purposeful while having a clean look and comfortable feel. I felt immediately like 'this is my apartment.' And speaking of comfort - the bed was divine. Linens and coverings, all white, all fluffy and comfy and ready to make you not want to get out of bed in the morning. I say, don't! There is a coffee maker in the room, but free good coffee in the lobby, free papers, and once back upstairs, a flatscreen TV by the bed. (Of course there is always room service, breakfast from Burke's. I do suggest a luxurious morning in.) Our studio also had a larger flat screen in the living area, two big closets, a large bathroom (again, appointed the way you wish yours were at home) a sidebar piece with small bar sink, several premium bottles of spirits, including a wine key, and a great little sound system. And they pack all this into a tiny space, while still making it feel both spacious and cozy. (And quiet, even right by the elevator.) Well done, James! \u00e2\u20ac\u201dThe only minor downer about the room for me was the bathtub. Again, looks fabulous with long, chocolate tiles surrounding it and a cloth shower curtain. Now, most people avoid taking an actual bath in a hotel. However, sometimes it's necessary. I happened to need a soak when we were visiting, and it was the most uncomfortable I've ever been lying down. No place to rest my head without my chin jammed into my chest. No little ledge, nothing. Could The James provide at *least* a bath pillow? That would have helped tremendously. I know most of you will, but, stick to a shower. \u00e2\u20ac\u201dThe location of this hotel is perfect. Shopping and great restaurants are *literally* paces from the front doors. And by that I mean across the street and on the same block - and with in a mere 2 block range you could be fed and clothed for life. \u00e2\u20ac\u201dIf you're trying to decide where to stay in Chicago - I highly recommend the James. (My last name is James, but no relation! The hotel is named for James Dean.) And the place is not just for young hipsters, though you will encounter many cool young staff members - good energy, very helpful folks. If you stay at The James, I hope you're experience is as fun as ours was. :) ps - David Burke's Primehouse is amazingly good. Be ready to drop some coin, but wow! And it was recently listed high in the top 20 best steakhouses in the city in Chicago magazine.

I remember when this building housed the Lennox House hotel, so the makeover was pretty impressive. The look is minimal and hip. Contemporary art, especially photography, is displayed throughout the building. Check-in was simple. I arrived early but this was not a problem. I asked for two beds instead of one, and this request also was accommodated. The front desk person asked me if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like a higher or lower floor. I picked higher and was assigned t a room on the 15th floor. The rooms have already been described here \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very white with minimal furnishings: two beds, a table between the beds, a long bench in front of the window that contained two drawers, a dresser-like piece with the mini-bar items and tow more drawers, and a small nook with a padded seat plus a small table. The bathroom has a very small entry room containing a closet-like cabinet with shelves, hangers, and a safe. The bathroom was nicely done with grey tiles on the floor and white fixtures. As others had mentioned, there was an odd smell in the nook. This smell (reminiscent of dirty feet) probably came from the upholstered seat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c either the padding or the covering. This musty smell pretty much stayed in the small nook and did not permeate the room. Housekeeping\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to spray for the smell only temporarily alleviated the problem. Some of my observations: PROS: - The beds were incredibly comfortable. I thought Westin had great beds, but the mattress, sheeting, and pillows were maybe the best I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve encountered in a hotel. - After looking around, I realized there was a lot of storage space in the room. - Kiehl products in the bathroom were great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c their Amino Acid shampoo is one of my favorites and I now have a 2.2 oz bottle to refill for future travels. - The selection of newspapers for guests was good. USA today was delivered on Monday morning. No paper was delivered on Sunday morning but the New York Times and Chicago Tribune were available for guests (gratis) at the front desk. The Wall Street Journal joins these newspapers on other days. - Having 3 computers in the lobby area (two Windows and one Mac) for guests meant I never had to wait for a computer when I wanted one. I also brought my laptop and had no trouble accessing the free Wi-Fi from my hotel room. Kudos for the free Wi-Fi. - In addition to the sheeting, the towels were top notch. So were the bath robes. - Great workout room. - Each hotel employee I encountered was cheerful and friendly. When I contacted maintenance, they came up within minutes. They fixed a very slow drain in the bathtub so that it drained easily my second day. - The location was great. Across the street is a Starbucks, Trader Joes, and a good restaurant called Farmerie 58. After a good lunch, we returned for an even better dinner the next evening. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try room service or the in-house restaurant. CONS: - For a hotel that classifies itself as 5 stars, the room seemed a bit worn. The cylindrical light fixture on the floor by the window was obviously stained and dented. One of the three pictures above one bed was missing and the hanging hardware was still in the wall. The alarm clock had a nice feature to project the time on the ceiling, but that feature didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work properly (only half the display was visible even after setting the focus). To lock the safe, I had to push hard on the door. - The cookies that were left at turndown were not very good. (Did I really just complain about cookies?) - Lighting was hit and miss. The lights above the bed could be adjusted for reading, but there were not individual controls for each bed so both had to be set at the same level. The bathroom proper had good lighting but the small entryway with the closet fixture did not. Why did they put up a full length mirror and then not provide any lighting in the dressing area? - The outside noise wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a problem until 3 am on the last night. The garbage was picked up and this was a noisy event. Being on the 15th floor, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect that to be so annoying. Those staying on lower floors must have been even more annoyed. - Although there was plenty of hot water for a shower, the sink produced only warm water. - Speaking of the sink, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the shallowness which was not conducive to complete draining. Other than the noise from the garbage trucks, none of these complaints were major. However, there were just a few too many of them for a self-proclaimed 5 star property. I would stay at The James again if the price were right, but normally the price doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look right for this property. If I could stay at the Park Hyatt or Trump International for about the same price, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d pick either of the other two hotels. I find The James to be similar to the Affinia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The James has better service but the Affinia has newer and better rooms for what is often a lower price.", "Date": "November 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat for the Location, Didn't Meet The Hype\u201d", "Author": "MatMo", "ReviewID": "UR21320449", "Content": "The James is one of those \"super swank\" hotels as I like to term it. The service was fantastic and was a place I always wanted to try out because I often passed it while staying at other hotels in the area and it always seemed to be really hip & high-end. Before I continue, I would like to preface the following by stating that I stay at a lot of high-end hotels (mostly Starwood for what it's worth) so my review is much more critical than the average traveller. First off, the service & bed were awesome...I think it's even better than the Westin's \"Heavenly Bed\". The pillows seemed to be made from real down and were also incredibly comfortable, actually, the Pillows & Mattress were the best I've ever had a hotel all together (this includes places like Westin's, \"W\"s, Four Seasons, & Ritz Carlton's to name a few)! The room was very \"Chic\" and high-end, however, there were some significant drawbacks. I personally thought it was a VERY small room for the price and since it was rated something like #23 in the Contiental US & Canada by Travel & Leisure Magazine. I think the \"W\" Chicago Lakeshore has a much larger room (probably 25% larger) with similar design & \"swankiness\", and I still wouldn't call the \"W\" Lakeshore's rooms big! At the James, there was only about 2 feet of clearance between the foot of the bed and the wall which also hung a nice 42\" plasma. While the 42\" plasma was nice, it was a tight squeeze by the bed & TV and the only other place to watch TV was a small sitting chair. There was also a small \"nook\" area off to the side where someone could sit, but it was out of view of the TV and everything else in the room. The other big drawback was that there wasn't any type of normal business work area in the room or any type of business chair to sit in. This isn't an issue for the leisure traveller, but is a BIG issue for a business traveller because there wasn't a place to get comfortable and do some work if needed. The only place was the \"nook\", and it was out of view of the TV and was set-up more as a little sitting area verses a working space. It's also an issue for the leisure traveller that likes a sitting area to kick-back in and watch some TV without laying in bed. Overall, it's a great place to stay with an awesome location. However, the room was a little small and not set-up well for the average business traveller.", "Date": "October 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "rmdwkikform", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel\u201d", "Author": "sharon17", "ReviewID": "UR21096341", "Content": "Stayed at the James for 4 nights.

I was not encouraged by the hotels own web-site which is very sparse on practical information. Sadly, The James did disappoint to a degree without ever really giving cause for serious complaint. It is a visually stunning hotel and there is an air of quality throughout. The fixtures and fittings fall within the \"boutique\", style and for people who like that kind of thing, they will absolutely love The James. The investment made in renovating the property appears to be considerable ( sad then, that in our room the enamel in the bath was peeling and the air-conditioner was faulty ). They definitely try to encourage a feeling of exclusivity here, helped by impresssively attentive staff and the already mentioned rack rate of $400+. To be fair they do pull that off to a great degree. If you can afford that kind of money and are in town for only one or two nights, then this is a hotel that should seriously be considered. However, for somebody like me who generally stays in Chicago from 3 to 5 nights, then The James is totally impractical. For one thing there is absolutely no closet space in some of the rooms. We were forced to store most of our clothes on the floor !. The room furniture, though very stylish and contemporary, is not what I would call comfortable. The James is all about visual presentation and for me it lacks the necessary comfort and intimacy that I always look for in a hotel. I need a home away from home and in that regard I realised very quickly that I do not fit into their target demographic. Nor to be fair, did I expect The James to meet all of my criteria for the perfect hotel. This would probably explain why I was impressed with aspects of what The James offers and yet did not like it overall. The ceiling projection alarm clocks, the remarkably unobtrusive housekeeping staff, free in-room wireless internet access and the latest check-out time that I have ever experienced ( very welcome ) are things that The James should be commended for, as they are unique in my experience.

We choose the James because of a special rate they had for studio suites. I think my expectations were a little too high after reading the reviews on this site and seeing that the hotel was ranked 29 in the world by readers of Travel & Leisure. In my opinion, there is no way the James beats the Park Hyatt or even the junior suite at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago. I am a constant visitor to Chicago and have made the rounds of almost every hotel on or near Michigan Avenue, and the James is just average. What is all the hype about? Our room had some issues. The first room we were given was smelly, to the point that I called and asked for a new room. The second room was fine, no smell, and the set-up was interesting with a tiny TV area with a couch (stained) and a coffee table, then a bedroom area with a nice bed and a little bench with some drawers. The hallway area had a little wet bar, which I thought was a cute touch. The bathroom was not great - the sink was more style over substance and there is a combo bath/shower. Our shower drain did not work the entire time we were there. We also had to request towels as only 2 were in the room. Some of the furniture was chipped or stained, and a few of the light switches were missing their covers. The elevators are small and slow and at busier times (Saturday morning and evening) we had to wait for a few elevators to go before getting on. I also took issue with the lack of a view - I have never stayed in Chicago without a view of at least Michigan Ave, if not the lake and/or river. Our view was of an interior courtyard. The decor is fun, but I feel like I've seen a nearly identical wallpaper and photos before, perhaps at the W Times Square. The hotel did not seem like a boutique hotel to me, just another trendy chain (or chain in the making). There was some extremely loud music and flashing lights coming from the hotel's conference center late on Sunday night. Luckily it didn't bother us much, but it could be a problem. I was disappointed by Primehouse. We went for the American dim sum brunch. Great idea but horrible execution. The restaurant was not at all crowded but service was horrible. We never got a visit from two of the carts, which is sad when there are 6 or 7 carts total, 10 tables in the dining room with customers, and there is a checklist on the table saying which carts have visited. Some \"signature\" items come straight from the kitchen, like the sliders and the kobe corn dogs, and we just never received them. Not the end of the world, but evidence of very poor management. Some things I did like: very nice door staff and front desk staff; turn-down service with cookies was cute, although two nights they left only one cookie for two people (didn't need two, just weird); the Kiehl's products are nice; and the location is good, although 15 other hotels have as good of a location. Would I stay here again? Maybe, for the right price. Would I include this hotel in the same category as the Four Seasons, Park Hyatt? Definitely not. If I want a luxury experience, I'm staying elsewhere. Chicago is a wonderful, wonderful city with so many wonderful hotels - the James is definitely not the only game in town.

I booked a package (air & hotel) on expedia and got a good rate for the hotel. We arrived before check-in and our room was not quite ready. The desk associate was very helpful, offered to hold our luggage, and to call us as soon as the room was available. We decided to go eat lunch. We barely made it a block when the hotel called to say our room was ready and we could check in at any time. The location of the hotel can't be beat. It is one block from North Michigan Avenue. Everything we wanted to visit was easily accessible. The El train is a few blocks away - within walking distance. There are also several bus stops within a block of the hotel making it easy to get around. We purchased vistor passes for the CTA (public transit) and it worked out great. A two day pass is $9.00. The room looks just like the pictures. We were in room 414 and had a king bed. The bed was extremely comfortable. The plasma TV with HBO was wonderful. The bathroom is large and stocked with Khiels products (a nice touch). There were also two plush robes. The desk, bell, and cleaning staff were wonderful. The room was visited twice a day by the cleaning staff - once in the morning to make up the room (make the bed, pick up used towels and leave clean towels). Then for turn down service - the staff would leave cookies and fill the ice bucket. The desk and bell staff could not have been more helpful with directions. It was our first trip to Chicago and although we knew what we wanted to see we were unsure how to get there. Ask for a map of the bus and train routes at the desk - it is extremely helpful in getting around the city. The one drawback we found at the hotel was the concierge. I had called the hotel two days before we arrived the inquired about Cubs tickets. Toni took down my e-mail address and cell phone number. She said she would check on the availability of tickets and get back to me. I never heard from her. When we arrived at the hotel I waited to speak to the concierge. I explained that I had spoken to Toni and had not heard back from her. The woman at the desk did not introduce herself or apologize for the lack of response, but told me the tickets would be very hard to come by and would be at least $100 a ticket. I told her I had read a review on the internet indicating that standing room only tickets were available on the day of the game. She said she had been in Chicago a long time and had never heard of that. She made no attempt to check on that information for me. We were able to buy tickets to the game on labor day at the box office. We purchased box seats right behind the cubs dugout for $66/ticket. Standing room tickets were also available. Additionally we had purchased tickets to see a show at Second City. The concierge recommended we take a cab because the neighborhood was not the safest. However, she did say we could take the #36 bus and it would take us right to the theater. We took the bus, however, the theater was two blocks from the bus stop. Not a big deal, but not what we were told. After the show we walked around the neighborhood. It looked perfectly safe to us. It was actually a nice section of Old Town. The attitude we encountered from the concierge was at best condescending.

The food was below average as was the slow service. Our waiter asked us what we ordered 30 seconds after we just told him and there was no one else in the restaurant so it's not as if he had alot of orders to remember. The first morning I ordered Belgain waffles with cream and berries -- there were 3 berries and the cream was cool whip! The restaurant prides itself on their reknowned chef -- I guess he must of been on holidays when we were there! The lobby of the hotel is very nice but small. The bar though offeres complimentary coffee in the mornings although no one did mention this to us at check-in and I didn't discover this until the morning we were leaving. There are desk top computers in the lobby for email and internet use which was great. The concierge's were pleasant and very helpful. Make sure when you call to make a reservation that you ask about all their packages. Apparently there was a parking package where your parking is included for each night during the summer months. I had asked about the packages when I booked and the reservations agent did not tell us about this package and it wasn't until we were at the hotel did my husband notice it on the internet. When we asked to have our parking inculded it was abit of an ordeal however the manager did go ahead and take the $46 a day parking off our bill which was great. All and all we thought the James was nice but needed some fine tuning. The turn down service was nice as was the different cookie they put on your bed at night.

We found a great deal on Expedia a couple of weeks earlier (a non-refundable rate of $176/night for 3 nights) and found it to be a bargain compared to what we could've paid to stay at inferior hotels nearby. We had an early morning flight from Boston and arrived at the hotel at 9:30AM; the staff was very friendly and accommodating, making us feel very welcome the moment we stepped out of our cab until we checked out 3 days later. We were able to do an early check-in, which made a major difference in that we had an opportunity to relax a bit and freshen up before heading out. The staff member took us to our room on the 7th floor and showed us all of the amenities - minibar, mini-stereo w/ iPod hookup, flat-screen TV, bathroom, explain the services provided by the hotel, etc. The room was in the west corner of the hotel, so we had a long walk from the elevators, but it was very quiet and we couldn't hear anything from outside. The room itself featured minimally chic decor and had a king bed that was much more comfortable than most hotel beds I've slept in. The room also featured small sitting corner and also featured a long \"bench\" against the window with 2 drawers below. There was plenty of space to store luggage without it being visible and obstructive in our room, so I felt the way the room was laid out made it look and feel bigger than its actual square footage. The only minor issues I found with our room were the closet and bathroom being a bit small. While the rectangular pedestal sink in the bathroom was beautiful, there wasn't much space for toiletries. In addition, the tub had a couple of scratches, but I was much happier to have plenty of towels (the bath towels were especially plush and oversized) and 2 sets of robes and slippers for our use. As for other aspects of the hotel, I particularly liked the lobby, which featured numerous lounge-style seating areas and a bookshelf full of coffee table books and magazines. The lobby bar (which bridges the lobby itself and David Burke Primehouse) was a great gathering spot for drinks and was a lively hangout throughout our stay. We ate breakfast one morning at David Burke Primehouse, which was a bit of a mistake. We went at 10AM and even though there were only a couple of other tables occupied, it took 15 minutes before a server even came up to us to start taking our order. It took another 15 minutes before the server returned to bring our juice; at this point, I was frustrated by the poor service that I spoke to the general manager, explaining the situation. He was very apologetic and comped us our breakfast, with our server coming by and apologizing for the lack of service as well. The family seated two tables over also complained about the poor service and the manager also comped their breakfast. The problem with breakfast there is that on weekends, they have an \"American dim sum brunch\" starting at 10:30; however, they also have breakfast daily until 11AM. This overlap, along with the transition period from 10AM-10:30AM, seems to result in inattentive service for those coming in for a late breakfast because the staff (servers, kitchen, etc.) are so focused on setting up for brunch. My suggestion for guests who want to eat breakfast in the hotel is to either: 1) Order room service for breakfast 2) Go for an early sit-down breakfast 3) If staying on weekends, go after 10:30 for brunch. My suggestion for the restaurant is to curtail breakfast on weekends at 10 or 10:30 to ensure a smoother transition into brunch. Even though the experience was disappointing, I appreciate the way the manager handled the situation. There is also a lounge/club attached to the hotel called J Bar. We checked it out on the first night of our stay and while it might be the right scene for some, it wasn't for us. We expected more of a relaxing lounge, but it turned out to be a club more than anything else. Very crowded, DJ, loud music - we walked in, grabbed a drink, and quickly retreated back to our room upstairs... Misadventures with dining/drinking aside, I would highly recommend The James. It is a very stylish boutique hotel where I think most people would love the rooms and the service provided by the hotel staff.

We returned around 4pm to find that our room was still not ready. We waited another half an hour until it was finally ready. The desk clerk did apologize and offered us free breakfast for two. The room was amazing. We stayed on the 17th floor with an amazing view of the city. There was a brown spot on the ceiling that wasn't very appealing. Also the bathtub would fill up with water when having a shower. But all around along with the beautiful room and free breakfast it was a great experience.

The fitness center is a great size and is open 24 hours. The rooms in tones of brown and red are spacious, and have that minimalist chic look, but perhaps done to the point where they lack function ability. I hated the bathroom sinks- too wide and flat and therefore do not drain well and they also take up more counter space then needed. However, overall I was pleased with the room.

The hotel is fabulous, very chic and chilled. The service is beyond compare. Check in and out were swift and painless. The Concierge service is also super efficient having located an excellent hair salon and a couple of fab restaurants for us during our stay. The hotel restaurant itself is rated 5 in the top 10 in Chicago - voted by Chicago residents. We stayed on the 14th floor with great views of the city. The room (a deluxe king) was equipped with a great selection of cocktail making lovelies, hairdryer, safe, tv, robes & slippers, a very interesting selection of minibar items (one of which was a real surprise!) including crisps/snacks a first aid kit and an umbrella! We also had a spotless and elegant bathroom with Kiehls products and a cosy little dining area. The ipod dock/CD/radio and complimentary chillout CD were a nice touch and husband liked the enormous plasma tv. The super comfy bed ensured a good snooze and complimentary WiFi allowed us to plan our next day's activities from our bedroom. We were so busy touring around the city we didn't get an opportunity to use the gym or the spa - both of which looked fab. The bar/lobby area is a haven of civilised tranquility with smooth music playing in the background to help you chillout that bit more. Staff are attentive without being fussy and a good selection of drinks and bar snacks are available. The barman mixes a mean mohito ! This hotel is full of nice little thoughtful touches to make people feel welcomed and cared for e.g. The Virtual Tuck In service - basically a couple of PCs with webcams to allow people to say goodnight to their children when they're away from home on business. Also the dog biscuits and water outside the front door for our furry friends.

The location is within walking distance to everything - dining, shopping, the subway, etc. We stayed in an upper floor room (#1518), far away from any elevator noise and foot traffic. The room was spacious and clean, and yes, the bed was by far the best we had ever slept on. The bathroom was great and large - we had no problem with the sink set-up, and the Kiehl's products were a plus, and were constantly replenished when needed. I cannot say enough how friendly the staff was - the front desk staff, the bellmen, and especially Bill and Esperanza at the Concierge desk....they both made some excellent recommendations. The twice daily maid service and turndown was a treat. Robes and slippers were laid out, lights were dimmed, fresh ice was delivered, and a wonderful cookie was left behind (the TV was also turned to a funky black/white channel that portrayed a various figures in comical scenes - a nice touch when you return to your room). I also appreciated all of the reading selections located in the front desk area (I love to read) - various local magazines were available for purchase (great for tourists), but they also had an abundance of complimentary newspapers that you could take up to your room as well...the NY Times, Wall Street Journal, Chicago Tribune, etc. The USA Today was delivered daily. I visited the gym one morning and was very impressed. Abundant and quality equipment and a very clean room. TV's were on the cardio equipment, and they had disposable earbuds for you to use. Definitely the best hotel gym I have seen in my many hotel stays. My partner and I indulged in room service one night from David Burke's Primehouse. It was delivered as promised within 45 minutes, piping hot. We had filet on the bone, hashbrowns, sauteed mushrooms, and the beef BBQ/lobster dumplings - all was wonderful! We also had the incredible crab cake wrapped in a pretzel down in the lobby bar one night - this is a must try dish! WOW...We also went to the J Bar one evening - completely underdressed.

It is a trendy hotel with mostly young business men and women that stay here. While it has a lot of nice features such as large flat-screen TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and great linens and towels, it is missing a few of the soft touches you normally find at hotels of this caliber. The elevators are slow, small and noisy. We often had to wait for two or three elevator cars to arrive because only about five people at a time can fit. They are dirty and not up to the standard of the rest of the hotel. The hotel has no ice makers. If you want ice, you need to call the front desk, wait 30 minutes, and then tip the person that brings the ice to your room. There is no free coffee or free breakfast or free water. A pot of coffee (4 cups) will cost you $14.00 ($7.00 plus 12% hotel tax, plus $3.50 delivery charge, plus 18% built-in gratuity, plus the additional tip they want you to give). The front desk staff tends to cluster and when approached they give you the feeling that you are annoying them. The walls are thin. When the rooms on either side of you get a wake-up call, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your wake-up call too! Street noise is very loud \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even on the 16th floor. The hotel tries so hard to be trendy that it often sacrifices functionality. For example, the bathroom sink is a trendy square, flat sink. The faucet is a standard low faucet that makes the distance between the faucet and sink stopper only about 4 inches. It makes it very difficult to wash your hands under the running water. For this same reason, you cannot fill a tall glass of water. The trendy boutique closet is in the bathroom. When the bathroom door is closed, the main room has no access to a mirror or clothes. This makes it slower for two or more people to get ready at the same time. The bathroom sliding-door has a frosted glass window. This is not a problem for one person but for two people, it is a huge annoyance. You CANNOT turn the light on in the bathroom without lighting up the bedroom as well. Also, the light switch for the bathroom is in the bedroom -- so if you are in the bathroom and then want to adjust the light or fan, you need to open the sliding door (all the way) and go in to the bedroom to adjust the bathroom light. ON THE PLUS SIDE: The rooms have plenty of electrical outlets. My wife and I both have our laptops cell phone and IPods plugged in and we have outlets to spare. The hotel is in a great location to the best shopping and restaurants in Chicago. The artwork in the rooms is beautiful. There is plenty of storage in the rooms for your suit cases and belongings. The gym at the hotel is one of the best I have seen. OVERALL: I would give this hotel 4 out of 5 stars. It is very nice, but not as nice as the Amalfi \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the nearest similar hotel. The James is very nice, but does not make that extra effort that separates the good hotels from the great hotels.", "Date": "August 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cLoved It!\u201d", "Author": "George16", "ReviewID": "UR8260116", "Content": "All of the good reviews about The James are true.

The hotel itself has a unique, comtempory design, which carries from the lobby into the rooms. Style preferrence is a personal thing, but if you lean toward the less traditional, you'll enjoy the look of the James.

Service at the counter and door was prompt, professional and friendly. Maid service was well done and included turn down service. Another plus is the fitness center which rivals many stand alone gyms for equipment selection and quality. I only have two minor criticisms to offer. One, the hotel is an older building and there are a few worn spots in the common areas that should be touched up. Second, and this is very minor, there is not gift shop in the hotel, so if you need toiletries or a bottle of water, you'll need to go across the street.

Our check in was a breeze...we were worried about getting bumped to another hotel (this has happened to us when we booked with hotwire previously and the property was sold out) but I called the night before to confirm. Our room was incredible! My only complaint was we were put in a corner room on a lower floor with very little view and a handicap accessible room so I don't know if all the rooms looked like ours or not. I am guessing that's where they put their guests that don't pay close to full price for a room. We didn't mind too much because we didn't spend too much time in the room. The bed was a king and was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in....better than my own!! They have a featherbed on the mattress, down comforter, feather pillows (5 on the bed), an Ipod station/mp3 player, a HUGE 50\" plasma TV, closet, full length mirror, electronic safe, iron/board, hairdryer, very modern furniture. The bathroom was completely tiled and had a huge sink. Only complaint here was little room to lay anything down, hardly any counter space. They provided robes, slippers, shampoo/conditioner, lotion, shower gel, q-tips and cotton balls. We had very quick housekeeping in the am and had nightly turndown service with \"mood lighting\" (all the lights are on dimmers) and treats on our pillows with the music turned on! The shower was enormous, easily fits two people with a handheld nozzle (no tub). Bath towels were very soft and extremely large!! My husband and I went to the gym on our first morning there...incredible!!!! The treadmills, ellipticals, and bikes all had flat screen tv's attached to them with personal remotes and headphones. They had a large variety of new state-of-the-art weight machines with racks of free weights, multiple swiss balls and even BOSU trainers with mirrored walls throughout in addition to fresh towels and pitchers of ice water with sliced oranges and lemons in the bottom as well as a personal trainer wandering around. We didn't get a chance to try out the spa, but it looked amazing also! The J Bar was smaller than what I expected and never was very crowded, but definitely had that \"lounge\" feel to it with comfortable seating and candlelight. The concierge gave us great recommendations for dining and even gave us business cards to give the hostess if there was a wait to get us \"moved up on the list\". We never had a wait, so we didn't get to use them. Check out wasn't until 2 pm, so that was nice also and the front desk tagged and stored our luggage for us while we spent Sunday in the city! My only complaint would be that the valet cost was $42/night, but it's Chicago! It's probably that much anywhere and they were very prompt and courteous. Would I choose the James again???? ABSOLUTELY!!!!! I don't know if I would pay $400/night to stay there, but if you want to try your luck that you will be placed there, I would try hotwire.

Granted, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a world traveler and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sort of cheap when it comes to hotels. The hotel impressed me before I landed at O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122hare. I called to say I would be arriving in Chicago at 11 a.m. and was wondering if I could check in early. A charming staff person told me the hotel would do its best to get us into our room early. The hotel did not disappoint. They sent us up to a room on the 4th floor, which, actually was not ready. We returned to the front desk. The staff was very apologetic. We remained our charming selves. They offered us a suite on the 14th floor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An upgrade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, I asked, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at no additional charge?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what they did for us. We went up the elevator again, this time, feeling a glowing benevolence for all our surroundings. We examined the lobby, this is no ordinary minimalist box. The James has a sense of style that would make Ian Schraeger want to rethink the Delano. Start with the cool signage, visible from far away for those of us who are directionally challenged, pass the cute doorman, notice the stainless steel water bowl for dogs and the giant canister of dog bones before you enter the lobby. Once inside, even the coolest among us, will grin. The floor to ceiling windows fronting the street let the natural light shine in on the comfortable furnishings, terrazzo floor and warm wood front desk. There are book shelves filled with design books and newspapers. This is a lobby I would actually sit in. Hotel chains everywhere should try to steal the James\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s curator. Do hotels have curators? The art collection is fabulous. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re dumb enough to come to Chicago and not stay at the James, at least check out the art. An installation in the lobby by Joel Ross of 50 vintage suitcases, filled with the dismantled contents of an entire motel room should not be missed. Everywhere else you look has some sort of interesting mural or photograph. The hotel rooms also have original photographs. No boring recycled stuff here. Our suite was beautifully furnished. The designer actually considered how guests would use the space. The bathroom was immaculate, beautiful and conveniently set up, one of the few hotel bathrooms that had decent light and space to put your stuff. Finally someone had the sense to put a towel bar and shelf under the sink and even remembered to put a ledge above the sink for your toothbrush, lens case, etc. I appreciated every moment I spent standing on the cool matte brown tiles and washing up at the marble vanity with the stylish square sink. The room had a sitting area with a flat screen tv, a modernist couch that would certainly sleep a kid, a Bertoia chair and a Saarinen style coffee table. Everything fit perfectly to make a cozy spot. The suite also had a bar area with martini glasses, a stainless steel ice bucket, small sink, refrigerator, coffee maker and of course, a mini bar. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m never tempted by a mini bar, it goes back to the cheap thing. The bed and bedding may have been the best part. The James had the best bed I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever slept in. The mattress was firm, even though it had one of those pillow top things that I usually hate. The pillows were also not too hard and not too soft. The designer cleverly outfitted the room with a bench with drawers, so there is both seating and storage next to the bed. Even the clock projects on to the ceiling so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to lift your head to check the time. I need to get one of those to truly improve the quality of my life. Sorry I know I sound like a crazy fan, but I just can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help myself. Loved the white waffle weave robes & the red slippers. The red & white theme extended to the crisp white stationary & the freshly sharpened red pencil. Did I mention that I love red? I even loved the closet because it had cool red wood hangers. Is there nothing these people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think of? Oh, and one more thing, when I asked if I could get a late check out time, the front desk guy smiled broadly and said check out time is at 2 p.m. So who needs late check out time at the James? I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t examine the gym or the spa, nor did I eat dinner in the restaurant. But, we did eat breakfast there and I do need to rave about it. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s called David Burke\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Primehouse, so I was amazed that a place that seems like a steakhouse could do breakfast so well. I ate a blueberry muffin that was large & can only be described as wall to wall blueberries. The waiter brought the coffee to the table in a carafe, which means so much to me, since I like my coffee burning hot and only like a half a cup at a time, so it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cool off too much. Do I sound spoiled and picky? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m really not, just particular when it comes to food and coffee. My daughter ordered boring oatmeal that came with beautiful berries. She loved it. While we were waiting for our food, something called orange slushy appeared, complimentary, of course, because the chef knows \u00e2\u20ac\u0153how hot it is out.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After I raved to the waiter about my muffin, he insisted that we try a sample of something off the dinner dessert menu. He brought an artfully presented dessert that lived up to it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stylish presentation. Have you ever heard of cheesecake lollipops? Three arrived in different flavors; peanut butter, white chocolate raspberry and some kind of crispy, nutty flavor. Oh, there was strawberry mousse on the plate too. I have been dreaming and salivating about that dessert since. So, I want all the world to know, that I love the James! Now, I just have to convince my husband that only dumb tourists, who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know any better, stay at the Four Seasons. Note: The James will be opening in New York City and Miami Beach. Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to stay at the NYC James. Just wonder if the staff can possibly be as delightful and unjaded there as they are in Chicago. The James Hotel is located 55 E. Ontario.

We used the valet service to park our car for the 3 nights we stayed. Upon departing, we realized that we had a substantial ding in our driver's side door.

The HD screens are a nice touch and the staff is very friendly and helpful. However, we were on the top floor and the air conditioning couldn't keep up - the room was a bit warm and the outside temp was only the low 80's. Despite the contemporary look, the furniture is uncomfortable. In the bathroom, they have high-end soaps and lotions, but about the cheapest, roughest facial tissue and toilet paper possible, and in our room the overhead shower dripped, so it was more annoying than enjoyable.

Water presuure was very very low on the evening we arrived. Called the front desk and the operator was willing to send someone up to check it. However it was clearly a system wide water supply problem, so we declined. By morning the water presuure was back to normal. Be forewarned. If you park a car there and once they add the city taxes to the bill the cost per night will be $100 more than the quoted rate. So our $340 room ended up being $440. Was it a $400 hotel?

We had a loft room (821) which I highly recommend though there is no view. Our rate was $299 for the first night and $269 the next two nights - we booked via the hotel but requested the TravelZoo rate. In a loft room you can bring your own movies to play on the projector (yes, your own projector TV with a Bose 5.1 surround system) or the front desk has a bunch from which you can choose. Check in: I had a difficult check-in and it had me wondering if I had made a mistake. Lisa from the front desk handled it well, though, (the room they gave me had no projector) and her manager offered to upgrade me to one of their executive apartments. I declined, though, as I really wanted the projector. When we bring the Davooda-offspring we will book an apartment. Concierge: Some of the best we've seen in Chicago and we've stayed at all the four-stars and some of the five-stars. Laura got us on the guest list at The Underground, Billy Dec's new club, and we had a great time - even had a hosted bar with free vodka drinks! Room service: we dined in our room twice and both times the delivery was on time and service was perfect. Even at 2:30 am the burger tasted like it had just come off the wood-fired grill! Worth the extra cost (though we had a 20% discount from TravelZoo) Bath: A walk-in shower, huge towels, and Kiehl's (I think) bath products make it a winner. Bed: huge and comfy - though kinda warm. Had to keep the AC cranked overnight Media - two plasma TV's in addition to the projector, CD/radio with IPOD dock Housekeeping: turndown service around 6pm with a cookie was nice, and they give you all the ice you want (we travel with our own cooler so that's a plus) The Lobby Bar: good service, they make a good Manhattan and play this awesome world music that is very relaxing. Primehouse - did not dine here this time but had a great breakfast on the business trip JBar - We walked in and out - not much going on Saturday at midnight but, then again, it was Memorial Day weekend and Chicagoans typically leave town Location: Couldn't be better. Trader Joe's right across the street for in-room noshing or a nice bottle of wine. Pizzeria Due - one of Chicago's best is one block west. (((TIP: Walk to Due's and order your pizza for pickup later. There is really no atmosphere at Due's and it's always packed, so pickup your pizza, asking them to cut the pizza and give you plastic plates and utensils, and enjoy it with a bottle of wine from Trader Joe's while watching a move in your room))) Michigan Avenue shopping is just one block east and Rush Street nightlife begins right outside the east door of The James. Bloomie's Home Store one block east. Our favorite thing: The attentive staff is very friendly and professional. We felt like \"big-shots\" the whole time.

There was a very well stocked mini bar, as well as full bottles and a cocktail shaker for fixing more than one or two drinks. The bed was very, very comfortable, the TV was great, and the clock in the room was one of the kind that projects the time on the ceiling. Turn down service provided a cookie and placed the robe and slippers on the bed. There is a steakhouse in the hotel that serves breakfast and lunch as well as dinner. I didn't have the opportunity to dine there, but it was always very crowded. Check elsewhere for reviews. The location is two blocks west of Michigan Avenue and all its shopping. A few blocks farther east is Lake Michigan; great for a walk during warmer months (not so much in the middle of winter).
