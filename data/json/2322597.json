Let me share some of my observations: \u2022Beautiful, modern structure- more like a Park Hyatt than a Four Seasons, but very tastefully done. The rooms are contemporary with clean lines, yet super luxe as expected from the FS. Toiletries are La Occitane and the bathrooms have cool features such as a little TV embedded in the mirror. \u2022Interesting Hotel Policies- we booked a fairly reasonable rate as part of the hotel\u2019s introductory rates, and got a romance package that included breakfast and 2 mimosas. The package was a no- brainer, as was just $20-30 more than the room by itself. We had booked the night prior, and there were certainly rooms open in each category. During check in, we were offered an upgrade to a suite or a premier harbor view room (we had booked the standard harbor view, which is a step up than the basic marina view). Here was my shock- there was a cost to upgrade. I cannot recall the last time a hotel at the FS level charged for upgrades, when there are obviously open rooms available.(We were upgraded several levels at FS Bali some years ago, and the price difference between those rooms was way more than the total cost of a room at FS Baltimore!!) However shocked I was, we did shell out a bit for the corner view as the host talked it up quite a bit. Very odd policy, might be more suited for a Marriott, but took me by surprise here. \u2022Room views - so after my shock at the upgrade situation, we checked into our premier corner harbor view room. The room had floor to ceiling windows in place of any outward facing walls. As some other reviewers have commented, one whole wall faces a parking lot and the Marriott. There\u2019s only a smaller wall that faced the actual harbor. If this was the premier room, I wonder what views the standard rooms have. On observing the hotel from the street, there are a host of rooms that looked to have excellent views, I wonder if they were all suites. \u2022Excellent bar/restaurant/caf\u00e9- the Michael Mina tavern was outstanding. Fancy \u2018tavern\u2019 interiors- think a super luxurious Pottery Barn, with interesting details such as small fireplaces, fox fur pillows everywhere. We did not have dinner, but enjoyed the tavern menu- the burger was one of the best I have ever had. There is also a caf\u00e9 next door, with a host of goodies- crab pies, amazing chai tea, beignets! It seemed like a hang out spot for the John Hopkins business school alums, and I see why- calming view and a killer cup of coffee makes for a good spot to get some work done. Also did room service for a late dinner and our package breakfast- good, but not excellent. \u2022Prime location- I was blown away by the inner harbor and fells point neighborhoods. It was my first time visiting Baltimore, and it is fun! Everything is a 5-7 minute walk from the hotel, including the aquarium. We spent one evening bar-hopping thru Fells Point- great wine stores, Waterfront grille was very cool as well. \u2022Service is not Four Seasons par- the very fact that one had to think about service at a FS, since it is usually something you take for granted as being outstanding, goes to show there is still work to be done. The staff was confused, over whelmed and just plain rude in some cases, especially over the phone. The punch line- worth the value at this point, once the hotel moves past the introductory rates, hopefully they also improve on some of the policies and service, as it still needs work to be a true Four Seasons property.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Suburban Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cFab hotel - very chic\u201d", "Author": "rimavh", "ReviewID": "UR125261645", "Content": "We booked 6 rooms at the Four Seasons Baltimore. 6 couples.

The spa area is clean and restful with nice treatment rooms and a very good \"hot relaxation area\" with jacuzzis, steam (with those changing colored pinpoint liights in the ceiling), sauna and heated beds.

Yes, it's a beautiful and new building. Yes, it's the best hotel in Baltimore (not difficult to achieve). And yes, eventually it will become a true Four Seasons hotel. But it's not there yet and needs some work. The basic problem is the staffing model. The hotel is overwhelmed by its success. It needs more people on duty and the staff needs to remember that while it's important to be friendly, it's also important to get the job done. Pretty much every staff person with whom we spoke said they were too busy. We agree. We stayed one night during a recent three-day weekend when the hotel was hosting two weddings, one for a prominent local businessman and the other a huge destination wedding. We were not part of weddings but felt their impact. Sunday room service breakfast took an hour to deliver. The spa needed two receptionists on duty when there was only one. The front desk could not check out guests in a timely manner because they were either on the phone (why?) or chatting with friends. And then there was the parking. When you charge $40 for overnight parking you had better deliver good service. When we checked in on a Saturday afternoon we were assured that it would take only seven minutes to bring up our car, but you had to wonder because the place was already backed up and too many livery cars were allowed to idle in the small driveway. The next day, following the lousy and long checkout experience, our car was still not available even though we had called ahead. In the end it took more than 30 minutes to get the car to us and even then we had to load our luggage from the cart to the car because the staff, while numerous, was enjoying the view more than getting their job done. Was it the end of the world? No, but it also was not what one expects for $40 or from a Four Seasons. It wasn't all bad and the hotel deserves credit for trying hard. In our case, they delivered champagne and strawberries to us with an anniversary card even though it wasn't our anniversary -- but we appreciated the thought. The front desk offered a suite for a small upcharge but when told we preferred a good view over a bigger room, they kept us in our original room and passed on the additional revenue that a dishonest answer would have elicited. The bell staff, while harried, was terrific. The rooms are, indeed, beautiful. And the front desk clerk removed our breakfast charge after noticing my frustration with the checkout process and without even being asked. She also promised manager follow-up, which was nice. Will we be back? Of course we will. It's a beautiful escape destination in a neighborhood with some of the best restaurants in the DC/Baltimore region and a vibrant modern urban scene. We hear the hotel bar is excellent and look forward to sitting on the pool deck in better weather.

When \"comped\" items were delivered, server carried galsses with her fingers inside and dishes against her jacket to quickly complete service.

The staff is helpful and friendly, the lobby flowers are stunning, the views from the room and the fitness center were amazing. The rooms have floor to ceiling windows and overlook the marina/harbor and are a great size. You feel like you are in your own apartment instead of a hotel room. The bathrooms are wonderfully appointed and for once have space to put your belongings. Also, it was very quiet in the room even though you are walking distance to many shops and restaurants. The fitness center is on the top floor and overlooks the harbor. It has plenty of cardio equipment as well as free weights and the pool outside offers beautiful views. I will not stay any where else when I travel to Baltimore. The staff definitely makes you feel like they are excited to have you there and were able to check me in and get me settled all while I was on a conference call. It's nice to have a staff that understands that sometimes you can't get off the phone!

I have been to many five star hotels but this hotel truly shines!!! The hotel is wonderfully located near the Inner Harbor, Little Italy, downtown Baltimore and two major medical centers, University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins Hospital. When we drove up, we were immediately greeted by the doormen along with three other staff members before arriving at the front desk. The front desk staff was welcoming, kind and efficient. We were in awe of how beautiful the lobby and the entire hotel is. The art work is magnificent and the hotel is modern, clean, and advanced in technology. Our room had a magnificent view of the harbor and was equipped with a state of the art television and a T.V. even built into the glass of the bathroom wall. The rooms were modern and stylish and very roomy. The bed linens and bed itself made for hypnotic sleep and we enjoyed the wonderful bathroom and room amenities even having an nespresso maker in our room. The spa was an experience that I will always remember. The jacuzzi had lounges within them to ultimately relax, there were heated chairs, wonderful showers and steam and sauna rooms. The spa treatments were wide ranging and creatively magnificent. Being a foodie however I must say that besides the beautiful hotel and its amenities, Wit and Wisdom, the Michael Mina inspired restaurant is magnificent. The manager, Anthony Kinn, who we knew from his wonderful management of the Four Seasons Restaurant in Scottsdale, has done a magnificent job in making this restaurant a truly special dining experience. The restaurant has a wonderful \"vibe\" and its theme is to bring the flavors and foods from the region and prepare them in a spectacular manner using multiple open ovens that cause a permeation of the natural flavors throughout the restaurant. The music in the restaurant is well suited and the staff and service was amazing and efficient. I enjoyed lobster corndogs, clams, rib eye steak and delicious side dishes of brussel sprouts, potatoes and mushrooms. All very prepared carefully and with wonderful craft. The desserts were innovative. We had a maple nut pudding and a heavely rendition of a candy bar. The wine list was extensive and complete. My wife and I both agreed that whether for pleasure, to attend a conference, or to stay here if we needed to address medical concerns at one of the famous hospitals in Baltimore, this is the place to stay!!! We looked at the ballroom space and what is so unique is that it is on the second floor so the space has windows all around it to capture the beautiful water.

We were booked for a multi day stay during Xmas. Checked in at Valet 54.00 per day plus in and out charge plus gratuity. Do not ask staff for directions. We ended up 45 minutes late for The Lion King after receiving bad directions from Four Seasons staff. Oh voy! Initial check in was not smooth as they were in the middle of a shift change! How Motel 6 of them!!! After waiting what seemed like forever we were told that our room was not yet ready! A flambouyant staffer offered us drinks at the bar until it was ready. A Bellman took our bags somewhere and off to the bar we went. The drinks were good but there was a HORRIBLE constant smell of burning ash that made me sneeze and nearly Vomit in the bar. I know, gross. Imagine how we felt!! About 20 minutes later we were offered apologies and escorted to our room. It was Totally unacceptable. We requested a corner room upon reservations, didn't get it. The stuffy room was soo small that it felt boxy with little ventilation. The a/c had a slight banging sound. The hallways in the room were very narrow and worst of all someone left a cigarette bud in the shower! The bathroom smelled of stale smoke. Is this the Four Seasons or Motel 6 ?! Additionally the mattress was uncomfortable and street noises could be heard. Also the curtains stop in the middle of the window thus blocking some of the view. Later that evening we were 45 minutes late for The Lion King after receiving bad directions from Four Seasons staff. Again, how Motel 6 of them. The only compliment I can offer this Under Experienced hotel is a view of the harbor. The next morning after our bad experiences with this possibly 1 star hotel, we CHECKED. OUT! And instead of offering us a courtesy discount Management confirmed that our card would be charged for all of the reserved days! Fine.

The sleeping rooms look out over the city or out at the Baltimore Harbor. The staff is well trained as many are implants from other Four Seasons Hotels from across the country. There are a couple of \"punch-list\" items that need fixing in the spa but, overall, the place is incredible! We could not believe the popularity of the bar and restaurant in the evenings where one can find many well dressed/heeled people enjoying libations around a uniquely modern bar. The decor of dark hard wood floors, bubbly glass lamps and velvet couches and chairs adds a welcoming warm elegance to this locale. The sleeping rooms are of course five star comfortable, housekeeping impeccable and food delicious. The front desk staff is great and my only complaints were that the concierge (originally from Texas) needs to be trained on where the Meyerhoff Symphony Hall is located. We were given walking directions that sent us to their corporate headquarters, then had to take a cab as it was too far to walk. The restaurant service was a bit slow and inconsistent, but, I think this is due to the newness of the property. Otherwise, be aware that parking is $54.00 per night if you valet.
