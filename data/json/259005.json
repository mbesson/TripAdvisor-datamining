He silently checked us in and then told us our room number, what floor it was on and where the elevator was and handed the key over. He did not mention that a staff member could bring our bags up for us. The two of us with our two 40L packs (not very big) crammed into the tiny, old and worn elevator and headed for our room. We were pleasantly surprised when we entered our room. So spacious! Nice d\u00e9cor, nice bathroom and overall everything was very clean. The bed was very hard but we still managed to sleep well. The only downfall to this room was the shower head. It was rather high and didn\u2019t seem easy to adjust if at all adjustable and the water came out with such force! Usually some decent force to the water can be great but this was beyond that and to the point it was a bit tender on the skin and harsh on the face and a little damaging on the hair. They offered a delicious selection of food at breakfast. A variety of breads, deli meats, pastries, cereals, fruit, etc. The croissants had Nutella centres, as did the mini donuts! The nice sunny yellow d\u00e9cor of the breakfast room is a nice start to your day. We encountered a different man on reception our first morning there who was more friendly and helpful than the man the day before hand. He gave us directions and advice on where to go and how to get there. The hotel was only a 30 \u2013 40 minute walk from Trinita dei Monti, The Spanish Steps, Keats-Shelley Memorial Musuem, Trevi Fountain, Fontana del Tritone, and only about 15 minutes from Villa Borghese. So handy to everything and such a nice walk to get there. All in all it wasn\u2019t a bad stay.

Because our room is one ground floor next to the breakfast area, we were awaken more by the breakfast staff banging stuff around than by the traffic noise. Breakfast is minimal and the breakfast lady doesn't refill things quickly, so many times, we had to ask. Wifi is available for a fee. Amazingly, considering it's in Rome, parking here is FREE. They have a small gated parking lot in the back where they just jam cars in one by one. On a side note, in Rome, pay attention to road signs and traffic if you're driving because some square are not blocked off, but cars are not allowed. This was our only mishap while driving for 3 weeks all over Italy. We drove without paying attention onto the square in front of the Pantheon and were fragged down by the policia.

Incredible architecture and frescoes in main building. . Staff polite but, on occasion, a bit aloof - something often found in Relais & Chateaux hotels.Bedroom and bathroom in annexe were excellent - clean and well equipped. Breakfast Buffet good but not special. Bar and lounge service could be slow.

We knew the oputside pool was closed for \"the winter\" but still didn't find it, it's \"down the road\" somewhere. We didn't dine in the evening preferring something more typical and local - good restaurants in Frascati were very hard to find, we found \"Al 19\" to be the best local food and value for money. Hotel Grazioili offers a free minibus shuttle to Frascati station to co-incide with train timetable and must be prebooked. Trains can be 2-3 hours apart and taxis, for a 3-5 minute ride to Frasacti town centre, are 10-12 Euros! The hotel would not survive without its shuttle.

Be aware that this hotel is not in the central city. It is on Via Salaria outside the Aurelian wall. If you don't mind public transit (which is very good and easy to use in Rome), there is a bus stop right outside that takes you directly into the main part of town. A short walk away (4-5 blocks) is Piazza Buenos Aires where there is a taxi stand and streetcar/tram stops which can take you straight to the Villa Borghese or the Vatican, for example. Via Salaria is a quite busy and noisy street (and it's hard to escape road noise in Rome anyway), which is only an issue if you have your windows open. The one other drawback here is that the rooms are, by American standards, quite small and cramped. By European standards, however, our room seemed amply spacious; there was an armoire (including safe, hanging space, drawers, and mini bar, with tv mounted above), king bed, luggage stand, and chair, and that was it. Space between the bed and the wall was tight but not too tight (about 15 inches I'd guess). It was definitely cozy for two people. The breakfast served by the hotel in the mornings is a nice surprise by Roman standards, but is nothing like an American or English breakfast. There are pastries and cakes, cheese and coldcuts, some juices, and eggs (yay!) and sometimes bacon. Note that coffee is, like everywhere else in Rome, going to be either espresso or americano (which is espresso with water added). Are you really here for the breakfast, anyway? Otherwise the place is quite nice and clean, staff were reasonably friendly, and once we got the hang of getting in and out of the city center using the bus, we were satisfied with our stay. We got a good rate through hotels.com and that seemed to make it worthwhile.

The rural setting is quiet and the grounds and buildings look fantastic. I stayed in rooms situated in outbuildings away from the main Villa and they were really simply furnished and nice but a few things could have been better. TV remote control was broken and only worked intermittently. TV channel choice was also surprisingly limited with CNN being the only English Channel available - no BBC World - a surprising ommission. The air conditioning control in my room also made loud clicking sounds but at least was work (perhaps even worked too well!), The bath stopper is operated by one of those knobs at the end of the bath but the plastic assembly was broken and it was impossible to get the bath stopped to engage. I had to use toilet paper to stop up the bathplug in order to run a bath. The shower was powerful and with good control over temperature, but it also dumped a lot of water onto the adjacent toilet seat due to the lack of a wrap-around curtain. The enamel bath itself had a few dents that had been badly touched up with paint and the rubber shower mat had lots of fungal growth on the bottom side that fell into the bath when I lifted it out. Main building is beautiful with wonderful paintings inside apparently still under restoration. Views north towards Rome were great. Service seemed quite poor at reception on arrival - the receptionist somehow failed to see me waving at her and continued bashing away on her PC until I was forced to \"ding the bell\". I arrived late one evening (1:30am) and found both gates closed. It took several minutes of ringing to attract the attention of a member of staff - thankfully it was not raining. Car parking - there are a few reserved spaces on the site but main parking is down the hill a bit and is not protected. However the area appears quiet and no signs of broken glass which is common in Britain for example. As another reviewer has said, Breakfast was very limited with some \"own brand\" round corn flakes on offer rather than the standard Kellogs type you would normally expect. Limited hot food, more like a better buffet in a Novotel than somewhere that holds itself to be a really classy hotel. Dinner service one evening also appeared pretty slow - even with relatively few people staying. A colleague also complained that she had no hot water in her bedroom on one of the mornings. That is not acceptable.
