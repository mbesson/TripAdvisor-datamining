For this kind of hotel (small 3-star range), it met our expectations and we were generally happy with our stay. Key points are: - great location - 5 min walk to blue mosque and other key sites and less than 10 minutes to the tram line. - we got one of the larger rooms (207) which cost more than the regular size so it was spacious, well-appointed with nice fixtures/furniture and clean. Bed was basic, a little on the hard side but equipped with good comforter and pillows. Bathroom was a tad small, but normal for most hotels around here and shower was good - strong water pressure and hot water. - like most hotels in this area be prepared for climbing 2-3 flights of stairs to get to your room or request ground floor. - service was generally good - all staff members were helpful and friendly. - breakfast was served in a rooftop dining room with seating inside and out and a great view of the sea of Marmara. Decent spread with scrambled eggs, breads ,cheeses, fruits, cold cuts, jams etc. Also they serve tea every afternoon in the small lobby.

I only found this out after booking it through a booking site. We were flying into Sabia Gokcen airport which is quite far outside the city on the Asian side. I found it difficult to ascertain how to get to the hotel using the various methods from the airport so I booked a transfer with the hotel which was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50 each way which divided between three of us was fine. We had a 7 seater pick us up and drop us so it is good value for larger groups. I cannot say enough about the staff here they are absolutely wonderful. Ahmed in reception was very helpful with tips about the city and gave us excellent advise on using the Metro and the ferries (we didn't get a chance to take the ferry to the otherside). I was trying to get hold of family in Istanbul and he told me about the phone cards for the public phones which was a great help. I didn't catch the name of the lady who deals with the breakfasts in the morning but she was lovely and eager to help even though she had limited English. The breakfast is great, the hot part consists of scrambled eggs mixed with different things like meat or potatoes, a type of sausage and savoury turkish pastry. There are olives, cucumber, tomato, cheese and cold meats on offer as well as a variety of breads and cereals. One tip the peach juice is nicer than the orange juice which my friend told me tasted like cordial. The view from the restaurant is breathtaking - the Blue Mosque to the back and the Marmara sea to the front. I loved staring out at the flotilla of ships that seemed to sit there each morning. The rooms are the only real downfall. The average rooms are small and the double bed feels quite small by husband's feet were sticking out well over the end of the bed. We had to change rooms because we could not sleep in the original room which faced the street and the mosque. If you have not visited a Muslim country before be prepared for the early morning call the prayer. Added to this was the plethora of seagulls and the noise of cars gunning it up the hill outside. They very kindly changed our room to one facing out over the terrace we even got a little balcony - we couldn't use it due to the dreadful weather. The location is wonderful apart from being close to the main tourist attractions in Sultanahmet there are a number of restaurants in the immediate vicinity and a small supermarket where you can purchase some drinks to put in the fridge in your room. My criticisms of the hotel are these: the shower sealant had been affected by mould inside and looked quite dingy and this was the case in both bathrooms, the doors to the bedrooms and bathrooms were scuffed, they were doing up the reception area so it got a little noisy and dusty, the heating was not on during the day and trying to get the aircon unit to provide any heat proved too baffling for me and the hair dryer in my friend's room had bubbled in parts due to overheating. I would absolutely recommend this hotel as it is exceptional value for money and the service is second to none.

My husband and I stayed for five nights in January 2012 and couldn't have been happier with the experience. Our room was gorgeous, and expertly cleaned every day. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and the heater kept us nice and toasty. The hotel itself is tucked down a tiny side street, and it's very quiet at night. Breakfast is included, and what a feast! There was something for everyone, mostly homemade, and all the Turkish black tea you could drink. Plus, the view from the breakfast cafe is unparalleled, and was a wonderful start to our mornings. We met many people from all over the world each morning, and there was a definite sense of community among the patrons. You're within easy walking distance of the Blue Mosque, the Hippodrome, the Hagia Sophia museum, the Grand Bazaar and the Topkapi palace, and the Spice Bazaar is only about a 15-20 minute walk away. I also highly recommend you take the tiny ferry to Eyup (ask the staff where to find the ferry building as it's a bit hidden away) for only 2TL per person - a lovely little town practically devoid of tourists. But the real treasure of this hotel is the staff. We became fast friends with almost all of the front-desk folks, the woman who cleaned our room and the women who run the breakfast cafe. They were always more than happy to help us find a point of interest, suggest a local place to eat (try Doy Doy - delicious!) and help us with our lamentable Turkish.

Located in Sultanahmet district, this quaint hotel is a very short walk from the Marmara sea as well as Ayasofia mosque, Blue mosque, Grand Bazaar, good restaurants, bars, little shops, and stores to get essentials, etc. We stayed for 3 nights, and from the first moment to the last, we were welcomed with open arms. We traveled with my sister and brother-in-law and their 11month old baby, and we felt right at home. We arrived at 10:30am after a long flight, and they were able to give us our rooms immediately so that we could freshen up and take care of the baby. They always had good advice on where to go, as well as some decent Turkish coffee when we started to run down. The breakfast buffet is great - mix of European and Middle-Eastern foods. And you eat overlooking the Marmara Sea and can even eat out in the courtyard or on the rooftop veranda where you can see the Blue Mosque. If you're looking for sugary doughnuts and waffles of a typical American breakfast, go to an American chain hotel. However, if you typically like to stay in a traditional location and try to use the language and learn about the culture, stay at Tashkonak! After breakfast on the second day, they even offered to wash our baby bottles in their dishwasher because we didn't have a good place to clean them well - this example typifies their service and family atmosphere. The only minor things, which are not complaints, but just to give travelers a heads up are that the beds are a little hard. I recommend that they add some small pillow tops to the beds. And for those of you who have a room that faces the street, there is a local Mosque that has the sunrise call to prayer which is pretty loud because it's right across the street. I personally love the call to prayer sound, and I woke up and took a walk on the deserted cobblestone streets at 6am every morning, but if you like to sleep in a little and you think the call to prayer will wake you, then ask for a room on the backside of the hotel. You'll still hear call to prayer (it's a Muslim-majority country after all), but on the backside, the sound is more muffled.

We stayed here for 2N before we headed out to Izmir and Cappadocia. We had lined up the Airport transfer with the hotel and the transfer was right on time and very efficient. It is slightly difficult to get to the hotel on Public transport. To get here, you can take the metro from the airport to the tram changeover station (Zeytinburnu). Catch the tram from this station to the Sultanahmet tram station. From there its a 10 minute walk (downhill) to get to the hotel Once we got here, check in was quick and our room was great. The only downside was that it was on the Ground floor. No other rooms were available since they were sold out for the Christmas weekend. Ahmed at the front desk was very helpful in pointing out how we could walk to nearby attractions and also educating us about the tram/metro system. All major attractions are a 5-10 minute walk away. The rooms are nice, clean and spacious. The beds are great and the decor of the rooms was also nice and quirky. The breakfast is served on the rooftop restaurant. From here you can watch across the Bospherous and look at the Seagulls flying across. The breakfast spread is great with lots of home cooked bread, cheese and fresh fruits. Especially loved the Peach juice being served. We had booked a further 3N with the Tashknoak Suites and wanted to leave our luggage back at this hotel while we took our trip. They gladly kept our luggage with them for a week and also sent it across to our room which was in the next building on the return leg. Do note that they offer a 8% discount for a Cash payment which I thought was a great bonus. The free wi-fi made it very easy to stay in touch with friends. There is also a PC in the lobby which you can use to send out emails or check facebook.

First the country, Turkey, was chosen for the May 9th \"Victory in Europe\" holiday weekend primarily because our first choice, Georgia, was frustrated by visa bureaucracy. This development had us scrambling for alternatives for our first escape from Baku. Visa-friendly Turkey and its capital was a no brainer Plan B. As my wife was a first timer (and I had not been to Istanbul in about 15 years) we chose the Sultanamet section of town, with all its nearby sites. True to the hotel's word, things were quite close. Everything in Sultanamet was a brief walk away. The hotel itself was also quite lovely, with a very charming, authentic feel. The upstairs dining room where breakfast was served offered great views on sunny days. The service was quite good as well. Friendly and helpful, though I did get the sense that the managers were interested in steering us to various packaged tours, only one of which we took (a Bosphorous Trip), and which turned out to be a bit of a disappointment. On several days of our stay, a very friendly English woman would show up (she appeared to be some sort of consultant for the hotel) and she gave us great advice and perspectives on things. I should have listened to her more about the choice of boat trips. The only downside was our room. Though clean with a sufficiently comfortable bed, big enough for me, my wife and our then one-year-old son, there was barely enough room to stand up otherwise.

On arriving at the airport we were met by our transfer car and taken direct to the hotel. Professional and a good start. We received an excellent welcome and Hayati and the other staff were very welcoming. Our room was on the small side but perfectly OK. Hayati gave us a rundown of all the local attractions and suggested some tours we may like to take. We have been to Istanbul before but it was great that he took the time to do this. And it's not for show. We saw all guests get the same treatment! A lot of hotels could learn from this!! The reception staff were always on hand if you had any questions and we had a couple of really good 'general chats' about 'stuff'. No tea making facilities in the room but free tea is laid on in the foyer from 3pm every afternoon!! Breakfast. Mostly cold buffet and cereals but enough choice with meats, cheeses, jams, fresh bread, juice, team and fresh coffee. So plenty to eat to send you on your way for the day. Perhaps a bit of variety would be nice but that's being pretty picky. Breakfast room on top floor with superb views!! The hotel is very clean and tidy and the room service was excellent too. There were a couple of minor things that were not 100% but to be honest, if you have to complain about trivia, get on the TV show '4 in a bed'! The hotel is in a great location just a short walk from the big local attractions. We booked a transfer from the hotel back to the airport. You can share with others for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 ea but we felt the personal service offered was worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10 each and the transfer was impeccable too. This is great as you get the transfer when you want, not at set times as offered at many places locally. It's a choice thing. Would I stay here again? Definitely. For the price this hotel was a hit for us! OTHER STUFF Local restaurants. Tamara!! (3 mins from hotel). YES!! Great prices and superb food. BIG meal for 2 just 60tl. No alcohol served. Hippodrome (3 mins from hotel)?? NO! This is meant to be a licensed place. My full kebab didn't have the lamb chop but some tasteless frozen chicken thing. No apology until I asked why I had not been served what I ordered. Got some weak excuse about the boss not having all the ingredients. BASIL!!!!!!! Do try the Red Bus tour. Very good! The Dolmabache Palace is also worth a visit and at 40tl each it's worth it if you like stately home type visits. Wander around the spice market and grand bazaar (15 min walk from hotel). No visit to Istanbul would be complete without that. Barter for anything you buy but you may also be able to buy cheaper elsewhere!!! There are dozens of places to eat with lunch available from just 3-4tl EACH! Loads of choice, even in the Taksim Sq area. Take a ferry to the Asian side from Dock 4 (35 minute walk from hotel) at Eminonou next to the Galata Bridge. Some great photo opportunities. Public transport. Top marks for the lot! Dolmus... public minibus' that go all over the place, 2.50tl each per trip. Tram. 2tl per ride. Metro. 2tl per ride. Excellent way to get around! We did hear of one guest who got turned over by a local taxi driver for a short trip. The hotel even tried to get that sorted. So I guess the answer would be to get the price before you start!

We had a very similar experience. Although we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spent much time in the hotel itself, each time we left and came back we felt the warm welcoming attitude of the staff. We felt special, spoilt and part of the family. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we also felt that it was a home away from home. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t require the assistance of any of the local Information Offices in Istanbul. The staff is well-informed and they provided us with many helpful recommendations relating to sightseeing and restaurants. They are real ambassadors for Turkey and especially Istanbul. Here are some of the things they did for us; \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Arranged a Bosporus day trip. (Picked up from the hotel and dropped back to the hotel) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Organised the car hire (rang multiple companies to get us the multiple quotes) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Arranged the repair of my broken necklace \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Arranged the ferry tickets from Istanbul to Bandirma \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Helped us with the leather jacket purchases \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 And so on Their assistance saved us a great deal of time and allowed us the luxury to spend more time at the places we wanted to see. We highly recommend Tashkonak to anyone.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Strasbourg", "Title": "\u201cA pleasant and friendly place to stay\u201d", "Author": "1968Allan", "ReviewID": "UR119054520", "Content": "After a hectic week of making last-minute arrangements for our two-week holiday in Turkey, we were delighted to discover that the Hotel Tashkonak was indeed a 'lucky strike': an ideal place to stay during our week in Istanbul, and a place that was always pleasant to come back to after a long walk through one or another area of the city. The hotel's amenities have already been amply described by other reviewers: its clean, comfortable, air-conditioned rooms, each with a modern bathroom and - very important - excellent beds which always guaranteed a good night's sleep; the tasty and copious breakfasts on the roof terrace (with, yes, good coffee too!); a quiet garden patio for enjoying an afternoon cup of tea; and, last but not least, the courtesy and attentiveness of the staff who were always ready to fulfill our every wish. In this regard, I might mention that we were a five-member family group of two generations and mixed cultural backgrounds (German / French / Algerian), so it is particularly noteworthy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and to the credit of the staff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that each of us felt equally welcome and comfortable at the hotel. The very few small inconveniences (e.g., not much space for two suitcases in some of the rooms, no surface in the shower on which to place a bar of soap or bottle of shampoo, some noise from the general neighbourhood) were quite insignificant in comparison to the hotel's many advantages. Although Tashkonak is situated in the Sultanahmet area of the old city which abounds with tourist attractions and tourist facilities, its immediate location \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a fairly quiet side street \u00e2\u20ac\u201c still retains much of the flavour and atmosphere of 'old' Istanbul. I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting the city and would enjoy staying there again should I be fortunate enough to return to Istanbul in the near future.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cHome Away From Home\u201d", "Author": "JLB_10", "ReviewID": "UR118717523", "Content": "I don't know that we could have a better experience at a hotel than we did at Tashkonak. Being our first time to Istanbul, and to Turkey, we put a lot of faith into Tashkonak as our choice of hotel because it's where we kicked off our vacation and where we came back to finish our vacation. In total, we were there for 6 superb nights, and when we returned for the end of our trip it felt as if we were coming home. We are a family of 4 adults, who desired one large room with a door separating two bedrooms. No problem. I'm convinced Tashkonak has the ideal room for any traveller. The rooms were comfortable, nicely decorated, one was small but with enough room, and the room we returned to at the end of the trip was more spacious. Again, I think there's a room to fit everyone's needs. The AC worked great, the bathrooms were nice, TVs in all rooms and free wireless internet. Stairs are the only option of ascending or descending the hotel, FYI. You'll also hear the calls to prayer loud and clear anywhere throughout the city, FYI. The glory continues in the location, extra amenities and the staff (especially Hayati): Extra Amenities Upon arrival, you're greeted with refreshments on the patio which is a warm welcome. Tea time on the patio is available all afternoons at your leisure. The breakfast is downright killer. The best breakfast we had in our two weeks+ of travels. The view of over the Marmara Sea magnificent, and the wide selection of food will definitely suit anyone's tastes: tea, coffee, selection of breads, sweet treats, fresh fruit, eggs (differently styles each day), meats, cheeses, olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, at least a couple different vegetable or pasta salads, savory pastries...I mean, come on! Lastly, when we had to get up at 3am to go to the airport, the staff kindly prepared us to-go breakfast boxes. They will do that for anyone who asks. Location This spot is ideal. On a comfy side street in Sultanahmet, which is only wide enough for one car, so while there's traffic, it's pretty dang quiet. It's approximately a 5 minute walk to the Arasta Bazaar, the Blue Mosque, the Aya Sofya, the Hippodrome, a few more minutes to the Basilica Cistern, and perhaps 15 minutes to Topkapi Palace. Walking to the Grand Bazaar is about 15-20 minutes and to the Bosphorus or the Egyptian Spice Market is probably a half hour. I would ABSOLUTELY recommend staying on this side of the Bosphorus. Staff Hayati went out of his way for us on a daily basis, and by the end of it, we would have been happy to adopt him as an honorary family member. Our experience in Istanbul would not have been the same had he not made the recommendations that he did. The standouts were a Bosphorus/Black Sea cruise that was worth every penny (choosing a cruise is tough as there are many and they all want you to buy with them), so Hayati arranged that for us. He also gave us the best restaurant recommendations, and where possibly necessary, made reservations for us. He chatted with us every day, answered all of our questions patiently and happily, taught us a little bit of Turkish, welcomed us with open arms upon arrival and arranged for us to have to-go breakfast during the wee hours (3am) on our departure date. He is helpful, professional, friendly and caring. Just the right guy for the job. When we returned for the last portion of our trip at Tashkonak, we were as excited to see him as we were to be back in Istanbul. Although we dote on Hayati, the other staff members from the front desk to the breakfast area were very friendly, hospitable and all staff members are blessed with a fantastic sense of humor (which seems to be common in Turkey!).

We loved it and would come back! This was a recommendation from my father-in-law, who stayed here a couple of years ago. There are so many places to stay in Sultanahmet, and they all pretty much seem the same on the internet. We were happy to hear from him that Tashkonak was a great little place tucked away on a side street just a few blocks from the Blue Mosque. He described the fantastic service, the lovely morning breakfast on the rooftop with the view of the city and the sea, the convenience of being located right in the mix. This being our honeymoon, we were looking for somewhere nice enough to get a good night's sleep every night, but we were not seeking luxury accommodations in Istanbul because we knew we were only going to be in the room at night, and we were planning on more luxury type accommodations on a different portion of our trip. So we booked this place assuming it was going to meet our needs just fine, but it really exceeded them in a lot of ways! The staff was very friendly, and they were always ready to help us make some plans, find a place to eat or a hamam, provide info about a ferry or tour. They booked our shuttles to and from the airport, made us coffee when we got in and prepared some especially for us when we took a 5am shuttle out the day we departed. They even sent up a nice plate of fresh fruit for us on our second day. Breakfast on the roof is not to be missed. You will get a version of the standard Turkish breakfast which will include eggs, meat, cheese, breads, olives, yogurt, coffee, fruit, juice. It is a perfect way to start the day and you have views of the city and the Sea of Marmara from up there. We noticed an international crowd of visitors with a handful of other Americans mixed in. It was very nice to be in a place with people from all over. The location is perfect. It's nestled into a little side street just a few blocks from the Blue Mosque. From here you can easily walk to most of the old city sights and you can hop on the light rail/tram to other parts of the city. But although Sultanahmet is a very active and bustling place, Tashkonak is tucked away on a side street and it feels very peaceful and much removed from the action, which is nice when you are trying to sleep. We noticed a lot of other hotels which were right on main drags with cafes, restaurants, shops and a significantly more street activity. Tashkonak is a quick walk from the action, not right on top of it. One final note: Tashkonak does not provide state-of-the-art luxury accommodations. We stayed in a wonderfully decorated room that was quite large enough for our needs. There was no AC, and it was probably 90 degrees while we were there, but honestly it did not feel that hot in there. You're not going to get modern fixtures and furniture, flat screen TVs, huge bathrooms, double sinks, etc. You're going to get simple accommodations that provide a perfect base camp for a few days of adventures in the city. We loved this place and we will recommend to all of our friends, and if we come back to Istanbul, which I hope we do, we will stay at Tashkonak!", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Falls Church, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Monica W", "ReviewID": "UR117256626", "Content": "I stayed at the Taskhonak during my first trip to Istanbul and was pleased with the hotel.

We walk a lot so we made it over to the newer side by foot, and traveled further afield by boat. There is not a huge selection of food. It's all very touristy there (restaurant-wise), but it makes up for it by having many of the prime sight-seeing locations nearby. One warning - there are seagulls that live on the mosque across the street. Bring earplugs.

Overall, the hotel is incredible value for money, it is not the most chic (if that is what you are looking for), but it is very comfortable, cosy and with good staff.

Our most important criteria was value, given that we planned to spend as little time as possible indoors and more time away from our bedrooms experiencing Turkey, a high class elaborate service was something we were willing to waive for this particular excursion. Eventually we opted for a seemingly neutral venue - Hotel Tashkonak - a decision arrived at thanks mainly to the plaudits in a lot of the reviews for the place. It is not an exaggeration to say that Hotel Tashkonak blew us away. We got exactly what we expected from the quality of rooms which, in retrospect, were a snip for the amount paid. Incidentally our room overlooked a small traditional Ottoman mosque which made our stay even more pleasurable and authentic with the muezzin sounding a captivating call to prayer every morning. However, for me, the most gratifying thing I took from the trip to Istanbul wasn't the awe-inspiring beauty of the Blue Mosque (a 2 minute walk from the hotel) or the euphoria of the Grand Bazaar but it was the genuineness and chivalry of our friends that ran Hotel Tashkonak - from the bottom up the staff went out of their way to make our short stay a memorable one. The cleaner, kitchen staff, porters and management operated more as a family than a business and made it a point to get to know us at a personal level. Whatever your background or reasons for visiting Istanbul I would recommend that you stay at this gem.

There are a daunting number of hotels in the old quarters of Istanbul to consider. I had the advantage of being able actually to visit the hotels in which I was interested; and I looked over about a dozen hotels, guided by online services, the Blue Guide, Lonely Planet, and DK. The best combination of price and quality I found was Taskonak. It's in Sultanahmet near the Blue Mosque and lovely Little Aya Sofia, but it's on a quiet side street, just out of the hustle and bustle. The location puts one near many of the most important historical sites as well as the less touristed esplanade along the Sea of Marmara where Istanbulis stroll, swim and picnic. Distinctive to Tashkonak is the lovely, garden courtyard of the hotel, which offers a refuge of peace and solace unlike the offerings at most other hotels. The rooftop terrace has a splendid view of the sea in 3 directions (I loved breakfast there), though one can't really see the grand mosques. That was okay for me as \"Doy-Doy\" and many other nearby restaurants have great views of the Blue Mosque from their terraces. Best of all, however, at Tashkonak was the staff, which I found to be extraordinarily helpful. The clerks negotiated a good price for me. They dealt with my very fussy wife's needs, even moving us to a larger room when she found our first room to be too small (as a boutique, non-corporate hotel, the rooms are many different sizes). The desk clerks also gave us great advice on sites, baths, and restaurants. They were pleasant just to chat with. The free shuttle to the airport was welcome, as was the WI-Fi. There is a small mosque just across the street. So, if you're a light sleeper, don't get a room on the street side, since there is a 5am call to prayer. It's on low volume, though, at that hour. So, for the rest of us (and for me) it didn't present a problem. (Our second room was street side, but it wasn't a problem.) The Menu meal was terrific.

Our reception and arrival did not go smoothly even though we were asked to confirm our booking a few days prior to arrival and we provided an arrival time. On arrival (11.40am) we were told there was no record of our booking, then, when it was found, that our room was not ready and we were asked to wait. Shown to our room around 12.30pm the door was opened to a wall of smoke fumes so we declined the room, having asked for nonsmoking. Reception did not think another room would be available so we were asked to wait. There were no facilities for refreshments so after a tiring 6 hour journey (by road and air up from Southern Turkey) we left our bags and went to a nearby cafe.Maybe we caught the hotel on a difficult morning given the very positive feedback posted on this site. We dropped by our preferred hotel HOTELLINO in the hope of a cancellation. They gave us a warm welcome, remembering our short stay a few months earlier. We had tried to rebook this time but they were already full. (See my November review) When we returned to Tashkonak at 2.00pm a room had been found and we were able to complete our 3 night stay. The room, on the third floor was spacious and clean but rather dated with a large fridge and old style portable TV on top in front of a radiator in the middle. The bed was comfortable. Plus points of this hotel are: great views from breakfast terrace, good turkish breakfast, reasonable location in quiet part of Sultanahmet. Probably OK if you are a first time visitor to Istanbul as good english is spoken. Negative points: Large number of stairs to negotiate from upper floor rooms. Breakfast room on 4th floor but no lift and a separate staircase to many guest rooms (we were on 3rd floor on a separate staircase).

However I felt the experience of staying there did not quite match the level of many reveiws. The room we stayed in was incredibly small, a single sized room masquerading as a double, with barely any room to walk around the bed. The clothes cupboard was tiny, so hardly any room to hang clothes if staying for more than 2 or 3 nights, and there was no extra storage which meant we were constantly falling over one of our suitcases on the floor. Whilst the desk staff were polite and helpful, this felt mainly superficial, with the objective being to relieve people of as much money as possible rather than directing them to what was actually being requested. The hotel reception also seemed to serve more as a front living room for the social lives of the desk staff rather than as a place where visitors could relax. I could not access my email on the computer, provided for that purpose, as the settings wouldn't permit it.

From the airport, take the metro to the Zeytinburnu stop and then change trains and get off at Sultenhamet. From here you are about 3 blocks away. When you get off at Sultenhamet, walk towards the long and narrow grassy park (Hippodrome). You'll probably see some big dogs wandering around - I don't know why but they are always there.

Although not a lot of traffic passes down this street, the refuse truck at 5 a.m with its orange flashing light and lots of noise was not welcome. The sound of the call to prayer from the adjacent mosque did wake us, but this was not a problem - it is a fact of life in a Muslim city. Next morning we were told we would be given a different room (a twin) overlooking the garden which we accepted. We were asked to pack our things and the hotel staff moved our bags to the new room while we were out for the day. We were also told that we should not have been given the first room for an 8 night stay - it was far too small.

If you have time during your stay would recommend a boat trip on the Bosphorous & also Dolmabache & Beylerbei Palace as well as Chora Church are well worth a visit.", "Date": "September 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois", "Title": "\u201cVery Impressed.\u201d", "Author": "halaljello", "ReviewID": "UR41384180", "Content": "Great place.

First and foremost, let me talk about the staff at Tashkonak. I have stayed at many hotels throughout the world, both large franchises and smaller boutique style and i must say that Tashkonak's staff are by far the most welcoming, helpful and knowledgable people i have come across. Inan, Ali and Hayati were the general managers that either worked the day shift or night shift and were always at hand to assist us no matter how small or large our request was. What struck us the most was theri abilities to speak multiple languages whcih was welcomed not only by us but other international guests. Between them they could speak Turkish, English, German, Dutch and Spanish (possibly more!). Then there was Adalet, who was organising the breakfast each morning. Always greeted us with a smile and always made sure the breakfast was varied and stocked up no matter what time in the morning we came up. A point to add here is that the views from the terrace are simply wonderful. On one side you have the Blue Mosque and the other you have the Bospherous Sea! Ramazan, Ahmet and Ekrem were excellent in assisting our daily needs and always served us with a smile. The great thing about this team of people is that they are always there when you need something but never seem to be invading your space. The perfect Balance! Afternoon tea is served between 3pm and 8p in the garden cafe/terrace. Plenty of tables and chairs to relax hidden by beautiful plants and flowers. Did i mention that this was all free! Bargain! My wife loved the selection of cinamon, apple, lemon, green and turkish teas available at no extra cost. A real bonus at this hotel! The hotel itself is a traditional boutique hotel, with beautiful turkish paintings on the wall highlighting the Byzantine and Ottoman heritage. the Rugs in teh reception area and throughout the hotel give it that cosy rustic feel, it was everything we hoped and wished for and that little bit more. The bedrooms are well maintained and very clean! The air conditioning in the room worked well and was a treat after our days out in the warm sun exploring istanbul. The TV had more channels than we could count and there was enough cupboard space to hang our clothes and accessories during our stay. The painting/designs on the bedroom ceilings are a beautiful touch. Now about the location. When this hotel advertised that it is only a few hundred meteres away from the main attractions, i was a bit sceptical however our concerns were put at rest as it literally was only a few hundred meteres away from the Aya Sofia and Blue Mosque, with the Topkapi Palace only a further 100 meteres away or so. To put it simply, to walk to these attractions would only take 10minutes :) great as we did not use a taxi once! This is the perfect location for a hotel as it is close to the main sights yet is tucked away on a quiet little street which is very peaceful. Finally, its important to talk about the restaurants at your doorstep. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants near this Hotel to suit all budgets from backpacker budgets to those special occasions. To sum this up, i would say that it is the best hotel we stayed in due to the service provided by its most helpful staff, cleanliness of the rooms, presentation and design of the hotel, value for money and obvioulsy the location. As mentioned above it is near a variety of good cafes and restraraunts visited by the Turkish residents themseleves as well as the tourists. We loved it so much and were made to feel at home. My wife and i will soon be planning our next trip back and have already recomended this hotel to our friends and family!

However, on our last day the service of this hotel really shone. The morning we were flying out there was a bike race in Istanbul. The streets were partitioned off. Cars couldn't get to the hotel. The police were guarding the barricade and not letting people pass to the other side. Many people with luggage gathered and wondered if they'd ever get across. The co-managers/owners of this hotel saw to it that we made it to our cab. One walked us to one side of the barricade, and the other met us on the other, and drove us to the airport. I wondered why the owner was driving the shuttle. He said, with the event, he didn't want taxi drivers to take advantage of his customers claiming undue traffic and charging more for the service etc. or to have people missing planes. I was so impressed with the conscientiousness of their service. They left nothing to chance and took personal responsibility that we'd make it to the airport. Stay at the Tashkonak.

The Tashkonak is one of the many small hotels situated on the seaward side of the hill crowned by the Sultanahmet (Blue) Mosque - and thus on the former site of the imperial Great Palace and its gardens. Nowadays it is a densely built area of small hotels, mosques and working class turkish housing. It is a pleasant 5-10 minute walk to the Hippodrome and the Blue Mosque, 10-15 minutes to Haghia Sophia and the Topkapi Palace. Don't miss the former Church of SS Sergius and Bacchus (now the Little Aya Sofya Mosque) 5 minutes down the hill in the other direction. The front of the hotel faces onto a small side street, across from a small Sinan-designed mosque (it's hard to find a mosque in Istanbul that is not connected to Sinan in some way) which, alas, looks like a concrete village hall from the outside. Muezzins start the prayer call at 6.30, but it wasn't so loud that it woke me. The hotel itself is a bit shabby in places but entirely tolerable for the excellent prices. We stayed in Room 104 which is a 4 person suite on the ground floor (double bed in one room, two singles in another, and a bathroom in between). The beds were firm and comfortable, windows were plentiful (and openable). A special mention for the showers, which are spacious, hot and powerful. The staff are uniformly friendly (very good-looking porters!) and were always willing to go out of their way to help out with queries or requests. The included breakfast is good and simple and is served on the top floor (there is a room with large windows and a terrace - the views over the Sea of Marmara to Asia in one direction and up to the Blue Mosque in the other are very photogenic).

Tashkonak is a 30-odd-room hotel located on a quiet street minutes from the Blue Mosque in Sultanahmet ('old' Istanbul). It is also a 10 minute walk to the Haghia Sophia and about 15 minutes to the Topkapi palace. Yerevada Cistern is also about 10 minutes away by foot, as is one of Istanbul's best sea food restaurants (Baltiki Sabhattin). In other words a number of Istabul's main attractions are all reachable on foot. However what we most liked about the hotel was the excellent and helpful staff (our friend Hayati in particular deserves special mention) who went out of their way to help us and guide us, make restaurant bookings, etc. and always had time for any other enquiries we had. Rooms are basic, but clean. Some face the street (which is fairly quiet except for the odd car/bike) and others a quaint garden/porch at the back of the hotel. Another highlight is the lovely terrace for breakfast, with wonderful views of the Sea of Marmara and the Golden Horn. I would recommend those who are not on a tight budget to opt for a large double room as some of the standard rooms looked a little bit cramped (although some others looked a decent size).

Not only does it have what you need - clean pleasant rooms, stunning terrace views of the Bosphorus, a quiet garden (it's a converted Ottoman house), internet (a bit unreliable but available), scrumptious Turkish breakfast, Istanbul on your doorstep; but it has two big advantages. First, the staff are professional, but in the most engaging and warm way. So that, for example, I could have a joke with them, talk about my day, ask for their help (in fact, they got me out of trouble a couple of times). This is a real bonus for a sociable solo traveller. Second, and related to this, is the excellent service and support offered by Annelie, an English woman who works at the hotel, having moved to Istanbul two years ago after staying at the Tashkonak for a number of years on holiday. Annelie makes sure that guests get that bit extra, advising, discussing, sorting out any issues that might arise, without language barriers intruding.

This hotel fulfilled all our criteria. The location is excellent. Lovely old neighbourhood barely a few minutes walk from the blue mosque and the rest of Sultanahmet. The view from the terrace is wonderful with the Sea of Marmara on one side and the blue mosque on the other side - which made breakfast a very pleasant affair. Plenty to choose from at breakfast - eggs/fruit/juice/bread etc. We had two rooms between two couples. They were both very comfortable. However our friends had a smaller room but a balcony overlooking the garden, whereas we had no balcony but a larger room. So if you have a preference you can probably request what you would like. Our larger room was perfectly comfortable - considering we were there 5 nights we were very comfortable. Our room overlooked the street and was right next to a mosque but despite that we had no disturbances. We didnt really hear the early morning call to prayer (even though it was Ramazan!) and the street was very quiet so no noise. The rooms and bathrooms are clean and comfortable. The shower is very powerful so lovely to step into at the end of the day. The garden is also lovely. Great place to sit in the afternoon and have coffee. They have nice Lavazza coffee available - which they supposedly charge 2 euros for but we had it every day so they just did a set 5 euro charge for 'extras'. Which is typical of the good nature of the place. They do not try to charge extra for every little thing. The price of bottled water is reasonable, they have free maps and postcards at reception, free internet and wireless. They even let us print something for free. Which is great as you dont feel like you're being ripped off all the time. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. They would go out of their way to try and help if you had a problem. I think some customers expected too much to some degree - after all this is a small boutique hotel and if you treat it as such and take the time to chat to the staff you soon realise how friendly and helpful they are and give you advice on getting around. It's also a big plus to have the airport pickup if you are staying more than three nights. They were there on time. Very efficient. All in all we had a very comfortable, very pleasant stay made all the better by helpful, friendly staff and a great location.

The best I can say is that it is well located, the staff are friendly (but then Istanbul generally is) and the breakfast room at the top has great views, unfortunately once you've gazed at the Marmara and look at the food, you really ought to find somewhere else to eat, but more on that below. The room was small, but to be fair comfortable and adequate, although the one power socket was not beside the beds. Nylon curtains hadn't been cleaned for ages. 1# Air conditioning. There was no remote for the airconditioning unit in the room, so I went to reception to ask for it. After 5 or so minutes one was delivered to the room. All well and good till the next day when, having returned from touring around - the remote control disappeared again, so once again \"can I please have it\". Note that the aircon was turned off and the windows closed (naturally) the whole time we were out, so the room was rather hot on days where the temperature outside was in the 25-30C range. Aircon did have a odd smell, but at least it worked when I could control it. Clearly less air con remotes than units! 2# Power cuts. At first thought this was Istanbul, but poking head out of the window saw lights on in adjacent buildings. One day it happened three times, and we were told that \"one of the power lines to the hotel didn't work well\" (presumably part of the hotel was fine). We were given a candle, but these power cuts go for anything like 20 minutes to 3 hours. Given it appears to be a hotel problem, it's rather poor. Resorted to using cellphone screen as a light for ventures to the bathroom! 3# Shower. The drain was clearly rather clogged as after 5 minutes you realise it isn't draining at all, and it's about to overflow. So you time the showers. We didn't raise this if only because the power cuts and the air conditioning were raised enough that we figured we had bought an overpriced lemon. There was no written material about the hotel, including nothing about fire escape procedures. The TV had a lot of channels, most of which had appalling interference, so while 3 channels are in English, one was watchable. Breakfast was abysmal. 2 non-descript cereals with one variety of milk sitting out in a jug, 2 varieties of cordial (these are at best \"juice drinks\", they wouldn't pass for pure juices) that were barely cold as the machines storing them were kept off much of the time (but the LCD TV with music videos is kept on). Remaining food comprised bread (ok), olives, a couple of jams and honey, cold meat and cheese, all lying outside exposed (the breakfast floor is very open to the air), for the flies to land on (as I witnessed). Nothing hot (besides tea and coffee), no fruit. Oh there was a single hard boiled egg, cracked already. Had to ask for more. Given the price for continental breakfast was around \u00c2\u00a322 per night for two people this was an extortionate rip off. For that price I expect cereals, fresh fruit, range of juices, service (as in someone bringing me coffee and tea, not self service), some varieties of hot food, and cold food covered for hygiene. The hotel was not uncomfortable, not dirty, but it wasn't great and for \u00c2\u00a3145 per night for two people it is priced as a reasonable hotel but with standards of a good backpackers. 3 simple tips for the owners, offer breakfast commensurate for the price, get air conditioning controls for every room and fix the power.

I prefer small, locally operated hotels in mixed areas that include residential and local retail and when I'm travelling with my loved one - they have to be romantic too!

The sea is in spitting distance and an abundant selection of bars, restaurants and pubs offer great local food as well as international drinks and cooking. The rooms of Hotel Tashkonak are small but very tidy and the friendliness of its staff is simply unbeatable. Breakfast on the rooftop terasse is a perfect start for a day of sightseeing or shopping. The (European) standard size fridge in the middle of the room takes some getting used to but once you've been shopping in one of the bazaars and come back with bags full of fruit and other perishable delights it becomes very valuable.

Free Wi-Fi (though the connection in my room tended to be a little variable - sometimes strong, other times frustratingly weak). What distinguishes the hotel from others is the staff - amazingly friendly, very helpful, extremely kind and go the extra mile to guide and help - they give the impression of not being in it for the money (give guidance on what they think are best economical deals) which was refreshing.

The Tashkonak proved to be perfect for this as it is minutes away from the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofya, Topkapi Palace. It is about five minutes walk to the tram allowing one to explore further afield such as the Great Bazaar, the Spice Market, Sulaiman and New Mosque, the big public baths, Rustempasa Mosque (a tiny gem), the bridge across to the Galata tower, and the ferry for trips up the Bosphorus. The room we had was smallish but attractive and more than adequate with twin beds (one of which was not very comfortable, but was changed the same day I mentioned it at the desk). Both the room and the bathroom (with shower not tub) were very clean. Our room looked out onto a small terraced garden, built against the back wall of the Blue Mosque. It was very quiet except for loud neighbours the first night. The staff were charming and helpful, and on duty 24/7. The breakfast was a buffet with meats, cheeses, eggs, yogourt, fresh fruit salads, buns, breads and many spreads. It was possible to have breakfast and only need a snack lunch. Perhaps the best thing about breakfast was the rooftop terrace restaurant in which it was served. There was a wonderful view over the city and Marmara sea, and the beginning of the Bosphorus. We enjoyed this both at breakfast, and in the evening when we looked over the lights of the city and the dozens of ships at anchor. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hotel to any of my friends. If, however, you are only happy in a Hilton or Holiday Inn clone just like \"at home\" then I suggest that you stay at one of them and leave the Hotel Tashkonak to those of us who travel to experience and enjoy another culture and people.", "Date": "December 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Heidelberg", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel in Istanbul!\u201d", "Author": "BB-HD", "ReviewID": "UR11181981", "Content": "Hotel Tashkonak is a great hotel in the Sultanahmet area of Istanbul.

We liked the melodious call for prayer at 5.10 in the morning!!! and we were able to sleep afterwards for a while. The rooms are not large - we have moved two single beds to make one double, but they are are very clean. The breakfast terrace offers attractive Bosporus and Marmara view. The breakfast was satisfactory and the good breakfast food was Turkish (the jams were simply too sweet for me). The staff was very friendly and helpful (example: running in the heavy rain to catch the taxi for the guests). Free e-mail check and short look into our local online-news at the hotel's Internet corner was another way to make our life easier. In the hotel and at nearby news' stand we were able to get two Turkish dailies in English language: Zaman English and Turkish Daily. Restaurants' experiences: Azinade (close to Chora Church- recommended by Lonely Planet) -exciting and perfectnot cheap; Doran in Kumkapi (in the south of Kumkapi beach section) - fair seafood and rates accompanied by the good Istanbul live music; Kervansaray Evening Show - good dinner, good belly dancers, perfect animation, bad folk dances. In 8 days we did not make one negative experience in the grill-bars and restaurants. Only once in 8 days we have had the feeling to be tricked by taxi-driver (no disastrous ammount). Sometimes we were annoyed by the lack of specified meals&drinks bill in any language then Turkish - even if we did not suspect any overpricing. Istanbul is not cheap town as some other cities in the country.
