We love it! The rooms are very nice, the location is fantastic, and the front desk staff is the same now as it was when we first stayed there in 1996! The hotel is one block from the Champs Elysees at the mid point between the Jardin des Tuilleries and the Arc de Triumphe. There are numerous cafes all within one block of the hotel, and the boulangerie/patisserie two doors down sends the wonderful aroma of fresh baked bread past your window in the morning. The hotel offers breakfast but it's expensive. If you want a good and reasonably priced breakfast, go out the front door of the hotel, cross the street and head to the left. There is a great little cafe right there on the corner that has a very good breakfast and the coffee is perfect! Most of the hotel rooms at the Rond-Point are for two but they do have at least one \"family suite\", which has a queen-size bed, a sofa bed that sleeps two, and two bathrooms. They also have two rooms that have a terrace with an incredible view of the eiffel tower. The Champs Elysees is one block away, and for high-end shopping, Avenue Montaigne is just two blocks away on the other side of the Champs Elysees. There you'll find Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Prada, etc. If you're looking for that small French hotel experience convenient to the usual tourist sites, transportation and great shopping, you absolutely cannot go wrong with this hotel.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cThe perfect taste of Paris!\u201d", "Author": "Softsoutherner", "ReviewID": "UR121485176", "Content": "2nd time we have stayed here. Liked it before, but love it now. Near everything. The place is small, artsy, and has a lot of chracter. If you want the Hilton, this isn't for you. But if you want to enjoy Paris like it is meant to be, this is the place for you. And, if you've heard bad things about the Parisiennes, forget it when you stay here. Everyone at the hotel was helpful and charming. They will appreciate what little French you speak, but all speak excellent English. We took the Metro a couple of times, but mainly enjoyed walking evrywhere. Rooms vary in size. This time we stayed in #80 - one floor up from the last elevator stop so we had stairs even with our huge suitcases. But no one seemed to mind. Our room might have even been the smallest, but it was like living above the city. View of the tower just outside our door, and Paris rooftops from our bed. Meticulously clean and beautifully decorated. Breakfast was perfect, though there are many little places near to have coffee and pastry in the morning.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Knysna, South Africa", "Title": "\u201cGenuine Parisian Hotel\u201d", "Author": "vanlipp", "ReviewID": "UR118428125", "Content": "This quaint, interesting little hotel immediately makes one feel that you are truely in Paris. It's decor speaks of olde world charm; simply elegant without ostentation. Our room was very comfortable and the bathroom fabulously spacious. Cleaning of the room was done perfectly every day and fresh, fluffy white towels were awaiting us on our return. The staff were all very cordial, friendly and most accommodating. The breakfasts were lovely, especially because of the setting in the beautifully furnished dining room and the splendid crockery on which it was served. Our five day stay in Paris was made more special because of the 'Hotel du Rond Point' and was a home away from home. It's location, one street below the Champs Elysees, is perfectly situated.

The rooms ooze the classy but stuffy charm of Vieux Paris. The lack of air condidtioning was not balanced off by the seemingly modern but noisy fan in my room. Sleeping in room 17, just above the kitchen, turned out to be a problem when kitchen staff started its noisy work at 6.30 am: the open kitchen windows led into a small internal court where every sound was reflected from the walls into residents' rooms. Reception staff was friendly enough, while service over breakfast was slow and unattentive. Though pretending to be continental, breakfast was little more than a brushed up version of coffee and croissant.
