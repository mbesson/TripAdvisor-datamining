We complained, and were given another room, which was just as bad. The bathroom sink did not even drain, the room was abundant with holes within the walls, the lights did not work, the door did not lock securely and there were damp patches on the ceiling. The entire hotel is a fire hazard, the hallways had rubbish everywhere, we had to drag our luggage around, no one certainly assisted my family with luggage in fact I was just stared at when struggling to enter the narrow entrance. The hotel was not secure and we were very concerned for our personal belongings. My family and I were so distressed by the condition of this place we checked out within 2 hours forgoing the 5 nights we had already prepaid. We were offered a \"flat\" as we checked out which we declined and checked in elsewhere which cost us an additional $AUD2000.

Breakfast was terrible - only toast, cornflakes, orange juice, boiled eggs and cheese, despite the full english promised. The breakfast was not available until 7.30 and on one occasion there was no milk until 7.45, when the staff came back from the shop with it. Despite the fact that I was a customer who had been waiting for milk for my cereal AND I was queueing for it, a member of staff thought nothing of pushing in front of me and helping herself to a glass of milk to enjoy with her breakfast. There were always at least 2, if not 4, members of staff sat in the dining area having their breakfast at the same time as the guests. They did not wait for quests to get their food first, simply helped themselves without any regard to anyone else. The staff were all rude and unhelpful.

Instead they just had a stack of paper they needed to rummage through first before they found my booking. Room: I was escorted back out of the hotel onto the street to get to the \"Annex\". The single door a bit down the road look like you were entering someone's flat! Immediately as you walked in there was a smell of gas. Reading these reviews where people talk about the strange smell i'm convinced that's it....and I wouldn't be at all surprised to read that this hotel had blown up one day in the future if they don't get that fixed! I climbed the mountain of stairs and entered my room with the flimsy lock. Facilities: TV on the wall had a missing remote control so was impossible to switch on. Shower didn't drain away properly and took 45mins to completely empty. Kettle and coffee there but the coffee somehow tasted of those blue blocks you'd put in a toilet....so that's what I did....tipped it down the toilet in disgust! Cleanliness: Bathroom still had rubbish from previous guest. Bed Linen & Towels were clean though. I didn't fancy the idea of breakfast in the place. Before booking this place I'd looked at a couple of other places but saw their website at the last minute and thought I'd found a real bargain. The website makes the place look very modern and trendy and at a very low price. Based on that I immediately booked it thinking I'd made a great decision! All I can say is that I think the website is very misleading and some of the images they show of cool dining rooms etc actually belong to a separate restaurant below the hotel!

As mentioned in previous reviews, there was no-one at the desk when we arrived. He was actually outside having a cigarette and had decided not to follow us in. This was a common theme. Either that or there would be a few members of staff at the desk who had just decided to ignore you. Our room was not ready but we were advised that they had a \"luggage room\" available if we wished to leave our bags - this turned out to be a cupboard in the dining room that anyone could have access to and was piled high with bags and suitcases. The hotel itself is pretty grim. As also previously mentioned there is a peculiar smell in the entire building that they have attempted to mask with multiple plug in air fresheners. The whole building is extremely run down - carpets are worn, dirty and torn, plug sockets and various wires hang from the walls, the walls have holes in them, the ceilings also have holes and are sagging with damp in places and the corridors are generally filled with bags of rubbish and excess pieces of furniture (fold- away beds etc). You can't help but pray that you don't need to escape from the building in a hurry. Our room was actually a decent size - a double and a single bed and had the obligatory plug in air freshener. It was as run down as the rest of the hotel and unlike other reviews had obviously not been cleaned before we went in. The lock on our door did not appear particularly trustworthy, the cups were filthy and the shower was a disgrace. In fact you would have thought that it was actually in the process of being renovated - half of the tiles appeared to have just been put on and the rest looked like they were about to fall off. The bed sheets appeared to have been changed but were still dusty. We also discovered that a chair in the corner of the room was actually the only thing holding the curtains up as well! That was quite amusing when we moved the chair and the whole thing fell down! The electrics were a bit odd - you had to press a combination of switches in order to turn the main light on and off and out of the 3 bulbs on the lamp only 1 of them actually worked. The roof had patches of damp, particularly above the lights and there was a distinct rustling that I wouldn't have been surprised to discover was rats. You could hear the underground regularly but that wasn't actually too much of a problem and you have to expect some noise in central london. We didn't hear much noise from other rooms although the hotel in general appeared pretty quiet whilst we were there so that may differ when it's busy. Reading previous reviews, it also appears that we may have been placed in the staff bedroom (210), so perhaps we were lucky that we weren't actually near the staff on our stay. Although we were offerred a continental breakfast we didn't actually try it - the fact that the cups in our room weren't clean was enough to put us off attempting to eat there. There was a hairdryer that worked in our room and we had no problems with the TV. The only good thing about this hotel was the location. It is a five minute walk from Paddington station and so has easy access to Heathrow. It's also a 5-10 minute walk from Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. One staff member was relatively helpful when we enquired about transport , even booking a taxi for us, although this appeared to be a friend of his and we don't know London well enough to know whether he took advantage, he did take a lot of side roads and dropped us off a good bit from our destination although admittedly there were a fair bit of roadworks. All in all, we won't be returning to this hotel any time soon.

I don\u00c2\u00b4t know what is the best english word to describe it. Maybe horrible, disgusting, sick, growse, and dangerous together. There was nobody in the front desk when I walked in to the hotel. Few people walked in and just picked up their keys behind the desk. I waited there about 20minutes until the clerk walked in like nothing had happened and gave me the key. I took the elevator to the second floor and started to look for room 105. There was one different looking door in the hallway and it did say: ROOM 105 THIS WAY I opened the door and saw the stairs down. There was no light switch and the hallway was totally dark. I walked the stairs down and looked around bit. Stairs went one floor further where was all kind of construction equipment and no door to open to exit. Seemed pretty dangerous incase of fire. Because only way to exit the room was to walk to the second floor. Then I opened the door and saw the disqusting room. It was about size of 1,5meters x 2,5 meters. Everything was in the same room: toilet, shower, bed, desk and travel heater (one of those that you just plug in the wall) There was about 3-4 centimeter gap below the door and the lock was not safe. Two huge wholes in the wall. About 15-25centimeters wide and filled up with towels!!! I AM SERIOUS!!! Used toilet paper next to the sink and amazingly cold. After I moved the bed I saw the condom on the floor. Then I gave up... And I am not picky. I have stayed in pretty bad rooms, slept in the airport etc. I went to talk to the clerk and was as polite as possible. I talked with him about 3 x 30minutes (went back to my room because I thought I will survive and then back when I realized I can not stay here. Finally after long conversations I got new room. Two persons room costed about 26UK more. He said that there was no more one bedroom rooms. But I saw later on when some guy came in and got one bed room. SO I finally stayed there in the other room. It was bad room. But like heaven to the other room. Only minus was that mattres was not clean and there was no porn magazine under the bed. This did not bother me because I was so happy that I got out from the other room. Next day breakfest was ok. Only minus was that you had to eat it in the bar made to the basement. I do not mind about that. But some older people may not like to eat breakfest next to flashing slot machine. BAD: -Very cold room. Air blows in to the room from below of the door and from the cracks next to the window. -Only one plug-in in the room!

It was literally frightening. I booked a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153family room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd package, which consisted of two rooms on the same floor in close proximity. I did this because I was told by hotels.com that it was forbidden to have more than two people per room for security reasons. Upon arriving at the hotel, I discovered that I was given one room that was supposed to house four people (a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quad room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). The room was absolutely horrifying: no lock on the door, dirty soaps stacked for new use (I found a hair on one of them), no toilet paper holder, light switches that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work, a wall heater that was precariously dangling at a 45 degree angle until it finally fell off, 4 gaping holes in the wall, a dirty shower, dysfunctional toilet, dirty windows, cracked floor tiles, and a phone with no dial tone. We called hotels.com immediately, and were promised a new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quad room,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd despite our original reservation for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153family room.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The fact that hotels.com called down to the front desk for us, but refused to acknowledge the fact that we received one room instead of two, was the most infuriating part of our check-in process. I was on hold for at least 15 minutes; I could have stayed in the Savoy Hotel for the price of my useless phone call. The new room that we were given looked like a low-end dorm room: 4 twin beds in a line under a chipped and peeling faux-wood grade headboard, broken bathroom tiles, no door handle on the entry door, an uncloseable window, no toilet paper holder, dysfunctional toilet and sink, no light source, where else can I take this! Beware, o potential client, room 503 may have a view of chimneys and TV antennas with a partial image of the London Eye in the distance, but that moleskin door handle came from yours truly! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably still up there for the next customer, but if not, grab the room numbers with your fingernails to help close the door when leaving. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even get me started on the stairs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they were narrow, uneven, lumpy, cramped. If there were a fire, you would end up at the bottom of one of the many stairwells with a broken ankle. Out of the kindness of the hotels heart (haha), breakfast was provided in the basement (Steven King, what a book you could write on this place!) One of my fellow travelers had to leave the basement because of its low-lingering clouds of burnt toast, loud ethnic music, and dim lighting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she had a panic attack, the first one out of a twenty-day vacation. The breakfast served was sliced white bread, a toaster, rancid lunchmeats, and coffee or tea. The only thing we were willing to stomach was the coffee. On our last morning at the hotel (thank god it was only three nights), we accidentally woke up a sleeping patron on the fifth floor, who was fast asleep on the dirty carpet of the hallway. Before you blame this experience on us six \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pampered\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd women who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how to book a hotel, two other groups/guests were thrown into the same predicament: they booked a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153family room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and were expecting two rooms, but were instead greeted with a smelly and dirty quad room, as were we. One of the groups was a Chemistry teacher and his three students that were addressing Parliament; another was a family from Sweden. All of the guests in this hotel were first-time clients there, and swore that they would never come back. Two of my fellow travelers in a different room said that their door supposedly locked but would pull open occasionally; for safety, they put their suitcases in front of it just in case. Every time somebody opened a door across the hall or in another part of the fifth floor, it sounded like someone was rattling the keys in your door, trying to get in. To be honest, the Ascot Hyde Park Hotel would be great for Halloween fright night for a bunch of drugged-out teenagers. The hotel looks more like the lowest-grade youth hostel one could find, but with an astronomical price tag. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay here even if I was paid, and would never wish these circumstances on a most despised enemy. Hotels.com lied to us when we booked the hotel, telling us that we would receive two rooms. Their customer assistance personnel felt that they were assisting by getting us yet another quad room, but failed to acknowledge that we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t supposed to have that style of room in the first place.

Contrary to the experiences of other reviewers, I did have (very) hot water, my room was rather small but fairly clean and the staff was friendly and helpful.

The beds are really bad, and i think there are bed bugs in it too. The room didnt have airconditioning, and didnt have a fan either. We stayed there on the 22nd of Sep, and it was hot outside..we had to leave the big window open, which meant that it was very noisy...the hotel is on a busy street...there was loud traffic and people talking outside on the street, until 1am. The underground, runs under the hotel and every few minutes you can feel the rumble of the trains as they pass below you. Luckily the trains stop between 2am-5am, i think. The hotel didnt even bother putting new soap in the bathroom..we had used soap in the washbin and shower! Luckily for us, there were 4 small shampoo packets, which we used as soap! The toilet tank takes a really long time to fill up too....so if there are two of you, you gotta wait! The staff at reception isnt friendly at all. Use this hotel as a last resort, really.

When we arrived in the morning our first impressions were not good, very small and shabby, painted over peeling wallpaper, a strong musty smell which was almost overpowered by the smell of new paint. However, we were only staying for one night, it was just somewhere to sleep, it was relatively cheap so what did we expect! We told the receptionist who we were and she allowed us to leave our bags and off we went for the day. After a lovely day we went back to the hotel and it was then that things started to go wrong. The receptionist, the same one from earlier, explained that there was no hot water on the fourth floor and that people had been checking out all day and that she had arranged for us to stay in 2 family rooms in a hotel nearby for no extra charge! I told her this was unacceptable and that we could put up with not having hot water. She then said that the plumbers would need to be in and out of our rooms all night to fix the boilers which made no sense at all! We asked to see the rooms for ourselves to make up our minds to which she replied that the manager had told her not to show anyone the rooms. Obviously by this time we were getting very suspicious and on asking someone from the fourth floor discovered that there was nothing wrong with the hot water. She then told us it was only certain rooms, namely the four that we had booked, what a coincidence!! Then, as if by magic the \"plumber\" walked by, although he had been the painter when we saw him at work in the morning! We asked to see the manager and even though she told us that he had been there obviously he had somehow managed to sneak passed her! Eventually after several attempts she got through to him on the phone. He was extremely rude and unhelpful and told us that we would just have to put up with it, there would be no refund and there was nothing he could do. To be honest at this point we felt that he was right, there was nothing else to do but to put up with it and go to the other hotel, even though we knew that a hotel with rooms available on the Saturday night before the Marathon was going to be even worse that this one. How right we were! We were taken to the other hotel by another young woman, obviously the receptionist had had enough of us by this time and chickened out, actually I think she was very wise not to take us! When we arrived we were taken to the basement and were shown our room, yes one room with a double bed and a bunk bed, for eight of us!! The new receptionist told us she'd only been asked for one room. After much shouting and running around they emptied someones things out of another room and allowed us to have that one. At least it had a double and two singles. She later told us that the Ascot Hotel had double booked our rooms and she was often called upon to help them out and that the rooms we were in were only meant for workers and not usually let out! By this time we didn't really care, we just wanted somewhere to sleep and to forget the whole thing, unfortunately being in the basement at the front of the hotel where the windows did not shut properly and in a street where there were signs warning curb crawlers they would be prosecuted you can imagine that there was little sleep to be had! So much for my marathon preparation!

On they way upstairs we passed a portable electricheater in the foyer with a leg missingand all lopsided, loose wires in the stairway and loose carpet on the stairs. We got to the room, via a dark corridor as there were no bulbs in the lights after passing ladders and fire doors wedged open. The door was very flimsy with gaps around it and a lock that did not work properly. The room was painted recently but everything was still at least 20 years old including the bed, wooden toilet seat, hair dryer that did not work. The route to the fire escape had no lights, ceiling and had wires hanging down. I reported back to the reception desk and advised that I did not wish to stay there as we did not feel safe.
