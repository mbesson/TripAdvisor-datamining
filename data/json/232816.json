Several had good English and with my rudimentary Spanish, I had no difficulties getting good information on services and local food and transportation choices. Here are some Pros and couple minor cons: Pros: Very clean and neat overall- rooms and public spaces. Great location for local business and easy taxi or Metro connections to other areas. Free mini bar with beverages restocked daily Free coffee (espresso) in the room Solid WiFi connection (free as a Platinum, not sure the cost otherwise) Good buffet breakfast (also included in my rate) Good selection of soap, shampoo and other bath amenities.

The hotel is located beside the main street Castellana. It is located in a business district not far from the Real Madrid soccer stadium. The hotel is best described as a business hotel, catering more to that than anything else. It is located about 50m from the Cuzco subway station, so getting around Madrid is quite good and convenient. The Madrid Metro is one of the best in Europe, clean and efficient. The hotel room was a good size and appointed minimally. The bed was comfortable. I was somewhat surprised that there was no safe provided in the room, nor was there a coffee maker or an iron. Also to my surprise (not that I sit in a hotel and watch TV) there were no English channels available. I used the laundry service and it was very quick with same day service. A taxi fare from Barajas International airport should run between 25 and 30 Euro, any more than that and you know the taxi driver took the long route (which happened to my colleagues). There are some excellent restaurants within a few minute walk of the hotel. There are also some great tapas places very close too. The breakfast at the hotel is quite good, with an assortment of cold and hot meat along with cereals and pastries. Taxi fare to the main part of downtown where the attractions are located is about 10-12 euros. There is a lot to see in Madrid with some great museums. The night life is great, with clubs open until 6 or 7AM. I recommend this hotel if on business in the Castellana area. I would have liked to see wifi included along with other amenities mentioned.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAmerican confort,spanish service\u201d", "Author": "Gaston22", "ReviewID": "UR132632178", "Content": "The hotel has everything required by any traveler, rooms are very confortable though space available is by european standards, location is very good considering is not so close to Gran Via and surroundings, very close to train station from/to airport.

There are three adults in our travelling party and we found the beds large enough for three adults although two of the beds are two singles attached together for a couple, and they could come apart.

The fitness center provides water bottles even if it is small and the treadmill was broken on this visit. Unlike the ac property in Barcelona, this one did not provide snacks, tea or coffee in the evenings. For gold members like us, we are used to the extra perks and the ac property lacks the extras. having said that we were upgraded to a corner suite without requesting, and we're happy that the staff and supervisor tried harder and offered us continental breakfast in our room without extra charge in lieu of the breakfast buffet ( we paid for) we couldn't make because of an early flight. Checkout was a non event and efficient. Taxis are readily available. The property is seconds away on foot to Cuzco metro station, and Citibank. It is also within 5 minutes walk to nearby good tapas, restaurants and Irish pub. If you stay at this property, try the Tasca La Farmacia for a great dining and tapas experience within 5 min walk. The hotel staff can direct you to its location. They know this place well. the Cuzco metro station is 7 stops to the heart of the Madrid city! plaza de espana. It's only 10-15 euros by taxi to the Madrid regional Atocha renfe train station, and 20 to 25 euros to airport.

Those looking for ambiance should look elsewhere. My major complaint with the hotel however and believe me it is a MAJOR COMPLAINT, is the rudeness and lack of customer service of the staff. Everyone we spoke with from the front desk to the resaurant bar had a serious attitude problem which really made the entire hotel portion of our trip unenjoyable. If I was able to have changed hotels, I would have done so, but for business reasons, we needed to stay here. If you are visiting Madrid as a tourist, this is definitely not the place to stay.
