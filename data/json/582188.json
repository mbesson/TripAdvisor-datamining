{"Reviews": [{"Content": "great hideaway Sunari is located in Lovina, about 150 min taxi drive from Denpasar airport. Shuttle bus or private taxi are the easiest ways to get to the hotel.Staff was friendly all the time during our stay. They don't speak so well english here but with time and smile you will get your message trough. Hotel is quite wide spread but the whole area is highly secured with security guard walking around the area 24/7. Rooms are a bit better than average. Bathroom was amazing, it came partly with no roof at all, only a net on the top of your head because of the bugs. So you get a moonlight after dark when visiting the toilet! Rooms were clean and tidy every time we came back from our trips. Room service served basic BLTs and Heinekens as they do everywhere. No complaints about catering either. Beach is in front of the hotel. Great place, no service but you can get a shower after swimming at the hotel pool, only few steps from the ocean. Boats for daytrips leave 5 min walk away from the hotel.I recommend this hotel for families and couples but not for party-goers because Lovina is quite small place with only a couple of bars and no discos. But the nature around you is absolutely amazing!", "Date": "Aug 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR971791854", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Laiska"}, {"Content": "A pleasant short stay After our unpleasant stay at Taman Wana Villas and Spa, we found this place easy-going, friendly and warm. Staff was very souple and the stay was hassle-free. Of course, one comes to Lovina only to see the dolphins at dawn, as the beach is unattractive (and crowded with salesmen/women and the sea is dirty. The pool in the Sunari is pleasant enough and family/children/teenager friendly. We had a villa with a small pool, so I do not know what the regular bedrooms look like. Also, the place was only about 20 % full, so it might be a different story if full. I would personally not stay in Lovina more than a couple of days.", "Date": "Mar 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR274290487", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "roudoudou"}, {"Content": "Run down We loved our stay in Lovina but wouldn't stay at Sunari again. We were booked in for a week and there was not a day when there wasn't a problem of some kind, be it the hot water system breaking down, the aircon not working, the children cutting their feet on broken tiles on the bottom of the pool or being charged for transport into the centre of Lovina when we were under the impression that it was complimentary. We may have assumed too much after staying at the Melasti Beach resort (great hotel). We wanted to make our own cups of tea but was told there wasn't a spare kettle to be found in the whole hotel. The hotel had no info in rooms to let us know what was around the area to do. The staff were lovely though and they did their best with what they had available.", "Date": "Feb 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR742622384", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Fath"}, {"Content": "A little tired and rundown The review of this hotel is best taken in the context of what we paid for is through Asiarooms.com - just \u62e249 a night for a private villa with private pool. A little too good to be true? If you've been backpacking and are looking to spoil yourself then maybe not, but if you have booked this alongsoide other boutique hotels you may be dissapointed.When we arrived we immediately got a 'feeling' about the place that wasn't quite right - we were met by a man who introduced himself to us and tried to sell us dolphin and diving trips - and assuming he was part of the hotel didn't think too much of it. We checkd into our room - right on the edge of the resort on the beach, which was very tired with paintwork and tile paint peeling, orangey green layer in the private (and the main) pools, and a dead frog in our pool which was a nice touch.The dive man was insistent - he found us again by the main pool and when we insisted we weren't insterested in doing any diving he came back to our villa later that evening with the 'dive master' - we found this VERY intrusive and it put us off - made us feel very uneasy. Having spent a few hours in Lovina itself we decided to cut out 3-day stay short and travel back to the Alam Kulkul resort in Legian, Kuta. It's not the busiest of places and as such there are hawkers everywhere trying to sell things and they iterally will not leave you alone.The next day our driver Wijana came to pick us up (recommended through his website Bali-Transport dot com) and took us back to Kuta. He told us the previous day when he had dropped us off that the dive guy had actually followed us to the hotel from Singaraja on the way through - which really spooked us out, and we were grateful that we had left.This hotel used to called the Lovina Sol until recently - so maybe try searching for reviews on this instead of Sunari for other opinions. We simpy could not recommend this hotel I am afraid.", "Date": "Oct 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR700329273", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Sparky76"}, {"Content": "Sunari Villas really shines! Found this hotel on Asiarooms.com at a great price. Paid $NZ99 for a private plunge pool walled villa. Hotel is set well back from the main road through Lovina. Very welcoming reception staff and porter. Sadly the hotel is still very under-occupied as people who are visiting Bali seldom make the journey to the wonderful, peaceful, amazing far north of the island. Our walled villa was perfect and totally private - lovely plunge pool, patio with table and chairs for eating out in the evening, chaise longue for relaxing and a bali bengong day bed for really relaxing! Bedroom was a romantic 4-poster with netting and bathroom was enormous, clean and well-kept. Room also had satellite TV, fridge, coffee-making facilities and free 2 bottles of mineral water daily. We ate dinner on our patio; excellent Nasi Goreng, washed down with arguably the world's best beer - Bintang. Our villa was very close to the huge and beautiful swimming pool which we almost had to ourselves. Hotel is located absolutely beachfront and benefits from great sunsets. The grounds are very large and attractively landscaped, masses of flowering shrubs and trees (as is normal in Bali) and full American breakfast was included in the price. Absolutely cannot fault this hotel, great location, superb staff who cannot do enough for you, great value for money (room rates and food). Next time you go to Bali, travel 2 and a half hours north and escape the rat race of Kuta and Legian. Lovina is waiting to show you its dolphins, turtles and, of course, its captivating smiling people.", "Date": "Jun 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR160354920", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "nzbased"}, {"Content": "Nice hotel, beach not useable, had a good time       pool, v quite when i was there (Aug)", "Date": "Mar 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR105666183", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "citynorman"}, {"Content": "\u9288\u5c42\u5063\u9289\u581b\u4eb4\u704f\u6219\u4efe\u9287\u5fcb\u20ac\u4f78\u760b\u9288?..   showReview(20348294, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 6, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR124797217", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297699-d582188-r19176089-Sunari_Villas_Spa_Resort-Singaraja_Bali.html", "HotelID": "582188", "Price": "$53"}}
