First of all the hotel was super close to Notre Dame and was located in a great part of Paris with tons of cafes everywhere. The hotel was a stone's throw away from a metro station and taxi stand. We booked our room thru hotels.com and were very please with the size of the room. Rooms are supplied with down pillows and comforters which end up meaning alot after a long day of sightseeing. The only aspect of our stay at this hotel was the size of the bathroom. Now I've been to Europe before and I am fully aware that everything is normally on a smaller scale but the toilet area was crazy small. But definitely something that one could deal with for the price. The staff was ok, but there was free wifi which was great.

This is a lovely 3 star boutique style hotel, on a quiet street within minutes of Notre Dame. Rooms are small so don't be shocked but our room (50) may have been one of the bigger ones. We requested a top floor room with views of the Cathedral which is what we got. It is 3 star but was perfectly clean, functional and comfortable with a nice bed, safe, hairdryer, tv etc. Your hotel is only a base as there is so much to see and do in Paris so the small rooms are'nt a big deal. It is 3 star so don't expect the Ritz! The location was perfect and you are close to plenty of little restaurants and bars, with Metro and the hop on hop off stops just a few minutes walk away. My only criticism was that the guests who had stayed in our room previously had obviously been smoking but we left the window open while we were out sightseeing and it was fine when we got back.

Breakfast is not included on the daily rate, but it's worth it. The reception is nicely decorated and there is a computer there that we can use for free. The building itself is not brand new (ok, I know there isn't any brand new building in Paris), but the bedroom is very clean and cozy. The air conditioning works fine. The windows can be totally opened if you want to get some fresh air. The bathroom is small but with new furniture. The wardrobe has a good size. There is enough space to leave your baggage open on the floor. The TV and lights are good, inside the bedroom.

The hotel's location is fantastic, you could simply walk to most major attractions- the metro station is a stone throw away.

The lobby is really cute and very inviting. In addition to location, staff was kind and helpful (especially the lady who was there during day shift). There's free wifi which we found quite helpful. The room had all the bells and whistles, however, functionality was an issue. There's AC, but you could only control the on/off function- temperature appeared to be centrally controlled. We had a bathroom with only a tub (no curtain), water splashed everywhere, tub didn't drain well at all, VERY little counter space, 'sadly' we were glad when it was our last night there (the bathroom was a real nightmare). On the positive side, there're two express grocery stores nearby, a laundromat (no iron at the hotel), and the famous Eric Kayser bakery (absolutely the best!). Of course, there's an infinite number of dining outlets in the immediate vicinity. We certainly recommend this hotel and would come back if we find a room with a shower instead of that weird tub.

You can have your morning coffee at the Metro, or you can walk half a block down the Boulevard St. Germain, and there's a place owned by an Asian couple that serve excellent coffee to go. On the southern side of the Place Maubert there's a bunch of grocery, meat, and fish stores. The Seine is a block away. The service is startlingly courteous, super-helpful, very friendly. Our room looked out on the courtyard: probably the most charming courtyard in Paris. It's a dream. The hotel is very clean. The ceilings are a bit low: that would be the only drawback.

Located on a very quiet side street it's shielded from the noise and the bustle, but yet literally a stone's throw is the bustle of Bd Saint-Germain, which is full of caf\u00e9s, bars and restaurants - ideal for a short stroll back in the evening.

Saint-Michele Notre Dame station is a 5 minute walk and has trains direct to Charles De Gaulle airport. The hotel itself looks like it has been recently renovated, and the rooms are modern and clean, though admittedly small. The bathroom in particular was rather tiny and the smoked glass toilet wall/door and the gap between the bathroom door and glass wall means that those sharing with someone with whom they're not that intimate may feel slightly awkward. But hey, this is central Paris so I didn't expect a large room, and many continental European hotels are going that way with the loos. I would advise against if travelling with children, it's just too small and prams/buggies in the lift would make it a very tight squeeze.

We would recommend asking for a room at the back of the hotel. It was very quiet at night and we didn't have any undisturbed sleep. We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel as we thought 11 euros each was a bit on the expensive side for what you actually got. We will definitely stay there again.", "Date": "July 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Essex", "Title": "\u201cEven better\u201d", "Author": "Coppins", "ReviewID": "UR70904052", "Content": "Hi. My husband and I stayed at the Hotel de Notre Dame last weekend. We have stayed there many times before, I first discovered this hotel over 16 years ago. The reception area and very helpful receptionists haven't changed and that's reassuming. The hotel refurbed its rooms earlier in the year and the decor/new bathrooms are a big improvement. The location is the most fab thing about this hotel and the rooms were always secondary. The baths had no shower curtain and you could not help but flood the floor each time you showered, and couldn't then disperse the water. However, the rooms now have a walk in power shower which was great. The rooms now have aircon too which was wonderful as last weekend was unbearably hot in Paris. The downside is in putting in the aircon, where the vents seem to run straight from one room to the next, we could hear every word the gentlemen in the room next door said, it was as if he were in our room. A small price to pay for being cool however! However, I would say that it's two years since I spent the weekend in Paris and all prices are now astronomical. \u00a34.50 for a diet coke and \u00a31 for the public toilets. Not funny. Super hotel though, ideal location.

The staff was very friendly and helpful. No A/C could be a problem - we were just lucky the weather was not too hot. The hotel is on a little, narrow, quaint side street.

They have satellite TV which allowed us to see English speaking channels. That was quite nice, since we did want to watch the news in the morning. Another plus is the hotel has many, convenient electrical outlets in the room, and there is free WI/FI!!!!! It is close to the It is a block to the Quai de Montebello where you can catch the #24 bus to the Lourve, Musee D'Orsay, the Eiffel Tower etc. The bus in much more convenient and faster than the subway! You can walk to Notre Dame and the Batobus. If you need to take the subway, it is 2 blocks from the Maubert Mutalite stop.

We are in our 50s (fyi since age is an important factor in how one sees things sometimes). Over the years we have stayed in MANY small hotels in the 5th arr. This hotel is by far the best in our experience . The rooms are all newly renovated (2010 newly) . Not just a paint job-- floor to ceiling new and well done. The rooms are now air conditioned. Bathtub is long and deep. The rooms are small by American standards, and quite reasonable in size by Paris standards (I am not including the Paris branches of American hotel chains in my comparison-- if you want an American hotel room, why come to Paris?) The staff speaks sufficient to good English and is helpful if advice is sought. The street is QUIET. Wonderfully quiet. Many 5th arr. hotels are on busy busy streets (buyer beware!). This is a quiet side street, one minute from Blvd. St, Germain and Place Maubert (metro stop right there and taxi stand) which has the usual cafes, cheese shop, pastry shop, meat , wine, veg and fresh fish dealers and a close Franprix small supermarket. It is also a 2 minute walk from Notre Dame and Ile St Louis and the walkway along the Seine. Within a 10 minute walk there are at least 4 old (and I mean OLD) churches which feature weekly chamber music concert series. You could not stay in a better small Parisian hotel . Many of the guests where French from out of town (well maybe some were Parisians having trysts, how would I know....).

A little modest eatery opposite the Altier had great Duck Terrine.
