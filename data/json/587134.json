The price was good and the location was exellent. 2min walk from the train staion and 5min walk from the bus station and 1min walk from the ferry terminal that will take you wherever you want to go in Venice. Everything in Venice is triple the price of the UK unless you buy your booze from co-op (which we did) and sat next to the river in the sun. Co-op was 10mins walk away. The hotel is clean and we had a shared bathroom but the rooms are basic but do have a T.V with english speaking channels. There is no lift but the amount of walking you do in Venice the the steps over bridges etc made the third floor stair climb seem irrelevant. Our room was next to the ally way above reception and at night it was a little noisy with people comming and going but we like that urban vibe so it didn't bother us. The breakfast was OK. With a hangover most mornings a large jug of coffee. orange juice and a croissant is all you need (but all you got !). The recption staff were helpful and spoke english and had a laugh with us and the maids were thorough and friendly. We only paid about \u00c2\u00a338 per night for the room with breakfast and I thought this was a fair price in an over priced city. I have travelled all over the world and stayed in Cesars Palace to a hut in India. I was more than happy to stay at the Dolomiti and would recomend it to the more seasoned, level headed traveller. For price and location it has to be an 8/10. Venice is amazing but watch your wallet. It will chew the life out of it !", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norwich, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBudget hotel in the right place\u201d", "Author": "BenWalker20", "ReviewID": "UR119592422", "Content": "Others may have grumbled but we were very pleased with the location, price, helpful staff, in fact everything.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLovely staff and so helpful\u201d", "Author": "Josurd", "ReviewID": "UR119151520", "Content": "Enjoyed stay here very much..

I enjoyed that so much, I stayed again 2 years later with my 2 daughters and four of their friends. Over the years I have stayed with other family members and friends there and in 2004, took the oldest daughters of both my son and daughter to stay there. We have all loved it. I have always loved having a room that overlooks the monastery gardens and the sound of the bells in the morning is a wonderful wake-up call. While the rooms have been updated and air conditioning has been added over the years, I actually enjoy opening the windows (providing it isn't too hot) and enjoying the fresh air. I have no doubt I will be back again. The family and staff are always so welcoming and helpful and I love the pate for breakfast.
