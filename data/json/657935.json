{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Excellent hostel We have just returned from BCN, we stayed at the BCN Port Hostel. The room we stayed in (there were only 2 of us) was small (which meant we didnt leave our clothes everywhere!) but very very clean. The staff were unbelievably helpful and polite regardless of what time we came strolling in or how many questions we asked!! I will definetly be staying there again and would highly recommend it to anyone as it is a 2min walk to La Rambla and the Port where you can get the Bus Touristic.", "Date": "Oct 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR995608236", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "donnajames99"}, {"Content": "Welcoming BCN ! What a fantastic hostal! We arrived after a fairly traumatic trip and then went to the wrong floor in the building (press E in the lift not 1!). Every person in reception was completely helpful and welcoming and spoke very good English. Our room was very clean as was the bathroom. We also used the safe with no problems.BCN felt like a safe haven in the centreof Barcelona", "Date": "Aug 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR804885166", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "ocelot69"}, {"Content": "Wonderful Gem! My daughter and I stayed here from 10June to 13June before our cruise. The location is fabulous. We walked everywhere. We were a bit hesitant when we first saw the building, there are residences and offices in there. The hotel is on the 2nd level. The rooms are small but immaculate, The bathroom is spotless and very modern. The staff was fabulous, helping us any time we needed it.If you're looking for a very reasonable place, look no further. We also enjoyed the cafe on the corner every moring for our tortillas and cafe con leche!", "Date": "Jun 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR491656633", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ellenkf"}, {"Content": "Location-Location- clean Stayed here as a family of four in June 08.The location is perfect within walking distance to all that is on offer in Barcelona, 3 mins to Las Ramlabas. Perfect!!! BELIEVE ME. We felt very safe here.This little hotel is located on the second floor of what seems to be a residential building. Do not be offput by the entrance. Once inside there is a small reception but the accommodation is immaculately clean. Wooden floors throughout, rooms cleaned every day and towels and toiletries changed and replaced daily. Free safety deposit box, Hairdryer / TV provided.Comparable to many a 4* hotel i have stayed in. The photo on the website is exactly what you get.Little coffee shop underneath, perfect for breakfast.Currently thay are adding additional rooms so a little noise is to be expected. Staff are extremely friendly.If looking for comfortable, clean, affordable, perfectely located hotel this is the place for you.I have no hesitation in recommending the BCN.

The description says hostal but it deserves better. From the moment we arrived we knew this was a gem. We arrived around 10.30 am Ramon on the desk apologised that our rooms were not ready although we didn't think they would be. He then gave us maps, restaurant tips and general info about the city all of which proved accurate and invaluable for our first visit. In no time at all he said the rooms were now ready and showed us up to the rooms. They were well furnished, comfortable and spotlessly clean. We have stayed in four star hotels that could have taken lessons from this establishment. All of the receiption staff we met during our stay were very pleasant and helpful. There is no restaurant in the hotel so breakfast is served next door at Alonsos. Coffee or tea, orange juice and croissants. We would definately stay here again short walk from La Rambla and port. A small hotel that is big on customer care.", "Date": "Mar 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR867074219", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "saraflo"}, {"Content": "Fantastic! Myself and three of my sisters stayed here in a quad room. Surprisingly there was plenty of space. Very clean room and maid came in everyday and changed the beds. The reception staff were very friendly and happy to help.

It is based on one floor of what appears to be a private residential block. The communal entrance is not the greatest but that is unimportant. Once you are in the hostel the reception staff are great. The guy helped with our bags, gave us maps and took us to our room. The communal areas are clean and there is free internet access and a TV area. Rooms are modern and have wifi in most. The room was really clean, had TV and a good bathroom (ours was a triple room ando so had its own bathroom, the communal bathrooms were equally clean). This hostela will pleasantly surprise you. The service is better than 2 star by far and I cannot think of any problems with this place. It is air conditioned. WAY better than other hostels and 3 star hotels. Location is great - 10 mins walk from Ramblas. If you're on a budget, this place is GREAT.", "Date": "Sep 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR537649547", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "EuroTravellerLDN"}, {"Content": "Good value       View from our room", "Date": "Sep 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR833606718", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "lilJoJo"}, {"Content": "superb!

But within the wide range I saw in Barcelona this is a very good stay regarding the ratio price/ quality. The rooms and the bathrooms are extremely clean and the staff is very nice and helpful. It is well situated. Regarding comfort, you can rest assured that the bedrooms are pleasant and comfortable, and each room has a flat screen TV. More extras, only perhaps the free internet in the reception. But not all is perfect. Again I emphasize the fact that it is a 2 star hotel in one of the busiest streets in Barcelona regarding traffic. Therefore don't expect a nice view outside for instance.In conclusion, this is a nice place to come and rest after spending the day visiting Barcelona.", "Date": "Jun 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR617200065", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Jnunes"}, {"Content": "tr\u732bs bon h\u4e48tel   showReview(12592454, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR510986665", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "huguette21"}, {"Content": "Bon h\u4e48tel       salle de bain avec douche.
