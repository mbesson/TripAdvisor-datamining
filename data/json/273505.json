{"Reviews": [{"Content": "acceptable hotel I stayed at this hotel during the Frankfurt Book Fair. Although it was quite pricey during the time, I had no problems with the hotel. The double room was quite a nice size, and a bigger room than I would expect for Europe. The shower was sort of odd with the half shower door, but you get used to it. The location is nice enough, close to the train station and right by a street car stop. I felt comfortable the whole time I was there. I would say that if a person were to stay there during the summer, it may be hot, due to no A/C, but in October, the temperature is comfortable enough to have the fan. Considering the price of al hotels durnig the book fair, and the exchange rate, this was acceptable, and I could not see myself spending more for that time for a more upscale hotel.", "Date": "Jun 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR690061018", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Bobbie43"}, {"Content": "One of the worst in Frankfurt I just returned from a one-night stay at the Memphis hotel. The hotel was one of the worst value for money hotels in the city. Although centrally located, the hotel is very close to the city's red-light district and is located in a street rich in ethnic shops and restanrants.Rooms are small and not very clean - the garbage bin in the room had chewing gum stuck to its rim, the carpet was stained and the closet was dusty. No heating/cooling system could be found in the room, and the only way to cool down was by using the fan located on the desk.The bathroom was also quite low on hygiene - the towel provided by the hotel was frayed and stained and the shower stall floor was grey- water temperature kept changing from hot to cold and water pressure from the shower was so low that washing one's hair was nearly impossible.The only good thing about the hotel was the breakfast which consisted of a selection of cheeses, cold cuts, cereals, and eggs, but was lacking in water - you had to fill your glass of water from a cooler located at the reception.Overall I think that this hotel should be avoided as it may look like a 4-star but is in reality far from being a 3-star", "Date": "Feb 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR941050672", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Anon58"}, {"Content": "Convenient Location The best thing about this hotel is the location, within walking distance of the main rail station and also ideally placed to get into the centre of town. We went there for the Christmas markets and this was a 10 minute walk away.We had read that it was near the red light district but it is in fact a couple of blocks away. I felt perfectly safe walking back at night.The rooms are clean and appear to be freshly decorated.We asked for a non-smoking room, but clearly there had been smokers in there at some time, as it reeked of stale smoke.We had rooms at the front, and it was still noisy despite the double glazing, so would not advise a trip in summer.The staff are pleasant enough, although not terribly friendly.The breakfast was very good, although very busy on a Saturday morning, and we had to wait for a table, which are quite crammed together.Despite the website advertising breakfast until 11am, this was not the case, and finishes at 10am which is obviously a very busy time.", "Date": "Dec 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR421123783", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Happytraveller55019"}, {"Content": "Strange depressing atmosphere.... I had just been to Munich where I stayed in a lovely hotel and was in Frankfurt to work the next day, so this was a one night experience only. I am happy it was really, photographs may look okay but there is a strangely depressing atmosphere in the hotel. The rooms look like they have been refurnished in the last few months but certainly in number 66 some of the guests have not treated them well, mine had torn curtains. The pillows were really huge fat things that hurt your neck so I made something to sleep on using some bedding. The area is full of sex shops and kebab houses but is not too far a walk from the main train station. The lady at breakfast seemed really nice. So there you go, if you need somewhere to stay for 85 Euros a night that is reasonably clean you could do much worse but like me you may feel a bit creeped out by the atmosphere. lee.wilson@gmail.com", "Date": "Dec 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR954734743", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "lee_bear"}, {"Content": "Excellent Value I have stayed at the Memphis a couple of times both in single and double rooms.

The hotel is very modern, the rooms were basic, but VERY clean and comfortable. For the money I paid to stay here I was pleasently suprised. My rate included breakfast which is served between 7am - 11am. Typical contintenal style, cereals, selection of breads, meats, fruit and pastries. I found the service in the hotel typically German, i.e. brisk and efficient. The location couldn't have been better, although the road from the main station down to the hotel is a bit grubby, however on the other side of the hotel towards Willy Brandt Platz is fine. The hotel is ideally situated near the trams lines 11 and 12, and U bahn. To be honest I didn't use them much, as you can walk to the old area of Romer, the riverside and the main shopping/eating area of Zeil from the hotel 20 mins max.
