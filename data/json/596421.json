We arrived around 9 p.m. and were astonished at the disgusting conditions of this place. To give you an idea, there is a sign in the lobby that says you have 5 minutes in which to ask for a refund. Does that sound like a place confident in their amenities? I'm far from a hotel snob, but when we arrived in this gritty part of town and walked into this dump, past the homeless man in the lobby alternately leering at me and falling asleep on a table, I told my husband I really wasn't comfortable staying there and asked if we could leave before we even checked in. I used GPS to find the group of hotels closer to the airport that included some bigger-name hotels, and we actually paid $180 for about 10 hours' stay rather than stay at Midway Inn. The next day we went to pick up some of the guys on the team (we had one of the only rental cars), and when we got to the hotel in the daylight I've got to say I felt completely confident in our decision to chunk almost 2 bills into another hotel! Even in the daylight this hotel is disgusting and creepy. The paint and decor is old and gross. The bathrooms are ancient and toilets sound weird when they flush. I was pregnant at the time and going to the bathroom all the time; whenever we went to the hotel I would hover over the toilet so I didn't have to touch anything in the bathroom. The beds and linens looked dirty and old. Like I said, honestly, I'm not a hotel snob; I have stayed in some places that weren't so great. But this place is absolutely unacceptable. Even the younger, rough-and-tumble guys on the team made fun of the horrible amenities. RUN, run FAR away from this horrible hotel.

Since we were going to be getting in late and flying out early, we decided to book an \"economy\" hotel. Worst decision ever made! First of all, we booked the hotel through a website. We were told that they had a park and ride and it was only going to cost us $20 for the duration we were gone. We arrived into our room to find both of the beds missing a leg and leaning to the side. We asked to move to a different room, which they were accommodating. The new room didn't have fitted sheets on the bed, the pillows smelled musty with stains on them (we covered the pillows with extra t-shirts we packed and just layed on top of the sheets without any covers...I wasn't about to use the bedspread with holes in it), the shower curtain was covered in mildew, i was scared to look at the rest of the place,and I woke up early the next morning to find 3 extra guests in our bed (looked like small roaches). The only reason we didn't go to a different hotel was because it was late and the kids were cranky. Plus, we figured we could handle a few hours. When we ended up leaving our car there (surprised to find it was still there when we came back on our return 10 days later) we found out it was $30 more than they originally told us. What could we do then since we were already there? Once we got back from our vacation, as soon as we landed, my husband called the shuttle to let them know we needed a ride. After about 30 minutes my husband called them to find out where they were in case we were in the wrong place. They told him the driver tried to call us but we didn't answer. This wasn't true because my husband had his cell in his hand the whole time and there wasn't a missed call notice. My husband confirmed the phone number with the guy dispatching the driver and was told the driver will be calling us soon. We never received a phone call. This went on for another 2 hours! We were finally told to just get a cab!! We already paid them for their service!!! By this time, it was 3:30am and we had been sitting on the curb for 3 hour with 2 very cranky kids (a 2 year old and a 10 month old). We were literally the last people out of the airport. We ended up having to pay an extra $15 to cram into a cab. When we got back to the hotel of course my husband had something to say to the manager. We were told the manager wasn't available and to call back the next day. Of course we didn't want to stay at that rat hole again and since it was so late (ER...early) we decided to just drive home 3 hours. When we called the next day, the manager said there was nothing he could do to accommodate us. We paid an extra $30 dollars for the park and ride than we were originally told, waited for over 2.5 hours for the shuttle to pick us up to be told to just get a cab, then paid an extra $15 just to get back to the hotel, then told they wouldnt reimburse us for the cab fair!! Mind you, my husband was very courteous (unlike i would have been) while dealing with these people.

The outside of the motel looked run down, the inside was jsut as bad, rundown. I had already pre reserved my room and had a no cancelation policy so I was stuck with the room. The room itself had filthy carpets, I wore my socks the whole time because I was afraid to take them off. I checked the beds for bugs and checked the sheets to see if they were calean and both passed. The bathroom was nothing like the pics on the web.

I should have known not to stay there when after checking in, the worker gave me the key to my room AND THE REMOTE TO THE TV!!! LOL We put our stuff down in the room and left immediately to get some dinner, as it was quite late. Upon returning, we get into the dim-lit room which had the furnishings of a one-night-stand stop. That includes a chewed piece of bubble gum in the shower, torn bath towels, a tray and ice bucket labeled from the Ramada hotel and soap bars from Super 8 Motel!! Not sure how they got those items, because I would bet my life that they don't have an agreement with any of those groups. I decided that I might just be very picky, and we decided to get some sleep since we were both very tired from our flight. But once we pulled back the blanket and found curly hair on the sheets and the pillow cases, I decided that I could not stay there, especially with my girlfriend. At 2 a.m. while waiting to speak with the attendant at the front desk, I was able to overhear a pleasant conversation where a respectable customer rents a room for the \"four hour special\" of $50. Upon doing so, his male friend enters followed by 2 very short and very plump ladies, and then off they all were to have what I can only figure to be a very quiet night of sleep, because what else would they be doing in a hotel room for 4 hours? Now to think that my girlfriend and I would be sleeping in the same bed as some guy who rented the room for 4 hours, and assuming that they so not clean the rooms every four hours, I was decidedly not going to stay there at all. I get to the front desk and complain to them that I will not stay in their hotel and that I wanted a refund as I had not even stayed there for 2 hours. I was promptly informed that according to the hotel policy, I had only 5 minutes after entering the room to decide whether I wanted to stay or not. When I told the attendant that we simply placed our bags in the room at midnight when we checked in, and went to get something to eat, she told me that the rule still applied. I told her to call the manager because I was not going to pay a thing (mind you they take full payment up front). She called the \"manager\" who was sleeping and decided not to come out, but told her that nothing could be done till the next day. I later found out that the manager ended up being the homeless looking fellow who was wandering the lobby in shorts and a torn T-Shirt when I was checking in. Needless to say we called a taxi immediately and went to the Holiday Inn Express just a few minutes away near to the Midway Airport. Spend the extra money and stay in a place where you wont get an STD from the sheets! Nothing is worth more while traveling than a clean hotel room and a respectable hotel in which to rest your head.
