And before I continue, I have to say that I'm not a very picky person at all - I am fine with very simple, all I look in hostels are safety and a place to sleep! Location - it is perfect, I have to say, Cleanliness OK. Security: absolutely none - they rooms are never locked, the door downstairs is not lock as well, there is absolutely no security at all. There are small locks in SOME rooms, but that's it. And don't get fooled by the roof-top terrace - ALL of them have it, they just don't advertise it always! Overage this place is not the best, not the worst I've seen, but I really don't recommend it. There are tons of hostels/hotels in this location that seem a lot better. The worst thing about this hostel is the staff - not friendly at all (the only nice and helpful person is the guy at the Travel agency - he seems a bit arrogant at first, but hey you can trust him no problem, wherever you want to go.. he will organize an awesome trip!!!). There is a very creepy guy who works at the reception (not sure if he is the owner), he is VERY annoying. First thing, MAKE SURE YOU PAY AT CHECK IN - He will fool you!!! We were two as asked for the total price, he gave us a price and then at time of paying he decided it was TWICE the price. When you check in he will say you can pay later - make sure you insist to pay now. Second thing, he will ask you to write a review of the hostel IN FRONT OF HIM. No wonder why the reviews are so good... he forces you to do it while you are there. This is so not appropriate. In sum, this is a very average hostel and I do not recommend it at all. You can find much better hostels/hotels in Sultanahmet.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ljubljana", "Title": "\u201cAn advice - don't go there (read review)\u201d", "Author": "Srdan V", "ReviewID": "UR117460446", "Content": "Hi, after reading many great reviews of this hostel we booked it because of great location and great overall rating. When we came there truth was very different. We booked through hostelworld and when we came it was not a problem. After that some other people came and said that they reserved via e-mail (directly to hostel). Hostel personnel told them that they don't accept reservations directly to their e-mail and they don't even answer it. So they left to find another accommodation. We payed while checking in and a very creepy guy took us to our room (I think that is the owner so I will call him like that). Room was not clean, it had dust everywhere, towels that we got were dirty (had stains), there were wires staring out of wall socket and in room is very very small (just bed fits in it...no chair, no closet or bedside tables). After you see all that the bed doesn't seem so pleasant anymore also. Bathroom is shared and it is disgusting. in a hall there is one sink, on the left two showers and on right two dirty toilets (for one toilet you can't lock the door and for the other door can't be closed but only locked). And all this is for about 20 people that are on that floor. You have to laptops for free use (thats ok), and you have a great terrace that functions as a restaurant/bar and it has great view plus location to the cities most attractive sites is very good. Bad thing is that they have loud music late at night on the terrace (btw there is no people upstairs at that time) so sleeping is a bit bad cause of that. Breakfast is included in price and its ok (classical turkish breakfast..but it is not unlimited like in many other hostels). Staff is average but the owner is creepy. 2 times he was asking (with his low insecure voice) us did we pay, like he doesn't believe us or can't check. It was very unpleasant. Cherry on top was this. Owner doesn't speak to you much but at the end you can expect him to ask you on which site did you book the hostel and after that <b>he will ask you if you have 5 minutes to post a review (in his presence of course).</b> I also heard him telling the same thing to one american guy one day before. So that explained to me how they get such great reviews on some sites for hostel booking Generally - there are FAR FAR better accommodations in Istanbul than this poorly managed hostel.

The two \"Terrible\" reviewers both tried to book via e-mail, which is not advisable.*Insider Tip: The hostel really only uses HostelWorld.com, and any reservations made via e-mail are subject to changes by the staff.* I simply arrived and they luckily had a room (it's now the off-season, so it was a good bet). If you're a light sleeper bring earplugs! After 12:30 or so things quiet down, yet as with any hostel in a large city expect street noise. Being picky or expecting 5-star service from ANY hostel is only setting oneself up for disappointment. Again - Don't expect anything out of the ordinary and you'll be pleasantly surprised. The terrace has a great view of the beautiful Four Seasons hotel, Aya Sofia, and the Bosporus! Istanbul Hostel delivers exactly what they promise and for a good price.

I arrived at the hostel at 4AM, and they were kind enough to give me a bed at that ridiculous hour without a reservation. Throughout my stay the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly. The location of this hostel is fabulous - within easy walking distance of all the city sights, and the cost of a stay here is amazingly cheap - I paid just a little over $10 USD per night and that included, in addition to lodging, free breakfast and 24hr internet. More importantly than any of the above was the staff - words cannot express how wonderful they were. On my last night in Istanbul I became gravely ill, and they not only took me to the hospital, but they stayed at my side during the doctors visit, and then they even drove me to the airport since I had missed my shuttle (and I was flying out of Sabiha G\u00c3\u00b6k\u00c3\u00a7en , which is nearly an hour away from the hostel).
