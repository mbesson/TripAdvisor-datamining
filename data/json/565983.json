Location: The Hotel is centrally located (hence the name) and is a short walk from shops and restaurants. It is a short cab ride to the busier districts of Wan Chi and Lan Kwai Fong. Cabs are so cheap and plentiful this is not an issue. There is a nice bar just over the road from the hotel, although it is expensive. Staff: I found the staff to be helpful and courteous throughout my stay, no complaints what so ever. They dealt with check in and check out quickly and efficiently.

Also close to Kau Kee (which I seriously recommend), a nice little temple which seemed to attract a fair few tourists and a really nice little park with pagodas and a stream with turtles and fish. Away from the hustle and bustle, but only ten minutes walk to the centre with all the malls etc. I really enjoyed my stay here. Was perfect for just sleeping and evening chilling out.

But again if you're here to revel in a hotel room, you shouldn't be in Hong Kong. The service is excellent and friendly, rivalling that of the four or five-star business or luxury hotels in the territory. The staff is extremely knowledgeable--eg, the best local joint for Chinese breakfast (a hole in the wall specializing in congee about five minutes away). They were efficient and unflappable even during the morning rush hour of check-out. The location is very good. It's not quite as centrally located as everyone would have you believe, meaning it's still about a ten minute walk to the Sheung Wan MTR station, which is the nearest subway. But it's about a five minute walk from the nearest tram line. And having lived in many big cities, I can attest that it is very well positioned for taxis. Even in the rain, it wasn't difficult spotting an empty cab. But Hollywood Road is just a minute's walk away, and the steady Western gentrification has spread farther west. Which means there is an excellent range of cosy restaurants and bars all along the strip. If you walk east, you eventually hit the antiques shop and gallery nub as well as Lan Kwai Fong (an expat haven for decades). I stayed in a standard room on one of the executive floors (high up in the building), which was very small. The closet could hold about three suits, but it did come with two fluffy white bathrobes and slippers. (A very nice touch that should be a worldwide hotel standard, not just in East Asia.) The space is efficiently used, ie, the sink was in the main room, sharing the same counter that also functions as a \"desk.\" The bathroom was just the commode and a standing shower---all much nicer than described as thus. It comes pretty well-stocked with shampoo, soap, razor, toothbrush/toothpaste, hairbrush, etc. Everything was immaculately clean. There's a flat-screen TV with some satellite/cable stations like CNN, BBC, ESPN, etc, and the local HK stations (Cantonese and English language). The room temperature was perhaps a touch cool as there is no heater. (Just a/c for the summer months.) Be warned, with HK's humidity, the room can get a little moist without the a/c on---even in the winter. There's Wi-Fi and a LAN connection for Internet, but there is a daily rate. Wi-Fi is free in the lobby. I did not eat breakfast at the hotel, but there does appear to be that option somewhere. There is no gym or business centre. There is a free shuttle bus that runs from Central Park Hotel to its two other sister hotels in Central and also the Hong Kong station of the Airport Express train in the IFC, which is a super-swank shopping mall with a cinema, hotels, restaurants, bars, and one of the best western-comfort food supermarkets in Asia. From the IFC you easily can hit the ferries and get around the Central business district. All this for a great price, a couple of hundred US dollars below the going rate at hotels with similar quality service (although admittedly bigger rooms and more amenities).", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Blagoveschensk", "Title": "\u201cNice for a short stay\u201d", "Author": "IreneBlag", "ReviewID": "UR124246179", "Content": "Central Park Hotel is a lovely boutique hotel in Hong Kong.

Lots of local color, with shops selling dried fish products and birds' nests. Some fantastic local restaurants, including a great dim sum place, were within walking distance. Walking to Central was even manageable -- giving you the advantages of proximity to the heart of the city, yet the advantage of staying in a quieter place that felt like \"home\" after a few days.

I would simply remove them as you really don\u2019t need something reminding of a kitchen cabinet in your hotel room. Breakfast was not included in our room rate, but they are many nice places just next to the hotel. For example, Graze on 143-145 Bonham Strand serves delicious breakfast. The room we had was a very quiet one. We felt like being the only guests in the whole floor. We did not hear a cheep outside our room during our stay. The location of the hotel is an excellent one: we did not even use the MTR during our stay as you could easily walk to Central and Lan Kwai Fong. I think the hotel offered very good value for the money, and despite the hanging feet, I definitely would stay again. The only thing I really disliked was the lack of free internet. I think it starts to be quite customary to offer free access and charging for it is a bit greedy.", "Date": "March 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cEverything you Need to Know about Central Park Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "HeartTravelLondon", "ReviewID": "UR23996806", "Content": "Certainly not luxury, but great basic hotel if you prefer to save your money for shopping, massages and eating/drinking like we did!

However, it has one major disadvantage - the attitude of its staff!!! We were awoken at 3am (on a Monday morning) by the guests of the suite next to our room. Upon returning home from a boozy night, they had basically decided to have an impromptu party and were making such a racket that several people on our floor got up to see what the noise was. It carried on for 15 minutes before I knocked politely and asked them to be a bit quieter. They were incredibly rude, aggressive and obviously drunk (and by the looks of it, high.) At 3.30am I decided to call reception and ask them to intervene. The manager came up to our floor and made a half arsed attempt to ask them to be quiet but to be honest, it was just lip service to our complaint. At 4.15am, with the noise from next door intensifying, I rang reception again and demanded to be moved. At 5am, I finally got to bed (in another room, on another floor, with all my belongings in the room 5 floors down)!! The next morning, I spoke to reception about the problem and they were again, unsympathetic and pretty rude. Basically, they would not be moving the noisy guests or asking them to be quiet because they were paying a (slightly) higher room rate so if they wanted to make noise, then they could!! If we had a problem, we could pack up all our stuff and move rooms. Needless to say - I was less than impressed with them!! On my return to the hotel that evening, I was told by the manager that they had actually spoken to the guests concerned and that there would be no repeat of what happend the night before. I suggested I moved any way but it was greated with an attitude of 'whatever'!! Surprise surprise, at 4.30am this morning, I was awoken by the same guests who were now entertaining their own 'guests' - singing at the top of their voices and jumping around. I ring reception and demand to be moved - only to be told that they will see what they can do!! Whilst I wait for 45 minutes to be moved, 3 members of the hotel staff deliver beer and snacks to the room next door. It is only when I call back again (and by this time, I'm livid!!) and demand to be moved that it happens. For a second night in a row, I end up sleeping in another room, with none of my own stuff and then having to walk back to my own room in the morning just so that I can have a wash. Oh, and I had to pay full price for the 2 nights of lost sleep - only adds insult to injury!! So in summary, DON\"T STAY HERE!!!!!!!!!!! There are better, cheaper and nicer places to stay. In addition, our room had red ants constantly crawling along the surfaces (and we were on the 20th floor!) and there is no regulation of the water temperature - no hot water whatsoever in the basin and boiling hot or freezing cold in the shower. They are also 'renovating' floors 1-10 so you are basically living on a building sight, sharing the lifts etc with the builders and constantly building paint fumes!", "Date": "October 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDecent value\u201d", "Author": "jkofman", "ReviewID": "UR20416204", "Content": "I found everything about this hotel to be average if not below par.

It is very difficult to find a hotel room in Hong Kong during the Chinese New Year! After reading all the previous reviews, I had concerns. But this is the only hotel with room available and at a rate I could afford. so here I am. Staff: Actually the hotel staff attitude was pretty good. Check in was easy, fast and with a smile. At 4 a.m. in the middle of the night, I wanted to log on internet, and could not find an internet connection. So I called the receptionlist. They sent someone within one minute, with a cable in hand, and actually connected my computer to the internet. To me, that is great service! Room size: The room size is actually above average for Hong Kong. I would say it is even slightly bigger than some others I have stayed in Hong Kong. The table along the window wall was very space-saving and functional. Bed: The bed is firm, but quite comfortable. My mom and I slept like a log. When I mentioned my concern when I checked in, the receptionist said they can bring a soft bed-pad is needed. If you prefer very soft bed, this is something to consider. Shower: I definitely will need sometime to get used to this. As you can see from the pictures, the shower is at corner of the room, and there is no way to get undressed in privacy. As I am staying with my mom this time. I need to think of something. At my age, I am not ready to be seen naked by my mom. So I am taking a shower when my mom is asleep. The hotel should at least add a curtain of something. If you intend to share a room in this hotel, make sure you are comfortable being seen naked by your room-mates or be prepared to shower in the middle of the night.

It was 130Euros a night, so we expected reasonable, comfortable but not luxurious accommodation. Nothing really prepared us for this hotel. Firstly the staff are nice, and really friendly as are all Chinese. However, the hotel room is TINY. No space if you have a standard sized suitcase and/or large backpacks. The bed, shower and toilet (not nice) are in the same room, just cornered off by glass partitions. The toilet is just the toilet nothing else, the shower, just a showerhead, nothing else. When I say space is limited, it's almost like the pay-by-the hour hotels in Japan. The bed is hard, not memory matress hard, but kitchen counter top hard, no joke, it's ridiculous. We were on route from Sydney back to Ireland, and arrived to this property after a 9 hour flight at like 5pm in the evening, we were only staying 2 nights, just to literally see Hong Kong and so felt there was no point moving, had it been more than 2 nights we would definately have left. The hotel floor 17 which we were on stank of rotten herbs and disenfectant. It was not pleasant. There is a plasma TV in the room, but that's where the comforts end. I mean, it's not like it was budget accommodation, it wasn't cheap considering we had paid 80euros per night in 5 star luxury accommodation in New Zealand. The area, Hollywood Road is perfect if you want to experience the real Hong Kong, as it's all locals, no tourist, and no frills. It's humid, dirty, smelly but hey, it's real and the people are lovely and the experience good, but if you're coming for high life Hong Kong for Louis Vuitton shopping and expensive meals, then dont' stay here, it's not the right part of the city. We however weren't looking for top end, but comfort would have been nice. On the plus side it's only a 5min cab ride from Lan Kwai Fong (the main party district) and even though I was with my boyfriend, we checked out the red light bars in Wan Chai, as it was an experience and the nightclubs hilarious. The taxis are really cheap so a 30min cab ride to Stanley (a gorgeous ex pat filled village with a great chinese market) the taxi was 11euro!

The hot water didn't work consistently in the shower resulting in a few cold showers even after our comments to the staff. The room was small, 240 sq.feet, in fact the shower cube was in the sleeping area. Many rooms at this hotel are under 200 sq. feet. Some on line sites list a restaurant at this hotel, there is none.

The room was small but very high tech and space efficient with a 21 inch LCD TV, remote control AC unit, etc. and very clean. Our room overlooked Hollywood Park and had nice views looking west. The cost of the room was only $83US before taxes. It's best to book through an on line consolidator as it was much cheaper than directly through the hotel.

The tram at Western Market was only a 5+ minute walk and the subway (MTR) at Sheung Wan another minute further. This location was very much inhabited by locals and not the well to do locals either. It was quite a site to see the many open markets in the area and small Chinese restaurants. We made daily purchases at the markets. No one spoke English but we all got our points across. Shopkeepers started to recognize us after a while and would wave as we passed by. Nearby was Herbal Medicine Street, Dried Seafood Street, and Bird's Nest and Ginseng Steet. The many high rise apartments in the area had laundry hanging all the way to 40 floors up. The neighborhood streets were twisting and climbing with many signs hanging over and across them.
