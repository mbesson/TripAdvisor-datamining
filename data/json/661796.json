{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Disappointed The staff and the location are good but the hygiene is very low and the interior is old, dirty and smells intolerable. Not worth the price.We booked this \u9225\u6e09otel\u9225?based on many good reviews from different people from around the world that we found on several sites, so we believed them. They use to be reliable, but not in this case. We stayed just one night and the day after we found a very nicer, cleaner and cheaper hotel just around the corner on the main street.", "Date": "Aug 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR826578945", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "CazioSwe"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d661796-r18672849-Forest_and_Land_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "661796", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
