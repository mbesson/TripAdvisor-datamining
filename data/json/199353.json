{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Our honeymoon before the wedding. We had no idea what the hotel would be like as we booked it last minute. We got there and it was better than expected. I loved our 5 night stay, the room was clean, big light and airy. As it was busy at breakfast time make sure you get it early. I couldn\u9225\u6a9b fault it in any way. The staff were very friendly and helpful, from the reception to the maids. Across the road from Am Zoo is an excellent bar called Berliner Kindl. Good entertainment.It was situated not far from the attractions in Berlin.well recommended.", "Date": "Nov 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR384339119", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "rockape14"}, {"Content": "Great location and value Passing through, went over to see if the reservation I had made from back in the U.S. (through Orbitz) was honored and the receptionist could not find the reservation. Luckily, there were rooms available and II was placed in one at a cheaper rate than the reservation. It was a no frills room, was traveling by myself so it did not matter but what I really enjoyed was the neighborhood. It was about 10 mins from Frankfurt center and it was a nice area, train next to hotel which could get you anywhere including the airport and walking distance to a mall which I visited and really enjoyed. Besides the nice experience, add that when I departed I left behind some personal items and souvenirs. I contacted the hotel once back in the US and they mailed everything to me. I would stay there again should I visit Frankfurt again.", "Date": "Jul 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR929979596", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "FranciscoR"}, {"Content": "comfortable and relatively quiet I stayed here during the fair period, so the rate was more expensive than usual, but still far cheaper than most other hotels. It's clean, comfortable, friendly staff, and in a quiet area.
