The location of this place is very convenient as you are next door to Playa del Carmen (5 min) and 20 mins from the airport, but in a more quite, unexpensive and sophisticated area. There are many advantges of staying at Cocos Cabanas, such as having privacy for resting, excellent food, private swimming pool and beach access just (600 ft away). My stays are usually 1 week long and almost every single year, flying out down there all the way from Stuttgart, Germany. The hosting provided by the owners (Silvia & Hlemut), who also run this business, is quite a different experience as you become a memeber of the family right away. Having dinner at Cocos is the best choice, as you can get international food at reasonable prices, and excelent service. My favorite one is the lobster wood-oven pizza, signature of Chef Helmut. In my last stay, I tried the Junior Suite with Ocean View, wich is brand new.

We actually booked our stay for three nights, but decided on a whim to explore more of the city and stayed at a variety of places. I personally grew up going on camping trips, and with no air conditioning so I didn't mind our little hut (sans television and with one small and barely working air conditioner). There were board games and books available at the restaurant right outside, with cozy hammocks swinging next to a tiny pool. The beach was a short and easy walk, and the place next door let us use their beach chairs as long as we made a purchase at the bar (Coronas please)!

The owners were very nice and helpful and the grounds were all very well kept and clean. The hammocks provided a great place to hang out and relax next to the pool. There was a lot of questions before our arrival about what to expect when we got there so I hope to clarify some of those here. There are 5 bungalows all very nice and well kept, however, one hot water heater for all 5. You need to time your showers when you're here if you want hot water. You have the choice of A/C, all have fans. We honestly just used the fans most of the time since it was cool enough in their winter. There were no safes in the rooms, which isn't a big deal but would have been nice. The location was nice and very close to the beach, but wasn't beachfront. You are tucked away behind another small hotel which is on the beach. You actually can't see the beach while inside the property. You to go out the entrance, turn right and there you will see the beach maybe 200' away. When arriving here, make sure you bring directions also because the cab drivers tend to not know where it is. It is off the highway a couple miles so be sure to arrive for the first time in the day so you can see all the signs pointing where to turn. The food there was great! Tasty pizzas of all types. It was a little pricy everywhere on the beach and around the area, so unless you plan on going into Playa del Carmen, Coco's is probably the best place to eat. It's the best deal around, although keep in mind there are only a couple places within walking distance.

We are pretty much your average all American couple who loves this place. Safety - I have always felt very safe here. We started coming when there was literally nothing around it and nothing from the highway to the resort (approx 1.5 miles) I felt safe then and I still feel safe even though there is more development. Keep in mind that we have been there 12 times and never had a problem with safety. Like anywhere, you need to still be aware of your surroundings and take normal precautions. The owners - We love them. From the moment we met we have been treated with the best hospitality. They are very warm, friendly, and fun. They have hospitality down to a science. They know who wants to be left alone on a romantic dinner and who wants to joke around and be silly and will interact with you at your level. The food - out of this world good. The owners cook and are very good at what they do. In the beginning of our trips down here we tried all the food everywhere. In the last 3-4 years we have just eaten at the resort. It's better than anything in town, you know who is cooking it, there is enough variety with mexican, italian, american, etc. They have items on the menu that you can normally get at any time (snacks that include a great variety) and then there is the dinner menu that has great choices everyday. A continental breakfast is served everyday and normally includes warm breads and rolls served with butter, jam, and peanut butter, cereal, fruit, yogurt, coffee and juice. (we have always been satified with it) Nightlife - Depending on how many and who is staying at the resort this place can create its own little nightlife. There have been many nights that we have sat with other guests, enjoyed drinks and conversation and a lot of laughs. The resort is so small that you meet everyone staying there on the first day. There is music playing most of the time and this place takes on its own special magic at night with the lights and the weather and the mood. Hard to explain. You can also go into Playa del Carmen for more nightlife. We have done this after things wrapped up at the resort. Playa always has nightlife. Playa del Carmen - it is very close. Not close enough to walk. You can get a taxi but I would recommend a rental car. We have done this every year and like the freedom it offers. There is a little parking lot for guests only so there is always parking available very close to your room. The drive to town is about 10 minutes. There is something for everyone there. Its a cool little place that is growing rapidly. The beach - The beach by the resort has a great place to swim and lay out. You can walk in either direction and see some large resorts and some small resorts. Lots of interesting people...(lots of people is relative - not like Cancun or the beach right in Playa) When we starting going there was very few people on the beach. This has changed but its still not that busy. It still has the feel of Mexico. The beaches in town offer more people and of course beach bars for that cocktail on the water. The resort doesn't serve on the beach but you can take one with you..! You have made the mistake of asking the #1 fan of this place their opinion. I love this place. I dream about this place. I am like a 7 year old on Christmas Eve about this place. I have fallen in love with it and the people that own it. It is my tiny slice of paradise.

He was most accommodating; we loved his cheeky sense of humor and his very tasteful choice in music. The beach, which is only a very short walk from the cabanas, is beautiful and virtually deserted. Although there are spots of rocky coral, there are also plenty of clear blue sandy spots to enter the water and have a nice swim. You can easily hire a boat to take you out to the outer reef for better snorkeling. (We did this in Tulum and it was quite cheap.) Walking both north and south on the beach was nice (we walked all the way to Playa del Carmen once). To the north, there's a resort on the point which serves tasty appetizers and drinks (although Helmut's are much better), and to the south, before you hit Playa, there's a cool little cove where a lot of local people hang out. There's a pond here that warns visitors about crocodiles(!), though we never saw any. The whole area is gorgeous -- the water as turquoise as the pictures. If we didn't love going to new places so much, we'd return here again and again. It's everything you could want and more (unless you like horrible, big resorts with bland buffet food and loads of screaming people.) We are SO happy that we decided not to book some cookie cutter all-inclusive deal.", "Date": "May 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bellingham, Washington", "Title": "\u201cBetter than we Ever Imagined\u201d", "Author": "Huck-n-me", "ReviewID": "UR6726738", "Content": "This was our first destination off the plane. I had imagined how lovely it would be BUT IT WAS MUCH MORE! We were greeted by Silvia and Helmut with such warmth and hospitality as we made our way down the path in the early evening. The restaurant & bar are so comfortable outside and Helmut is a great chef. The food is fresh and varied and they're happy to cater to your preferences. The cabanas are perfect. Beautifully designed circular structures with artistically created thatched roofs...nice little bathroom, simple and functional....Good ventilation. The hosts are so helpful and interesting,too. The spectacular beach is about a 2 minute walk from Coco's -- no crowds, just lovely fine sand. Sadly, alot of garbage has washed up: some of it is fairly interesting --- tiny mussels growing on plastic bottles; we found a note in a bottle!.... but what a pleasure to walk an hour and meet only 20 or so other folks enjoying this paradise... Coco's is superb.

It is far from the Americanized Cancun and Playa del Carmen. The comfortable canbanas run around 60-70$ per night and include breakfast. It is not directly on the beach, but it is only a 1-minute walk away from some fabulous, mostly unspoiled Carribean beach. It is a bit rocky, but you can swim. The restaurant has a small but wonderful selection -- how can you go wrong with deliciously pepared fresh fish, well cooked by the regular staff. The owner, Sylvia is a true angel and delightful company. Cocos Cabanas is NOT north of Puerto Morelos, as one reviewer said, it is about 25 kilometers south on Xcalacoco beach near Punte Bete. It is roughly between mile 298 and 297 on Highway 307. As you drive South on the highway from Cancun, get in the left lane just after you pass the Capitan Lafitte resort turnoff. Soon you will see a red Coca-Cola / Cristal bottling plant sign on your left, and when you come to the TOPES (speedbumps in the road to slow you down), get in the extreme left lane and turn left at the SECOND opening. It's easy to turn left because the oncoming traffic has topes too! Follow the paved road to a rough dirt road and follow the signs. You won't be disappointed in this lovely setting, unless the party lifestyle of Cancun and Playa are what you came for. Good restaurants and snorkeling in Puerto Morelos, too, which is not far away.", "Date": "December 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cWe loved this hotel\u201d", "Author": "Bearwife", "ReviewID": "UR6448809", "Content": "This little hotel is an undiscovered gem. The property is reached down a very bumpy unfinished road (turn left heading south on 307, just after the bottling plant), which is apparently how the local exclusive gated community and even more exclusive next door Ikal Del Mar resort like it. The hotel consists of beautifully landscaped grounds, several small one room palapas, each with its own shower/bathroom and a lot of storage space, a small lovely pool next to the dining area, and a small wonderful restaurant with a view of the pool and landscaping. There are places to sit or lie in hammocks everywhere. There is nice art everywhere too. The owner is incredibly sweet and warm and has wonderful English. There is a very well behaved yellow lab who is happy to accompany you on beach walks if invited. The restaurant food is great - don't miss the fabulous whole fried fish -- and breakfast is included in the price of your hotel room. The bar turns out the best margaritas I had in the Yucutan. The beach is rocky but beautiful, and at most 30 yards from the hotel. You can swim there if you like and it is an ideal place to take long romantic walks or energetic runs. We've attached some of our pictures. We absolutely loved it at Coco's Cabanas and would return anytime.

But who cares? We liked the isolation at Punta Bete, which is just north of Playa del Carmen. The cabanas are perfect. Each is a different color and all are round, with palapa roofs. The round theme extends to the shower, open save for a slanted half-wall. This place is a perfect antidote to the giant all-inclusive resorts. Sadly, the proprietors are leaving soon. Coco's is a manifestation of their personalities, so who knows what it will be like in the future? For now, it's a great bargain and about as charming as a hotel can be.

You never want to leave. When you think of a place you miss like you would about a person you miss there is something special going on there. Since we came across this tiny slice of paradise years ago our marriage gets an annual dose of that romance you experience in the first few months of a relationship. When we travel back in the winter of 2007 this marriage will be 20 years old. Cocos Cabanas has had subtle changes through the years but it still holds the \"magic\" that it had on our first trip. Something tells me that may have something to do with the imagination and ideas that were brought to life by the owner, who continues to keep it just the way it should be. If the day ever comes that CoCo's is gone.... All I will need to do is close my eyes and it will be forever there in my memories. Until then, we will be back every year.
