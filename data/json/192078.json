The real plus with the Dolphin Hotel was that there was a fridge in the room \u2013 only a small bar fridge, but a nice addition that I have not seen in other hotels. Especially during the summer months, this is a big plus in my book. This little difference really made this hotel for me.

Window didn`t close properly and there was a pipe with running water noise all night long. Got no help from the reception about these things. Water stopped completely one morning in the middle of my wifes shower didn`t come on again for about 5 mins. Came back one evening around 6 and couldn`t get up to our room workers were all over the stairs pulling up the carpets. Somebody already said this is the worst hotel but we had stayed in some dives in Egpyt and thought couln`t be as bad as that. But we were wrong.

The room was BIG with 2 single beds put together, 1 single bedon its own beside the 2 single beds... and 1 double deck bed in the corner.... what the hell is the point??? it was jus the 2 of us with so many beds!

After that, it's all down hill. The rooms are tiny. Our bathroom measured 3' by 4' (think about that!). The carpets throughout the hotel were filthy as was our bedspread. (The sheets were OK.) This is one of the hotels that assumes guests are criminals so charges 20 pounds to open a phone line. Then, to confirm flights with Air Canada, we were first sent to a pay phone next door that cut us off after a minute and charged one pound, and then were charged L2.20 for a short call from our room. Breakfast is served from 7:30 to 9 a.m. in a far too small room. The hotel itself suggests it unwise to go late, for obvious reasons. A self-serve breakfast area with rolls, juice and coffee open until 11 a.m. would be so much preferable from all points of view. If you don't mind roughing it for 70 pounds a night and living in a place that wants no drinking and no smoking anywhere (and we had requested a smoking room!), this place is OK.

The breakfast was copious and correct for the price paid. The rooms are cleaned every day. the staff is very helpful. Many restaurants in the vicinity. All in all, the hotel is a good place to stay. The only negative point is the carpet. If the hotel could change it, the place would really be perfect. Another thing, there are no remote controls in the rooms. Bad tv reception in my room and could not fix it myself because there some buttons missing on the tv set. But if you are in London, I don't think that you bother to watch tv.
