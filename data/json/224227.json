We had to ask every single day for something that housekeeping missed-towels,coffee,soap,toilet paper. I was treated rudely for every request. It would appear that the supervision of this staff is minimal. The breakfasts were marginal-even though I specifically asked if there would be a different menu each morning, there was not. It is frustrating when nothing offered is healthy-never any fresh fruit, only a few yogurts. Each meal had a high fat/cholesterol count and no one appeared to have any understanding of variety or healthy choices.

I did not see any white collar business travellers there. Mainly construction, families, travelling tradespeople. I would not stay here as a solo woman due to the neighborhood, sketchy parking lot, and many external entrances. I presume the ones without card keys are locked at night. Really nice pool/hot tub area with great hours until midnight. Dinner was OK (typical for Homewood) though very poorly attended. Hotel mechanicals (air conditioning, ice machine) were noisy.

I noticed the last TripAdvisor review was 10 months ago, so I thought I would add my 2 cents. I used the title about the friendly staff because that is one of the things I like about this property. I have probably encountered about 5 of the front desk staff both in person and over the phone and I found them all to be extermely engaging and friendly. Alot of the reviews on this web site address the front desk staff, so obviously that is important with travelers. My luck so far with the folks at Homewodd Suites by Hilton Dallas-Park Central Area has been excellent. I quickly read a couple of reviews on this hotel and would like to address a couple of things. First of all, there is not a Manager's Reception every night. Like most Homewood Suites, it is Monday - Thursday. As another reviewer noted, the property is a little dated. I would say the furniture is somewhere in between old and new. Hope that makes sense. The TV in the living area appears to be circa 2000-2001 and the TV in the bedroom is a little older, so I am guessing the furniture is probably from the mid '90's. Bottom line, the room we had was comfortable (had the same room both weekends we were there). If you are looking for new furniture and flat screen TV's, this isn't your place. The neighborhood where this hotel is located is kind of interesting. It is only a couple of blocks off I-635 and a mile or so east of I-75. There are a number of nearby hotels, but for some reason, the location seems odd to me. Can't quite pinpoint what it is. However, there are a number of nearby restaurants including Cheddar's, Outback, Red Lobster and Olive Garden. We went to Cheddar's our last visit and it was great as always. One of the reasons I choose this property was because of the price. We paid $87.00/night including tax. It is the least expensive Homewood Suites in the Dallas area. Both weekends we were there, they didn't seem to be too busy. We would leave and come back to our same parking place. I would attribute the lack of business to the economy and the aforementioned odd location. All that said, I would highly recommend staying here if you are looking for a decent room at a decent price that includes a complimentary breakfast. We just got back from staying at a Homewood Suites in Orlando and their breakfast set-up was a little more sophisticated (milk dispensers vs. milk in a pitcher sitting in melting water), but it is decent for a free breakfast. The first time we were there they had some excellent bacon which surprised me because you usually don't find that in a free breakfast. However, the next week, they had sausage links that tasted like what I would have expected. One last note...we have been staying here while going to the Cowboys games and it is convenient to hop on I-635 West to head to the game. It only takes about 20 minutes to get to the stadium in Arlington.", "Date": "November 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boca Raton, Florida", "Title": "\u201cgreat value\u201d", "Author": "d33j", "ReviewID": "UR22408014", "Content": "We stayed for the Thanksgiving weekend. The $80 rate was a great value for a suite room with a king bed and a kitchen. The TV in the living room also had a VCR. The room was quiet, spacious and clean. A Kroger is less than half a mile away, and the hotel is next to a Racetrak gas station so it was easy to fill up with cheap gas. On the website, we asked for a room on a high floor, which we received. The rate includes a hot breakfast with bacon, eggs, potatoes, waffles, oatmeal, etc. and a happy hour every day. The hotel has an indoor pool, business center and fitness room. Unlike other hotels, wireless internet access was included without an extra fee. Parking was ample and free. When we asked to stay an extra night, the manager gave us the same $80 rate. Last year we stayed at the Doubletree Campbell Center whose glass walls transmitted all the cold air into the room and whose walls were paper thin. I was aghast the Doubletree Campbell Center received a high rating on TripAdvisor. We have had good experiences with the Doubletree chain, but not the one at Campbell Center. We will stay at the Homewood Suites instead of the Doubletree Campbell Center and save 50%! We have also stayed at the Fairfield Inn next door to the Homewood Suites Park Central, but the latter has a kitchen so it is a better value.", "Date": "December 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cOk - a bit dated\u201d", "Author": "sarah-louise", "ReviewID": "UR12997445", "Content": "After staying at Homewood Suites in Houston I thought this would be of a similar standard - I was wrong.
