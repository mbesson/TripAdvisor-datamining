I will avoid staying here again, and have told my hosts to book another place for my next trip. The hotel lives on the memory of a past 5 star hotel. The d\u00e9cor and furniture are in dire need of being replaced, same with the carpets which look old and worn out and the hair dryer was a museum piece. The worse was the bed: not a great mattress, only one pillow offered in the 'cheap rooms' (makes it hard to watch TV as the bed headboard is molded wood) and two blankets that tangle all night long around you (and give static, they literally give off sparks). The heating was really suffocating in the corridors and rooms. Insufficient toiletries compared to other 5 star hotels I've been to. Breakfast was fairly basic for a 5 star, though they seem to leave the cheese out during the night as it was rock hard in the morning. The breakfast staff was quite grumpy, and the coffee they served was really quite bad (the problem seems to be the milk). It doesn't matter which kind of coffee you ask for (espresso, cappuccino, cortado, caf\u00e9 con leche...) they will serve you this one from the big pot. I would suggest them buying a coffee machine urgently so they can offer quality for those in need of morning caffeine. On the positive side: Internet is free and location is good (metro is just opposite the hotel entrance and loads of bus connections) but not many restaurants around (although that makes it quieter). The Paseo de la Castellana is a main artery in the city (loads of Ministry and Embassies), so expect dense traffic.

The decor is 1980s and the room does need a lick of paint but it is around 600 sqare feet with a large lounge and 2 huge picture windows overlooking the garden. The room is very quiet and although the Intercontinental was a lot more luxurious and a similar size it was more noisy and had a lot less storage space.The staff here have been excellent and cannot do enough to help. The room is very clean and there are so many nice touches like turning down of the beds, chocolates on the pillow, cotton towels laid on the floor next to the bed, lots of free toileteries.

A basic breakfast and food and soft drinks in the business centre are free throughout the day and there is a chef in the evening if you want to entertain but this would have to be paid for.

The deal sounded too good to be true and after staying at this hotel we understand why. Any optimism or enthusiasm we had before arriving at the hotel was soon displaced once we saw our room. It was shabby, outdated (the tv, hairdryer and furniture all looked like they belonged in the 70s) and not even kept clean (there were smears on tables, the curtains were dirty and there was hairs in the bath!). The only thing worse than the initial impression of the room was the view of a shabby wall out of the window. We didn't expect a fantastic view of the city, but it would have been nice to have something other to look at which didn't make you feel like you were staying in a derelict area (something we didn't expect to encounter when staying in a 5 star hotel). When we raised the issues with staff, they seemed uninterested, were unhelpful, and offered no alternative or solution. We tried to retain some optimism, hoping that the breakfast buffet would be of a better standard and quality than our room (we thought the hotel had to be 5 star for some reason!). We were disappointed again. The buffet didn't offer much choice and was minimal, and the food was often left to run out before guests had to bring it to the attention of staff for it to be replenished. The staff here were again unhelpful and gave the impression they didn't have the time for you. We felt unhappy knowing that the cost of breakfast had been included in our holiday deal after the service we received, and found it ridiculous that if it hadn't been included we would have had to pay 18 euros! Although the room and breakfast were extremely disappointing, by far the worst part of our experience was the service we received. Staff were unhelpful and uninterested at all times during our stay and didn't manage a smile once! Even if the room was bearable and breakfast edible at best, the service was awful and ruined our experience of Madrid, which is a shame since it's a beautiful city.

The area is clean and safe, and busses run up and down the lovely tree-lined Paseo de la Castellana in front of the hotel. Also, the Gregorio Maranon metro station is literally steps from the front of the hotel, which was super convenient. 2. The staff were very professional and helpful, and they spoke English very well. 3. Free WiFi in the rooms was a big bonus. The internet service was a bit slow/spotty, but it was sufficient. POOR qualities: 1. This hotel is in need of a big update, especially the rooms. The entire hotel smells \"old\", and I had to spritz some of my body spray in my room just to make it smell less musty. The curtains were a bit old (and they were falling off of their railings), and the carpet was literally threadbare in the high-traffic areas. The bed was somewhat comfortable, but there weren't enough pillows (and no extra pillows in the closet). The closet doors sqeaked and didn't roll on their track very smoothly, the trouser press didn't work very well at all, the A/C was mediocre, and the most laughable item in the room was the hairdryer. It was one of those 1970's models with a vacuum-cleaner-type hose that blows out a miniscule amount of warm air, yet still manages to burn your hand after holding the hose for 2 minutes. Luckily, the staff downstairs loaned me a 'real' hairdryer. There was a small safe, but it was quite old -- and the TV was an older tube-version with only a few channels. All of it seems a bit ridiculous -- why would a \"5 star\" hotel not have REAL hairdryers mounted in every bathroom? Why would a \"5 star\" hotel not have flat screen TVs and new carpet? 2. There was a nice garden out back with some sort of restaurant. I did not eat there as prices listed on the menu were too high. Same thing for the breakfast buffet. I heard it was somewhere around 22EUR (seriously? for breakfast?). I elected to visit the Starbucks across the street for breakfast, or alternately, you can try the VIPS cafe down the street. 3. Prices listed on the internet were way too high, in my opinion. I got a very discounted rate, as I'm an airline employee and this is our crew hotel -- but I would not have been happy if I would've been forced to pay the regular rates they were charging on the internet. In my opinion, this hotel is not worth anything more than 90EUR a night. Additional notes: There was also a spa, which I was not interested in using, but some have told me is \"nice\". I can't vouch for that. Also, I chose this location because it is only 2 blocks from the Iberia Airlines office where I had a meeting. However, it would still be a good location if you wanted to do some sightseeing, as long as you understand it is NOT walking distance from the old-town/tourist area. You would need to take a bus (about a 20-25 minute ride) or the metro (about 10-15 minutes) to get to the old town/tourist area from the hotel. All in all - this hotel had the basic amenities that I needed, such as a clean room, free WiFi, and good location. However, it really is just a mid-range hotel -- so anyone staying here should not expect anything luxurious, and definitely should be careful not to pay luxury prices.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wales, UK", "Title": "\u201cPlenty of positives\u201d", "Author": "TaxChic", "ReviewID": "UR115982109", "Content": "This hotel is in need of an update.

But this hotel, even though they had a Concierge counter there (with staff!), that concierge man just look at us and didnt offered to help. All he did was just direct us to the counter! Unfortunately, this was just a start of the lousy service... The worst would be the reception counter! Firstly, they are not friendly, and was not welcoming. They are just there to process your booking and pass you the keys. When you asked them for more information (if you don't know Spanish), you would not get the answer. Plus, I had ordered something online which was supposed to be delivered to the hotel. And when the package did not arrived on time, I asked the reception to help me call the local numbers and see if there's any problem. But all they can tell me is, \"Sorry, I can't do that!\". And that's it! They did not even bother to suggest other solution, and all they can say is....\"Sorry, we cant do that!\". Basically, I really wonder how they are rated 5-star. I'll give them 3-star the most given their location. Definitely not recoomended by me!

But in some parts of the 7th floor, for example, there is so much noise coming from the hotel's own air conditioning system (outside in the corridor, and above the ceilings) that it's impossible to sleep. I asked for, and was given, a slightly quieter room, but I just find it amazing that any decent hotel would even try to get a guest to sleep in room 701. The room had been smoked in. Breakfast was standard buffet style; good quality food.

At that time I booked the room through the hotel own reservation system. I had an overall 5+ star experience especially as far as the room cleanliness and beauty. On November 10, I needed to spend one night in Madrid on route home, because of the easy access to the metro I booked one night via Hotel.com for the total of $209. I expected the same experience as in my prior stay. I arrived to the room at 10:00pm. It started dawning on me how different the room was this time. The decor was dated and the room was very dusty . After touching anything in the room I had to wash my hands. The carpet was nothing but compounded dust. The old dust laden curtains covered a very dirty plastic shutter. After pulling a very dirty shutter belt the view from the room was an interior wall 20 feet away. The hotel hosts airline crews. On the flight home I talked to 3 flight attendants who lay over in the Miguel Angel hotel who told me that they had the same feeling of needing to wash their hands after touching surfaces in the rooms. One of them even stated she brings her own towels.I believe Hotel.com pays Occidental for the old rooms that are for the use of airline crews but charged me the price for a 5 star room. I was offered to change the room but it was 11:30 at night. It was to late for me. I did not sleep much because of discomfort from lack of cleanliness. I am told by my credit card bank that there is 30 minute period to dispute the adequacy of a room for the bank to be able to dispute the charge. I will not stay in Miguel Angel again because of their arrogance and double standard.

Some tips- Dont be afriad to use the metro it is really simple and really cheap. Visit Momabar (come out of the hotel turn left its just round the corner) its really sophisticated and trendy they serve a tapas type menu. If you do use the metro to Sol get off at Tribunal turn left out of the exit and walk the rest of the way as you will discover some brilliant shops. When you are in Sol beware of pick pockets!

We booked the hotel via airmiles website (not using any \"miles\") and received a good offer of 3 nights for price of two, B&B. It cost us around \u00a3140 a head and if you check out other sites or the hotel itself you will see that it was a good offer! If you use this hotel and are arriving from the airport use the Metro; we were going to get two taxis at around \u20ac30 each but on advice of Easyjet steward took the Metro. Cost \u20ac2 each and we were there in 20 minutes (although the walk in the airport did take 5-10 minutes from T1 to T2 but you don't leave the airport building). There is only one change at the end of line 8 at Nuevos Ministerios, on to line 10 and one stop to Gregorio Maranon. At the station turn left at the exit turnstyles and the hotel is at the top of the steps. The Metro system system was clean and safe. We arrived late after midnight but check in was fine if a bit slow, each room having to check in separately, but not a problem. The rooms differed in size but were adequate. The decor did appear a bit tired but rooms were clean. Despite being winter and cold outside the hotel was warm and we had to keep trying to cool the room down at night. The bathroom facilities were good with plenty shampoo and bath wash, and other complimentary items. After reading another persons comments it was strange to have \"cheap\" toilet paper in a 5* hotel but then I've never seen this as a selling point. Breakfast however was quite a disappointment for a 5* hotel. The restaurant was split into smoking and non-smoking but we were forced to take the former as non smoking was full; not too happy at this but the restaurant manager just shrugged rather stuffily (possibly as we were dressed in jeans ready for sightseeing whilst there were plenty business types in suits). The selection of food wasn't great. The hot food didn't look particularly appetising but probably catered for the Spanish residents which was fine, but the cold buffet wasn't particularly plentiful in supply either. There were plenty of bread rolls though and mini croissant and cakes/pastries. There was also plenty fruit and some plain yoghurt. If you take the hotel on room only basis I would advise you to eat elsewhere as I think the breakfast supplement was pricey. The public areas of the hotel were very good, large and airy but the weekend wasn't too busy in the hotel so may have had an impact. One good point regarding the housekeeping was that we showered early evening prior to going out on the Saturday. We arrived back so our bed having been turned down and the towels replaced for the morning.Was really impressed! The hotel itself is very well situated for the metro so no problems getting around. The blue line Madrid bus tour passes the hotel stopping around 5 mins away across the road. The hotel is also close to the Bernabeu Stadium if you are taking in the football.

The carpeting was very old and stained and immediately gave me a poor impression of the hotel. To top things off the television routinely would lose signal at critical moments during programs.

The toilet paper is also very rough and not at all what should be in a hotel of this caliber.
