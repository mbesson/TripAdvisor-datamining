So hotels in Tokyo will be 2 hours away. Magome station is very close to the hotel. The public transport system is so efficient and convenient you can get to the rest of Tokyo without too much hassle. If you stand looking at the maps for more than 30 seconds often someone will offer to help you.If you want to stay close to the airport don't go into Tokyo.The restaurant is open from 7am to 2 am.Tokyo Inn is a small budget hotel. It is clean. The staff didn't speak very fluent English but they spoke it better than I did Japanese. I've stayed their twice and I'd stay there again.", "Date": "Jul 31, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR526064121", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "RastaFourEyes"}, {"Content": "Long way from Narita but neat little hotel Tokyo Inn is basically 2 hours via train and metro away from Narita. If you just want a stop over hotel look at a metro map of Japan and pick a hotel that is not the other end of Tokyo. There is a trick with the metro and you should make sure you are on the correct line as the tokyo inn is on a dog's leg line.As a hotel no complaints. Neat clean. Super small room. Convenience store across road. Resturant closed by time jet lag munchies kicked in.Breakfast interesting fusion of western items cooked in non western manner. This may be standard in Japan ??", "Date": "Mar 11, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR141058604", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "AllisonjaneBrisbane"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066454-d505989-r16400045-Tokyo_Inn-Ota_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "505989", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
