There was a large gap at the bottom of the door but nothing a towel laid accross cant solve. we were on the first floor and to be fair our window looked onto more windows but what do you expect in a city build upwards on narrow streets? The rooms were adequete size for me and my partner very clean and tidy on arrival. The reception staff are friendly and helpful. The breakfast was nice for what you got but do admit at 12.50euro is a bit expensive, but it doesnt take much to search for a website to book the hotel in which breakfast is included in the price, infact I booked from hotels4u.com and found the room was cheaper than any other website and also included breakfast. I have read a few reviews stating they would not return to Amsterdam, and one lady who felt unsafe on her own through narrow streets.... all i would say is do your reasearch of the city before going and lets be honest is any major city in the world safe walking down narrow streets on your? Amsterdam is a brilliant city which offers many things to do for all interests. Yes some may find the RLD seedy but do your homework and dont go to that side if your not interesed. I will be booking this hotel without doubt for my next trip in a few months The hotel is located a 2 min walk form central staion, when you get of the train from schipol go down the stairs/escalator and turn right walk out the station. follow the road to the right out of centraal station and its the street directly infront of you. cant miss it really.

The surronding area of the hotel is perfect, all main streets are in a 5-10 min walking distance in all directions.

Anne franks house is about a0.7 mile walk takes about 10-15 min walk. The van gough and rijks museam are a bit further away but you can get a tram from just down the road form the hotel or even walk if its a nice day (should only take about 30-45 min walk) The hotel is also on the edge of the picturesqu Jordaan area.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kiev, Ukraine", "Title": "\u201cConvenient location\u201d", "Author": "ElenaKiev1", "ReviewID": "UR118051080", "Content": "The location of the hotel is good.

The aircondition was very loud - and you need to have that going so you won't get rid of air. You have a saftybox, tv, no fridge. It gets very wet in the bathroom when you shower so you need a lot of towels. But a final warning. There are mice in the hotel walls. We had bought some snacks, and but them in our suitcases the night before we were leaving. And when we were packing the last thingsin the morning, the packages had holes in them (http://twitpic.com/5zb08h) Like a mice hade gnawed on it. Wasn't nice at all to see that. We told them at the reception desk and they confirmed that they had mice in the walls \"but we cannnot get rid of them\".

The staff on the front desk were friendly and helpful. I had a single room and yes, it was on the small side, but clean and I was using it to sleep in, not live in. Facilities in the room: Bed (One pillow and thin duvet) - comfortable, chair, small table, phone, flat Screen TV on wall opposite bed head (Only got about 4 channels, but two were BBC 1 & 2, so I could catch up with news back home) Wifi - could only get it with laptop on desk. Didn't realise until near end of trip so kept popping down to reception. 2 x hooks for coats Air conditioning with adjustable temperature. Small wardrobe with a couple of hangers and shelves Safe large enough for a laptop Bathroom - toilet, sink, shower, small shelf with 2 cups, hairdryer - with shaver point incorporated, hairwash/shower gel dispenser (took my own so didn't use, plus not too keen on all in one soaps) Bath mat, large towel, small towel. View from window - across to the wall of the opposite bit of the building, but if I sat on the bottom corner of the bed, I could look through the walkway to the harbour. Small gripes: There does seem to be a problem with the shower as others have said. The water took forever to go down and on the second morning was almost to the door. I went down to reception to tell them of the problem and they promised to have a look. Next morning it was only marginally better. The shower itself is quite good though. Light switches at the head of the bed. I kept switching them on/off when sitting up in bed. The extractor in the bathroom is constant, so you have to make sure the bathroom door is closed when you go to bed. No drinks available after cafe closes at 4.00p.m. Would have liked a drinks machine in the foyer (or a kettle in the room) Other The lift is room card operated, which makes it feel safer. In the room, you need a card for the slot to make the lights work. Any card will do - it doesn't have to be your room card. Breakfast - not included in my deal, but a couple of mornings I went down for coffee and toast. Nice coffee, lots of toast and jam. Girls in the cafe very polite and friendly. Luggage room in foyer. If you arrive too early, or want to leave later than checkout, there is a luggage room. Key card from reception, but anyone can get it. I used my laptop lock to secure my luggage to one of the posts. The hotel is just across the road from the Centraal Station and close to shops. Most things are within walking distance. Cafe/bar next door, small supermarket open until 10.p.m. around the corner which sells sandwiches, snacks, drinks, cigarettes and other groceries (turn right out of hotel and take first right - Albert Hejn) All in all, I had a nice stay and would recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cgood location, ok hotel\u201d", "Author": "luna_s02", "ReviewID": "UR115689447", "Content": "i stayed for 4 nights. it was a single room, very small. very few tv channels. it was a no frills kind of place. was not thrilled with their cleaning of the room. bed was saggy. it is very close to centraal station which is a big plus. easy to get to everything. it was quiet at night, no rowdy travelers. the bathroom did not have any separation from the shower and the rest of the bathroom so the whole room got wet when i showered, very annoying. also they offer a shuttle to the airport but it costs 15 euro and takes almost an hr., better off riding the train which is what i did.", "Date": "July 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cClose to everything.

The huge gap under the door also makes it difficult to sleep in with the corridor light glaring through. I really did not feel safe in the room and when leaving to go out for dinner I put all of my belongings into a locked case.

I had earlier read a few reviews about some issues with the hotel during check-in. I had warned my travel agent accordingly, but she said that such issues only arise out of online bookings made on the internet. When I received the booking voucher, I found that it mentioned only 2 Adults, and we were traveling with our 4 year old daughter. When I pointed that out, my Agent assured me that it wasn't a big deal as the Child would be sharing the bed anyway. And that's exactly where everything went wrong. The moment we arrived at the hotel, the lady at the reception pointed out that no where was it mentioned that we were traveling with a Child. My mistake, I admitted, and asked her what was required to include the Child into the booking. She wasn't very clear on this. I prepared myself to be asked for a payment for the child's breakfast. But what I heard instead was SHOCKING -- They do not allow 2 Adults plus 1 Child in their Double Rooms. Has anyone here ever heard that anywhere ???? I don't think so ! So what happened next was ridiculous.. we were checked into a \"Quad Room\" meant for 4 adults. I called my agent and refused to pay anything extra. My agent was nice enough to admit her mistake and told me that she would take care of the monetary terms from her end and I wouldn't need to pay anything extra. The Room was a huge one with 4 beds and it was in the Basement. No windows, and it was terribly damp. The Wifi also did not work down below. Staying in that room was like staying in a Prison cell with only walls to look at. The Location was great, I must admit. Its just across the road from the Central station (Amsterdam Centraal). We had booked 2 sightseeing tours and there was a pickup point right in front of the Hotel. Very convenient indeed. Dam Square is a mere 10 minutes' walk from the Hotel. Breakfast was quite okay, and the staff were very nice, helpful and smiling. There is this guy from the Carribean (sorry I forgot his name).. he is a super-wonderful person and speaks to his customers with a sunny smile all the time. Appreciated.

Once you arrive at Centraal Station, you just basically cross the street and you are at the Bellevue Hotel. This hotel is right in the middle of Amsterdam.

The double room that I was in was quite spacious, and serviced everyday. Within 50metres of the hotel you will find a vast array of eating spots, internet cafes (internet city, which is around the corner, was very handy and you can print). There is also a supermarket nearby if you are on a budget. The hotel was also very helpful in organising tours, and because you are basically in the middle of town, the departure sport for day, bus and canal trips is only a short walk away. We stayed during an extremely cold snap (-4 during the day) and were still able to walk to where we wanted because the location is so central to everything. Unfortunately, there is no internet, but there are plenty of wifi spots and internet cafes within 50 metres. I will have to say this, however. We pay 189 euro for two nights (without breakfast) and I think, for what we got, that was a bit much.

I was quite satisfied. I made reservation via the hotel's own website, and got as good of a price as I was able to see on any of the other hotel booking sites. They reconfirmed with me by e-mail two days before arrival without me having to contact them, and upon arrival the reservation was flawless. I selected this hotel based upon location (great), price (acceptable, and well within competitive range for 3-star hotels in the area), lift (necessary to be 3-star, and necessary for my knees!), and available internet connection (preferably free, which Bellevue had). Check-in was easy and quick. Yes, the room was small (by US standards), and by looking at the floorplan, most of the rooms are about the same size. Mine was (I measured) 9 x 12 feet plus the bath. It was small by US standards, but not by Amsterdam standards, and not smaller than similar hotels in similar price ranges in this area of town. The bath was actually fairly large compared to the room itself. Room was clean, though there were stains on the carpet. Mostly white carpet and walls gave to a smooth design, but showed dirt. The bath was clean, and daily maid services were good, even though the hotel was fully sold out. Others have commented on the shower and toilet areas not being separated by any barrier, so that when the shower ran the entire floor of the bath could get wet. It really was not a problem. The floor gently sloped toward the drain, and if you pulled the shower curtain, the water stayed where it should. It made for an interesting design, quite smoothe and attractive, and not a problem at all. I had absolutely no problem connecting to, nor staying connected to, the free Wireless service in my room. I took a \"Small Double.\" The description showed the bed as \"Queen,\" but it was not. It was what in US would be called a \"double.\" If a \"twin\" bed is too small, this is the size for ONE person, and would have been entirely too small for my spouse and me. However, it was PERFECT for me by myself. The next size up would also be called a \"double,\" but the sleeping arrangement would be two twins pushed together. They would be separately sheeted, which might not be optimal for some, but two twins are larger than this bed was. There was a lift off of the main lobby, but it required you to use your key card to call it. As a result, no on wandered in off the street and it was quite private. Your key card was also required to be put into a slot in the room before any of the electric lights or outlets worked, and they all went out when you removed the card and left the room. The only exceptions to this were the TV and air conditioner/heater unit. The hotel is not fancy, and is not a 4 or 5 star location. But then, neither is it priced nor advertised as one. I got exactly what I expected, a good value, and a nice place to stay. The location of the hotel is on a busy street (Marlelaarsgracht) with auto, bike and tram traffic, at the corner of an even busier street (Prins Hendrikkade), but I never heard a sound from traffic. No more than 100 meters from Centraal Station, with bus and tram connections in between, the location was PERFECT for getting around anywhere in town using public transportation. And, coming from Schipol, a quick train ride did not require any additional public transportation nor taxi. There is a small restaurant that serves breakfast and lunch (until 14:30). Breakfast was a buffet, for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12.50 they had scrambled or hard-boiled eggs, bacon, breads, yogurt, ham, turkey, cheese, coffee, tea, juice, cereal, and I am sure more. You could charge the bill to your room or pay cash. Lunch, available until 14:30, consisted of standard fare: Sandwiches or Dutch pancakes. Perhaps more important, the service was VERY good and personable, and they remembered you and your preferences from day to day, even though the hotel was completely full of guests. I felt like we were old friends. The location is excellent. Walkable distance to RLD, but located so that you could avoid it if that was not your cup of tea. Not on the Damrak with its commercialism and noise, but only a long block away should you want to be in the activity. Trams stopped right in front of the hotel on their return. Shopping and many small restaurants nearby, as well as bars. But a quick tram ride away or longer walk and you would get to Dam Square, or to Leidsplien, where the choice were limitless. I would choose again, and after seeing the location and insides of several competing 3-star hotels in the area (that I almost chose instead) I can say that I would choose Bellevue again if I was to stay in this area and price range.", "Date": "October 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Shields, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel - couldn't fault it.\u201d", "Author": "Nic40_10", "ReviewID": "UR83030119", "Content": "We stayed here for 3 nights in May.

This room was silent which was great for my partner who is a very light sleeper. The location was perfect and Damrak, a main hub of transport was one minutes walk, allowing for regular trams to teh Leidseplein and Museumplein if requied. These were however under 30 minutes walk. The hotel itself was nicer than i had expected. The rooms were crisp and clean with nice decor and the staff very friendly indeed, i was surprised to note someone had a negative experience as i found them extremely courteuos and helpful. When we had the usual 2 towells in our bedroom a quick mention of this saw 5 towells arrive in a matter of minutes, and queries on attractions were met with maps and valued tips. The only negatives i could find would be the bathroom did not had adequate storage space for accessories, with a tiny ledge, and was generally very small. Also the breakfast was somewhat limited, albeit exactly what i would expect of a three star hotel. It did offer scrambled and boiled eggs, a couple slices of cold meat and cheese, some cooked bacon, cereal and croissants. None of this however was particularly appealing. Overall i was very happy.

The first time I stayed my room was an ok sized room, not massive but not at all small. My room yesterday was also a double but this one was much,much smaller. Both ok for a lone traveller on an overnight stay although the later was really not great. Both rooms were clean and functional. On the downside, both rooms were at the front of the hotel which is REALLY noisy and I mean REALLY noisy. The trams go past over 120 seconds, yes 120 seconds. I was led in bed timing it at 1am. Also the other traffic is noise is very bad. It seems that the drivers in Amsterdam love hitting their car horns at any opportunity. Unless you are a very heavy sleeper or get blind drunk and collapse on the bed, you WILL NOT sleep! I finally fell asleep at 3am to be woken by the trams at around 6am. On the upside the hotel do offer free wifi throughout the hotel. Overall, if you can get a room at the back of the hotel and are staying just a couple of nights then it is fine.

Before I start let me just say that if you want to stay in a hotel where you only come in at midnight and sleep till 6am and are taking prescription - or otherwise - drugs that act as a sedative then you should be fine. This hotel has very tiny rooms - this maybe the trend in Amsterdam as land space is at a premium and is very restricted but this hotel is very tiny and allows for little room. The room we stayed in was an upgrade - this can only lead to me to the fact that our orginal room must have been a stable! Cleanliness was an issue: there was marks on the bed sheets, large marks on the thread-bare carpets, lip-stick marks round the bath and there was a dead insect on the bathroom floor, which was perhaps due to the fact that there was no drainage in the bathroom at all. No shampoo or conditioner was provided - only a small bar of soap and poor quality pinkish hand cleaning stuff was provided (which the hotel expected customer's to use as shampoo I guess as it was located over the bath). Towels were rock hard and tiny. We had a twin doube room and requested two separate beds: the hotel gave us a room with two very small beds pushed together. The pillows they provided were tiny and I had to ask for another pillow - which they provided without fuss. Sleep is a major issue in this hotel, as in kiss goodbye to it!! Despite the double glazing, you can clearly hear the traffic on the main road going all night long. To add to this noise, the trams operate from 6am to midnight with metal scraping on metal and 'ding, ding' signaling their intent to move forward. Internal to the room: well, there is a constant industrial hum from the fan/air conditioner which cannot be turned off. As aforementioned, you would have to be drunk or stoned to sleep in this hotel without issue due to the horrendous noise. Oh, the walls are paper thin and we heard a paricularly nasty domestic argument between our neighbours (it turned violent and we had to alert the hotel staff who handled it firmly - thankfully for the couple involved). The hotel has little facilities - no restaurant, no bar, no mini-bar etc. Breakfast is served in a cafe located next door to the hotel which serves yogurt, nuts, pastry and one glass of orange juice - very healthy and there is a little amount of scrambled egg and burnt bacon rashes to help yourself too. This hotel is not disabled friendly as there are stairs in the rooms and a large stair to access the bathroom. The hotel does offer free Wi-Fi but this is a joke as the connection only lasts for 30 seconds at a time! The staff are very polite and friendly and it is located near to the central station which is great for transport to sight-seeing locations. For 112 euros a night (starting from) and a further 12 euros for a small, limited breakfast this hotel is way overpriced for the small box rooms it offers. It is more like a hostel, but if you want a hostel and just somewhere to sleep, then plenty of those can be found nearby for a more suitably reflective price.

No big worries here since I've visited Amsterdam a few times before (all at t he Leidse Square Hotel which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend above the Bellevue, even though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about a 10-15 min tram ride away from Centraal Station). Since I was only in Amsterdam for a night, I thought I'd try something convenient to the railway station, hence the Bellevue.

Then they found my booking (booked under my middle name instead of my last name, for some unknown reason in spite of my Expedia booking showing my last name) and then told me, sorry, I'd not get the upgrade now, just the ordinary room for me! Nevertheless the staff, ranging from the reception to the breakfast room, were all exceedingly pleasant. Security seemed good since you needed your room card to operate the obviously-new elevatore. As expected from the reviews on TripAdvisor.com, my room was VERY small! There was nowhere to put my luggage, except on top of the bed. No frills either but reasonably clean although the carpet had a few marks and some of the paint was peeling in the shower area of the bathroom. There was NO VIEW from the window, except for another window about 1.5 metres away, which actually was a hallway window so people in the hallway could see inside my room unless I pulled down the blind and then the room became dark. Although there was no noise from the street, there was a bit of noise from the hallway and from other rooms, with doors clashing etc., not too bothersome but certainly indicative of the poorly insulated construction. Two good things about this hotel were that Wi-Fi access throughout the hotel, including the room, was free and breakfast was included in the room rate. Breakfast was the usual European breakfast fare; they were a bit late in getting started in the morning but eventually, everything arrived and the buffet table was ready. I'd consider staying at this hotel again, but only for a single night to make an easy connection at the railway station for Schiphol. If I am to be in Amsterdam for more than one night, I'd prefer a hotel with larger rooms even though it meant a tram ride from the station. The one thing this hotel has going for it is its proximity to Centraal Station. It's literally across the street, only 5 min walk. So I would recommend this hotel to a friend, but only for a stay of a single night.", "Date": "August 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buxtehude, Germany", "Title": "\u201cCentral jump off point for sightseeing in Amsterdam\u201d", "Author": "RollingStone61", "ReviewID": "UR38022398", "Content": "Small, modern hotel close to main train station and shopping district.

Get out of the train station, head to your right, walk pass the bike rental place and cross the streeet, and you'll be able to find the Sign of Bellvue Hotel. I took a day trip to Utrecht and Den Haag, and then I also took the train to Groningen. So, being close to the train station was just what I needed. When visiting Amsterdam, this location is great too, as you can always find the tram at the central station. You can also walk to almost everywhere. One morning, I took the tram down to visit Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh museum. After I was done for the day, I actually walked back to the hotel. It wasn't a short walk of course, but it was a pleasant walk while during some shopping on my way, and just to explore the city. My room is facing the street on the 5th floor, I have a lovely view. I was so excited to open up the curtain every morning. I was staying in this hotel during third week of December. I could see the sunrise every day (around 8am) However, since it's located so close to the station, you can't avoid the noise. the cars and trams makes it a bit noisy at night, it dies down around midnight, and in the morning starting around 6:30am (I guess), you'll started to hear them again. But for me, I can sleep through everything, so it didn't bother me. But if you are a light sleeper, you might take this into consideration. Maybe ask them for a room that is not facing the street would help?One of the window can't be completely closed. When it's closed, there's still a teeny tiny gap that some cold air, and noise, come through. Not sure if that's just my room. But again, that wasn't a big problem for me. My room was very clean, but not everything is in great condition. my comforter had a tear in the inside (I was going to ask for a different one, but I was too lazy to deal with that).The bed was not the most comfortable mattress, the heaters only goes up to 26 degree (but the room is still a little cold for me personally). I had a double room for myself, so i have enough space, and I think it would fit a couple comfortably. there is no coffee facilities by the way. The Bathroom was clean, but there were a bit dark stains at the corners of the wall around the bathtub. Something is chipping off from the faucet.But I have to say the condition wasn't unacceptable.The shower curtain wasn't dirty, but i do wish that they would replace it. Shower is always hot enough, hair dryer works really well.Only shower gel is provided. During my 6 nights stay, the towel sets only get replaced twice. But since I was staying there alone, I just use the other clean one when they have not replaced it. When I checked in, the staff was very nice and friendly. When I checked out, they were alright. But when I asked if they could break a $50 bill for me the guy sitting next to the girl I was asking interupted and just say \"No, we can't do that, we don't have enough small bills, go to the train station.\" Fine, but at least he could say it in a nicer way.

Central Station is across the road so access to trains, trams, buses and taxis is quite literally on your doorstep. You are only a five minute walk to Dam Square and the Red Light district. Check in was very straight forward. No big welcome but efficient nonetheless. My twin room looked onto Central Station and was basic to say the least. It was tiny. The beds were pushed together, they wouldn't have fit into the room otherwise. There is a small closet and a small desk with one chair in the corner. If you are sitting at the desk you cannot open the door to your room. There is however a safe in the room. The tv is mounted flat onto the wall and there was about 6 inches between the wall and the end of the bed. The bathroom actually had a really nice tub but the wall was angled in such a way that a taller person would have difficulty taking a shower. Quite unbelievably, the was nowhere to store as much as a toothbrush in the bathroom and I had to leave my toiletries in my toilet bag on the side of the bath. Despite everything, I qutie enjoyed the quirkiness of the Bellevue and to be honest I've stayed in worse hotels. I would forego breakfast as the dinning room, in keeping with the hotel, is quite small and the was always a queue to get in. Plenty of bars and cafes around to sort you out. It's definately not a hotel for those who like there comfort and it's not somewhere I would bring my wife for a romantic getaway.

It turned out to not be much of an issue. We were at the end of a 2 week trip that included 10 days on a cruise in the Baltic Sea. This means a lot of luggage to lug around. We had 3 45-50 Lb bags. They all fit in the room, the 2 chairs have to face each other, with one bag resting on the 2 seats. We had a room facing the street (highly recommended). The bathroom had a good size window sill to leave your bathrooom accessories on. The flat screen TV and the beds were very acceptable. We did not have breakfast included, so went to the corner restaurant every morning (turn right as you leave the hotel). The prices were reasonable and the quality of the food and service was 1st rate. We tried the hotel restaurant when we initially checked in. It was very expensive, and the waitress left a lot to be desired. She did not ask if we were staying at the hotel. This caused me to use a credit card for the full price. When I signed the receipt I found out we were entitled to a 10% discount and could have added it to the bill at check-out. She would not reverse the charge and could not understand why this was a problem. I complained to the front desk, but I don't think management was that concerned. Of course I would not consider eating at their restaurant for the remainder of the 4 day stay. The rest of the staff were good, with the front desk being really outstanding. The train from the airport to the Central Station is about 20 minutes and cost 8 Euros for 2 people. When you come out of the station, go right, past all the bicycles and walk across the street to the hotel. I did not find out about the Amsterdam discount book for museums, restaurants and trams until the last day of the trip. I believe it is called, \"I love Amsterdam\". It looks like you can save a considerable amount of money by getting it. The front desk must know where to buy them.

My most recent stay in July, 2008 brought me to the Bellevue after reading the many positive reviews at Tripadvisor. My only disappointment was that I did not stay here previously! In brief detail, here are the top reasons why you might want to stay here too: 1) Location: Walk out of Centraal Station, cross the street and turn right and you're home at your hotel. Early morning flights from Schipol are no problem anymore and you won't tire from lugging your luggage across town to the train. 2) Ambiance: The post-modern minimalist decor is fantastic. Ambient light comes from everywhere in the room and the white color scheme makes the rooms feel much larger than they actually are. As one reviewer noted, the showers are wonderful with great water pressure and hot water that never runs out. 3) Free WiFi: Excellent speeds and strong signal; enough said. 4) Security: No room key - no lift access. 5) Comfort: Soft, comfy beds and AIRCON make for a good night's sleep. 6) Service: Staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. I had to have some travel documents from the UK sent far in advance of my arrival and they were waiting for me upon check-in with no hassle. 7) Price point: Amsterdam is expensive, period. In my opinion, the room rates are very reasonable comparable with other hotels that do not offer the above six reasons to stay here. Negatives: 1) It's a non-smoking property. If you like to have your coffeeshop smokes in your room you'll have to go outside to take a puff. 2) Location: If you do not need easy train access and/or don't have a lot of luggage to haul around, then there are far better places to stay outside the tourist trap of the Damrak area. Even better, get out of Amsterdam and stay in Haarlem or Zandvoort and take the train in to town for your shopping and nightlife.

For any task that requires you to use more than one item at a time (shaving, putting on makeup) you need to be a juggler -- there is absolutely nowhere to put anything, not even on the side of the sink. You'll need to keep your toiletries somewhere near the bed and constantly carry everything you need in and out of the bathroom. Foolish design choices!

Breakfast on the first morning (a Friday) was chaos! We got down @ 09.40 and joined a queue only to be told there was little food left despite service finishing at 10 and there were no tables left. Despite this we were crossed off the list as having had breakfast (we were B+B), when a table finally came available we went to get coffee and returned to find someone else had taken the table! We gave up and got breakfast at the excellent corner cafe a few meters away. Later I complained to the manageress who said she would look into the matter. The next day we were given a voucher for free coffee and cakes for our inconvenience, and amazingly were refunded the cost of breakfast on checking out a few days later, certainly a first for us! So, just make sure you are down before 09.30 if you want breakfast, which incidentally is excellent. So, in short, a clean friendly hotel, a little traffic and tram noise if you are in the front but ideally situated to explore Amsterdam.

When we got back to hotel (about 1pm) The reception said we have been upgraded to superior rooms and checked in. The room was small but perfectly formed. The bathroom was clean and the shower was lovely. There is a flat screen TV on the wall with lots of channels, white modern furniture, Hairdryer in the bathroom, Wardrobe with plenty of hangers, artwork on the wall, a bottle of water and really comfy beds - we had twin beds but they were right next to each other so not a problem. Security is great, you can only acccess the lift by swiping your keycard - a fab idea! I didnt really notice any noise from other guests or the trams - so dont worry, you will get a perfect nights sleep. Breakfast was good also - a mixture of continental items and a couple of hot items too - scrambled and boiled egg, bacon, beans and mini sausages. Best of all it was all you can eat! Above all, I had a wicked time in Amsterdam and the hotel made it a better experience - completely hassle free. The Heineken Experience was fab - it closes over the winter period though. As we weet on the last day before closing - we got absolutley wasted on 54 halves of free heineken!!! Be prepared to wait hours for Anne Frank's house - the queues are massive. We didnt wait as it was really cold waiting outside - so be prepared! Definatley recommmend the Canal Hop on Hop off bus. Really easy to use - just get your ticket for 18 Euro - from outside the Station in the Tui office (same company as Thomson Holidays) and hop on and off all the stops all day.

Because of an early morning flight for our return we decided to book a hotel very close to Central Station. For this, the Bellevue is ideally placed being just 2 minutes walk away. Having read reviews that said the rooms were small we booked one of their larger rooms at extra cost. I pity those in the smaller rooms because there was literally no room \"to swing a cat\". The rooms are designed in a modern, minimalist fashion which is relatively pleasing as regards decor but proved to be a complete triumph of form over function. We had a double room, which consisted of twin beds pushed together, indeed there was no other place for them as they were 'shoe-horned' in between fitted bedside shelves, which were themselves right up to the walls. In the past when we have had twin bedded rooms in Amsterdam the beds have been double and on one occasion queen sized. These were not even singles, but 2'6\" bunk sized beds. There were no tea or coffee making facilities in the room but a complimentary bottle of water was provided on the first day! Not what I'd call 3 star! The wardrobe consisted of a single cupboard, wall mounted directly above one of the bedside shelves. The space inside was so minimal as to prove impossible to hang even a shirt or jacket without it bunching on the bottom of the cupboard. The bathroom was accessed by a sliding door, immediately beyond which was a step down, painted the same off white as the rest of the bathroom and which proved to be a real hazard for trips to the loo after a night out. There was imaginative use of lighting in the room, which gave a pleasing effect and was operated by touch pad type switches, 3 of which were located directly above the bed, at just about the hight of the pillows. This meant that any slight adjustment of position in bed would inadvertently switch the lights on or off! Though we went in for breakfast we never actually ate there as the buffet style offerings seemed very poor value for the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10 per person they charged. As I said before, the hotel was very conveniently situated and it was quiet, clean and well presented but despite its visual qualities we found it totally impractical and very poor value for money.

Amsterdam's oldest pub is also located next-door to the hotel. Our room did get nosiy at night due to cars and trams though, so if you want peace and quiet and early nights, you are probably better looking elsewhere. However, if you plan upon going out at night, and if you want a great location, within a 10-minute walk to the main bars/restaurants, shopping areas, Dam Square, canals and the main train station, this hotel is an excellent choice.

In fact, if you take the bridge over the canal on the far right of the station building, as you leave, you almost arrive at the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doorstep once you have crossed the roads. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very easy 5-10 minute walk, even with luggage. The hotel has a small reception area and a small caf\u00c3\u00a9/restaurant called Brasserij on the ground floor. The reception staff were all pleasant, spoke excellent English, and were most helpful with booking various trips and excursions (even if they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to know much about the restaurants in the immediate vicinity). We reserved a non-smoking \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsuperior\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 room, which turned out to be room 205, on the front of the hotel with a nice view out to the street, watching the trams go by, or over to the station if you turned your head left. The room was nicely spacious, with very modern d\u00c3\u00a9cor. It seems that the hotel was only opened in 2005, so everything still seems new and clean. The air conditioning in our room was very welcome, since it was very warm. There were no coffee facilities or refrigerator, which would have been a very welcome addition, although there was a complimentary bottle of mineral water, with two tumblers, on arrival. The bed was two singles pushed together, with an individual duvet and pillow on each side. The comfort of beds are always an individual taste, but we found ours to be quite comfortable, if a little soft for our personal preference. Nevertheless, we had three good nights sleep because we were so tired with all the walking we had done each day! The room d\u00c3\u00a9cor was modern, mainly white, with a sandy \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmural\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the wall opposite the bed. The ceiling had whitewashed wooden beams to add to the effect. The flatscreen TV had multiple channels in a variety of languages, including BBC1, BBC2, BBC World and Eurosport amongst others in English. There was not a great deal of storage space, although enough for the two of us for our three day stay. The room had one unit with a glass door in which to hang clothes, and two open shelves (one of which was rather too high to be useful). There was also shelf space either side of the bed, and a modern white table and two chairs. Lights were controlled by various switches, and was nicely \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcambient\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with light coming from underneath shelves and from behind the mural wall as well as above the bed head. The room had a small safe in which to keep valuables, and two electricity sockets. It was double glazed, and so we had no complaints about any noise. The bathroom was spotlessly clean, and starkly modern in design. There was a full bath tub, with shower and curtain, a toilet and a sink in front of a full length mirror. There was only a very small shelf in the bathroom, so not much space to put your toiletries. There was a hairdryer and shaving socket. The bathroom was stocked with the usual range of towelling, and had a shower gel/shampoo dispenser in the bath, and one small bar of soap (renewed daily) at the sink. The toilet was a little too close to the wall and bath edge for my complete comfort, although most other people would have no complaint. It also had full and half-flush options for water conservation. Breakfast was not included in our room rate, so we were free to eat where we liked. However, the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own caf\u00c3\u00a9/restaurant (Brasserij) offered a daily buffet breakfast for 10 Euros each. We highly recommend this choice. The breakfast buffet was superb and included a range of cereals with milk and yoghurt, orange juice, tea, coffee, croissants, various breads/rolls, multiple preserves, plates of cold meats and cheese, and (especially pleasing to us Brits) hot sausages, bacon, scrambled egg, boiled eggs and beans. The staff were all friendly and welcoming. The weather was so nice that we ate at one of the four tables outside on the street for three of our four meals there, and enjoyed watching the world go by. We highly recommend this breakfast buffet, which is available whether you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staying at the hotel or not. We also ate one of our evening meals here. They do a nice three-course dinner for 23.50 Euros, although we found a 10% discount voucher in our room, which we used. On our final day we packed and checked out by 10am. Guests can leave their suitcases in a separate, locked, luggage room for as long as they like (free of charge). Looking at the hotel layout \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that was on our room door, we could see that the hotel has a wide range of room sizes. There would only be five or six rooms on each floor that looked out the front of the hotel. Many of the others would only have a window onto a very small central square in the middle of the hotel, the only \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcview\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from which would be into other people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rooms. Certain other rooms would be smaller than ours, and some only seemed to have a shower rather than full bath. Our rate was 110 Euros per night for the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsuperior\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 room. Interestingly, this was 20 Euros per night cheaper than we could find on numerous web sites. I therefore recommend that you contact the hotel directly, either by telephone or email, to discuss rates and room options. Standard rooms would be cheaper still, although we were very pleased with our rate for our three nights in August.

The only complaint my partner had was that there were no tea or coffee making facilites in the room, but considering the number of cafes surrounding the hotel it wasnt too much of a probem. I agree with some of the other reviews that the room was quite small - but it was not an issue for us and i certainly don't think it should deter anyone from picking this hotel. We didnt have breakfast in the hotel, as we preferred to pick something up when we were out and about, but we did have a meal in the restaurant at night. It was very small and intimate, with a limited menu, however the food was lovely, and not too unreasonably priced, especially as there was a 20% discount voucher with the room. The staff were very attentive and helpful too (and the dessert was very very nice!). I would definitely recommend this hotel, and would stay there again if I return to Amsterdam.

They got back to me very promptly with a good and accurate quote for each member of our group so full marks for this.

As we met some of our other party at the reception it was rather chaotic with all the greetings etc flying about but the receptionist coped admirably. Our room was on the 5th floor directly opposite the lift which worried me slightly but we didn't get disturbed by any noise for the 3 nights we were there. The room was a decent size - not huge but we weren't planning on spending much time in it. It was bright and had a lovely double bed, flat screen TV and plenty of shelving. The wardrobe was very small and is obviously made for people who are coming on short breaks (isn't this most visitors to Amsterdam?) and not bringing much with them so it was fine for us! Put your suitcases on top of the wardrobe as it will give you more space in your room! (See photos). The bathroom was okay with a bath and overhead shower but no bath curtain which definitely seems to be a quirk of many European hotels that I've stayed in. The shower was powerful and was something that many of our party commented on over the weekend. More shelves in the bathroom would have been nice though. As we were high up we could only vaguely hear the trams through the double glazing. The lowest accomodation our party had was on the 3rd floor and they had no complaints about the noise either. Some rooms did vary within our group as the single rooms appeared to be quite small and some double rooms only had a shower with no bath. We didn't have breakfast so I can't comment on the food. The staff were very friendly and professional even when my friend sleptwalked out of his hotel room at 3am and he had to go down to reception for a spare key!

After reading the reviews here, I decided to book with the Bellevue. Trying to go through Expedia, Orbitz, etc., I found there were no rooms available. So I booked through Bookings.com But the hotel's brochure states that you can make reservations online at www.bellevuehotel.nl We paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac102.50 for our room, which I thought was reasonable. It only took a few minutes to get from Centraal Station to the hotel, which was wonderful. I faxed the hotel before we left for our vacation and stated that we would arrive late in the afternoon--I am glad that I did as the hotel was fully booked when we arrived. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. We stayed in Room #305, which overlooked the street. The room was chily when we arrived, but we turned the heat up before heading out. The room was not small by European standards--it was quite large compared to the hotels we had been staying in the last two weeks. It had an IKEA feel to it, but we had no problem with the decor. And my husband really liked the flat screen tv and the English-speaking channels. The room was very clean. The beds were comfortable--and the pillows were wonderful compared to those we had in our hotels in Italy. We were unsure that the light bedding would be warm enough, but we were comfy and cozy once under the covers. Our room was located just across the hall from the lift, but I was not disturbed at all by noises from the street or from other hotel customers. My husband did hear people coming and going in the night, but was not kept up. A pair of earplugs would have done the trick, if we had needed them. The bathroom was spotless. It was not too small and contained a tub/shower--with a shower curtain. There was a glass shelf, but it wasn't located above the sink. But this didn't bother us since we were only staying one night. The hair dryer seemed to worked well, but I always pack my own to use. We ate at the hotel restaurant and my husband loved his dinner. I only had bread and a bowl of tomato soup, which was wonderful. The panna cotta was terrific. And the staff were warm and friendly. I am so glad we had a quiet dinner there before heading out into the noisy city. I would certainly stay here again.

Here we had no such problems. Breakfast was included. They had a simple buffet - nothing spectacular, but it's not bad. The room itself is very nice. Simple but functional furnishings. I liked the built-in flat-panel TV. Had many stations in various languages. It had enough space to hold all our luggage. We asked for a quiet room and they gave us one facing an internal courtyard, so we had no view, but it was quiet. Have to be careful at night to close the blinds or people can see us. No problem since we spent most of the time outside. One unbeatable feature is FREE wireless internet access in the room. My wife loved that. The bathroom was strange. It was fairly big and nice. However they had little shelf space to put our toiletries - just a tiny glass shelf very high. I ended up accidentally knocking down my shaving razor blades.

At the top of the list is it's location and proximity to Central Station. Roundtrip from the airport was \u00c2\u00a34/(6 euros). That beats the heck out of the \u00c2\u00a330/(45 euros) I've paid in the past to take a cab. And the trip is shorter by train. D'oh! This was a 'last minute' trip and I booked into the Bellevue on Expedia. I paid \u00c2\u00a390/(135euros) per night with breakfast included. I bet if you book in advance you can get a better deal than I did. I was in room #110 which is an interior room. I was traveling alone and expected a 'single room', it was adequate for me but two people would be hard pressed, literally, to move about comfortably. (Prepare to be creative if you have a lot of luggage.) The only window looks out onto an air shaft. If 'the view' is important to you... then room #110 is not for you. The only way I can describe the room, it's decor, and funishings is 'minimalist'. Apart from one wall covered in 'watery' blue wall paper everything is very, very white: three of the walls, the bedding, the plastic table, the two plastic chairs, and the whole of the bathroom. In such a small space the white 'works'; making the room seem larger and brighter. (I have to wonder how it will age, this is a relatively new hotel.) The carpet was seagrass and already looking a little worse for wear. The closet is tiny but it contains a safe. The room is equpped with a flat screen television with good reception. (Parents might want to monitor what their children are watching in the later hours... the two movie channels are free... and offer an extraordinary range of entertainment.) The bathroom is large in relation to the size of the sleeping area. A simple solution for the shower would be a sturdy curtain that reaches to the floor.... but that doesn't exist... so you can expect to soak the entire floor when you shower. The towels were better than expected... and there were plenty of them. I understand that some rooms have a bathtub... that's the way to go. The hotel breakfast is served from 7am till 10am although I skipped it both mornings in favor of Barney's. I highly recommend the omelette, the hot chocolate, and the 'Amnesia Haze' at Barney's. I realize some people don't appreciate all that Barney's has to offer... and some people don't eat eggs.

Simply exit the station and turn right and the Bellevue is on the first street on your left. You can literally see it from Centraal station! The hotel looks very smart from the outside.

The door to let you into the hotel was controlled by reception staff so not just anyone could walk in, good safety. We were greeted by the lady at the desk and were quickly checked in. We were surprised to find that our room was ready for us and that we had been given a free upgrade to a superior room. Room 205. We were told breakfast times (7am-10am and 7:30am-10:30am at weekends). We headed off to our room on the second floor. We used our door card to gain access to the lift (again, good safety). What a lovely room. Quite spacious, lovely design. Mostly white with a feature wall. Flat screen tv with plenty of channels. Large windows with nets and block out curtains with a nice view onto the road and up to Centraal station and of St Nicolaaskerk. Two single beds together with comfortable mattresses and pillows. Ikea style table and chairs. Telephone. Very nice under lighting that set a nice mood to the room. Bedside cupboard for hanging clothes complete with hangers. Free safe. Three plug sockets. Bathroom was very nice also. Large mirror, trendy sink. Complimentary toiletries. Bath and shower but no shower screen but didn't really have a problem with a wet floor, just tilted the shower to the right and put a towel on the floor to stand on. WC and fresh towels. Hairdryer. Overall, the room was spotless, very well equipped and extremely well designed. The room also had good air conditioning which we had on all the time due to the baking heat! The room was also quiet considering the road below and a tram stop. This was due to a double glazed window and another single glazed window. Breakfast at the hotel was taken in the small dining area on the ground floor (or could be taken in your room for a few euros extra). Again, very nice breakfast room. Breakfast was: Juices, hot drinks, cereals, Croissants, uncut bread, meats, cheeses, fruit, and a hot breakfast of: sausage, beans, bacon, boiled or scrambled eggs and of course to finish with, pancakes! We really enjoyed breakfasts and never had to wait for a table at around 8:30-9am although guests arriving later sometimes had to wait in the nearby lounge area. The hotel has a Brasserij which always seemed to be very busy and appeared to do nice meals. Next door to that on the street corner is the oldest brown caf\u00c3\u00a9 in Amsterdam, this is a very nice place to stop for a drink and a people watch! We loved our stay at the Bellevue. Everything was as we would want, very central but quiet rooms, reasonably priced, good breakfasts, safe and secure, very well decorated/furnished and good staff on hand. It was perfect.

Our room was a reasonable size however we did notice when walking through the corriders that the hotel had a lot smaller rooms with windows facing the corriders - therefore they had to keep their curtains closed and had a lack of natural light! - We were very lucky with our room!

Are more than happy to help you out in finding places (getting the right transport and train numbers etc) I would highly reccommend this hotel to couples, business people and families.", "Date": "March 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cornwall, England", "Title": "\u201cLook no further than this hotel\u201d", "Author": "blight053", "ReviewID": "UR4595793", "Content": "Well we read all the previous reviews and was very excited about staying in this newly renovated hotel.

Location is everything, and that's only the half of it. The rooms are magnificently clean and have unique design elements at every turn. Flatscreen tv with international channels, floor-to-ceiling abstract photographs on the walls, clean crisp Dutch design. The shower curtain? Let me tell you something about that situation. The showers in Europe are notoriously cramped and tiny. Coffin-like, in most cases. This bathroom is designed so that it can all get wet and will dry relatively quickly on its own. If you can handle bringing in your toiletries bag and brining it out again when you're finished, you won't miss the shower curtain. Instead, you will feel free to stretch out and take a rejuvinating shower with no restrictions or sticky, mildewy curtains to brush up against. Clausterphobics take note: you will love this shower! We didn't wake up in time for breakfast any day we were there, but we were always within twenty steps of a place to eat, drink, smoke, shop, stroll, or stare. The staff was courteous and educated, and when we left our \"do not disturb\" sign up during our entire stay, they left us a drawstring bag of fresh towels and toiletries hanging from our doorknob in the morning. Delightful service. Do yourself a favor and avoid all the usual stress that comes with finding your hotel upon arrival, or at the end of a long day of walking around town.

The apartment was filthy and not as described and after two nights I walked into the Bellevue reception on the off chance of room (I had seen good reviews and thought it was worth a try). As New Year was over we were lucky enough to get a room at a very reasonable price and the lady on reception held it for us while we checked out of our apartment. The hotel is only six months old and is modern in style with a very clean \"Ikea\" look. The room was wonderful - mostly white with a few splashes of colour and plenty of lighting which is rare in Europe. There was a flat screen TV with en-suite bathroom (bath and shower) and two twin beds (pushed together). The bed was really comfy and the sheets crisp and clean. The room was a good size with two chairs and ample storage space. The bathroom also has a decent hairdryer. Room service and laundry are available but we did not use them. The most important thing was it was clean and tidy and was cleaned (and towels changed) every day. We had a front facing room and although we could hear some street noise it did not keep us awake (I love the ding of the trams!). We were offered a back room if we wanted it. Breakfast is not included but is 10 euros each - we did not try this so I cannot comment. My husband did get a free coffee for me one morning though!

The wet bathroom was cleaned nicely every day! - Don't be late for breakfast because you will not be helped (we saw some other disillusioned guests turned away after we fortunately made it!) - Wireless internet access is advertised on their brochures but according to the staff it must still be installed.
