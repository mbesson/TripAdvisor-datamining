The appartment is in a good spot, is nicely furnished, has everything one would need, the bed is comfortable, the room was big (we asked for some space), the breakfast was more than one could ever expect (your homemade jam is delicious and the fresh bread every morning a fabulous wakeup-call) and your support and hospitality was just great.
