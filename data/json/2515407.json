When I arrived, I was told they didn\u2019t have that room but instead had a room with two doubles. I made my dissatisfaction known and was told that the provider of my travel package couldn\u2019t guarantee my specific room because they didn\u2019t know the hotel\u2019s room availability. I find that odd as my reservation clearly indicated the room I booked as part of my package. The front desk attendant said she would look for a different room and call me within a few minutes, she clearly indicated she would put me on the top floor overlooking the city to make up for the misunderstanding. Several hours later, no call and only when I stopped at the front desk again did she re-address the situation. I was told I was being \u201cupgraded\u201d to a room with a king bed and that the room was larger \u2013 what she failed to mention was my \u201cupgraded room\u201d was only one floor up (4th floor) and had a lovely view of a wall, of the building next door and really wasn\u2019t that much larger. One day into my stay, another guest\u2019s dog barked throughout the night keeping me awake. I called the front desk and was told the owners had gone to dinner and had been notified of the issue. I had no idea the Bristol as a pet friendly hotel or I never would have booked it. Another day, our mini-bar key had been taken and we needed to ask for it back to retrieve a personal item we had placed in it. Another day, our dirty towels were removed but we weren\u2019t given fresh ones. Parking is an extra fee and most times, the valet took longer than I believed he should have to retrieve my car. The one and an only saving grace of this establishment was their restaurant. It was a lovely place, with very friendly and attentive staff, very good food and very reasonable prices. I would eat there again but I will NEVER stay at the Bristol again.

Their decor is modern, dynamic, and attractive--the property really does look as it appears on the website. Cleanliness is clearly a top priority at this property, down to small details--I returned after housekeeping not only to find that everything had been restored and restocked, but my housekeeper had actually arranged my toiletries on my countertop in a more visually pleasing array.

I read about The Bristol being in a good, walkable area of downtown, close to restaurants and stores. I liked how it looked online, and that it wasn't a big chain hotel, so took the chance and booked it. The hotel is a great area of the city for restaurants and shopping. And if you don't mind walking abit (or taking transit) it is easy to get down to the waterfront. I didn't have much of a view from my room, but I was fine with that as I was there for business anyways. The room itself was great. Much larger than I expected for a downtown hotel in a major city. And the decor was fun and unique, with a very comfortable bed. I had been warned from previous Trip Advisor posts that the bathroom can be an issue because it has a sliding door, but as I was travelling on my own, this wasn't an issue. The food from room service was fine, And most importantly when travelling for work, the wireless internet was hassle-free. Best of all, the staff at the front desk was amazing! Always very help with suggestions of where to go for food, or how to get to a location. I think the front desk can make or break a stay at a hotel, and the people on the front desk when I was there were top notch!

The hotel was nice and modern - though I think you could \"modernize\" any hotel with the right bed spread and wallpaper. The positive things included a friendly staff, close proximity to public transit as well as Gaslamp [a short walk of only a couple blocks], big windows, and a well-stocked honor [woo hoo!] mini bar. The negatives were the noise and an uncomfortable bed, and cramped tub. There is a bus station right across the street and if you like to sleep with the windows open like I do, you will be woken up constantly from 4am on, by the non-stop clamor of buses - beeping, clanging, engines, oh my. We didn't sleep very well until we gave in on the third night - closed the windows and ran the A/C instead. The bed was uncomfortable for me [and I'm not picky] - the mattress was too firm, and the pillows were the kind that are so squishy-soft that your head sinks through them with no support.The bathtub is also one of those teasers with the slanted back begging you to lay back, if only the tub wasn't so close to the wall that there's nowhere to put your neck and head. Now that's torture, especially after you've hit the mini bar. We ordered a lot of room service from the Daisy cafe downstairs and the food was mostly very good, though not many light/fresh breakfast options [mostly different versions of eggs and potatoes]. But the Irish Cream[?] Cheesecake was phenomenal. Also, the hotel requests that you leave your recyclables out of the room trash can which, I appreciate, but it would be nice if they provided and alternate bin so the trash is not just sitting around everywhere. Also Also, [Bristol, if you're listening] if you're going to be earth-conscious enough to recycle, then why do you put little [non-recyclable] laminated cards in each room every day with the days weather on it?

As it was our 20th reunion and we were seeing friends we had not seen in years we were told about the hotels \"no party policy\", but told we would be able to socialize as late as we like in the hotel lobby as it was two floors below the nearest hotel room. And just to clarify \"socialize\", I was giggling with old girlfriends while sitting on a couch in the lobby, not yelling, screaming and running up and down the halls. After following these guidelines, and catching up with friends in the lobby as requested, I returned to my hotel room (where my husband was sound asleep) to a party being broken up by security across the hall. I entered my room only to receive a knock on the door moments later by a security guard saying we were being evicted. When I asked why, she said she had received complaints about a party in our room. When I invited her in to see that my husband was sleeping and had been for hours and that I was just returning from the lobby, she said it didn't matter and left. Within an hour two police were knocking on our door to evict us!!! When we asked for an explanation we were told they could evict whomever they chose for any reason and they did not need to give an explanation. Really?!?!?! When we asked for their names, they refused to give them, which to me is an automatic admission of fault. The worst part is that the group having the party across the hall, also alumni, had received multiple visits from security and we later found out they were not evicted. We chose to wait a day to contact administration to cool off a bit, as we were understandably upset. The way the situation was handled by the management was equally, if not more appalling. We were hung up upon by management on our first call, the administrative assistant at the main office refused to give us the email of the president, as the one online was no longer valid, and when we finally received a response by those in upper management, we were threatened not to post a review in travel blogs. So....I am taking a risk by writing this review, but advise potential guests to stay at their own risk.....you, too may receive a knock on your door to be evicted for no reason.", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carlsbad, California", "Title": "\u201cI will never go Back!\u201d", "Author": "Scott3721", "ReviewID": "UR116128830", "Content": "They forget to tell you that all of the rooms have views of the San Diego Jail and the Greyhound Bus Statinn.

As previous reviewers said - the area is seedy. Lots of homeless and a kind of deserted feel around. The staff is really nice - all of them. Once you are in the hotel it is nice - decent rooms and nice lobby. The main issue we had (aside from the seedy area, but we knew that going in) is that they have events on weekends - like HS reunions! We were there last night (Saturday) and there was a 20th HS reunion going on. All the rooms around us were partying loudly. The really unfortunate situation was that there were 3 rooms all around us (oh, and we have a 9 yr old) who partied, drank and cursed really loudly all night! Finally we were awoken at 5:30am by the idiot next to us SCREAMING the worst curses. As we prepared to leave, the police came and evicted the couple who were causing this problem. Obviously this was really unnacceptable and the hotel comped us our room. The manager was very, very nice and sorry. So on the one hand, the Bristol was great in treating us well, but the downside is that they seem to host a lot of party people (see previous commenters).

When we got to our room around 6pm we could hear the people next door. I don't mean a conversation, full on partying, shouting, screaming. So I immediately asked for a new room. This was done with no problem at all but I was told this wasn't a party hotel so they couldn't do anything about noise at 6pm. I totally understand that but if that was the noise at 6pm then what happens next?! Also the party hotel line made me laugh as someone had put posters up in the lift saying Party Reunion 9th floor. We moved rooms and it was silent until 2am when the party continued outside our hotel room. We took it into our own hands to tell them to be quiet. So it wasn't a party hotel..... Anyway, everything was fine until our final night. We had an early flight so were eager to get a good night's rest. At around 12.30am we were awoken by water and the sound of drips. There was streams of water coming through the ceiling on to us and the floor. The bathroom was soaked with water and the bedroom was on its way. We called the staff and they began to sort things out. Apparently upstairs had left their shower on. (not a party hotel though....) and we were to be moved to a smoking room. Strange has this was a non smoking hotel? Ah said reception, the person had smoked in it and couldn't get rid of the smell yet. (not a party hotel though) So after our room was flooded, through no fault of ours we should be moved to some stinky room? Ehh what? Eventually they found another room and it didn't smell. We could once again hear the person next door and we worked out that any room with an adjoining room allows you to hear every little sound. This new room was also next to the ice machine so we got very little sleep that night. The next day we were given our bill for valet asked about our stay - reception seemed oblivious to what had happened. When we explained we presumed that we would be offered something, free valet parking, free breakfast, something - no. An apology. So when our valet bill was presented to us I asked if we could get that taken off. We were given more than that off, just about $50 which was fine. I just wanted a token at that point but in hindsight I should have pushed. It was disappointing that it was very much of a case of don't ask don't get. In any hotel I've stayed in before they have always offered remunerations to make up for something that went wrong - a flooded room certainly deserved more than an apology. Would I go back? Nope. Should you go? possibly, but ask for a room without an adjoining room for a bit more peace and quiet. It was a comfortable bed, a very clean hotel but I'm concerned that people are flooding rooms, smoking in bedrooms, having parties on the 9th floor, and waking people up with screaming and shouting in the corridors at 2am.

My first day there I received a call that my dog was barking when in fact she wasn't. It was another dog on that floor. Then the next day after completing the San Diego Rock n Roll Half Marathon and relaxing in my room. I received another call about my dog barking. This time it's true she was barking. But to her defense she was barking because the maid was outside of our room cleaning other rooms. But it was never a constant bark. So I went downstairs to explain this to the front desk concierge and she was rude to me. She said she was rude because I was being sarcastic. I know no one wants to hear a yapping dog all hours of the day but to even get calls that she's barking is a bit too much. I am a guest too. And the hotel says Pet-Friendly yet every time a dog barks everyone with dogs are called and told that someone is complaining about a dog. Why put the dogs on one designated floor and even entertain calls about barking dogs. I feel like the other guest should be told that the floor they'll be staying on has dogs and there will be occasional dog barks. To me it's like someone complaining about hearing a baby crying. So I didn't feel comfortable and I did not feel welcomed at all. I was about to leave early and drive back to L.A. even though I was sore from running. I can't say my stay was great because that really put me in a sour mood. I never received complaints about my dog before and she's stayed in other hotels. And I've never been talked to like that before from a Front Desk Attendant. The rooms are Ok. I had to call the Front Desk to send up a plunger cause the toilet almost overflowed. The toilet also leaked throughout our stay. The rugs look like rugs in Las Vegas casinos. The flat screen TV's are not hooked up properly. The quality is poor.

Especially thanks for the tip on the tasting selection of drinks at the local brewhouse. I hope your next employee of the month award comes soon (he never asked me to say that - Honest!!).

Breakfast wasn't included, but we ate at the hotel anyway, and it was excellent. As I said above, I couldn't fault it, but what gave the place the elusive 5 star review was the little extras they did for you, above and beyond the normal service. Printing off maps, and instructions on how to get to Old Town and recommending one of the best Mexican restaurants I've ever been to. As well as simple things like leaving a small card in the car, with some good suggestions of local radio stations. This felt like a 5 star hotel, and I would definitely stay here again.

I need to recommend the best pancake ever located at Richard Walker's. Also, my favorite milk chocolate gelato at Choc o' lat located on 5th. Both restaurants are a must. Don't leave out the Daisy Bistro which is the restaurant located at the hotel. Both soups I have tried have been fabulous! The Horton Plaza offers plenty of shopping and entertainment. There is also the local trolley right around the corner of the hotel which offers low cost, easy to follow, transportation to the other great sightseeing areas. Again, I believe this is my new home away from home.

We stayed at the Bristol Hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews. All I can say is WOW. What a great hotel. The staff was extremely friendly (Ahmad, Marisol and Heather) and very helpful in recommending places to eat as well as how to move around SD using public transit (which by the way is wonderful). Also, we could easily walk to Seaport Village (on the bay), Little Italy, Horton Plaza (outdoor mall) and many restaurants. Couldn't have asked for a better location. Talk about clean, this hotel was spotless (lobby, public restrooms and rooms). I'm extremely picky about cleanliness and found this to be one of the cleanest hotels I've stayed in. We were upgraded to a king room with the extra sitting area which was nice. I thought the room was plenty big and nicely decorated in a modern chic way. We were located on the 5th floor. We didn't have view at all. Faced the backside of another building. However, we weren't in the room that much so this really didn't bother us. However, it is worth mentioning. The bathroom was large enough to accomodate two people getting ready and has the best water pressure I've ever felt. And, the contoured shower curtain rod was a nice plus. Another plus was the wall-mounted lighted magnification mirror. There's also a small coffee pot on the bathroom vaniety with tea and coffee (we didn't use it but it's available). The only thing I would upgrade in the bathroom (and in the hotel room in general) is the lighting. I thought the room was a little too dark. The king-size bed was very comfortable complete with a down comforter and luxury sheets. Slept great. I know some complained about the street noise, but we didn't hear a thing except once or twice a siren went off. The hotel itself was extremely quiet. And, the free high speed internet was great. Didn't have any trouble connecting at all. There have been a couple reviews about the area itself. You are right in the middle of everything. We did a ton of walking and always felt safe. San Diego definitely has a homeless problem. It's very evident all over the city. But, we didn't feel threatened or intimidated by this at all. Like I said, it's all over the city and definitely around the tourist areas. Our last day we ate breakfast at the Bristol and was very pleasantly surprised. The food was great with a good selection for breakfast. It was a little pricey, but so are many restaurants in San Diego. On a final note I would definitely recommend the Bristol. It's a great boutique hotel with a very accomodating staff who go out of their way to make you feel right at home.

Total for 5 days was $488. I was blown away by this hotel. Room wasn't ready when I got there at 1, so I checked my bags with the bellman, and went explore the city for a couple of hours. The hotel is within walking distance to the many restaurants/bars on 4th and 5th (Gaslamp Quarter), is a block from Horton Plaza, and less than a block from the trolley stop. I came back around 3 and was told that because I joined the Bristol Loyalty Club before arriving, that I was being upgraded to the larger King room. Everyday serendipities during vacations make my trips extra special. The lobby is standard with a restaurant/bar right off the front desk. Around the corner to the elevators is a very chic area that has some couches. Throughout my stay as I came out of the elevators, I saw guests lounging here. Good meeting spot. There was also a pc and printer set up near here - good for me to print my boarding passes. There is free wifi in the rooms, but I did not have a printer, so this was very convenient. My room was on the 5th floor, at the end of the hall (I think room 506). I was very impressed with the size, cleanliness, and decor of the room. Very contemporary. There was an LCD tv, big dresser (I unpack if the trip is longer than 2 days), closet had plenty of hangers along with a safe and iron/ironing board, suitable work desk, and the bathroom was perfect. Not huge, but plenty of room, nice plush bath mat, great tub/shower, and all of the standard bath amenities. Bed was super comfy, and had more than enough pillows. One thing that I always complain about is the lack of electrical outlets in hotel rooms. This wasn't the case at the Bristol. And the alarm clock radio/mp3 dock was a nice bonus. My first night sleep was a little noisy. Everytime a trolley came to the stop just about right outside my window, I could hear the loud whistle of the electic motors. And the police sirens were annoying, but I thought hey, I am right in the middle of the city, and it's not near as bad as Manhattan. The next day I realized my windows were open. Duh!!! I closed them, and it was like locking my self in a sound proof chamber. One note is there is also central ac. I guess this isn't common in all San Diego hotels. With temps in the mid 70's and low 60's at night, it wasn't needed by me (I live in Florida where I deal with high 90's in the summer). Houesekeeping knocked on my door everyday by 10 am, and I usually wasn't ready. When I came back in the afternoons, everything was made up like new. My housekeeper even organized all of my personal toiletries on a hand towel in the bathroom. I wish that I could remember the names of the hotel staff that were so great - and I mean everyone that I enteracted with: the front desk, the bellman, housekeeper, night auditor - everyone was fantastic. The only negative thing that I have to say is that the ice machine was on the third floor, so it was a pain to refill my ice bucket. But that won't change how I feel about this hotel. I will 100% stay here again on my next trip to San Diego, and recommend this hotel to anyone that is going. Truly a remarkable hotel right in the middle of everything. I am a Starwood Preferred Guest, and the Westin a block or so away was over $300 a night. The Bristol was a better deal, with nicer staff, and even the bed was more comfy than Westin's Heavenly Bed. I don't give these comments lightly, as I love Starwood. But the Bristol earned my repeat business with every touch along the way. Thank you Bristol. I will be back.

The location seemed acceptable as it was pitched as being \"downtown.\" Neither of us had ever been to SD and had read reviews of thin walls but had hoped it was just a loud floor. I take a cab and arrive around 9:30pm to the hotel. Right off the bat, I notice the neighborhood seems a little sketchy and dark. There was graffiti on the wall on the wall next to the hotel. I was checking-in alone and a little nervous. The hotel had quoted me that a cab shouldn't be more than $8-10 for a cab ride when it was more like $12. The lobby was empty and I was checked in pretty quickly. I headed to the 6th floor (of 9) and had the last room in the hallway. The hallway had this smell to it.. almost a musty mildewy smell. I open the room door and immediately notice that we were given a double queen setup vs. a king setup. The one queen bed was completely pushed up against a wall. It seemed like an odd setup as most hotels do not have beds fully against a wall. I called down to the lobby to request that a king size room was provided as that's what we had booked. I was told that I needed to come back down and I would be swapped out to a king size bed. I was given a king size room on the 5th floor near the elevator. The room now faced the Greyhound bus depot and had a 100% increase of street noise. Sirens to buses to cars went by at all odd hours of the night. The rooms had Dell TV's which I found to be odd and only offered a few channels (about 30 or so). Premium channels were extra and the remote we had appeared to be dying as the range on it wasn't very long. The first night the hotel noise was limited as it was mostly empty. Thursday night, I definitely noticed a increase in traffic as well as people arrived for the weekend. I had breakfast in the lobby on Thursday morning and service was very quick and prompt. What was a little annoying was room service had a different menu than the restaurant lobby offered. I only went down to the lobby as I didn't want to pay the $3.50 delivery fee AND a 20% tip. This was all mandatory and would've made the breakfast above $20. The noise in the hotel seemed to increase each night as we moved into the weekend. Friday and Sat nights were definitely the worst as the hotel hosted a \"20 year high school reunion\" and the drunken folks were waking us up at 2:30am with their loud conversations and ramblings in the hallway. When I brought this to the hotel's attention the next morning; they told me that they \"usually\" try to keep the hotel guests with parties on the 8th floor and couldn't understand how they got down to 5. I understand that hotels can have multiple functions and events at one time; it is how they really make their profits but it was quite annoying to have super-thin walls (I could hear every conversation had) and even just passing hallway conversations from the bed (in the center of the room) with the TV on. The hotel bathroom was also odd as it did not have a traditional door. It was merely a 'sliding' door and you could still hear everything (super thin walls) as well as squeaky. The bathroom was small and the tub was non-existent. I definitely judge hotels by their bathtubs as I think a 'nice' one would have one you'd want to soak in. We had a rental car for a few days and $26/day is pretty steep (valet only) and we always called ahead as it took a bit to get the car. One of the nights we took the car out; the keys weren't located. We looked at all the keys as well as retrieved our ticket stub and finally located them. I'm not sure what happened there. We also had a mark on the rental car bumper (quite a large one) where it seemed the car was rubbed against a wall or another car. It came off thankfully so we didn't complain. Overall, the hotel seemed in a little sketchy part of town (the greyhound depot across the way with bus stops outside and always seemed to have homeless people hanging around.) Also, the hotel boasts of a ipod docking station but my room was broken. The dock was there but the actual 'insert' into the ipod itself was broken off. Also, there is no such 'business' center. There was a hotel pc with a printer downstairs but it was always in use and had a 'auto-reset' function every 15 minutes. It's not what one would consider a business center with faxing abilities, etc. Would not recommend as there are better hotels with views and more convenient locations.", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, great location!\u201d", "Author": "PapaMamaAustralia", "ReviewID": "UR77154080", "Content": "Great place to stay, handy to everything, shopping mall, transit office, trolley lines, etc. Staff were great, really looked after us.", "Date": "August 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Beach", "Title": "\u201cWhat a great find!\u201d", "Author": "Peachlett", "ReviewID": "UR76784626", "Content": "My spouse and I met our friend in San Diego for an overnight prior to her business conference.

Due to situational circumstances I've stayed in 3 different rooms and can speak confidently that my opinions weren't due to 1 good/bad room. PS....Come in December before Christmas....the hotel is empty!!...this helped me get a great rate. PROS: ***1) Location is a few short blocks away from the Gaslamp bars and restaurants ***2) The staff could not be nicer. They're very accomodating and super nice. ***3) Ipod docks in most rooms ***4) Nice sized (37 inch maybe?) LCD TV ***5) Excellent water pressure in shower ***6) Comfortable bed and nice linens (although pillows are a bit on the firm side and a mix of a few soft ones to choose from out of the 4 they give you would've been nice) ***7) Ample closet space, especially for single traveler, including safe and iron/board ***8) Free WiFi (not the fastest but certainly adequate) ***9) Nice common areas (hallways, lobby) ***10) Nice large dresser ***11) All rooms non-smoking CONS: ***1) Noise! I stayed in room 711 and the noise was present but not overwhelming. I got \"upgraded\" to a deluxe king in room 707 which is closer to C street and further from Broadway. The room has many more windows which are pretty bad at keeping noise out. The room is basically on top of the trolley line and both nights in this room I've been woken up around 5:45-6am by the trolley and the garbage trucks at the adjacent building. As almost all rooms face First street, it might be wise to request one closer to Broadway and further from C, and don't get a deluxe king unless you absolutely need the room because the increase in windows = much more noise. ***2) No full length mirror in rooms ***3) Lighting in bathrooms (in shower is fine) is terrible. ex...can't see properly while shaving/doing hair. ***4) Room lighting is poor as it all comes from lamps, no overhead lighting ***5) No fridge ***6) Coffee pot old ***7) No fan in bathroom, only some old wooden boards used as a cheap ceiling ***8) Bathroom doors are sliding doors that don't completely close, which might be uncomfortable is staying with someone else. ***9) Strange.....sometimes the water from sink faucet was only hot no matter what handle you turned on Neutral - ***1) Not sure if a pro or con, but there is a small gym with 3 cardio pieces and a small weight machine....no free weights. ***2) $26/night parking Overall - For the price I paid it was more than worth it and if I was staying longer I would request to get out of this particularly loud room. Nice people, nice location, free internet in my room, and a comfortable bed all made my stay worthwhile.", "Date": "December 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton Alberta", "Title": "\u201cThe Bristol Hotel is one of the little gems in SanDiego and has the friendliest staff around\u201d", "Author": "Patricialynn", "ReviewID": "UR51308923", "Content": "We booked the Bristol over the internet and were a little worried about how it would be. we were very pleasantly surprised.

Housekeeping did a fairly good job in keeping the lobby area, elevator and common areas in a clean manner. Only downfall here was I felt as if the rooms and bathrooms could use a little more cleaning. Upon checking, noticed a bit of soap scum around the sink area (Not like it was a big deal, but still). Room otherwise, was clean and everything seemed to be in accord during check in. Only thing I didnt like was the fact that there were no plastic mats for the baththub. 3.5/5 here Service: No issues here in regard to service put out by concierge. Check in was fast and easy. I know I previously heard horror stories of non-retrieved reservations etc. Booked everything through expedia and upon my arrival, everything was good to go. I was even able to check in early. Staff was more than friendly during check out (think her name was Juana) and placed an extremely small hold on my credit card. Check out again was also seamlessly easily. Had a late flight and reservation desk was very accommodating with providing me with a 2pm checkout. Couldn't ask for better. Hands down, 4/5 here. Location: My opinion! I couldn't have picked a better spot! Gas Lamp District is close by, Horton Plaza is in walking distance, not to mention the Trolley and the wonderful restaurants that lie downtown San Diego. 10 minute walk to the bay area and 10 minute trip to the airport. Hmm, what else. Oh yeah, Little Italy is close by and all major interstates are within minutes. Previous reviews indicated that the area is pretty rough and noisy, but I can honestly that is SO NOT THE CASE. Don't get me wrong, the Greyhound is right across the street but to be honest with you, the noise wasn't that bad at all and my room was adjacent to the Greyhound. I can look out the window and see the buses pulling it but Noise was minimal. The worst you ever heard was the bus backing out and the odd fire truck in the dead still of night. There are a lot of homeless people in the vicinity but most of them lured more around the corner of First & Broadway. I went out many late nights and not once did anyone approach me..so overall I would say..you're pretty safe and its not all that noisy (4/5) Room: Room was of fair size. Amenities were decent. Only thing I didn't like with the room is there really is no fan or ventilation in the bathroom. I kind of liked the idea of the slide in bathroom door. Wireless internet in the room was pretty quick. Only downfall is that after three days you have to get a new password from front desk. Beds were comfy and I can honestly say that I had a good night sleep (even being across from the greyhound). Only other thing I didnt like was the fact that they blasted the AC and the only way to warm the room up was by turning on the heat. Walls are pretty thin so many times you can clearly hear your neighbour speaking and I mean you can hear EVERYTHING lol haha (3.75/4). Other than that no complaints. Overall, this hotel was definitely a different experience as it isn't your typical chain hotel. Hotel staff were very friendly. I like the ipod dock for the rooms. It was actually cool to put my ipod on and listen to some tunes before going to bed. Hotel is still undergoing some renovations so waiting for the elevator takes a while at times. Also, the swipe cards are pretty annoying. I had to get my card reactivated two-three times. But again, this could be attributed to the renovations that are happening. I would probably stay at this hotel again for the above mentioned reasons. Amenity wise the hotel does not offer much such as continental breakfast, swimming pool, etc. Despite the paper thin walls, after a day of having fun and a few nights at the bar..all the noise fades out as you fall asleep.", "Date": "December 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cBed bugs and unfriendly receptionist\u201d", "Author": "dulin38", "ReviewID": "UR50425297", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel for two nights over Thanksgiving weekend with two friends.

After we requested it, we were given a new room, but nothing was said about compensation for our inconvenience. In the evening our physical condition became worse so that we had to cut our planned night out in San Diego short in order to rest in the hotel. We asked for compensation for our inconvenience but came across Scott, a very rude and unfriendly concierge who pretended he couldn't do anything for us until his managers were back on Monday. On Sunday morning we had to call an emergency doctor in order to treat our allergic reactions. This time we were helped by two very friendly ladies at the reception who, surprisingly, had phone numbers of several managers and were able to put us through to one. This lady at least agreed to put our charges on hold until we could speak to the general manger about compensation on Monday. In the end he waived the accommodation charges, but said they couldn't cover for the medical bills (more than 600$ in total).

Gorgeous and stylish lobby with the glaring exception of an inexpensive desk with a computer and printer, and duct tape against the walls. * No breakfast. There is a restaurant that people were raving about, but nothing complimentary. Management did put out a fruit basket, so kudos for the attempt. There isn't really a place to put a breakfast bar, but a coupon toward the restaurant breakfast would be great. * Scenery. Or, lack thereof. It's downtown; I didn't really expect any. Pros: * Beautiful mix of the old and new. Red, black, and white, but they completely made it work! Very stylish deocr in both the lobby and the rooms. The marble floor is stunning, and the furniture chosen to complement it. The designer was worth whatever he charged. * Excellent staff! We really felt like they operated as a family.

There are employed individuals who will give you the time of day and who are so polite and respectful in their etiquette. Room service was timely and professional and respected your privacy. Food was always at its expected temperature, and the service was polite to stand outside my door to wait for the bill, therefore respecting my privacy. The front desk was very helpful. Since my arrival was at midnight, i took a taxi which cost about $12. But for my return to the airport I took public transportation. It was easy and convenient. From this hotel, ALL public transportation is easy and convenient. And, the office for public transportation is practically next door. You can get any kind of pass and schedule. Bristol was nice to hold my luggage on the last day after I checked out but still had time to explore San D. before having to go to the airport. As for the on site restaurant Dixie's, that is convenient. I had the lavosh pizza. It's served on a cracker, not cracker-like crust. All the ingrediants were prepared well, and they all went well together. This I had in the bar area. Very wonderful bar tender!!! For breakfast, which was what i had for room service, I liked best to just get the basic breakfast with eggs to order, toast, bacon, and fruit instead of potatoes. The San Diego omelet would have been good if they would stick to the ingrediants listed on the menu, but instead they also add green bells and red onion and a lot of both that of course steal the show. They are both raw and strong. \"The Currant\" is a great place to eat out for breakfast and just across the street. There is a light in the shower! The air system was a bit on the cooler side. The vent was always blowing, so when the unit did not sense to turn on the vents would just blow cool air until the the sensor sensed that it needed to kick on the heat. I got used to it and planned accordingly. There were two little windows that opened to the outdoors. I like being able to open a window. There are few TV channels and nothing ever on. I basically did not use the TV and did not pay for any movies. I used the dry cleaning service which was timely and fine, but my slacks were not as smooth and freshly cleaned as i'm used to...The hotel really has all the great ammenities and charm and style that one would want out of an urban stay, but not quite plush. It's nice and the bed is VERY comfortable. And the robe and towels are nice. But it's not luxurious. I would stay at this hotel again. Mind all though, I only stayed here because I found an $85/night deal online. $150 a night, i don't know about that. But that's MY budget.

We chose the hotel because it had some of the best reviews within the Gas Light district, for the price range we were looking for, and for the modern style we wanted. Overall I thought that the experience there was fantastic, and I would recommend it to friends and family. They had attentive and friendly service, clean rooms, and a simple modern feel to the decor. We got a king deluxe room, and the prices then were $229/night. (With the bad economy, they are now $159). It was in a great location. Just around the corner was the mall, where we grabbed a coffee every morning, and only a few blocks up was the main drag, where all the restaurants, and night life was. So, we were relaxed when having an extra drink. Here's some things to think about.. 1) We were on the 7th floor, and although not distracting or overwhelming, we could still hear the traffic below. So, try to get a room as high as you can. 2) There is NO full length mirror in your room/bathroom, and the large 1/2 length mirror does not have a light over/around it. So, when getting ready for a romantic night out, I had to go out to the hallway by the elevators to see what my outfit looked like. And, I had to use the smaller bathroom mirror to put make-up on and fix my hair. This meant that my boyfriend and I had to share the bathroom anytime we were getting ready to go out. 3) Small bathroom. There's a bunch of open space between the bed and the dresser/tv, and the bed and the surrounding walls, but the bathroom was scaled down to accomodate the \"open\" feel of the main room. 4) Parking isn't free to guests. This is normal for San Diego (and most other cities, these days). We knew ahead of time... which, you may already know, too. But, keep that in mind when choosing a hotel. The Bristol charged $24/night, which is an average price. Some hotels charge more - so be aware of that. I would stay there again, for sure.

Nice lobby area, concierge is always on duty even when we were rerturning at 2am or 3am. Very close to the airport. You can take a bus or a cab for $6 one way. The walk is probably 1/2 hour. We booked the cheapest room through Hotels.com. Standard king size room for around $140 a night. Rooms - very nice and modern. Very clean and spacious. Enough space to hang clothes and lots of shelves to store your items. Shower is great. They also provide all the high quality shampoos and soaps as well as robes. Lots of towels. Bathroom is very clean and spacious. Bed is very comfortable and soft. We had a king and it was huge. Nice flat screen TV with lots of channels. They have a clock radio and advertise it to have an MP3 docking station. I didn't find any docking station but the radio does have a CD player. Great quality full size iron and a hair dryer. Air conditioning worked great. It's a little tricky to turn it on. All you have to do is to bring the handle completely down and it will start making noise - letting out air. After 10-15 minutes it cools down really nicely. Other little thing that might be a little tricky is a door handle that opens your room. It opens up instead of usual down. We had 2 key cards and on the third day they stopped working. I brought them down to concierge and they gave us new ones, explaining that if you put those cards with cell phone, credit cards or any metalic material, the key cards get demagnitized. They appologized numerous times for the inconvenience. Hotel located very central on 1st ave. and is short walking distance to 4th, 5th and 6th avenues of the Gaslamp district where all the action is at night. Hotel is located near Greyhound bus terminal that works 24 hrs and you might hear at night some noise due to that. It didn't bother me at all but my wife mentioned that she woke up few times early in the morning because of that. But nothing major. The hotel provides a free internet in the lobby. They have 1 computer that you can use any time of day or night. If you are renting a car, don't expect much help from the help desk. They called around to find us best deal and offered us \"the cheapest and most available\" rate of $50 before taxes. My wife and I went online and found a great deal with Fox Rental for $22 a day. Elevators at the hotel are actually pretty slow. At one point we waited for 10 minutes for the elevator to come. We ended up taking stairs. But on average it was fine. Many times it was right there with no wait. First day when going down to Lobby level, our elevator dropped to Parking level even though we pressed L. And I mean dropped. The free fall happened from level L to level P. Nothing major, just one floor. We just pressed L and went back up. The doors didn't open automatically, so we pressed Doors Open button and everything was fine. We mentioned it to front desk and they took care of it. We parked our car at the hotel for $22 a night. You have unlimitted access to your car and valet parking parks it for you and brings it back when needed. We tried to park at a nearby parking for $10 a night but you had to be there at 6am or 7am the latest to pick it up. Otherwise, they charge additional $6 an hour after that. I wasn't going to wake up that early on my vacation. Besides, those parkings do not have unlimitted access to your car and will charge every time you leave and then enter back again.

Desk staff were friendly and helpful overall. I was able to use a computer in the lobby (free of charge) to print up my airline ticket, and to check e-mail. There was an inroom safe, free of charge. The hotel is well-located (downtown); I did a lot of walking by myself in the area, including in the evening, and had no problems. San Diego's a big city, with its share of street people and other assorted characters, but I never felt unsafe walking from the hotel to the old train station (check it out; it's gorgeous), to Horton Plaza (2 blocks away), or to the Pier shopping area. Gaslamp District is very close also. An Airport Flyer bus stops less than a block from the hotel, at a cost of $2.25 (versus about $15.00 and a wild trip from the airport with an angry cab driver); I recommend taking the bus to/from the airport, if you can. I also recommend asking for a room below the 8th floor. The 9th floor is an uncarpeted ballroom. On two weekend nights when I was there (in my 8th floor room), there were events which could be heard through the ceiling (music, furniture being dragged across the floor), up to and after midnight. Quieted down about 1:00 a.m. Other than that, no problems with noise. Guest rooms are carpeted, so you should be okay on a lower floor. On the whole, I would definitely return to the Bristol.

The first night the hotel checked a party into our room at approxiamtely 10:30 p.m. We had gone to sleep at 9:00 p.m. seeing as though the Bar Exam was the most important test of our lives only to be woken up an hour and half later by people trying to enter the room.

I called down to the front desk demanding they stop checking different people into our room, explained my frustration that I needed sleep before the first day of the Bar Exam and could not get it because the hotel kept checking people into our room, and I was informed that I WAS NOT CHECKED IN AND NOT IN THE SYSTEM!! The guy at the desk said that he would make a note not to check anyone else in and that I would need to check in again in the morning or bring proof that I was checked in... AND I DID!

My husband and I live in San Diego, and we stayed at this hotel for his 30th High School reunion to spend more time with his classmates. It had a great banquent room on the 9th floor, in which the roof opened up above the dance floor which was really nice. Great seeing the stars while dancing. The positives. 1) Clever decorations, kinda of Art Deco. Flowers in vases at every corner. 2) Very comfortable bed. 3) Nice mini bar. 4) Close to the happening spots in Downtown. Great price for the location. 5) Great breakfast food in their restaurant. We ate with 6 people and everyone enjoyed their breakfast. 6) Front desk gave us a room away from the bus station so we had a good nights sleep. 7) Nice banquet room. 8) Nice bar to meet up with friends. 9) Very nice lobby with lots of very comfortable attractive furniture. The negatives. 1) Dark lighting in the room 2) Therefore bathroom needs a make-up mirror. 3) Not much storage space for clothing for 2 people if you are going to stay awhile. Our room had 3 little drawers. 4) No drawers in the bathroom to store toiletries. 5) Not a safe location to walk around in at late at night, take a taxi if you want to go somewhere. If you are walking in a large group you will be okay. Just don't go out alone at night. 6) The banquet room could use some noise absorbing carpet or something, as it got very loud in the room with the sound ricocheting off the tile floors, the walls and windows.

The whole town was packed due to the convergence of NCAA, the Baseball Classic and two large conventions, not to mention the St. Patrick's Day festivities. We've stayed at this hotel before and were pleased to get a $149 rate since the town was almost booked up. This is a small boutique hotel not far from Horton Plaza Mall (four blocks) and the Gaslamp quarter (six blocks). It isn't in a scenic area but it is clean and safe. Yes, there is a Greyhound station next door and downtown tends to be noisy. This is a somewhat artsy hotel, with bright yellow paint in the halls that fades upwards to an orange. Paired with the blue carpet, is has a Warhol/Lichtenstein effect. Lots of pop art is the hallways completes the decor. It has a small bright lobby with overstuffed red and blue chairs. The rooms are large and have minimal art deco furniture with very comfortable beds. The windows open, which is rare in a hotel, but the city noise makes it an almost moot choice. The linens are bright red and orange. There are two robes in the closet and the bathroom is larger than average, with great water pressure and temperature. The toilets look brand new and somewhat \"gadgety\". I loved the soap and shampoo -a vanilla/almond scent. The bath has a pocket door with a small pull to use (just run your finger over it and it pops out), the door may be heavy but it easy to use once you get the hang of it - it saves lots of room in the bath. I thought it was weird that there was no safety latch on the door to the hallway, just a regular lock. Free Internet access was available in all rooms, and there is also a free computer in the lobby to use. The Daisy Cafe is small and the food just OK, nothing special, but good for a quick breakfast or lunch. The front desk staff could definitly use some customer service training - not very friendly or helpful, or even apologetic when they didn't have an answer. The phones seemed busy, so they may have been understaffed. All in all, it was a great deal since the Omni and Marriott were over $300 per night. The trolley stops at the corner and taxis to the airport are less than $10. It is a good fifteen minute walk to the convention center or Petco Park, but through a safe part of town.
