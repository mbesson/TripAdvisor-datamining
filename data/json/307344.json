{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Jail City I was booked into this hotel for 3 nights but left after the first night. I booked the largest room available but was given the smallest. The bathroom was like an airplane bathroom. I asked to be given something bigger and was told by the unfriendly staff that hotel was booked out.The room was stuffy, noisy and tiny. The ice machine and vending machine was right next to my room. The wifi did not work. In the middle of my sleepless night I went downstairs to use the internet to book a different hotel. After I booked another hotel I told them I would be leaving in the morning. Then they looked in their books and told me they did actually have a bigger room. By then I felt that no way did I want to waste my last 3 days in Tokyo in such a dark, airless, cramped and unfriendly space.The staff did speak excellent English. This hotel would be fine if you just needed a place to crash, but if you are on vacation it's a bit too much like a jail cell.", "Date": "Mar 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR979799459", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Encinitan"}, {"Content": "A simple and smail pleasure. FOR A BUDGET BUSINESS TRAVELLER Over 8 years I stayed at the JAL City Yotsuya on at least two occassions per year of at least one week's duration each. Some years I was there four times. Our company has now entered into a commercial arrangement with another hotel group and so we no longer stay there. For those who want a well located hotel business hotel at a reasonable pice the JAL City can certainly meet your needs. Free High speed internet acess in the room. Rooms are pretty small with short doors. I would suggest a high floor. Breakfast is good and there are no health facilities. The staff is friendly and though english is understood it is not their forte. It is very close to Shinjuku and a very short walk to Yotsuya sanchome subway station. (Narita express to Tokyo station then Maranouchi line to Yotsuya san chome).
