We were greeted by crack heads and homeless people in the lobby and people up to no good outside on the streets. I know you are probably saying why didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you just leave!?! Well, it was late after the football game and we had been traveling all day and just needed to get a few hours rest before getting back on the road so we decided to stay. Plus, we had already pre-paid through Priceline.com (which is a website I use for all my travel until now). I have a reservation to stay here again in March for Ultra that I also booked through Priceline.com which I will be cancelling now after this experience. If, you plan on staying at this hotel make sure to bring \u00e2\u20ac\u0153protection\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or 5 bodyguards. There was what looked like to be blood on the walls and in the bathroom next to the toilet like a vein had squirted out blood from a heroin addicts arm. The shower was a 2 foot by 2 foot hole in the floor in front of the toilet that made you feel more disgusting after a shower. The bathroom had 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of ants that were traveling from the shower around the toilet, up the walls, in and out of the AC unit. After a few hours of not sleeping because the bed was only big enough to sleep a small dog. We had enough and decided it was time to get on the road earlier than we had planned because the hotel was so bad. But before we could go we had to fight off huge ants as they had taken over my purse in the middle of the night. We dumped my purse out on the bed and ants flew out of every inch of my purse. I know you are probably thinking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ants\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that would be the least of my worries after everything else you have been saying but really these were crazy huge ants with wings! After killing as many as we could on the floor we grabbed my purse to leave but then realized that the little ants from the toilet were coming and attacking the huge ant carcasses on the floor. They were sawing apart the bigger ants and carrying them away in what looked a factory line. That was probably the sickest thing ever and it made you feel like they are all over you, crawling in your ears and in your hair! As we were checking out I had mentioned to the lady at the front desk what we thought and she was not surprised at all. That confirmed with me right then that this was normal for her and that we would not be coming back. I hope that Priceline.com takes this off of their list and allows me to get my $300 refund for Ultra\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 they can keep my $60 for my horrible night but I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do that again in March. As we were leaving we had to cross through yellow crime scene tape blocking off the Night Club which is down the street from the hotel.

Now onto to the room. If being roommates with mice and mold doesnt bother you than the room should be just fine. They are small, dirty and smell. If you look at the ceiling and walls you will quickly discover mold and water damage and leakage coming through. Gross is the only word to describe the rooms. The beds are old and just as filthy and you can bet your bottom dollar you will be spending the night with bed bugs. Not to mention being extremely uncomfortable. The bathrooms are just as out dated and neglected. I have no good things to say about the rooms in this hotel. Being in Miami the hotel has an alright location just minutes away from south beach and etc. HOWEVER! beware that it is not in the greatest area of Miami. All in all I do not recommend this hotel to anyone. Its old, dirty and neglected. The building is mold infested and really out dated. You will not enjoy any part of this hotel or your time in Miami if you are staying at the Miami Sun Hotel. I would also like to mention this is my first review I have ever written about a hotel, it ruined my vacation so much that I do not want anyone else wasting their time or money here.

Don't expect much, but the bed was fine, the a/c worked well and it was fairly quiet. Wi-fi worked perfectly in my third floor room. The front desk staff was exceptionally friendly and went out of their way to give advice on attractions and transportation. When you arrive it does have the slight appearance of a transient hotel but once settled in, that impression went away. It is a darker, quieter area of downtown, but is easily accessible to restaurants, shops and on close to major public transit routes. The only huge complaint I have is that the shower was either scalding hot or cold, making for a challenging shower.

If you are this hard up for cheap lodging you should drive to a better area and just sleep in your car. No kidding. I am absolutely AMAZED that this place is still in business and not shut down by the health or police department. When you enter your room(if you make it that far) you WILL stop dead in your tracks and be completely aghast. It's like something out of a horror film - so incredibly filthy, stinking, and run down that you will quite literally marvel at it's decrepitude. I've stayed in some nasty hotels all over the world and I cannot believe that this place is even in the United States. This place should be demolished so thoroughly that the ground beneath it could be plowed, and the front desk staff (such as it is) should be publicly flogged for their complete rudeness and apathy. If you set out to INTENTIONALLY make the filthiest, nastiest crackhouse possible you could not make a worse place. It is nothing short of surreal, particularly when darkness falls. Hotel and local attractions include hordes of homeless people just sort of hanging out around the entrance, drunken people openly urinating not only in the streets but right in the stairwells of the hotel, a deep pungent smell of vomit in the carpets so old that the regurgitants that made it are probably all dead by now, and a rude and disinterested staff that would put a flophouse in a third-world country to shame. Shopping/services would include a wide variety of prostitutes readily available in both the local area and hotel proper, illegal drugs of every description being sold right in the hotel lobby and right out front, and stolen merchandise is also easily obtained from many of the unsavory creatures wandering around. If you cancel you will not get your money back, and if you book through Priceline here is what will happen: Priceline will tell you that the refund authorization has to come from the hotel. The hotel will very rudely tell you that it has to come from Priceline. So kiss your money goodbye. Please take my advice and do not even begin to consider staying at this apocalyptically awful place.

I will try to attach some pictures of the room. I certainly cannot recommend this hotel, although for single guys or maybe groups of people who don't have much money, this place is better than sleeping in the gutter. I certainly would not recommend this for couples or single females unless you have a compelling need to be in this part of town and your other option is sleeping on the street. I paid $80 in Feb 2009 on short notice, but I have seen other posts with lower numbers (maybe it is seasonal?). The other option for cheap hotel in this area is the Roadway Inn, which has bigger rooms, but cost more and is noisier and crappier than the Miami Sun. Do NOT stay in the Barlington or Spanish River hotels. First the good stuff: 1) There were low levels of allergens, perhaps because the floors throughout the entire building tile instead of carpet. 2) The location is good. It is close to American Airlines Arena, Bayside Mall, and many of the government buildings and courthouse buildings. 3) There is a small diner next door, which is convenient. The guy at the counter was nice, although he did not know was decaffeinated coffee was. The diner is basically crappy but the prices are reasonable and it is open for breakfast. 4) The people at the desk were helpful with directions. 5) You can get to the hotel using Metrorail for $2 from any of these points: The Miami Amtrak station, the Miami Airport (via bus#42 to Amtrak then walk a few blocks), Ft Lauderdale airport (via Tri-rail, which is an additional $4 and connects to Metrorail). See my notes at the bottom for details. And now the not so good 1) There are no amenities: a) no alarm clock b) no hair dryer, iron, ironing board, coffee maker, microwave c) There were two bars of soap, but they were very tiny, even by hotel standards. 2) There were only a couple of the very cheap, wire hangars that were too weak to hold my wool coat (there was a cold spell in the place where I started my trip) 3) There were only 2 towels and they were small, very thin, and one had dark grey spots. There are no hand towels, wash cloths, or floor mat for the bathroom 4) There was barely any hot water on Friday morning at around 7:00 am, although I had decent hot water on Sunday. 5) There was a lot of noise outside the hotel on Friday night--mostly loud cars, car alarms, and some people talking. The single-pain windows and perhaps openings around the air conditioner offered very poor sound insulation. Surprisingly, Saturday night was pretty quiet except for some distant white noise from cars. 6) There is no weather stripping or pad around the door frame, so when guests leave at 4:00 am to catch a plane, they will probably slam the door, which echoes in the tile hallway and enters the 3/4\" crack under the room door. 7) There was a new sink in my room, but no counter. 8) There was no shampoo, lotion, conditioner, coffee, tea or other such things 9) The procedures for booking the room were very odd. I had to go to themiamisunhotel.com, print a reservation form, and fax it to them with a Xerox of my driver's license and credit card (I noticed other reviews that said the same thing). 10) My room was very small, and there was \"old grime\" in some areas of the bathroom and many layers of sloppy paint that create nooks for dust and germs. There wasn't much \"fresh grime.\" 11) There were no \"do not disturb\" signs 12) The light bulb in the lamp didn't work 13) There was a mix of guests, and only a couple appeared to be people that I didn't want in the next room. There was one normal-looking family that spoke Spanish (they were OK), one guy that I thought was homeless (I'm not sure if he was a guest or just talking to somebody in the lobby), a career party girl with a big mouth, and a baggy-panted punk. 14) The blanket was really thin and cheap, but I guess there isn't much of a need for warm blankets. I did not try the heat or AC, but there was a window air conditioner (maybe the heater was in the AC unit??). 15) The curtain did not block the light, so when the sun rises, your room will be bright (and this might make it difficult to sleep late) 16) The key is a single, metal key that any moron could duplicate. There is also a 5$ key deposit that is returned at checkout. == METRORAIL directions: From Amtrak station (which is near Miami Airport): A) If you are INSIDE the Amtrak station in Miami, exit through the main double doors and turn right. B) Walk down the block past the electric transformers that occupy almost a full city block. This is mostly an industrial area, but there are a couple houses on theleft. C) Go about 3 blocks until you see the overhead train track (it is about 2 stories above ground on stilts), D) Turn right, go one block to the train station, but PAY ATTENTION!. E) If you are going to the hotel, you want to get on the **Metrorail** buy going up TWO FLIGHTS of escalators (or elevator) and take it SOUTHBOUND. Be sure to listen to all announcements to be sure that you are going south to get to the hotel. There is a different train system that connects at the same spot, so stay awake. F) Exit the Metrorail at Government Center (101 NW 1st Street) and walk toward the big courthouse buildings to get to the hotel). Bring a map printed from maps.yahoo.com. FROM MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT: 1) You have two options for getting from the airport to the Metrorail. A) Take bus #42 which goes to the front door of the Amtrak station. B) take a cab. 2) Follow the directions above to get from Amtrak to the hotel FROM FT. LAUDERDALE AIRPORT. A) take the Tri-rail from the airport (I don't know exactly where it is, ask around--my friend took it from Ft. Lauderdale). It costs around $4. B) You will arrive at the transfer point to Metrorail.

We are low budget travelers with low expectations. However, the Miami Sun is a place like no other. If you are looking for an experience you will find it here. We had some hesitations about this motel. It looked really run down from the outside. However the staff at the front desk were genuinely friendly and helpful so we figured it couldn't be that bad. We paid about US$63. The elevator is a bit frightening, but we didn't have any serious problems. The room is basic. Smelled kind of funny, paper thin towels, but a room. As said in another review, 'better than sleeping on a park bench.\" TV and a/c worked fine. There is a secure pay parking lot across the street which was nice. We think we were on a floor all to ourselves because we didn't hear any noise from other rooms all night (we may have been put there for reasons explained below). The other hotel guests appeared all normal during the day, however, at night the freaks not only came out, but came into the Miami Sun! The hotel is close to a really shady area of town so we expected to have see some weirdos around the area. We did not expect to see people high out of their minds, peeing in the stairwell, and drug deals going on in the hotel! We like to think that we are open minded folks and we don't really care what others do, but there were some serious freaks staying at the Miami Sun that night.. We decided to lock everything important in the car and slept in our sleeping bags on the bed. (Yes we were that grossed out). I guess if you plan to be in by 7 pm and not leave your room until morning, the Miami Sun would be ok. (Bring your sleeping bags!) Otherwise beware and be careful. This end or Miami really changes at night. The Miami Sun could really improve by just being a bit more selective about their customers. Crappy rooms are fine, but I don't like being scared when walking through the lobby. On the otherhand it gave me a story to tell.", "Date": "May 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Pete, Florida", "Title": "\u201cIf you're poor or cheap it's not that bad\u201d", "Author": "sv_makai", "ReviewID": "UR13689073", "Content": "We couldn't figure out why the building hadn't been condemned.
