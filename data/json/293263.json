In fact, it is a certain distance away but you can easily get there from the airport \u2013 take bus No.128, which stops near terminal A, get off at Holl\u00e4nderstr./Aroser Allee, and you will see the hotel right across the road. The bus ride takes 15 minutes, and the bus comes every ten minutes on average. My room was spacious, with a desk, a big wardrobe, a coffee table, and a small outdated Gr\u00fcndig TV with only German channels available. The bathroom with a shower was very clean. The hotel offers free wi-fi access, which is not so common in German hotels (don\u2019t forget to get a password at the reception). Breakfast was standard but quite good quality. If you don\u2019t feel like paying 8 euros for it, there is a kitchenette in the room, which can be fully equipped at your request, and the LIDL supermarket just a couple of minutes\u2019 walk away (which works until 8:00 p.m.) All things considered, I would give the hotel 3 stars, and I think it is OK for a short stay and if you have to be close to the airport. However, if you like peace and quiet, think twice before you book a room there as your sleep might be disturbed by the planes landing and taking off at the nearby airport virtually every 5 minutes.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albany, NY", "Title": "\u201cIt was a bit of a disappointment\u201d", "Author": "Bernie_Von", "ReviewID": "UR112261607", "Content": "I consider this hotel an average 2 star hotel Too far from the airport.

Relatively spartan rooms for the price and a noisy courtyard restaurant. Bathroom was clean, but not up to par.

Breakfast was extremely good with loads of choices from fruits to hot buffet. Very helpful staff. There was only one thing i was dissatisfied with - no aircondition, which can be very annoying during hot nights, open window can hardly help. A big plus for a kitchenette, where you got microwave, fridge, cooker, pans etc :) So you can enjoy even long stay and dont have to worry about diner late at night ;) To sum up I would love to stay there again if happens to me to visit Berlin again.

I paid about 64 Euros per night for a good-sized room with two twin beds, and found it to be an excellent value The hotel is located on the #128 bus line, which runs between the Osloer Strasse U-Bahn station and Tegel airport, with 24-hour service of 10-15 minute frequency.

I spent 2 nights at this hotel and I found the staff to be helpful and friendly. You can take a bus number 128 from just 50m outside the hotel and that gets you to Kurt-Schumacher U-Bahn station. From there on, its only a 12-14 min train ride to Freidrich Strasse (one of the centers of Berlin Mitte). The buses run every 10 min till 9pm I guess and after that it is every 20 min. Overall, this hotel is a good place. This place is also close to the Tegel Airport in Berlin. A tip: This hotel has a Berlin Package (2 nights, double room + breakfast) for 66 euros a night. This is a good price. Check the hotel webpage for more details. Also, do not forget to get the Berlin city card (14 odd euros for 48 hrs).

We therefore wanted something very close by so we could easily get to the airport. One thing that this hotel falsely claims is that is is 2 KM away from the airport. That might be a radial distance (through grass and fields). But if you are a normal person taking a car, taxi or bus - the route from the airport to the hotel will take abour 15-20 minutes. It is not too bad - as long as you are aware of this. The bus stop is at the corner of the street only a few yards from the hotel. The rooms of the hotel are adequate. They are large, the beds are comfortable, the bathroom is clean. Breakfast is also included and is really nice - they've got a huge assortment of food which includes hot and cold breakfas items.
