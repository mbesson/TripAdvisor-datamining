This may in part be due to the fact that the hotel appears to be an amalgamation of at least three buildings knocked into one. I can only comment on our experience. Firstly, the room was at the top up six flights of stairs. I cannot see that anyone has mentioned that the lift only goes as far as the 1st floor, so I wouldn't wish our room on anyone unfit! However, the room itself was fine although building work is going on at this level and both our windows had scaffolding and plastic sheeting outside so not much of a view, but it was very quiet [we were at the back of the hotel, and not much actual work was taking place while we were there, mainly saturday & sunday]. The room was right under the roof with beams and I would think it could get rather hot in summer but the weather was mainly on the cool side whilst we were there so that wasn't a problem. I know from staying in another hotel in Venice a couple of years ago that it can be hot in May and some other reviewers have complained that the air-con did not work. The website states that the hotel has air con \" in the summer \" so when does summer start? [ As hardy Brits accustomed to a cool climate walking around in t shirts we were amused to see the locals and southern Europeans walking around in body warmers and thick coats]. Anyway, for us in cool April weather the room was comfortable, not at all pokey, it was clean, did not smell, and the bathroom was a good size with bath, shower and hot water! The double bed was comfortable and the room was extremely quiet at night so we slept very well. But the stairs did cause us to huff and puff by the time we got to the top! The hotel decor is a bit worn in places, but we were not there to assess the furnishings. We just wanted a comfotable base to explore Venice with a good location and that's what we got. As to other reviewers regative remarks: We found the reception staff [all male as others have observed] to be nothing but courteous and friendly - but then we had nothing to complain about. There were no nasty smells either in our room or common areas. I'm not a great breakfast person but it was the usual continental buffet affair with waitress service for tea/coffee etc. The tv was tiny with only BBC world news and CNN in English but who goes to Venice to watch tv? [My kids would, but we didn't take them!] Would we say there again? I think I shall explore apartments another time. In case we end up down that alley! Finally we were stung by a tourist tax as we checked out - 4 euros each per night. This could add up for a family - not sure if this applies to children as well, also since we booked our holday as an inclusive package why we had to pay it, I am checking on that.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWhat a View\u201d", "Author": "delltone", "ReviewID": "UR128481361", "Content": "Located right next to the iconic Rialto Bridge and overlooking the Grand Canal, our room at The Rialto Hotel was richly decorated in the ornate Venitian style, and the views from our windows were to die for.

We had such an amazing time then, that we decided to come back and celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary here too. Apart from the unfortunate building work that was taking place on the roof terrace this year, everything was exactly the same as we remembered it. Here are some comments: Location: Perfect - you really couldn't ask for any better! There are several vaperetto stops outside the hotel (and a little bit futher down the canal). You can get here from Venice Marco Polo airport very easily by buying a return ticket on the ATVO Airport Express Bus, which takes you non-stop from the airport to Pizalle Roma (the main boat terminal for vaparettos into Venice). The cost is a very reasonable 9 euros for a return ticket which is valid for 7 days. To get to the Hotel from Pizalle Roma, I recommend you take the boat no.2 (red line) towards San Zaccharia (San Marco) - this is a faster service than the no.1 boat, however the 2 may be quite crowded, so taking the no1 maybe better if you have lots of luggage (the no.1 starts from Pizalle Roma). If you are staying in Venice for a few days, I would recommend getting a travelcard for 2, 3, 5 or 7 days. These give you unlimited travel on all vaparettos, and all you have to do is touch your card to the reader before getting on the boat (like an Oyster card reader). The cost for a 3-day card is 37 euros. From the Rialto stops you can get anywhere around the canals/lagoons, but I recommend you study a map of the boat lines first. Once you know where you're going, it's very easy to hop and hop off. You can also walk to lots of places from the Hotel Rialto - St Marks square is about a 5-10min walk away, and there a lots of lovely restaurants and bars nearby. There is a cheap self-service restaurant a couple of doors down from the hotel that does very good meals, pizzas slices and ice cream, definitely worth a look! Hotel Service and Rooms: Just like 2 years ago, the hotel staff could not do more for us. They were very polite and friendly, and spoke perfect english. We were surprised to find a bottle of Proseco waiting in our room once we'd arrived, a very welcome treat! The room was clean, tidy and a decent size (we did pay an extra 150 euros for a canal view room). Bathroom and Shower worked fine and hot water was in plentiful supply. One thing I would point out is that the noise from the canal can get quite irritating if you're a light sleeper, but the view and the atmosphere and ability to people watch overrided this. You may want to consider this when booking a room though. Breakfast was very good! I cannot understand some of the other reviews on here which say breakfast was poor! The selection is very good - cold meats, mini omlettes, croissants, pain au chocolats, fruit, youghurt, fresh juice, and even champagne! You could order extra for a small price, but there's no need. We indulged every morning! Be careful, we were stung with a 12 euro tourist tax at the end of our stay. I would recommend you calrify this with the hotel when you check in, so its not a nasty shock at the end of your stay. All in all, this is great \"4\" star hotel in a great location. The service and staff are very professional and courteous, the rooms are clean, comfortable and resonably priced, but be careful about the noise from the canal at night, and the tourist tax.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cEasy to find location but very busy\u201d", "Author": "UK-Based-Explorer", "ReviewID": "UR126736635", "Content": "It is a picture perfect location at a cost that is easy to find and can not be faulted but as it has been pointed out the tourist traffic makes it a very busy and somewhat noisy site for a hotel, which slightly off sets the great location and amazing view.

We followed the staff member in disbelief as he led us to a door in the middle of the alleyway, where peoples rubbish was strewn. We then had to climb three flights of stairs to our room, which offered no consolation whatsoever. The room itself was dark, dingy, old, tatty and in desperate need of a refurbishment. We could not believe our eyes and our hearts sunk. There were worn furnishings, discoloured carpets, stained lampshades and the shower barely functioned. We later went out for the afternoon and returned to find ants crawling around by our toothbrushes and toiletries, as well as being on the floor. I noted that on our paperwork a sea view had been requested, our view from the room could not have been further from a sea view and when this was questioned, reception virtually laughed and told us that we got what we had paid for. Regardless of its nasty state, we slept there that night but I woke up several times, worried about the security risk, being in this building down the alleyway with no telephone or reception at hand. The next morning, we hoped that breakfast could be our saviour, but not surprisingly, it was also a huge disappointment. The small dining area was very overcrowded, and the food that was on offer was shocking. There were a few stale buns, some wilted ham, tinned fruit, processed orange juice and two jars of cereal. There was of course, hot food available such as toast, eggs, bacon etc, though this was all at an extra charge, which we had not budgeted for as we had been informed that a continental breakfast was included. The photos on the hotel website must have been taken years ago or have been drastically enhanced. If you are going to book, make sure you ask which part of the hotel you will be in.

In fact the photos are misleading. When I checked in, the man that took my bag up to my room looked like he hated his job. When he opened the door to my room, my heart sank. I had booked a Classic double room with Rialto bridge view. I got the view from a small window and I was taller than the window...if I sat down in a chair I could see the bridge. I did get a fantastic picture when I leaned out the window...but, you can also get fantastic pictures of the bridge by standing in front of the hotel or riding the water bus.

I was polite with my enquiry but, the man assisting me was very rude and condescending, in fact, I have another word to describe him. He said, \"Well WHAT were you expecting for a standard room?!!!\" \"Tell me!\" Come on Hotel Rialto you don't talk to your guests like that. I have been to Europe and stayed in many different types of accommodation so I am not naive. They got someone to show me another room and the man showing the room was just as bad as the man that carried my bag to my room. I decided to stay in the room that I had. My room was really far up in some corner...room 306. On my last night, I decided to put the card out on the door for room service for the next morning. I had put it out before the cut off time (in fact early), but no one had bothered to come by.

It was also easy to find your way back to the hotel when you get lost as there are signs frequently for Ponte di Rialto. We also ate at the restaurant downstairs where I had my worst meal of our honeymoon.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houghton", "Title": "\u201cExpensive Accomodations but Great Location\u201d", "Author": "Jks784", "ReviewID": "UR121709349", "Content": "Stayed here in the spring of 2010 for a weekend. The room was booked months in advance for a \"junior suite w/canal view\" prepaid of course so no refunds if something were to change. The location was wonderful, right by the water taxi stop and the bridge. BUT our first night we were in the room that over looked the taxi stop. Which a boat is there every 15 mins or so and when the people were getting off they could practically walk in our room. We requested another room and ended up in some back corridor, had to climb some steep steps (no railing and my aunt walks with a cane and we weren't told this). The room had a small window that if you climbed up and hung outside you could look down at the steps of the Rialto. Breaking your neck while hanging out the window would get you a great view of the Grand Canal. So again, requested a new room (paid a lot of money so figured we should ask since the view we were thinking of didn't include hanging out a window, which we could only do one at a time) and finally got the best room which was overlooking the canal, had doors you could open and was high enough and just to the right of the taxi stop. Room was good sized, bathroom was decent, didn't have to walk miles to get to the room. Of course it was the last night we were there. The staff at the front desk were men so they were rude and condescending to us. One in particular. There were 3 of us women so not sure what his problem towards us was. The breakfast was okay. Like most italian hotels I've stayed at you have to eat early since towards the end pickings are slim at times. I don't think it was worth the money for what was charged. Basically it was the location and if lucky the view of the bridge from your room. The route to St. Marks Square was confusing and easy to get confused but close to the hotel. Anything close to tourist attractions seems to be very pricey for food. We did get a free trip to a glass factory on Murano where we must have looked like poor relations since the owner didn't push us to buy. Probably figured we spent all our money paying for the high priced hotel! Had a very expensive ride to the airport in the morning. Oh, and if taking a gondola ride don't take the one right out front the hotel. I know they basically all charge the same but it was 100 euros and I felt like we were in the gondola for all of 15 mins. I'd say find somewhere not in the main tourist sections unless there is something you'd really want to see. We found taking the water taxis around you could get some great photos if you could get a seat or stand by the railing. Another FYI on the water taxis.....they pack the people on! Be careful getting from the platform (which sometimes is moving) to the boat which is also moving.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Constanta, Romania", "Title": "\u201cA dissapointing place to stay in Venice\u201d", "Author": "George_Gx", "ReviewID": "UR121618990", "Content": "We arrived there in our honey moon coming from an excellent hotel in Rome and my expectations were quite high considering the price we've paid for the room.

The many sights and sounds were hard to avoid, although when you closed the windows and shutters, the room became completely soundproof. Room was airconditioned which made for a very comfortable retreat after a day in the italian heat. The hotel comes complete with restaurant and very friendly staff who accommodate all of your wants and needs. The hotel is centrally located for eating, shopping and taking that all important gondola ride. Positioning of the hotel is most important. You have a choice of water taxi or ferry. The water taxis and ferries stop right outside the hotel, which is very convenient. We can recommend the taxis although they will cost 50+ euros from the train station to the hotel. The ferry is often cramped and difficult to manoeuvre your baggage on and off at the ferry dock. St Marks Square is a short ten minute walk from the hotel. Here you will find many other shops to wet your appetite and eateries together with the tourist sights in the square. One can quite easily spend an afternoon sitting in the shade, sipping coffee and listening to a wonderful four piece band with a lovely repetoire of classical italian and romantic music. To eat at this point, whilst wonderful, is a bit expensive, but worth it. We enjoyed many of the eateries along the canal adjacent to the Rialto Bridge and the hotel.

As an Australian I have always been taught to guard your passport with your life!! The staff at Rialto Venice really don't understand this concept and I'll tell you why. When we eventually checked out of this hotel, we had plenty of time to kill so we just sat in the lobby area close to reception. What we witnessed was very interesting indeed. Every new guest checking in were told the same deal about the passports and all were very nervous about leaving their passports with reception. Furthermore an American guy was really upset with the fact that he discovered his luggage was not locked up when he left it with hotel staff during the day. Anyway, the room we stayed in was huge, but very very tired indeed. You could hear rats in the walls at night, but to the hotel's credit, I think they are trying to resolve this issue. The balcony is ok at best as you don't have any view unless you stand up and peer over the edge. It's not like you can sit at a table and have a drink with a view! Also, breakfast was terrible. There was very little variety and the pastries were horrible. The only positive thing about this hotel was the air conditioner in the room worked really well. Forget about the good location, find a better place!!!

San Marco square is also only about a 5 min walk away. All staff were really friendly and helpful and provided great tips for sightseeing and recommendations for restaurants etc. Best recommendation was on our last night in Venice when we wanted a memorable dinner, the concierge gave us directions to Poste Vecie, the oldest restaurant in Venice and it was absolutely lovely! Another great thing the hotel provided was a complementary one-way water taxi trip to Murano (the island with the glass factory). The water taxi meter got to 30euro by the time we reached Murano (about a 10min trip) so was great that the hotel picked up that tab! Took a Vaporetta back home which took about 45mins and cost about 5euro each.

After watching many tourists wandering around the narrow alleys with their suitcases, trying to work out on the map where their hotel was, I was glad I based my choice on location. The hotel itself is actually five long, narrow buildings joined together, which makes it a bit of a rabbit warren inside. If your lucky enough to get a front or side facing room, as we did, then it's great, always something or someone to look at and you feel part of the place, but unfortunately, for every front facing room, there's one facing the back alley, with a wall about 3 feet from your window, as we found out when we walked around the back of the hotel. So it's the luck of the draw really! Our room was small, but fine for what we needed and very clean. The breakfast was ok, nothing special. The choice was a bit limited and the breakfast room tiny for the amount of people who must stay there, but it was better if you got down earlier, before 8.30. Venice is a very expensive place so for a couple of nights we bought some food from the local supermarket and ate it up on their roof terrace, which was lovely and no one there but us! I'd recommend this hotel on our own personal experience, but, as I said, someone else's may be entirely different. Try to get a front facing room and you should be ok.

The hotel is just at the Rialto bridge and as been said by others it is only a ten minute walk to San Marco. Plenty of busy streets roundabout for nice shopping and didnt have to go too far for good but overpriced food in the evening. However this hotel is solely about location. Booked Grand Canal view room and was surprised to be shown to our room at 10.30am having just gotten off a cruise ship. Surprise turned to shock when I opened the curtains to see our Grand Canal view totally obscured by the Vaparetto station right slap bang in front of our room. The Vaparetto bangs into the station on its arrival every ten minutes or so and I doubt that the dead could have slept in that room plus no view of canal!. Went downstairs to reception and acted all girly and pathetic and got room changed to one with good view of the bridge and the canal as paid for. Pleasant smiley gent at reception was thus helpful but he seemed only to be about in the mornings. Other than that it was a battle of wills to get your key from reception and anything else you needed. As my husband said we have been patronised in much better establishments than this. New room with the good view was otherwise clean but very tired. Mini bar was ok and good shower strength in the bathroom. Shutters on the windows allowed us to sleep as boat life on the canal was pretty much 24hrs a day. Noticed a room from the outside which had small balcony with two seats and table which would be worth asking for. Good luck. Breakfast room was small, cramped and the food was nondescript. Breakfast staff must have trained at the Lord Snooty school of hospitality. Had to use the ladies loo just off the foyer before departing and sorry guys thought I had strayed into the gents, disgusting. Glad I had a roll of loo paper in my handbag. This toilet did service the cafe attached to the front of the hotel and was therefore used by the cafe patrons also but none the less not good. So regrettably although the location was good, at just over 300 Euros per night I would have expected a bedroom that had been redecorated in the past twenty years.

So we requested again, and he simple replied no, you can leave. He said three times he told us can't and we didnt get it so leave the hotel. We had paid already and he said he did not care and told us to leave and called my mother crazy, a senior citizen who was trying to understand what he was saying. He refused to check us in and we asked for someone else but there was no one. I could not believe this was happening. We were shocked. He treated us women like garbage and was throwing us out. We were visitors, we could not do anything at that point. Go where? So we had to plead with him while he showed absolute disregard and attitude to us.

On the other times we had to ask questions about getting around and such they reception guys were helpful and gave us a map to get around. 2: Tell us how you liked the room The room tiny with barley enough room to walk beside the bed, and once you got your bag set up there was even less room. The room decor was old and tired and whilst not being that bad and not really affecting our time there it just needs a general upgrade I think, this was one of the most expensive hotels we stayed in on our trip so it was a little disappointing to say the least. Housekeeping was efficient and the room was cleaned as usual each day. 3: Talk about the location & amenities Breakfast was served in the restaurant attached to the hotel downstairs, which can be a bit noisy as its right on the main tourist spot the Rialto Bridge. Breakfast was very disappointing with only some cereal, a choice of ham and salami with bread roles and a few pieces of fruit and yoghurt and that was it. As said previously the location is prime, basically on the steps of the Rialto bridge, this is a very central location to be in Venice and as we walked everywhere around the towns it was an easy place to get back to.

Piazza San Marco is a 10 minute walk away, and even did walks as far as to the Ferrovia (Santa Lucia Train Station & Piazza Roma). 30 minutes, leisurely. As for the room itself, we booked a triple and got a room on floor 1 with no view. The furnishings were quite old, TV was small and outdated, but the bathroom was clean, modern and big. Careful if leaving the bathroom window open... our room ended up smelling like the sewer upon our return, even in December! Since the flooding impacted the lobby area, the computers for internet access were not set-up (4 euro per 30 min), so I was able to use the hotel's wi-fi which is not accessible from my room unless you had one near the lobby. The breakfast was a little bit below average. No orange juice but instead red grapefruit and some red grapefruit-orange juice mix? Breakfast consisted of traditional brioche, salami/ham, cheeses, hard boiled eggs, cereals, and yogurt. Coffee was strong. Found the whole experience below my expectations. You could get \"extra breakfast\" by paying a fee for bacon & eggs (5,50 euros), a ham omelette and some others. Staff was courteous and spoke English w/ no sense of annoyance. Have to say that Luca, a young tall Italian guy, that works through the evening and night shift, is very nice and cute. ;-) I would consider staying here again but would check other properties first.

The air con worked but inevitably the room was sweltering when you came home after a day out. And the fridge wasn't on a separate connection and was therefore a tad pointless. There is a restaurant on the canal side which is part of the hotel. It was, as you would expect in Venice, pricey. I would recommend going further afield to find a decent, better value restaurant.

Yes there are stairs up but after eating all that pasta we really did not have a problem with this. Honestly how many times a day do you return to the room? The location is really fantastic and scenic, The ever popular Rialto bridge is at your doorstep. San Marco square is in easy walking distance and transport (waterbusses, gondolas etc) is also right there. Check in was courteous and efficient and our bags were carried up those stairs. The room itself was really gorgeous in Venetian style, fourposter bed etc. The room was in fact two bedrooms and a bathroom. It was fully airconditioned and had 2 single and 1 King bed as well as an extra bed for our youngest, these were all comfortable. The layout while being unusual in that the rooms are long and narrow cannot be helped as it is a restored original building. The bathroom was modern and fully equipped with soap and beauty products etc. The bath can also be use as a shower which was good for all ages! My only complaint was the awful view of not a hell of a lot, but one could pay more and stay in the \"main\" hotel. I would think however that the annexe would be quieter as it is away from the busy canal. Breakfast was the usual European affair, not everyones taste but sufficient.

The one gentleman that did check us in was lovely and when I asked for a larger room he looked sincerely sorry, the rest of the staff was the complete opposite. Let me back up; our Junior Suite which we were paying $330/$350 a night for was not much bigger than my laundry room at home. The extra bed was only made with one sheet and a pillow that looked from a bad airline flight. The bathroom smelled of rotten eggs, the shower handle barely fit to be an upright shower and the toilet sounded as if it were about to errupt the entire night. After my son, actually vomitted TWICE, from the stench we were able to go out and almost enjoy the surroundings. We asked for a larger room but after being eaten alive, over 40 flea bites between us, we decided to finally, cut our loss and ask for a partial refund. We understood that the night we stayed and probably the day we were asking wouldnt be refunded; I was mortified when the very rude manager put his finger up as if to halt further conversation and told me in no....possible....way would any of my stay be refunded. Did I tell you about the sour eggs and clear coffee they tried to serve us as their 'gourmet buffet' We were able to find a lovely....extra large suite at Baglioni near San Marco Square, a beautiful view of the streets and an amazing breakfast included for only $50 more a day.

We have each travelled extensively during our 50+ years and have stayed in many of the world's finest hotels. Additionally, I spent the first half of my working life in the Travel Industry and as a result I think I have a fairly critical eye; at the very least, I certainly expect value for money. We stayed in a Standard Double room with a Canal View for three nights in June and found it to be quite large by comparison. The decor was elegant and typically Venetian and even though there were a couple of small signs of wear, it was more or less as depicted on the website - besides which, when we were in our room, we spent most of our time gazing at the spectacular view from our two windows. As the weather was quite warm, we were happy to close the windows after dark and use the air conditioning, which was set at a perfect temperature - i.e. not too cold - and the double glazing on the windows was so effective we were unable to hear any noise that may have been emanating from the Ponte Rialto. I hasten to add that, we found the busyness of the area to be a positive experience, yet one that was very easy to escape the minute we stepped inside the hotel or, from just one street away in any direction. Without exception we found the staff to be courteous and helpful and if one accepts that the hotel is in Europe, rather than America, England (or Australia), one will find the breakfast not only typical but also, more than adequate.

Having stayed at the very elegant Westin Excelsior the first time. I knew the Hotel Rialto couldn't possibly live up to those standards. However, this was my wife's first trip and I thought it would be best to stay in a more touristy area. The Hotel Rialto difinitely fits that bill. Within shouting (literally) distance of the Rialto bridge, the Rialto Hotel is right in the middle of Venice madness. Tourists flock to the bridge until very late in the evening (2:00 AM). Then delievary boats and the like all begin making their stops as early as 5:00 AM. The location is almost always buzzing with activity. With that being said, the hotel itself kept the noise out fairly well. I rented a junior suite which really wasn't much (I can't imagine what a regular room looks like). The room itself was clean and the bathroom was surprisingly nice and modern. The room was just large enough to accomodate the two of us, if travelling with a small child it could work, but anything more would be really cramped. Complimentary breakfast was typical but satisfactory. The one nicety was free internet access in the lobby. This was nice to send out a quick email to the family we \"abandoned\" back home. The staff was pleasant and happy to assist, however I did not find them to be all that knowledgable about the area. Two examples were not knowing where Novecenta (900). This is a fairly popular pizzeria/bar in the area (I have friends in Venice who know the place well). The second example is what really soured me on them. The night before leaving I asked the concierge to have a water taxi ready at 11:30 AM for our trip back to the airport. I asked him the cost and he said 90 Euros. This seemed right as it was the cost coming FROM the airport. We made sure we spent all of Euros the next morning (except the 90 we needed for the taxi). Upon arriving at the airport, we were surprised to learn it was 100 Euros. The reason was because it was consider a scheduled pickup. The hotel should have known this. Since we didn't have the Euros, we had to wash boats for an hour (just kidding). They were kind enough to take US currency. Anyway, in summary, the hotel was decent enough. I expected a bit more for the price, however you are paying for the location. The average person will find no problem with this hotel. Anyone, who might be a picky type, might want to look elsewhere.

I planed a two week vacation visiting Rome, Positano, Florence, Pisa and Venice. Everywhere I went, especially the hotel staff, was very helpful with directions, suggestions, etc..., except THE HOTEL RIALTO. Any question I asked (directions, restaurants, sites to see, regular general questions that are normal to ask), it seemed I was making the employees go out of their way. Let me give you a couple other reasons/experiences, to help prove my point: 1)Checking in: When asked for a map of the area (all big cities in Italy provide maps to tourists for free at the hotels), I was told to come back later, they were too busy...(Unfortunately for the employees, I understand Italian, they assummed I didn't) The real reason was the two desk employees were trying to figure out who's break it was, and NO, there was nobody else at the counter but me and my wife...NICE 2) The Room: My wife and I were on our honeymoon, so I decided to get a room overlooking the Grand Canal. These rooms were 360 euros (almost $500) a night, which I didn't mind spending due to the occassion. The view was nice, but the room was slightly larger than a shoe box. The only good thing about the bathroom was I quickly found where the ant hole was so I could block it...When told about the ant problem I was told to put a wet piece of toeilet paper on the hole, it should keep them out as long as the paper is kept wet...NICE Even without the ant issue, this room was very overpriced, you are overpaying for LOCATION only...There are plenty of nicer hotels in the area with a Grand Canal view that are cheaper with nicer, cleaner, and larger rooms.. 3)Check Out: This was the most impressive part of the HOTEL RIALTO: Per their website, honeymooners receive compimentary bottle of champagne, as well as some other items. When I booked the hotel, via their website, I also inquired about flowers being in the room also, which they told me would be 50 euros(which I agreed). The flowers and champagne were in the room upon check-in(surprisingly, considering the lack of professionalism throughout the hotel). While checking out the concierge first demanded the flowers be paid by cash only, which seemed odd. When I informed him to put it on my credit card because I didn't have cash, he became irate, but eventually did it. Later when I checked my billing on my credit card, I noticed the concierge charged me 100 euros for the flowers. When I contacted the management regarding this error, they told me, too bad, and anyway, the bottle of champagne was 70 euros so you got away with 20 euros, you actually owe us. NICE To make things clear, as a travelor, I never ask too many questions, I try not to bother people too much to a fault, but thats just me. Not that it would justify any of the above, but there was no INCIDENT, or anything, where I angered anyone, all this was unprovoked. I still have the WHATEVER attitude regarding this, because I didn't want it to ruin the memory of a great honeymoon. I don't believe this was because I was American, I believe it was because, they thought, I was ONLY an English speaker. I seen similar treatment to a couple from Austrailia as well. Don't get confused by the name of the hotel, it definitly is not the only, and surely not even close to the best, hotel near the Rialto Bridge.

It was our first visit to Venice and was a special birthday surprise for my fianc\u00c3\u00a9e. I chose the Rialto after spending alot of time researching various hotels in Venice because of its location / ease of transfer and its epitome of a true Venetian residence. I was not disappointed. There is a desk at the airport (Marco polo) after you come through the security gate where you can book a direct transfer by car to the dock and then water taxi which lands right outside the front door. The cost was 100 euros but we were in the hotel room within 30 mins of stepping off the plane. The water taxi also gives you a great first view of Venice and you have that 'film star' feel as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re escorted off and into the hotel. I booked with the hotel direct through their website and paid 380 euros per night for a beautiful suite overlooking the Rialto Bridge. If it is a special occasion, this is the perfect start with a four poster bed and the stunning views. Prior to arriving, I was also able to make some additional requests such as flowers, champagne in the room and restaurant reservations for Friday and Saturday night. It is very important to try and work out where you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to eat in Venice and to book if possible. There are a number of high priced, low value establishments that charge alot for very little just because of their location. I can highly recommend Alle Testiere on Calle del Mondo Novo (half way between St Marks Square and the Rialto). A small intimate restaurant serving excellent fish with a charismatic owner who is only too happy to help you choose the perfect meal. You must book in advance as there are only 22 covers in total. Venice proved to be the romantic get-away we hoped for, the obligatory gondola ride (80 euros), sipping cocktails in St Marks Square and getting the lift up the bell tower were duly accomplished. The Rialto markets on Saturday morning are well worth seeing as is trying to get lost in the meandering streets, especially on the other side of Venice from the bridge where the madding crowds are significantly smaller and less claustrophobic.

The staff at the Rialto were multi-lingual & very friendly & helpful on the whole. Continental breakfast was buffet style with a very wide choice & hot breakfast items available for a small suppplement. We'd definitely want to stay here again when we do back to Venice. Take earplugs if you're worried about noise and want to have the Grand Canal view. We had a junior suite which was very spacious and comfortable and immaculately clean. Do let them know if it's a special occasion, in our room there was a bottle of Prosecco and 2 glasses in a cooler on our arrival as it was our anniversary. A huge benefit of the Rialto Hotel is how easy it is to find - right by the 1 & 82 vaporetto stops so you don't have to spend any time hunting through the back streets with your luggage in tow - remember you can't take a car to your hotel so this was an important point. All traffic stops at the Piazzale Roma and you're on a boat from there so we were relieved to be in a hotel whose location made the journey so easy. We booked through Citalia but you can book direct with the hotel by using their website (-)rialtohotel(-)", "Date": "March 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cJust superb !\u201d", "Author": "welshglobetrotters", "ReviewID": "UR4584716", "Content": "Some basics about the geography. Venice City is an island (or rather a series of islands) set out about a mile or so from the Mainland in a sea water lagoon. It is connected to the Italian mainland by a causeway which carries a railway line and a roadway. Both the railway terminus and the end of road transportation is at the end of the causeway at Piazzale Roma (Rome Square). Venice's airport - Marco Polo Airport - is on the mainland about 10 miles away from Venice City, (although some budget airlines - like Ryanair fly to Treviso Airport, about twice that distance away). If you fly into Marco Polo the choice of transport to Venice City is either by private water taxi (90 Euros per boat one way); or a combination of bus or taxi to Rome Square/ Piazzale Roma (the closest place that road vehicles get to Venice City) and then transferring to a Vapporetti water bus (5 Euros per person) from there along the Grande Canal to the Rialto Vaportti stop - right outside the hotel. We pre-booked a taxi transfer with ATS (airport transfer services) which was 30 Euros to Rome Square and got the Vaporetti afterwards. Total transfer time about 1 hour. There's also an hourly express water bus from the Airport to St Marks Square (15 Euros each) - but you'll still need to get the Vaporetti from St Marks Square to the hotel at an extra 5 Euros each. The top tip really is to get the more expensive but \"door-to-door\" private water taxi from the airport and save all the fuss. Now the Rialto Hotel -what a great hotel! We stayed at the Rialto late last month, during Carnevale week in Venice. This was our first visit to the city and the carnival atmosphere certainly added to the experience. Carnevale is the week or so leading up to lent each year. The hotel is a charming 3 storey pink building, about 150 years old, set among similar buildings, right on the Grande Canal, about 10 metres from the Rialto Bridge. The reception is only a few steps away from the Vaporetti (water bus) stop at Rialto and is nicely appointed. Reception staff wear gold-trimmed, crimson velvet tunics, white ruff collars and are multi-lingual. Dining-room staff and the bell staff are similarly attired in 'period' uniforms. Our room (131) was along a maze of pristine pink marbled corridors. The door to our room had gilded panels - an ornate theme echoed on the cream-painted Italian wooden bedroom furniture within. Beautiful pink pavilion-striped padded fabric wall coverings, matching water-marked silk bed-covers and canopy. Lovely Venetian glass mirror and chandelier. Shutters on the double-glazed windows. Immaculate house-keeping and efficient individual climate controls in each room. Breakfast was included in the tarrif we booked on-line (through GTA hotels) and comprised the usual hot and cold continental buffet, with fruit, croissants, ham, salami, cheeses, cereals, yoghurts, juices, coffee, eggs etc. The hotel is in the centre of everything with some beautiful restaurants nearby - ranging from expensive fish restaurants (like the Cafe Grande Canal across the bridge - two course dinner, with lobster was 200 Euros for 2 persons)to great little Trattorias (like the Aquilla Nera) up an alleyway from the Campo San Bortolomio Square behind the hotel where dinner was around 40 Euros. St Marks Square is clearly signposted and a 10 minute walk through the cobbled streets. The Campenile Bell Tower, Basilica Church and Doge's Palace are all there along with pigeons galore - to feed for 1 Euro a bag. Admissions to the Campanile, Doge's Palace and Basillica are extremely reasonable - between 6 to 15 Euros for adults. The hotel has great souvenir shops and stalls all around, selling local cheeses, silk ties, glass, carnival masks to sports shops and more keychains and fridge magnets than most other tourist traps. Gondolas go from outside the hotel - but haggle with the Gondolier - a 40 minute trip should be no more than 100 Euros - expensive - but a MUST DO in Venice for the first time. This is an excellent, 4 star hotel, with furnishings which exude the ambience of Venice. Well situated, clean and stylish - the ideal choice for the tourist visiting the sites of this wonderful city. We travelled with our 10 year old son who loved the city. All the restaurants - even the fanciest - will happily rustle up things not on the menu such as a margherita pizza or french fries for fussy little eaters and feeding the birds in St Marks Square always pleases kids. A great city for romantics, photographers, shopaholics, families and those who love art, architecture and history.

We actually checked into Al Graspo De Ua for the first two nights in Venice (booked by our travel agent) and found it was terrible (see our review!) When we decided to extend our Venice stay for another two nights we went to see the Rialto and found that it was cheaper and in a better position and the staff were very helpful and it had a lift! Breakfast was the usual - we found it better to drink coffee out in Italy, but it was adequete for what we needed. St Marco Square, Rialto Bridge, the railway station and heaps of shops were in walking distance and we were able to spend our days wandering around the local area and returning to our hotel room when we needed to put away the shopping or put our feet up! We were offered a free tour to Murano Island during as part of our stay at the Rialto which meant that a canal taxi took us out to the Island and we were shown the glass blowing factory and shown the beautiful original glass pieces (one of a kind and more expensive then what you find in the souvenir shops in Venice). The stuff was beautiful and you get a 50% discount off the marked price, we were unable to purchase any because we would have had to get it back to Australia, however would have loved to! Be warned though that the tour ends in the souvenir shop of the factory and you have to find your own way back to the hotel (we weren't told this). And whilst its only a cheap ferry ride back to Venice we wondered whether we would have been treated differently if we had purchased items from the exhibition?", "Date": "January 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Etchingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cTerriffic Location\u201d", "Author": "jfzola", "ReviewID": "UR4315400", "Content": "Stayed in the Rialto for a long week-end break in mid Nov 05.
