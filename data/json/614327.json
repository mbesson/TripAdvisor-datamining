{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good potential, could be cleaner We stayed in the Bornholmer Hof in late December for New Year's Eve celebrations and overall the hotel was a mixed experience:Its layout and design is very charming as it is situated in the backyard of some residential buildings which I found quite unusual. Nevertheless, this location makes the hotel a very quiet choice which is still conveniently situated in Prenzlauer Berg, a short walk away from public transport station Sch\u679anhauser Allee (U + S-Bahn), with an additional streetcar station literally around the corner. Consequently, I felt that the location of the hotel was very good.The hotel rooms are smallish but still quite pleasant, I found that the fact that the hotel building is an old building from the 1920s / 30s (?) added to its charm. The rooms have high ceilings and large windows and feel bright and attractive. The furniture is a bit worn and dated, but - except for the very old shower which took ages to be warm - still fully operational. So, no big problems in this area.Breakfast, as has been mentioned in a previous review, is excellent for a hotel in this price range. It is served on a plentiful buffet with lots of items to choose from and the breakfast room is very convenient. This is a large upside of this hotel.What bothered me most was the cleanliness in some parts of the hotel. Don't get me wrong - the hotel is not outright dirty or gross, it simply could and should be cleaner. The bathroom in my room always smelled a bit, and the toilet bowl had seen better days. The shower had some stains I could not really define and the public restroom looked as if it had not been cleaned on the day I used it. All in all, this added to the impression that the hotel was cleaned in such a sloppy way that it really started to bother me. As I consider this the most important subject in a hotel, this was a major downside for me that would make me think twice about staying there again. Too bad as otherwise, I really liked the hotel quite well. So, hotel management: solve this problem, and I will make this hotel my homebase on future visits to your fantastic city...", "Date": "Jan 2, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR832799169", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "MarkK_Hanau"}, {"Content": "Great location and value We loved the neighborhood location of this pension with its many cafes and bakeries, food markets and shops and a mall, beautiful architecture everywhere, and convenient public transportation. Everyone we met in the area was friendly and helpful. The pension has a lovely reception area where check-in and check-out went very smoothly. Our room was very clean, nice sized, had a big window providing alot of light, comfortable beds and excellent reading lamps. The bathroom is quite small but also had a window for light and ventilation. The only thing I would add would be a hair dryer and soap/shampoo. The breakfast buffet was the best we had over a 32-day visit in Germany. The quality and variety of items was superb and the breakfast room was extremely pleasant and made more charming by the addition of candlelight and music. Our stay in Berlin was wonderful and we hope to visit again and stay at the Bornholmer Hof.", "Date": "Jun 19, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR785360710", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "redzig"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d614327-r23176094-Pension_Bornholmer_Hof-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "614327", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
