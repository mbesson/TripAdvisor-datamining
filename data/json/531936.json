After a day walking around the vatican your feet will be very happy to hop on a bus right back to outside the hotel. To catch the bus for the vatican you go across the road to outside the bookshop on the left. We didn't find the noise at night bad, to be honest if you are sightseeing around Rome, you'll be too tired to hear anything. Found the staff very helpful/friendly. There were 2 staff, one on the day shift and one on the night shift. Breakfast was good, no hot food just cereals, fruits, breads, cheeses, etc and really good coffee.

The small lift is a bonus in such an old building and can fit two people or one person with some luggage. Booked a 10 night holiday in the suite (room 4) which is spacious and comes with a very welcome jacuzzi bath for two in the bedroom. Great to enjoy a soak after all the walking! The bathroom is large and has a shower unit and large towel rail. The bed is two single beds together were firm but comfortable. Pillows were rather flat and hard but were adequate. The room lacked a set of drawers which meant we had to hang most of our clothes and use the small drawers in the cupboard, this probably won't be a problem for those on a short stay. The cupboard also had a safe which was easy to use but could do with a light in the cupboard to see. The room had a useful mini bar where we could store cool drinks. Range of wine, spirits, chololate and water in the room. Our room has fresh flowers on our arrival and a complimentary bottle of Prosecco which was warmly recieved. The hotel management were efficient, friendly and offered a very personalised service to suit. Much more relaxed than big hotel chains. The breakfast could either be delivered to our room but we chose to get it ourselves and there was no problem in getting a tray to take it back to our room which is just beyond the main reception area. there is a small bar and some seating in the reception. The bar is reasonable and offers hot drinks and alcohol. The room has a small falt screen TV, DVD player and sound system - useful for plugging in your MPS player/phone. Wifi is available for 6 euros for your stay. A computer and small library of guide books etc are there for general use. Overall a fantastic location within easy walk of all major sights.

This fantastic little boutique hotel was our home away from home in Rome. Firstly, the staff were absolutely outstanding. They are helpful, friendly and willing to do almost anything to ensure your stay is comfortable. They welcomed us at night and greeted us with a smile in the morning. We stayed in the hotel both at the beginning and the end of our trip, so we had Room 4 (with a jacuzzi) for the first few nights and then Room 6 for our final night. Both were fantastic. The rooms are clean, well cared-for and very well maintained. We had clean towels every day when we returned from our sightseeing and there is plenty of soap and shampoo provided. The morning breakfast was excellent - and the cappuccinos were a great way to start our day. By paying 6 Euro for our entire stay, we have free access to a computer and the Internet which we used to communicate with home on a regular basis. There is a real sense of security also in the hotel. You have to buzz in from the street and you first enter two large courtyards. You then have to buzz once again to be let into the building itself, where you climb into the VERY small elevator for the journey up to the third floor hotel. You then have to buzz once again to get into the actual hotel. All of this sounds a little awkward - but it is not at all - easy as can be. The location of the hotel itself is absolutely perfect. It is right in Largo Argentina - a bit of a transportation hub. From there, you can catch a bus or a tram right outside the hotel door. It is within walking distance to Piazza Venezia (a hub) and also within walking distance to the large attractions: Campo dei Fiori (5 minutes), Piazza Navona (5 minutes), the Pantheon (5 minutes), the Colisseum (10 minutes), Travestere area (10 minutes). The square outside of the hotel is also a taxi waiting area so you can catch a cab to Termini if required. Overall, I have to give this hotel a 10+++.

There were both good and bad points to the hotel so I'll start with the good. Excellent location. Well within walking distance of all the tourist attractions. Furthest being vatican probably about 40mins stroll away. Public tram stop virtually outside the hotel enterance, for those less mobile, or the city sight seeing buses stopped on the main street no more than 5 mins walk away. Staff. I found all staff to be friendly and helpful and all spoke English to a reasonable standard, and were able to help with directions and taxi transfers to the airport on our departure day. Breakfast served 7am - 10am so good if you're setting off early on departure day. Now the bad... The hotel, although set back from the main road through a courtyard, does back on to a side street and our room (No 4) was noisy at night (and well into the night too) with the bars/restaurants on the side street. Other rooms may not have been this noisy depending on which side they were on. The breakfast. Lovely coffee, and selection of teas available but the breakfast consisted of bread with cheese and meat, croissants, yoghurts, cereals, and cake. The croissants with chocolate spread were nice for the first day but after that something else would have been nice, like toast or an omelette. Also the breakfast is served in the reception area of the hotel which is directly outside all the rooms and so you sometimes get woken by other guests dining if you're wanting to sleep a little later. The Room. We booked the Junior suite (with jaccuzzi) and I was disappointmed at how small the room was. The cloth covered walls (?!) were dirty, and the jacuzzi area was in the bedroom and so close to the bed that the bedding got wet as we got out. The bathroom was always spotless but the shower screen didn't fit properly allowing water to leak onto the tiled floor Being unaware of this on our first day my partner stepped out onto the tiled floor and slipped and twisted his ankle and bruised his leg.

The employers english was not good and therefore, two of our restaurant reservations were non existing when we arrived at the restaurant.

There is a bus stop right around the corner, which makes getting to/from the Termini train station a breeze.

Tram did produce some noise, though, but mainly in the morning . One had to get up anyway, so it was no big deal. Traffic in big cities always produces noise. We didn't get a key of the two outside gates, so every time we had to ring the bell, which was a bit of a hassle, but I guess it keeps some unwanted people out of the inner courtyards, which the Residenza shares with other residents. The building the Residenza Argentina is situated in has a lift. It's small, but you don't have to drag your suitcases up several flights of stairs. Room was modern and clean and so was the bathroom with shower and bidet. One night we were informed that there wasn't any hot water as the boiler had broken down. I guess this was exceptional. The boiler was fixed the next day. Breakfast was buffetstyle and offered enough choice. Only negative point was that the bread was rock hard (had been in the oven too long) and there was no fresh fruit. The staff was very friendly.

We literally never took a cab anywhere. Tons of restaurants nearby, located right off a main street, very easy to find. Another nice feature is though the entrance is right off a main road, the actual B & B is 200 feet back through a courtyard and then through another security gate, so you don't hear any of the street noise off of Argentina. As with most properties located in Rome, you will occasionally hear some street noise, even though the double paine glass, but it is incidental at worst. 2) The room itself was amazing!! The size of the room and the bathroom were huge by European standards. The bathroom was all marble, with a stand up shower which had great water pressure and never lacked hot water for a minute. The room had the equivalent to a standard king size bed, which was two twins pushed together......firm, but not rock hard. Flat screen TV with Sky satelite.

The decor was modern with plenty of lighting. It really was a perfect room for two. The breakfast in the morning was standard fare for European B & B, breads, juices, Nutella, cheese, ham, expresso, coffee, cappucino, more than adequate. The only negative I can think of is that while the front desk staff was extremely attentive, they were not able to provide a great deal of information about where to eat or what to do.
