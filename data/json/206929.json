The beds were totally awful, you basically sink in them. I loved the hardwood floors but given that the isolation wasn't very good, they probably should have chosen carpet flooring. You could hear people in the next rooms, as well as people walking in the hallway. It seems like a half-hearted renovation: the elevators were quite ancient, and our magnetic keys had to be replaced pretty much every day. Breakfast buffet OK (there is no restaurant or bar, just a breakfast room) with some hot food which is not the norm in Spain. Wi-fi is free in the (small) lobby, although only in 30 minute increments so you have to keep asking for a new code. On the other hand, good price for value, extremely convenient to the metro (Les Corts), with super easy access to Sants train station, and Fira on Placa Espanya. Very quiet, relatively upscale neighborhood with lots of local shops, bars, and cafes. Police station a block away so assuming it is also quite safe!", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood discount hotel in the Barcelona sub urbs\u201d", "Author": "Eremie", "ReviewID": "UR122587035", "Content": "Though the hotel is further away from the city centre, it has a good metro connection.

It is in a nice area, though I doubt one would want to spend a lot of time exploring it given all Barcelona has to offer. While the hotel may not look far from central Barcelona on the map, it will take at least 35 minutes (10 minutes walk + 25 minutes ride) to get to the city center due to the metro line located close to the hotel taking a very indirect route. We found this is generally the case for all of Barcelona's metro lines, however. Other than location, NH Les Corts is an excellent mid-range hotel. We found the rooms to be quite large, especially by European standards, newly renovated and perfectly clean. Thirty minutes of free wifi is offered in the lobby each day, while in room access costs about \u20ac8 per day. Free in-room access would be nice, but considering the price the hotel charges in a rather expensive city like Barcelona we didn't find this to be an issue. Overall, I would recommend the hotel to those who are looking for a nice hotel on a budget. While it is nice to be a in a location where one can conveniently stop by the room throughout the day, this is going to be hard to accomplish for less than \u20ac70 per night in Barcelona.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGet by\u201d", "Author": "Peggy_Pegster", "ReviewID": "UR90554668", "Content": "It's not an ultra modern or boutique hotel but certainly get by...I mean Barcelona is so exciting , tons of sight-seeing, activities - you really won't spend lots of time in the hotel. It's actually not too small, great if you are there alone - it gets a little cram if you share it with someone. The toilet didn't work for the last 2.5 days of the one week stay, couldn't flush, they couldn't fix it , although they offered to change the room - I was really too comfy to change ...4 days staying in the same room with stuff all over the place - the last time you wanna do is to include packing into the itinerary in SPain! Good thing is they aren't too pushy of getting us out of the room , although they try by insisting at first telling us there are major changes need to be done to the room. After that I realized that they have asked several other of my colleagues to moved out of their room as well.....hmmmm.... Their balconies face directly at a residential building opposite - so remember to draw your curtains! Very simple reception, very simple breakfast - there are scramble eggs and sausage links and of course all the cold cuts: breakie european style. Went there, realize my electrical adaptor does not fit into the Spainish wall plugs (not because of the prong type but because of the shape of the plug)....try to get one in the reception and they ran out of them apparently. So I went to several shops asking for an adaptor with my broken spanish...they don't have them in supermarkets, I have to walk 7 minutes to a Chinese run shop that sells everything. The subway station is round about 7 - 10 minutes walk away - if you are going during autumn, remember to bring an umbrella, else you will end up like me totally soaked in a thunderstorm as I find my way back to the hotel in the night.... It's not a fantastic hotel, but certainly can get by - was in this hotel as when I was there, there's a 10, 000 delegate conference occuring at the same time as a festive season in Sept when they celebrate for the end of summer ...so do book early if you are planning to go Barcelona during the peak season!", "Date": "December 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South West England", "Title": "\u201cNot central but still a good place to stay\u201d", "Author": "JonnyBerlin", "ReviewID": "UR82734100", "Content": "This hotel is not central but has great transport links fight to the heart of the city.....Underground - Green Line 3 and Bus 66 are the best (both 1.30 Euros) ask for Placa Catalunya when you get started...its the \"city centre\" and at the top of La Rambla. The hotel is on a street corner with loads of traffic but this was no problem and it was quiet in the rooms. The hotel and room was spotlessly clean and efficiently services daily. The hotel staff were friendly, helpful and mostly english speaking willing to give loads of detail about the city....just ask. The breakfasts were far too expensive and it was much better to go to one of the many local cafes to get a great breafast for a third of the price!. There are loads of Restaurants and Bar all around. The bars stop outside eating and drinking at midnight when it all moves inside to you want to stop. There is great shopping 5 mins up on the Diagonal... Camp Nou is really easy to walk to and if you want to do an open-top bus a stop is within easy walking where you can also get the tickets - this is a stop for both the blue and red routes - BBT (Barcelona Bus Touristic) was the best and cheapest option.
