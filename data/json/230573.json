Great price vs comfort. The location is not downtown Berlin, but with the tram in front of the hotel we quickly reached all the hot spots. The breakfast is great. Why? See my pics.The only complaint is the noise @ rooms facing the street. There is no airco, so with open windows the noise it horrible. We did not sleep at all. The next day we were moved to another room (on new years eve...full hotel) facing the court yard, thank god!, and we slept like babies.Great service.

My room was in the main building on the 5th floor with a nice balcony, facing the cross street. I slept with the window open, traffic noise wasn't too bad. The room was spacious enough for being a queen bedded room, large safe with plug inside, flatscreen TV, minibar, etc all good. Internet comes included in the room rate. All staff I met was very friendly, both at front desk and in F&B service. The bathroom was good too, with a real hairdryer and not one of those super small ones. Only thing I have to comment here is that in the shower the shower tube's tap was loose, and there was some painting to do above the mirror. Breakfast was served across the patio (this is a negative, as you have to cross a parking lot to get there - either take your coat or umbrella, it's about 100 yards so with rain it's long enough to get wet). Nice large breakfast buffet with an option of scrambled eggs, variety of cheese, sausage, breads, jams, muesli, etc. I believe in this building there is also more rooms as I saw another elevator and people getting out with luggage. I tried room service once, this was a negative. My order came incomplete, and plates were covered only with aluminium, not with the usual cloches that are placed on them. Thus, wasn't too hot anymore. Minestrone was ok, but the Cesar's salad was disgusting. Salad leaves were definitely not fresh anymore, sauce was very oily, chicken was minor quality and had a weird taste. Still would visit again, although definitely not for ITB as the location is not good. Next public transports SBahn is about 1km walk, and takes forever to get to central Berlin or even fairgrounds. To Alex / Brandenburger Tor etc by Taxi I'd calculate 10/15min.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "munich", "Title": "\u201cGeneral review\u201d", "Author": "pinme", "ReviewID": "UR123344361", "Content": "Very nice, cosy and romantic hotel. Reception extremely helpful, smart and nice presentation. Good food and reasonable price however limited menu. Matress and linens were very confortable and TV superb however without CNN!

The only reason we had to choose this hotel was that it was only a 100 meters away from the flats belonging to our friends. However the hotel was a huge surprise. A very friendly and very informative information at the arrival. The whole hotel was very fresh and during our whole stay the service was amazing, in terms of perfect. The hotel rum was excellent. The whole hotel and the rooms had a very distinct architecture and down to the little thing it was genuine to its nature. The breakfast with no doubt five stars. Furthermore, in this area of Berlin you can go out to the little restaurants around the hotel. There you can find a very personal service and extremely inexpensive for a city like Berlin. For two persons with a three dish meal and water and a bottle of vine (1 liter and a very good Valpolicella) the cost was about 25 to 30 euro - altogether. It\u2019s not the last time we will those hotel New Berlin. The hotel deserves a five star with no doubt and the areas around the hotel with small restaurant, with tramp and bus \u2013 or walking you can reach practical most of Berlin.

It consists of two houses, one at a mainstreet (classic house) and one in a courtyard. We had room 507 in the classic house. You can hear the noises of the street a little bit but we didn\u00b4t care. The rooms in the other house (the Mediterranean House) must be more quiet and bigger (they did cost 95 EUR, our room 85 EUR per night). Our room was nicely furnished, not too big but big enough for the two of us. The bathroom was very nice and seemed to be new (marble). You even can dim the light. You get a free bottle of water each day. And you can use the sauna free of charge (we had not time enough to do that). If you want to you can have breakfast for EUR 12 each person. You get a piccolo and can choose how you want to have your egg (the boiled ones are on the buffet, sunny side up and scrambled are freshly made), have cheese, cold cuts and fish and much more other appetizingly things. Around the hotel are mostly apartment houses, no restaurants but a discounter. But you don\u00b4t need to have restaurants nearby as the streetcar stop is around the corner and you can drive to Berlin Alexanderplatz in about 5 minutes. And the hotel has its own restaurant and bar (I think it was italian, but we didn\u00b4t test it). As we were sitting at the bar one day at 0.20 a.m. (the kitchen closes at midnight) we heard that other guests asked for something to eat and they opened the kitchen for them again. The whole hotel staff was that nice! You can buy tickets for the streetcar in the hotel, too. The help you by choosing what is best. And they give you a map and a subway and streetcar plan. We certainly will come back although the hotel is not in the middle of the town!", "Date": "June 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berlin", "Title": "\u201cGood deal\u201d", "Author": "LukeSkywalker", "ReviewID": "UR10087544", "Content": "We stayed there because a friend had recommended it to us.

The room was very clean, spacious and very quiet. The hotel is situated in a rather boring but safe area of Berlin, there are not many restaurants nearby, but two supermarkets are around the corner. But therefore it is directly at Tram M10, which will take directly to the cool Kastanienallee/Prenzlauerberg area within 5-10 min. Alexanderplatz is about 8 min with Tram M5 and 6. The breakfast buffet was really nice with a large variety.
