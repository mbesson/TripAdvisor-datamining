It has been a great experience. The reason I picked Navona is because of it's location and it did not disappoint! We literally walked everywhere. Of course, it's about a 2 min walk to the Piazza Navona and then about 5 min from the Pantheon, 10 to Trevi Fountain, 15 to Vatican City, 15 to Spanish Steps, and we even walked to the Colosseum. it was about a 30 min walk, but we got to see so much of Rome. The location is the BEST!!! The hotel itself is hard to find just like the other reviews say. Just get to the Piazza Navona and head north. Exit the Piazza in the north center exit and look to your left. Across the street is a large white building. Walk along that building and it will be 2 streets down on your right. You will see the famous green door. It's number 19. The street signs are on stone plaques on the buildings at the corners. It took me a while to know where to look for the street names. Okay, now about the hotel...It's very clean. We stayed in the apartment and like the other people said, there is a bed hanging from chains. It takes a little bit to get used to, but the Apartment is pretty spacious. A family of 4 could stay pretty easily, but more than that...no. One would have to be on the couch and the other in the twin bed past the kitchen area. The beds leave a lot to be desired. you'll probably be too tired to really care at the end of the day. The shower is quite small. I'm an average sized person and it was tight for me. They cleaned out room every day and gave us fresh towels. The woman at the front desk was most accommodating. The maps at the hotel are the best around and they have coupons on the back for Hard Rock Cafe and such. It was raining almost our entire trip, so our maps got wet, so we got 2 new ones each morning. Don't waste your Euros on the maps at the news stands. The hotel ones are much better. I really don't have any complaints. There were some quirky things like there aren't any outlets in the bathroom and you have to use the special rounded outlets for the hairdryer, but really, nothing to complain about.

But, the place is small and you see the same faces everyday; so more like a B&B in that sense. They also gave a free bottle of wine that we didn't drink, so I can't comment on the quality of it. We got the room right next to the reception desk, and as the previous reviewers stated you WILL get a lot of noise from the reception desk and the other guests. It normally doesn't last that long, but whenever someone calls the reception desk to make a reservation or other guests are asking for help to make arrangements, you can hear the entire conversation fairly clearly. Not too much noise late in the evening aside from the occasional guest coming back from dinner; because they have wood floors you can hear their steps clearly. Our room faced an inner courtyard, so there weren't a lot of noise from the outside. Tip on finding the place: if you take a taxi, ask the taxi to drop you off at the taxi rank on the north side of Piazza Navona. Head north towards the Museo Nazionale Romano di Palazzo Altemps. After passing what looks like a church on your right, take the 2nd street on your right, and the road bends to the left.

It is hard to find that kind of hotel at an affordable price in a really good location in an old city like Rome. We thought we didn't have a TV when we first got there, but we figured it out later on. It was one of those things were you press a button and the TV comes out from the desk!!! Ok so they have that at some hotels here in the U.S. but I wasn't expecting that in Rome. lol. The have free breakfast every morning and OMG it is delicious. You have to place your order the night before and they will deliver your food right at your door at the time you specified on your order sheet!! There is also free wifi!!

It is a 5 minute walk to the Piazza Navona and the Pantheon where you could also find a lot of places to eat. We also walked to the Trevi fountain and to the Vatican (prob a 30 minute walk). I would recommend taking the bus to the Colosseum as it is a bit far. Also, from the hotel, it is only 11 euros to get to the train station. From the airport to the hotel, there are a whole bunch of shuttle services that can be quite expensive so make sure you ask around for the cheapest option. The airport is a little bit out of the city. The service was fantastic. The guy at the reception is the friendliest and nicest ever. He said he has been working there for a long long time! The negatives: The hotel is actually a few floors rented out from a condo/apartment building so it is hard to find. I recommend that you do your research on the detailed directions before you go. Even the locals don't know where it is, if you plan to just ask around. The reception area is not in the same building as the rooms (if you are staying at the newly renovated ones). Also, I don't recommend booking at the older rooms unless they are a lot cheaper. I saw one of them and they are so basic (looked like a hospital room).

In fact, when we were trying to re-route our flight back to the U.S. at the last minute (weather cancellations), the reception let us use their computer and made some last-minute arrangements for a car service and breakfast. The entrance is hard to find, and there's no outward sign, so know the address, then look for the buzzer with the \"Imperium Suite Navona\" label. Our room (and several others) were in a secure building across the street. The rooms each have a separate \"Roman\" theme (ours was the Trevi Fountain room, with Trevi Fountain artwork hanging inside).

The room was adequate size with A/C and free Wi-FI and kept clean. One minor issue for me since I am petite was stepping into the jacuzzi tub to use the shower which was part of the tub.

The room was good sized w/ a/c. The bathroom quite large and modern. The staff were pleasant. On the con-side-- bathroom was a bit dusty and not as clean as I would have liked. It wasn't outrageously filthy or anything beyond the pale, but a couple stray hairs in the tub put me off.

I highly recommend taking a map that has all the street names listed on it, then it is easier to locate. We has aloso looked at the photos on here first which helped! Our taxi driver pointed us in completly the wrong direction (as cars cannot fit up the street) so it took us a little while to find it! Staff: AMAZING...all the staff speak good english, were so friendly and helpful, went out of their way to help us! Gave us a really good free map of Rome which was so useful! The Hotel and Room: It is on the 1st floor, so there are stairs to climb - not not hard! You have to buzz the intercom to get in (reception is manned 24hrs and this was nice as it felt safe) We stayed in the standard room, which is down the corridor from the reception. It was a good sixe, very clean, and very sweet! Air con worked which was a big bonus as it was so hot outside! Breakfast: You have a tick box selction each evening to fill out what you want and what time to be delivered - we ticked everything (!) and it was all great! Delivered bang on time each day, and it was a luxury eating breakfast in bed! Location: PERFECT! we couldnt have wished for more! 1 minute walk to Piazza Navona, 2 minutes to the river and bridges, 10 minutes from the Spanish Steps+Trevi Fountain, 20 minutes to the Colesseum. There were some great local restaurants about 1 minute walk from the hotel, and the hotel staff gave some great recommendations of other places near by to. There are local buses/taxis very nearby if you want to travel this way, but we walked everywhere - all the main sites were within easy walking distance. Rome is very easy to navigate (with a good map!) and we had so much fun walking down all the little cobbled streets and discovering new sites and places, which you wouldn't get if you got the bus! The food is amazing, and the ice cream is the best we have ever had! Avoid the restaurants on Piazza Navona, as these are more pricey and not as cute as the little side street ones!

We would stay here again and we slept very well because we were so tired everyday! We were probably the last ones in most night as we only heard the door bell one night. It did rain every day we were there but it would be sunny until about 5/6pm and then there would be a down pour and it would clear again leaving the sun shining until about 8.30. The last day we were allowed to leave our luggage after checking out as our flight wasn\u2019t until 10.00pm. They also let us use the facilities across the road to freshen up. They have some rooms in the apartment block across the road and they are newly decorated rooms. There was a taxi rank just before the Piazza Navona square and we paid 30 euros to the airport. Taxi From Airport to Hotel: When my husband and I arrived in Rome we went to the Taxi stand outside the Ciampino airport (white taxi\u2019s). We had read that it is a flat fee of 30 euros and told the taxi man where we wanted to go and said \u201cwill it be 30 euros?\u201d he replied, \u201cno, it will be 50 euros\u201d. At this point we were concerned about getting ripped-off. Then he went onto say that \u201cthere is a marathon on at the moment and all traffic has been diverted around the city\u201d. We were still unhappy about this. He then told us to wait and there were 3 other ladies that also joined the queue, he then asked them where they were going and then suggested we could all share the taxi and pay 30 euros each. The taxi man was using his Sat Nav to get us to the hotel and he managed to get us as close as possible. But he could not take his car down to the hotel so we had to walk to the hotel, which was fine because it wasn\u2019t far. Hotel: The hotel is quite difficult to find but fortunately we had read the previous reviews and had a look on Google maps. It was basically a green door to this apartment block and the hotel is on the first floor of this apartment. There is a lift and we used it because we had a suitcase and a trolley, it was bit of a squeeze for the both of us and our luggage, and we are both of slim built! The receptionist was very friendly and welcoming. We arrived at about 11ish and were worried about arriving earlier than the check-in time, the lady said that it was fine and that we could check in early! Bonus! We could start the site seeing straight-away!! We were given a key to our room but not a key to the front door. You had to press the bell to be let in but this was manned 24 hours. Room: We stayed in the room that was in the lobby area but further away from the reception desk it was called Navona. The room was nice and comfortable but not that spacious. The first thing we checked was the safe as we had read in a previous review \u2018the safe was not attached to the wall\u2019 \u2013 luckily it was. The bathroom had a Jacuzzi that did not work but we couldn\u2019t be bothered to complain about this and just used the shower and had a bath. The bathroom window had a hazardous handle and my husband scrapped against it on the way to the toilet in the middle of the night! Beware of the window handle! The room was quite dark with little light \u2013 although this was because our room faced into the courtyard. The walls are very thin and we could hear the people in the next room and we could also hear people downstairs in the courtyard. Because our room was in the reception area we could hear the noise from the lobby too, although having the TV on drowned out all the noise. There are a few English channels but we only had it on as background noise and to check the news. Breakfast was served in our room and you would have to pre-order what you wanted the night before \u2013 we were very happy with breakfast. I didn\u2019t like the orange or pineapple juice and we had the bread, scrambled eggs, bacon, croissants and tea. Itinerary: We went for 4 days and as soon as we checked in and freshened up \u2013 we went to grab a bite to eat on the go. Headed toward Piazza Navona and just before you cross the road into the square there is a pizzeria on the corner. Day 1: Headed to look at the Panthon, Trevi Fountain, towards the Spanish Steps along via Condotti & via Del Corso (main shopping road) and finally to Piazza del Popolo. Had Dinner @ Cafe Barocco, good food. Day 2: Colosseum, Palatine Hill, Roman Forum, Piazza Venezia (ate at some cafe was overpriced and it was raining), Monument to Victor Emmanuel II, Sant Maria Del Popolo & Pincio Gardens (amazing views). Dinner was near the Pantheon @ Trattoria Al Pantheon-Acquisto Cartasi, good food but service could be better. Day 3: St Peter\u2019s Basilica, Vatican Museums & Sistine Chapel and lunch @ pizzeria in the Museum. Dinner & drinks were at Campo del\u2019 Fiori first restaurant on the left as you enter the square from Piazza Navona. The food was not very good and I would recommend this square for drinks and hanging out late into the night also there are clubs near too but we were too tired to check them out. Also the clubs are not all in one location either. Day 4: Went to the Vatican as heard the Pope was here today, Castel Sant\u2019Angelo and explored Piazza Navona. Dinner @ Anima Sapori, food was good but portions was small but adequate. It was on the side street next to Tre Scalani on Piazza Navona.", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201clovely\u201d", "Author": "igor188590", "ReviewID": "UR106128561", "Content": "We had absolutely a lovely stay.

The thing is, it's not really meant to have a lobby area - the receptionist sits at a desk in the small hallway outside the rooms on the right of the entrance. I really wish we would have had a room down the left-side of the hallway, but our room was right-most room. Right outside our door was the reception, computer/desk and kitchen.

The hotel is in an excellent location, perfect for exploring rome. However it really is tucked away and we recommend a detailed map as the street did not appear on our tourist maps and even the taxi driver found it difficult to find. Taxi from the termini rail station to the hotel costs nearly 30 euro, a far cheaper option is to get the number 70 bus which stops at the top right hand side of piazza navona (two minutes walk from hotel). The hotel is smartly decorated, modern and the rooms have all the facilities you would expect (flatscreen tv, mini bar, safe, heated towel rails etc.) The service was very good and the office & staff were convieniently located - perhaps a little too close by (literally outside of our door). The main office is situated in the corridor, and when lying in bed we could hear the staff typing on their computer. In order to feel any privacy we needed to keep the tv on at all times. The staff did their best to keep noise to a minimum however it was a little strange having them so close by. In terms of cleanliness the room was spotless and well maintained (new soap every day!). However, to my disappointment the spa bath jets had not been cleaned out for some time - I only found this out after running the bath, getting in, then turning them on - within seconds I was covered in brown gunk from the water pipes. Not particularly relaxing or indulgent! Breakfast was very good, varied slightly each day (different pastries, yoghurts etc.). The choice and quantity was just right. Also a nice touch was the guest welcome table which had drinks and jaffa cakes available throughout the day. Our main issue during our stay was we believe beyond the control of the hotels owners - there was a significant amount of building work going on in the building next door. Noise began at around 9am in the morning and continued relentlessly, this meant no lay in's we were up and out pretty much straight after breakfast as the noise was very loud. Noise was usually over by the time we returned at around 6pm each evening. Unfortunately from the scaffolding it looks like the building work is pretty subtstantial and may continue for a few months. In terms of restaurants the nearby L'orso 80 (literally 20 seconds walk away) is very good, excellent quality food at a good price - don't be put off by the dated looking exterior - inside it is very nice. In general the smaller restaurants on the side streets seem to have better quality, better priced food than the large fairy lit outdoor restaurants near the main tourist sights - these are great for people watching but very over priced.

Going from Fiumicino (Leonardo da Vinci) it is comfortable with a prebooked limousine, we used http://www.rome-limousine-airport.com/ , 40 Euro for the trip and they take you to the door. The hotel is on the first floor, and you have to use the stairs. Only 6 rooms, 2 is so called superior rooms, slightly bigger and with a jacuzzi (not working in our room). I have uploaded the ground floor for your information. Descent breakfast served in your room, but for some reasons the bread was not fresh and we could only have 2 slices. Strange. Breakfast is served at the time you wish and it came just in time every morning. TV with all kind of international channels from many countries. As other reviewers have mentioned there is a problem with noise from the reception, you can hear everything from your room. No problems nighttime, but in the daytime it was irritating if you wanted to sleep in the late afternoon after a \"busy\" day in Rome. Free wifi if you bring you labtop or Iphone, you need a code from the reception. Not quite sure if it works in all rooms, it did in ours. I recommend the place but don't kill me if you don't like it for you might or you might not. The hotel had new owners during our stay and there was some signs that it will be for the better, but time will show. We might come back and we might not. Not quite sure. A bonus tip: Go to Al Greco in Via Condotti, go to the cashier to the left and ask for 2 G&T, go to the bar and they make a generous drink and you wil have canapees and different snacks as well. 12 Euro for 2 drinks.

It is a one minute walk to Piazza Navona and a quick walk to the Pantheon, the Trevi Fountain, Campo De Fiore and the Vatican. There are dozens of restaurants of every type within a quick walk. On Rinascimento a block or two away there are bus stops that take you anywhere in Central Rome (the Coliseum, Villa Borghese, Termini station, the National Museum, the Capital). To get to the hotel from Termini Rail station just take the No. 70 bus outside the station and get off on Rinascimento. It is a good idea to print the picture of the exterior of the hotel as there is no sign. If you want a friendly, good-value, well-located hotel and can do without the lobby, this is a real gem.", "Date": "August 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome", "Title": "\u201cIf You Want Best: It Is Imperium!\u201d", "Author": "PINTO2", "ReviewID": "UR35667477", "Content": "To find a place from where one can move without any difficulty is the best thing to be happened for a tourist.

Without the driver we would still be trying to find the place now , despite having some zoomed-in pictures from Google Earth with us! The reception guy was waiting at the door and was polite and friendly. We were led up a set of stairs to the first floor. There are about 6 rooms all on the same floor. We had booked the superior double room with jacuzzi spa bath. The reception area, and I use this term extremely loosely is a desk and chair next to a computer with a small kitchen area behind it occupying the landing and right outside the room we had booked. The walls are paper thin so you can hear the other guests coming and going and I could hear somone snoring all night! and the reception guy when he is on the phone and talking to the night porter guy when he arrives and leaves. Tip: take ear-plugs. The room was clean and looks like it was recently painted/decorated. The guy shows us the safety deposit box and tells me the code!!!! Tells me ? so I ask how I change it and he says \" No, you must use the code I give You! \" There was no way to change the code ! In 25 years of staying in hotels I have never been given a code to punch in that the receptionist knew and probably the night porter also. Anyways I fiddled around trying to see if I could change the code ( but could not when I noticed that the safe moved slightly....I then discovered that it was not secured to the wall. I picked it up and got the wife to take a photograph! ( See the pics I have included. ) Needless to say we walked around Rome for 5 days carrying passports, 700 euros and our plane tickets...unbelievable! Next the jacuzzi spa. It didnt work..no bubbles for us. When I complained they kept saying they would have a look at it later, finally on the saturday night ( second day of stay ) they said it would be fixed Monday...and yes you guessed it, it was never fixed. We asked that first night for breakfast at 8 .30 am the next morning ( it is delivered on a tray to your room ..see pics of breakfast ) . Breakfast arrived at 8!!! we were still asleep when the guy began knocking ! Wonderful! There are no keys to the outside door. The hotel reception is manned 24/7 and when you arrive back from a night out you ring the bell. The bell can be heard in all the rooms, so you know when everyone is back if you keep count of the rings throughout the night like I did. The bathroom is very small and to get to the toilet you have to be very careful you dont injure yourself on the window handle like I did when you squeeze passed in the middle of the night ( see more pics of bathroom , window handle, my injury ) and speaking of death traps, see the pic I have included of the small step leading into the bathroom. If you sleep in total darkness or have been on the wine you will fall/trip/stumble on this obstacle. So, what was good about it? The bed mattress was very comfortable. The room was clean and the location good. It was a one minute walk to the piaza navona and 2 minutes walk to the bridge crossing the river. I would not stay there again. I would not stay there if it was half price or they phoned me and said it was a freebie. They need to address the noise/privacy issue...come on! someone sitting right outside your room !! That was probably the biggest concern for us. A door bell that wakes the dead. No security for all you money and important documents, unless you want to use a safe that anyone can pick up and walk out with or you are happy to share the code number with a guy you know nothing about! no english speaking channels on the TV. , no proper tea bags, unless you are into earl Grey, an early morning call that is much earlier than you request, a couple of safety issues in the room ( step and wndow handle ).

But after staying at Imperium Suite Navona, I have found a most recommendable place to stay. The hotel is perfectly located in the \u201cold part\u201d of Rome between Piazza Navona and Pantheon. It\u2019s not your typical hotel as the \u201chotel\u201d only has 5 rooms and in fact is an old renovated apartment. The room we had, a \u2018Superior room\u2019 with a king size bed, also contained a small wardrobe and a nice bathroom with Jacuzzi. Being an apartment, more than a hotel, you have the sound of people coming and leaving, just outside your room. However this was not a big problem for us. Also there is no big breakfast buffet (there is no restaurant) instead breakfast is served in your room at what time you choose. Based on reviews here on Tripadvisor we were warned that the hotel could be difficult to find, therefore I had printed a map from the website \u2013 without this, I think we would still be searching. The hotel is located in a very narrow street, which the taxi driver could not drive into, and the building bears no sign whatsoever that indicates a hotel. Only a green door with an intercom. When the door opens you walk into a dark passage and need to find your way up to the first floor. The staff in the reception was very friendly and helped us with maps of the city and recommendations. We only paid 85 EUR\u2019s pr. night which I find is a barging in Rome for a decent room, but one also has to accept that it\u2019s not a typical hotel.

We got to our hotel, which was hard to find but thats not their fault, and were extremely excited after reading all the reviews. Come to our surprise a man, can't remember his name but i it started with an F-so we shall call him Mr. F, came running down the stairs all frantic. This is the lie he told us: Mr. S.. Oh thank god youre here. We have a bit of a problem. I hope you guys arent too upset. I was in Aspen, you know skiing like a lot of people. I was on the mountians going up and down, i was on vacation. But the employee that i hired, i dont know what he was doing. While i was on vacation he was smoking weeding in my office. Not doing anything. He was always on drugs and i dont know what he did. But the reservation came through and I remember i had it before I left. I think he put it under pile of junk and just did drugs. And so we dont have a room for you. BUT, i have a soultion to this problem. I have another room at a better hotel, its a 4 start hotel and its near the spanish steps. Its our sister hotel and if i had to chose, id pick that one over this one. He then asked us to come upstairs because the elevator wasn't working, which it was because i saw a woman go up the elevator after we took the stairs, and that he would have to call a taxi to take us his other hotel. We go upstairs and and he forces us to drink coffee and orange juice and acting very nervously he makes phones to the other hotel and taxis. He lets us know that if we dont like the other hotel we can come back in the morning because he will then have a room for us. He runs off downstairs to find a taxi and leaves us with his wife. We waited about 15-20 mins before he came back upstairs and said he found us a taxi to go to the other hotel and that he would pay the fare for the trip. Obviously, we had no choice but to go to the other hotel. We get into the taxi at 10:30pm and we were dead tired, hungry, and hating rome at this point. we arrive at the sister hotel which was called Fellini B&B. We arrive at Fellini B&B, and the man working at the desk checks us in and lets us know that Mr. F said to give him a call in the morning and let him know if you want to go back to the other hotel. if so, he will check you back into the other hotel. We go up to our room and we were not surprised to find the room was all the way in the back the last room, it was the UGLY(everything was green), heater was not working so we were cold the entire night, sheets were dirty with hair all over it but the bed was comfortable, internet kept logging us off, shower was clogging up, and the bathroom tiles were broken. The next morning, my fianc\u00e9 called expedia to let them know what was going on and booked another hotel. We got a knock on the door while we were getting ready to leave and it was a woman working for the hotel telling us this. \"Don't go back to the other hotel because we have room here and theres no need to go to the other one. OK? So stay, stay... You can stay here okay.\" Obviously, we knew were werent going to stay and didnt want her to bother us more so we just agreed and finished packing up. We took all of our luggage downstairs to check out and another man was at the front desk. I dont remember his name but he was a very tall man so we can call him Mr. T. This is what happened with him: Were here to check out. Okay, whats your name. Im Mr. S. he said: Ohh.....!!!!!! No, no, no, no, no.. You stay here with us, you stay here. You can't go because we wont let you. We told him we we already booked another hotel and that were leaving and we just need to check out and we already took it up with expedia. He yelled at us asking us if its really because the room is ugly and thats why we want to leave. And supposedly the truth is this hotel cost more than that one so you guys are very lucky to stay here. After fighting for 10 mins, he got really angry and told us to leave which is what we were already doing so it didnt really matter. If you look up Fellini B&B you will find that many other travelers have had similar experiences. These people are very unprofessional and I suspect that they are running some sort of scam.
