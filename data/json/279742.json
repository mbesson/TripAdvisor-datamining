The temperature controls did not work and could not be adjusted below 22 degrees. We moved to a superior room. Here, the bedclothes had what appeared to be bloodstains on them. There were holes in the sheet. The bedside lamps are fixed, and dazzle you when you try to read. The armchair had a heavy layer of dust. In the bathroom,the shower stall has missing tiles and a lot of mould. There was chewing gum on the floor.The lighting is so poorly designed that your face is in shadows when trying to shave in the bathroom mirror.

Our standard (comfort) room was spacious and very comfortable with very high ceilings adding to the feeling of space. Everything was clean and worked just as it should. The beds were particularly comfortable. We looked onto the inner courtyard, so not a lot to look at but very quiet. An in-room safe is included at no extra charge. There wasn't a lot of clothes storage and some of the shelving was so high-up as to make it impracticable, but I imagine most people are only staying for 2 or 3 nights, so it isn't a major issue. The bathroom was modern, with a deep bath and powerful shower and a reasonable range of complementary toiletries. However, the frosted glass wall separating it from the bedroom won't be to everyone's taste. It made no difference to us, but I'm not sure if my wife and daughter would have cared for it.

I guess the hotel chose to capitalize on it and increased the price by at least 25% (if not more) over their regular pricing for the rooms we had (I found this out later). I wasn't pleased, but business is business, I guess. That aside, it's a VERY nice business hotel. There is a restaurant on the first floor that serves breakfast and dinner which is not bad for hotel food and would be good for a dinner with business colleagues; it's mainly swiss-eclectic. The beds are comfortable and you can't hear the person in the next room through the walls. The rooms are European medium to spacious (American small but not cramped). I have no idea if there is a business center, but I suspect there is. It's ideally located around the corner from the Anhalter Bahnhof S-bahn station, so there is quick and easy access to the subway if you need it, but both airports are *at least* a 30 minute to 1 hour ride on the subway with several connections. From a tourist's perspective, it's located within walking distance of a lot of WWII and post-WWII points of interest in Kreuzberg and Berlin-Friedrichstadt neighborhoods (Checkpoint Charlie Museum, Potsdamer Platz, Friederichestrasse, Berlin Wall remains, Topography of Terror, Jewish Museum, tons of historical buildings, etc.), but still several subway stops from Museum Island, the Riechstag/Brandenburg Tor, Unter den Linden, Charlottenburg palace, etc.). Although I did see some children there while I was staying, I don't think the hotel is very kid friendly; for instance, all the furnishings are what my friend described as \"stuff i wouldn't want my kid jumping all over\", and I don't remember the hotel restaurant featuring a kid's menu. That said I don't think they will turn you away if you show up with your kids in tow. The EUR prices are in line with what I would expect for an upscale business hotel in the US (think Marriott or Hilton Embassy Suites).

We arrived on 29th April and left on May 2nd 2008. We were offered a discounted upgrade on arrival and swapped the Superior room for one of the junior suites in the old loft on the fifth floor. Near an historically important local train station, Anhalter Bahnhof, the hotel is in a quieter area away from the busy central spots. We were able to walk to Potsdamer Platz in around 10-15 minutes, although it is only one stop away on the S-Bahn (getting on at Anhalter Bahnhof a few steps from the hotel). The hotel itself is very stylish, located in the old Siemens headquarters, and has been very thoughtfully designed with a tip of the hat here and there towards the old and continuing activities of the company which once owned the building. In the bar some of the tables were supported by glass insulator stacks, such as those that you see hanging from pylons. In the room the shower room door was like that which you'd find in a factory, sliding across on a rail. There was a lot of funky lighting and use of different materials to theme the look of the place. We found the staff at the front desk very pleasant, informative and efficient: just as you'd except from German staff working for a Swiss hotel chain. However, we did think it was a bit off when tried to go to bed and had to wait quite a while following our request a pillow containing man-made stuffing, as all the bedding contained feathers, which my wife is allergic to. We phoned the front desk at around 11.30pm and were told that it would take an hour and a half to get the pillow sent up. This was because there was only one staff member at the desk and they were not allowed to leave until another member of staff turned up at 1am. I wasn't able to collect it myself as the person at the desk would still have to leave to go to the store room. Our only other real criticisms were as reflected in one or two other reviews here. The hotel seems a little too eager to (over)charge for everything. Breakfast was to be a whopping 21 Euros each... It would have to be some breakfast for us to have paid that! A cheaper alternative is the Stresemann Cafe on the corner, near the S-Bahn station. The minibar in the room was also fairly expensive, as they tend to be in most hotels, and the main bar near the lobby and entrance was way overpriced at over 4.50 Euros for a 0.5l glass of beer. The inflated prices and persistent charging for everything actually put us off having a meal in the hotel's modern restaurant and we went elsewhere. We loved Berlin itself. The people were friendly, the service generally very good, there was a lot to see and a year ago would have been good value for a capital city (we got stung with the poor Pound versus Euro rate which made it an expensive visit!) Berlin isn't the prettiest of cities but there's never a shortage of things to do or places to eat and drink. There's bags of history, especially recent world history, and the people are very welcoming and keen to show what modern Germany is about. We were there during a public holiday and the avenue leading away from Brandenberg gate was heaving with people having a street party. They were mostly eating currywurst hotdogs and drinking beer to the sound of a live band. The atmosphere was lively and we joined in with the Berliners as if we belonged there! Highlights for us included seeing the remaining parts of the Berlin Wall and visiting the Jewish museum and Olympic stadium. The round trip bus tours are better value than some cities as there is a lot to see and takes around two hours to do the full tour. The public transport is excellent and a day pass covering both the U-Bahn and S-Bahn are great value for money. Get in early for the Reichstag. We queued for an hour to get in but the queue hardly moved and it was a hot day. They only seem to let a relatively small group in every half an hour. We gave up and sadly missed out on one of the main attractions. There were plenty of other places to go. We found the Sony Centre at Postdamer Platz to have a good atmoshere and ate at a couple of restaurants there. The Josty restaurant was recommended by our guidebook but we weren't impressed. We had to move to be served, the menu wasn't very logical and I paid 14 Euros for a pizza which tasted as though it was straight from a Findus or McCain factory. The waiter also stood waiting for a tip. We enjoyed the Lutter & Wegner restaurant just outside, near the shopping arcade and casino. It cost around 80 Euros for a starter, main and coffee each plus a bottle of wine. All in all a really good trip. I would happily agree that the Moevenpick Hotel was a good place to stay, but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it as somewhere vastly superior to anywhere else. That's not to say that we didn't enjoy our stay there on the whole and it was clean and very stylish in a modern way; just one or two minor irritations. Berlin is well worth visiting if you like history, museums, food, theatre, quality shopping and big city buzz.

My fiance and I were celebrating our 8 year anniversary while at the hotel, so I was willing to splurge some to have a nice room and great location. The location did not disappoint, as it is very centrally located to most of the museums and historical sites. However, my fiance and I enjoy walking and put in atleast 10 miles a day anyways, so we would have been almost as happy with any location within 15 blocks of this hotel to save on cost, as the location was not enough to warrant the price. We spent $175 a night for the basic room, and I was quite surprised with how small and cramped the room was. We had requested the highest possible floor (for a quiet room) and a view of the river, and they did grant these requests which was nice. However, the front desk staff was not particularly friendly or welcoming. We expected them to be after reading some other reviews, and at first we thought it might have been a cultural difference, but other people in Berlin at restaurants and museums were much friendlier. Everything was very clean, but the first morning the shower rod, which was apparently loose, fell on my fiance's head during his shower. We borrowed a power adaptor to charge our camera batteries from the hotel. After bringing it to our room, we discovered it didn't work, so we immediately brought it back to the front desk. They didn't have another one to lend us, which wasn't a big deal, but they accused my fiance of breaking it and asked him what he had done to it. The worst part of our experience involved laundry service. I clearly filled out the laundry form requesting that a jacket be dry cleaned and a pair of jeans be washed. As we were at a fairly expensive hotel compared to the general hotel costs in Berlin and a hotel which had a lot of amenities, I never dreamed that this service would be so lacking, so I didn't check the laundry for 1 day after receiving it back until I went to put the jeans on. They had not been washed as instructed, but dry cleaned, and they still smelled of airplane. When I told the front desk, they refused to do anything saying that we hadn't told them within 1 hour of receiving the laundry back. As we spent $600 here, I was not overly concerned about $10, but it is more about principle and how the hotel treated us. We have traveled through more than 25 countries and stayed at atleast 100 different hotels and I have never been treated like this. Before this incident, I felt that the value for what we were spending was not there, but after this incident, I am sure I will never choose this hotel or any hotel in this chain again. If you do stay at this hotel, I would definitely opt out of the breakfast and would not eat in the hotel at all. The food in the hotel is very expensive considering that food in Berlin is generally very cheap as far as big cities go. We had the breakfast 1 morning, and even at the 2 breakfasts for the cost of 1 rate, which you get with the special membership card you can sign up for for free on their website, I felt that this breakfast was majorly overpriced. At $15 per person, I would have expected a very large spread with a lot of hot breakfast choices, particularly regarding egg dishes. They would only fry eggs and there was very limited hot food. I could have easily bought a few pastries, of which they had a lot of, and a glass of juice for $5 per person elsewhere. The breakfast staff was much friendlier than the front desk staff. Regarding food in Berlin, it is easy to find great deals and high quality. I really recommend the Hasir Turkish Restaurant as well as the many kebab and falafel restaurants sprinkled through the city. They are a great value. Overall, I just don't think the value you get from this facility warranted the cost I paid. I especially expected better service from the staff.

Surprisingly quite large, but still had an intimate friendly feel to it, reception was quick and efficient and we took advantage of their upgrade offer which I took out when originally booked, basically it meant if an upgrade was available on the day you would get it at a much cheaper price - can't remember how much but it certainly made it worth while. The suite we had was room 206 on the top floor, our friends had 210 which although they paid the same wasn't a patch on ours and although equipped the same was much larger, so if you get the choice go for room 206. Probably one of quietest hotels I've ever stayed in although in a quite busy area of Berlin, other things to mention, great choice for breakfast although pretty expensive (19.50 euros) - great if you fancy stuffing your face in the morning but if you just want a bowl of cereal you can go for a cheaper option.Tried the bar one evening which was pretty good although a little quiet unfortunately, but great for a nightcap. Bars worth mentioning nearby: Solar bar which is on the top floor of a hotel within walking distance - go to your left when you come out of the Moevenpick and look for the glass lift on the outside - great views, good cocktails, not too pricey, surprised no one else has mentioned it - there's also a great little authentic German bar just around the corner (Stadtklaus) again on the left, just past the kebab place - resembled a church inside, all wooden pews and religious icons, weird really. Bar to avoid, on the crossroads as you look at it coming out of the hotel on the left again, there's one bar right on the crossroads (opposite the decent Italian people have mentioned) which is ok, but just down from that there's another bar where the landlord stunk of B.O. and made you as welcome as a f*rt in a diving suit. He even refused to serve as wheat bar as it was 'Bavarian p*ss water' according to him. The Moevenpick is really well located for all the main Berlin attractions - S-Bahn is right outside but there's plenty of good stuff nearby, Checkpoint Charlie, Topography of Terror, Brandenburg Gate, Jewish Museum - all close by, couple of other places worth a visit - classy Italian restaurant 'Sale e Tabbachi' and the 'Jazz bar' both within walking distance - Jazz bar especially worth a visit, quality beer and decent bar food, great atmosphere - if you like jazz, funk or soul - nice....

Most of the big tourist attractions of East Berlin are walkable from the hotel, (the big shopping area on Fredrich Strasse, Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag, Museum Island) and notably Check Point Charlie and the Topography of Terror which are within 5-10 mins walk. Rooms ====== The hotel is an old building which has been renovated to a good standard with a very modern finish. The bedrooms are bright, clean and spacious, with large windows which could be opened to keep the room well ventilated. Unfortunatley the aircon in the room had a relatively high minimum setting, which, had I been staying during the summer, wouldn't have kept the room cool enough for my tastes. As mentioned by other reviewers, the bathroom walls (seperating the bathroom from the bedroom) are are unusual in that they are constructed from opaque glass blocks. I didn't find this to be a problem, as they are opaque and only outlines can be viewed through them, however, the extremely shy or modest may find them to be a problem! Toiletries provided in the bathroom where functional, with the shower gel provided in a full sized unit that was fixed to the wall, making it more convientent than the small travel sizes provided by some hotels. A nice touch was the pillow 'menu' which allowed you to select your pillows from a choice of about 5 or 6 different styles. Food ==== We ate breakfast in the hotel as the breakfast buffet was included in the room rate. There was a good selection of cooked food, cereals, bread and fruit which was replenished frequently at busy times. We only had dinner in the hotel once for during out stay, on the evening of the Swiss buffet which provided a good selection of pleasant food, although nothing out of the ordinary. Value for money =============== We stayed in the hotel on their Surprisingly Different package, for 6 nights. This was a bed and breakfast rate which also included a dinner for 2 with a bottle of wine, free drinks in the bar on 2 evenings from 5-7pm, a packed lunch on a day of your choosing and 2 3 day travel passes. We enjoyed our stay and would seek out M\u00f6venpick hotels in the future following our experience in Berlin. Overall a good value package, especially for longers stays.

There was no quilt ping-pong for the night - one person throwing it down cause they were too hot and the other pulling it up.

The hotel is ideally situated for visiting the centre of the city especially potsdamer platz.

Very interesting.) There is a lot to see and do round about the hotel and the sheer weight of history is at times quite breathtaking. We regularly used the gym and by the end of the week my girlfriend was also a regular in the sauna. The restaurant serves excellent food and the bar is also very friendly.

The hotel room was very spacious, exceptionally clean and very stylish. My room was on the 4th floor. The glass wall dividing the bathroom from the main room (as you can see from my pictures) wasn't a problem. The room had a high ceiling and two twin beds, which could be pushed together. The beds were firm and comfortable. My sleep was peaceful and the room had long blackout curtains covering the windows/door of the French balcony. There was plenty of storage space within this hotel room. The room had a mini-bar (3 EUR for a 330ml Coke) and room service was available. There was a TV with CNN and BBC World available. The TV had pay-per-view with a couple of movie channels and a couple of adult movie channels. WiFi access was available (9 EUR for 2 hours and 22 EUR for 24 hours - both had restrictions on the amount that you could download within that period). The bathroom was of a good size and had a bath with an overhead shower. There was also a hairdryer, plenty of towels and the usual complimentaries. The restaurant was open until midnight. I went down about 11:15pm. The restaurant has lots of seating but there were only a couple of other diners around. There is a large glass roof which looks as though it will open when the weather is better. The food was fantastic - I really enjoyed it! There was a good selection on the menu and the staff didn't seem at all rushed, despite the time going on well past midnight. 3 courses with wine was 48 EUR. I thought this was good value, especially as the quality was so high. Breakfast is continental style, with a full range of meats, cheeses, fruit, cereal and yoghurts etc. You can also get a cooked breakfast - fried in front of you, while you wait, by one of two chefs on hand. No problems getting seated despite the size of this hotel. I think people will enjoy eating here. There was so much to choose from. Staff are friendly and efficient.

Whilst not the best location in Berlin (but still pretty good), the hotel itself was fantastic. When booking, we chose an option that would enable us to upgrade our room for a small fee if one was available. Lucky for us there was, and we were upgraded to the best hotel room I have ever stayed in. It had a massive bed, separate toilet, high ceilings, and the walk through bathroom was separated from the bedroom by a huge wall of glass bricks - very impressive. The front staff were very attentive, the breakfast was excellent - if only the weather had been better, as the restaurant has a retractable roof which means you can eat alfresco on a nice day. In terms of nighlife and cafes etc, the location is not the best, but there is a tube stop right outside the hotel. If the weather is good, it is better to walk the 10minutes down to Potzdamer Platz, where there are more lines intersecting allowing you to reach all the other parts of Berlin. I have no hesitation recommending this hotel to anyone visiting Berlin to lap up the history and see the sights as it is easily the best hotel I have stayed at. If you are looking for nightlife and cafes though, you might want to look a bit further north of alexander platz, e.g. senefelderplatz or even hackescher markt - though they are all easily accessible from the Movenpick hotel with a few trains swaps or a pretty cheap taxt ride (about 8 euro).", "Date": "October 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eastham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Good Location\u201d", "Author": "seleus", "ReviewID": "UR5926908", "Content": "Had a wonderful 3 days here in August.

Berlin was a lot better than I expected, very modern with great buildings both old and new, and there was a nice feel to the city. We thought the people of Berlin were very nice and only too willing to help us when we requested assistance.

The hotel itself is, of course, very colorful! This is done in a stylish way that makes you smile in appreciation. I liked the little details like the quotes painted on the walls and the inlaid flower designs in the hall carpets. The staff was always very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was excellent, especially that M\u00f6venpick yogurt and marmelade. We had a familly room with an extra bed for our little boy. There was a lot of space there with a very high ceiling. The bathroom was certainly large enough and stylish like the rest of the hotel. The air conditioning issue was a bit annoying, even in early October, as it didn't work so well and things got stuffy. We tried opening the window -- our window faced the inner courtyard, which is generally the quieter place to be -- but then we could hear breakfast being set-up downstairs through the courtyard's glass ceiling at 3:30 a.m. There was no pool, but there's a great-looking swim complex a street away. We didn't get there but would have liked to. There was just so much else to do!

Our room was very spacious and decorated in a very contemporary style. The bathroom in our room was huge but unfortunately we only had a bath (which was also enormous) but no shower which was a shame. Our friends' room was much smaller than ours as was the bathroom and they had a lovely shower but no bath. If you have a real preference it may be worth checking this out at time of booking as I did not read anything which told me about the difference in bathrooms. We used the sauna one day which was very nice and absolutely immaculate. The reception staff were incredibly helpful and friendly, if you want any information about the city i wouldn't hesitate to ask them. You can also buy the day/2day transport passes at reception. We bought them on our last day and ended up not using them and the nice man at reception refunded our money! We ate at the restaurant on the first night not something we had planned to do but the heavens had opened so we decided to stay put. The meal we had was truly delicious and very reasonably priced for hotel food. Our room price included breakfast and as commented by previous reviewers the breakfast is truly wonderful we were really spoilt for choice and felt it was the best breakfast we had seen in a european hotel of comparable quality. We had a lovely meal at theitalian restaurant which can be found by turning left out of the hotel and it is situated under the accor suites hotel, past a and pizza were both lovely.

I don\u2019t think the hotel is really airconditioned though, as the system will only cool it if it goes over 21C at night! Needed to open the window instead to let the cooler air in. This was fine as it was quite quiet as the windows faced into the courtyard over the restaurant. The beds were also really comfortable. There was a mini bar fridge in room, no tea/coffee facilities but I don\u2019t usually expect these in a European hotel. Good spacious bathroom, large bath and separate shower, plenty towels, kept spotless, slightly unstable controls trying to get the temperature right at peak times in the morning. Slightly quirky design with the glass brick wall around the bathroom which is at a slightly raised level above the room - the sofa and chairs are on the other side, sort of facing the loo. If you put the light on in the bathroom at night it of course illuminates the whole room. Lovely breakfast restaurant with glass roof that opens. Lots of choice \u2013 coffee brought to the table and self service food, with speciality breads, several types of cereals, yoghurts, fresh fruits, cheeses, smoked salmon, scrambled eggs, well worth having and good value compared to the cost of 4-5* hotel breakfasts in the UK.

The simple fact is that it isn't, and this detracted hugely from my enjoyment of the property.
