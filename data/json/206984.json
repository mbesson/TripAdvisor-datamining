We had 2 communicating rooms for us 4 (our 2 kids-4 and 1- my husband and I), taking advantage of their family offer: book the second room for half price. We paid 118 euros in total for these 2 rooms, which we found to be a great price. The shuttle from and to the airport is complimentary and a short 5min ride away. The subway station is a short walk (100m) away and only minutes from the city center. We even cabbed it for the return as the kids were exhausted and only paid 10euros for the ride. The rooms are new, modern and clean. Each room has either 2 double beds or a Queen size bed, as well as a sofa bed. Black out blinds made the rooms nice and dark. The bathrooms were nice: new and large. No bathtub, only shower. The AC can be set to whatever you want it. The hotel had a very nice pool, and it was full of kids, friends for our kids to play with. The restaurant had a nice patio to eat outside, with a very good children's menu. The food was ok, a bit expensive though as far as quantity/price, especially when you compare it to Madrid restaurants. All in all a really nice family hotel where we plan to stay when we go to Madrid with our kids.", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cIt's OK.

What do I like about it: > It's very close to the airport - great if you arrive late or need to rush off after a meeting > It has a metro stop very near > It is metres from my client's office > It's quiet > It has an amazing huge park right next door Have stayed further into town before now but it's noisy and busy and full of car fumes. This hotel yes is a little way out of town but that makes it a quiet location. And the park is fantastic - great for running, walking and cycling. With water running round it to boot - and that's a rare thing for Madrid - water !! I would consider staying here for leisure because of that fact. BUT unlike the previous reviewer - NO NO NO - don't ever eat dinner in a Spanish hotel restaurant unless you are staing 5*. It's a fairly miserable experience. The metro is cheap and clean and taxis are the same. If I was staying here for leisure with the kids I would eat Spanish style for lunch = big and long in the centre of town and then return for a snack at the hotel. The rooms are just fine - very clean, quite modern and room enough for 2 but probably yes a little small with 2 kids on top of that ! And the pool is just right - though not heated and salt water - that was a shock when I lept in after an hour's run round the park in 25 degrees heat !!", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely an airport hotel with nothing much around it\u201d", "Author": "Mariafromnz", "ReviewID": "UR139482452", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in August on our way back home to London. We chose it because it is close to the airport, and also because the price was far more reasonable than hotels in the centre of Madrid. Also, it offered 'family' rooms when not a lot of hotels do. The family room consisted of a double bed and sofa bed that converted into 2 single beds for the children. It was fine, except the room was cramped even without the sofa bed extended. The bathroom was also small, and an odd configuration with the toilet against one wall, a bidet next to the toilet and in front of the bath. The room was quiet however, and seemed fairly clean. The hotel also had a pool, which was great for the kids. The hotel had a restaurant which we ate lunch and dinner at. The food was ok- standard fare - and they only offered burger and fries, pizza and fries or fish fingers and fries for the kids. The food that we had for lunch was doused in so much oil that it was almost inedible. The night that we ate in the hotel the wait for our food was around 45 minutes, which considering the time and the fact that we had children with us was inexcusable. We asked for a discount on the total food bill for our stay (which consisted of lunch, dinner and breakfast for 2 days) and all they offered was 20Euro, which I felt was not very generous at all. There is a hotel literally next door to this one (the Pullman) and it had a couple of restaurants. We tried the cafe one evening and although the food was pleasant, there wasn't much of it for what they charged, and again, service was extremely slow. Staff at the Novotel were a mixed bag. Some were friendly, others were not very approachable and made us feel like we were being annoying. The area around the hotel is mainly offices it seems and there is literally nowhere else nearby to eat. There is a shopping centre about 10mins walk away, but that only has fast food chain restaurants. The hotel is located close to the metro and it's 2 traiins into the centre of madrid, which is quite convenient.

The hotel pick up point is difficult to find but is well marked. But once you find it and get onto the van the hotel is close by.

From the metro it is 10 minute walk to the hotel which can be taxing with luggage so it is worth waiting 30 minutes for the hotel shuttle.

The automatic window blinds are great 3. The internet is free but the connection is always getting off and on 4. The breakfast is good Bad points 1. The location is excellent for the convention centres close by but needs 30 minutes of Metro travel and two line changes to reach the city centre. The Metro is cheap at 1 euro/ trip. Probably cheapest in Europe. The quickest connection to the Centre is to take Line 8 from Campo to Columbia and then take Line 8 (Purple) to Princepe De Vegara and finally the Red line (Line 2) to Sol or Opera to reach most of the important places in Central Madrid 2. The hotel being located so far there are few options for eating and drinking other than the overpriced hotel restaurant. There is a large super market about a km from the hotel and some restaurants including a Mac Donalds. 3.

The only problem with the room was a toilet that decided to block with fairly unpleasant results - not what you expect in a modern 4 star hotel. Luckily it happened when we were packed and ready to go so it wasn't a big problem for us. The food was indifferent and incredibly expensive. Four club sandwiches and four soft drinks = 35 euros! Outrageous! The buffet breakfast was ghastly, the hot food was stone cold and the different food items were randomly placed on tables around the restaurant with the result that we kept discovering new items to eat as the meal went on. Which was just as well as I've never had cold bacon and eggs before and had to leave it after the first mouthful. Don't pay extra for the breakfast, it's not worth it. Without exception the staff were miserable and did as little as they needed to do. This caused a big problem as we were travelling with our two teenage daughters, both over 16 years and although the web site had let me book a room for two people this apparantly wasn't allowed so when we checked in I was told I'd need another room... for a further 80 euros. My daughter is fluent in Spanish (I know none) and she attempted to negotiate a compromise but the receptionist was having none of it. This same receptionist then spoke to a colleague in Spanish in a most disparaging way about me, I know this as my daughter heard it and translated it for me. All the while this went on there was a receptionist nearby who spoke good English, we know this because we heard her with another client, who steadfastly refused to get involved. Rather than ruin a precious weekend away with our kids I paid up and we had the second, unnecessary, room. When I got home I took this up with Novotel who, to be fair, have apologised and offered me a free night which I intend to use. The sad thing is, it was probably my fault in the first place but the rude and unhelpful attitude of the staff made me dig my heels in. I should mention that if you are visiting Madrid city the hotel is not well placed but it is brilliant for the airport and conference area. It is a 2 minute walk from the Metro station and a 20 minute train ride into town. The hotel operates a courtesy bus to the airport which we used and that at least worked perfectly.

The rooms are pretty nice, especially considering the price. And there is a free business center in the lobby! The hotel is located in a business area so there are plenty of cheap restaurants open during the week. We went on a weekend so some of the close cafeteria style restaurants were closed. We just took a short walk and found a great restaurant: Turn right out of the hotel and make a left when you get to the road. This should be Av de Capital d'Espana Madrid. At the roundabout (with a statue in the middle of it) look for a big McDonald's \"M\" in the distance and head towards it. Turn left just before you get to McD. It is called FresCo. It is 10 EURO for dinner all-you-can-eat including a soda. Great deal and yummy. There are also some other restaurants in this same area, probably only a 10 minute walk from the hotel. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant since it was quite expensive. I wouldn't really recommend staying here if you are visiting Madrid on vacation (though it is close to a metro stop if you want to go into downtown for the day) since it is more of a business hotel in a business area.

We had a non-smoking room, but I think that simply means a live smoke isn't present. The A/C system pumps smoke into your room regardless and your pillows, towels, and sheets stink like smoke. I live in Europe so I'm fairly used to smoke, but wow, this was like renting an ashtray. The carpet was stained, you need to pay to watch tv, the breakfast was free but you can only eat so much dried ham, chocolate donuts, and stale cereal.
