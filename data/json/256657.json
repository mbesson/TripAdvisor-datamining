Basically, you pay for a room and get little else. The rooms are fine - the same you would see at any hotel in any big, international city - but they don't offer anything really unique or special. I am sure I would feel differently if I had a room with a view, so I should put it out there that I didn't have a harbour view. For me, hotels are mainly a place to relax after a long day of sightseeing, so I don't need much, and this room certainly delivered. However, I would have expected a bit more given the price (you have to pay extra for breakfast, either in your room rate or at the restaurant), and the image they seemed to want to have. Examples: - They didn't even have the basic digital free-to-air channels. Instead, they give you Fox and Fox Sports. It seemed to me that they wanted you to pay for movies, and that this was their sneaky way of doing it. That, and the fact that every time you turned on the tele it automatically went to the screen trying to sell you movies. - They advertise a fitness centre, which I used, but which I was very disappointed in. The treadmills were broken for the duration of the stay, and the other equipment was pretty average. The dumbbells only went up to 7 kg! I am a 50 kg female, and that's not even enough for me to bicep curls with, let alone exercises like squats, etc. Not sure what a larger person would think... I know these are fairly minor complaints, but my point is just that this is one of those hotels that provides nothing for free. Your room rate will pay for a place to stay and not much else. if you have a deluxe room, then you will have access to a fitness 'centre', but don't expect a great workout.

We were quite impressed with the romantic atmosphere and the view of the harbour. We wanted to have a bite in the CBD, but the front office staff suggested us to go to the restaurant located on the 25th floor, and I was very happy with my choice. Prices are reasonable if you consider the the darkish and relaxed atmosphere, facing the harbour bridge and the city skyline. Food is good and staff is very friendly. We had a lazy morning and did not have breakfasts the following day as we had to get ready for the wedding party on Saturday. We ask to order a taxi, and the reception mentioned that there are plenty cabs available in the street next to the hotel, so it was not a problem to find one straight away. When we came back from the party in the middle of the night, a security guard checked our IDs and politely let us in.

Upon return to Melbourne, I got greeted by 2 bills for a bottle of wine ($30) and movie charge ($16.95) -- both of which we did not consume. I called on 18 May to dispute the bill. A duty manager called me today and said he would reverse the charge for the wine, and INSISTED that I watched 2 movies instead of one, hence this extra bill! During my checkout at the hotel on 8 May, we went through this same motion with the lady who checked us out, and agreed to bill us one instead of two movies. We had a change of room because the first room's movie did not work, and the 2nd room did not work and we left the room for dinner. And after dinner we came back and found that the movie system was working, we then watched a movie and paid for it. I asked the duty manager today could it be that the movie started playing after we left the room for dinner. He had the cheek to lecture me I SHOULD have turned off the TV before I left. He insisted that the system recorded a longer time of the movie that would justify 2 movies instead of one. I told him I am not going to pay for the system's fault as the movie was not working in the new room when for dinner. In fact the very system stuffed us up, such that we have to switch rooms! We even gave a feedback to the duty manager that day as we left the lobby that the room's movie was not working either. The worst customer experience ever is today's phone call. I had a duty manager who was rude and determined to quarrel with me on the phone. He was extremely argumentative and refused to listen. While I was talking and explaining, he was talking too, in fact he raised his voice at me. I reminded him I am the customer and he was not listening, and I would complain to his management. He told me to \"go ahead\". AND, I did. Why as a customer do I have to feel being prosecuted ? Instead of pacifying me, I left call extremely disappointed and furious. If the hotel made the mistake of mischarging me for wine that I did not consume, promised us a room with a working movie system but only to not work when we checked in, accused me of watching something I did not, how can we trust this is a fair call? Look, I have flown my husband in for a birthday weekend in Sydney, packed with surprises and little adventures. Did you really think I am that dodgy to want to avoid paying $16.95??? I am addressing the bigger issue here. Whoever that is going to respond to me here, please think twice before you defend company staff.

However, the rest of the room and hotel left much to be desired. I have travelled through much of Europe, and this was definitely a 3 star tourist class hotel, NOT 4 star as advertised. The 'King' sized bed was two (EXTREMELY) hard singles pushed together. The pillows were also quite closely related to bricks, which all in all made for two very uncomfortable nights! The room was a little cramped due to the unnecessary cot bed that was between the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bed and two chairs/window. The bathroom was quite dated, with no exhaust fan which wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ideal, seeing as there was no window in the bathroom. This meant in order to have a shower and not pass out from the steam, the bathroom door needed to be left open while showering. Also not great as the toilet was in the bathroom as well. Enough said. The shower head was new and had good water pressure etc, but was too low down for male guests, my partner is just under 6foot and he had to duck to wash his hair which wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too convenient. The rooms were quiet other than the last night when some drunken guests came home at 3am, which is not the hotel's fault though. The service we received from the staff varied, some were lovely (the concierges were great), while some breakfast staff didn't seem to speak much English and would run away when you tried to get their attention (they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow us to get more tea and coffee for ourselves so we had reason to try and get their attention). The breakfast was one high note, it was of good quality and quantity, but the staff wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let you pick the table you wished to dine at which was odd.

I knew something was wrong when the woman at the front desk had to keep going to the back room to see the manager. The check in woman, Jessie Lu, was very nice and politely asked us to sit down and wait. We waited about 20 minutes and Jessie Lu was nice enough to come over and bring us our check in cards and had upgraded us to a city view room. I thought this was fair and maybe even worth the wait as our room had a great view of the city, park and the bridge. The room was clean and modern and decorated in very minimalist furniture. This was neither bad or good, just very modern. I thought the beds were comfortable although they don't give you a comforter, you only get a sheet and a thin coverlet. I don't know if that is standard and the usual in Australia. I had the same thing on my bed in Thailand. Anyhow, the room was nice with 2 sitting couch chairs and a desk, I felt like we had room for all our stuff. The bathroom was clean. The bathtub wasn't really big enough to soak and take a real comfortable bath but the shower did it's job. But the light in the bathroom had some type of fuse or electrical problem as it'd flash on and off on occasion and sometimes we would even hear noise of an electric spark. We asked for a non-smoking room which I assume is on a non-smoking floor but a handful of times, we would smell smoke in the hallway when we were leaving and coming back to our room. We assumed someone was smoking in their room that wasn't supposed too. Another guest noticed that as well. On New Year's Eve day we had to walk a few blocks to pick up a bag of ice to chill our drinks (no ice machines). When we came back in the afternoon, there was a notice from the hotel slipped under the door saying that they would bring ice to our room for a fee. If we had known about this option the night before we wouldn't have schlepped a bag of ice back to our hotel room. When we called and requested just the ice bucket, we were infromed that we would still be charged the delivery fee. So our bathroom sink made for a makeshift champagne chiller.

Our accom fell through the morning of our trip and we found a room on Lastminute.com.au. The room was very modern, facing William St and had recently been renovated (end of 2007). A crib was ready in the room for our baby, and it was very comfortable. The hallways smelled of smoke, but our room didn't, and we were very happy for the discount rate. The second night my husband went to reception to request an upgrade at 5:30pm as our baby doesn't sleep well in the same room as us, and the bathroom was too small for the crib to fit. We were given a suite facing the harbour and moved immediately. My husband said I didn't want to know how much extra it was. I was disappointed that we didn't get a good rate for the upgrade, especially as the room would have been empty for the night. It would have been great customer service to have been given the upgrade for a nominal fee to cover housekeeping (maybe the full price of the room we originally stayed in). The suite was fantastic. The living area and sleeping area both had their own entrances. We were able to put our baby to sleep at 6pm in the closed off living area, and then use the sleeping area for watching TV, having dinner (table and chairs provided), using the bathroom, and one of us popping out to grab some takeaway in Darlinghurst. The views were absolutely magnificent, stretching from the city to the ocean (see my pics attached - sunrise). The hotel is a great spot; walking distance to the city, right near all the great cafes in Potts Point, 2 supermarkets, a short walk to the wharf, Hyde Park, and the great restaurants of Darlinghurst. Just avoid Kings Cross at night if you feel uncomfortable with the seedy side of Sydney. I found the car parking to be too expensive ($20+), and very difficult to get into and out of.

The problems took over an hour to recify, yet, we still ended up with all rooms being on different floors. We had to make 4 room changes just to get the correct amount of beds for what had been booked & paid for. Reception sent us to several rooms, to then discover only a single or double bed in there. Do they not have a list that says how many beds are in each room? Reception staff seemed unhelpful and didnt seem to understand the stress they had caused for everyone. We were unable to all sit in the one room prior to the night out, this being the reason interconnecting rooms was booked. No apology was given nor concern for the fact that sorting the rooms out had made us late for the dinner booked. To access the lift and rooms requires a swipe card. Twice we were given cards that didnt work. They were also only able to give us 2 per room, despite 3 people being booked for each room.
