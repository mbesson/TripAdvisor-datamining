{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great little hotel We stayed here for 5 days over New Year. The staff did not speak a lot of English but were very helpful and went out of their way to help us. The hotel was warm and clean and very well located although hard to find - we travelled from Beijing airport on the bus and then on foot to the hotel. Not many tourists in this area but very close to the subway which was excellent", "Date": "Feb 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR849016470", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "roblizBrisbane"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d582676-r6810176-Zhongyan_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "582676", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
