We received official confirmation from the booking agent. when we arrived to check in at the hotel we were informed that they had no room for us. The receptionist apologised but was quick to blame the internet booking agent. He told us that he had only received notice of our coming that very morning. He told us that there was nothing to worry about and that he had gone and arranged alternative accommodation for us at a nearby hotel. We were annoyed and disappointed but at that stage we were tired from our travelling and were just looking forward to a nice hot shower. We asked the receptionist to confirm that the hotel they had moved us to was of equal or better standard, to which he replied 'yes.' What was passed off as a replacement was the most shocking, disgusting dump we have ever stayed in. I won't name the ther hotel because in fairness we did not choose to stay there in the first place. It was only 2* at best, no breakfast included (which we had actually paid for in Barberini), NO IRON!!!, the list goes on. Needless to stay we were furious at this shoddy treatment. When I called the Barberini Suites to vent my anger I was met with ignorance, beligerance and a don't care attitude. So while I can't review the Barberini suites ( as we never set foot in a room in the place) I can say this with great certainty. Stay as far away from this place as you can. They have only 8 rooms and obviously oversell as policy. No offer of alternative accommodation, refund, reduction, NOTHING. It pretty much ruined our weekend. I was considering writing this the day we returned home but thought I'd cool down and let it be. But they don't deserve that. Rome is a great city but this hotel is an embarrassment to all things Italian. STAY AWAY.", "Date": "May 25, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Barberini Suites", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d1533075-Reviews-Barberini_Suites-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$119 - $258*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via del Tritone 102</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00187</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1533075", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/7f/e3/7fe375581b04cf3d0d1b940e8612b6361large.jpg"}}
