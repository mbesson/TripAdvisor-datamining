But there was no disturbance from thhose facilities. The access to the city is simple, one bus passing in front of the hotel and two underground stations at 10-12 minutes walking.

For a different evening when it's raining outside there is access to a small gym/sauna and steam room. While small it was just a fantastic bonus. There is also a jacuzzi although this was out of service during our stay. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. The buffet breakfast was a great start to the day.

Cheapest airport transfer we have ever used! Machines at the airport train station. Trains leave at 08 and 38. We got off at Paseig de Gracia and then transferred to the L4 metro yellow line direct La Pau. We then tried to avoid changing at Passieg de Gracia as it is a lot of going up and down stairs and a very long walkway! We got off at Selva de Mar (exit Selva de Mar not Prozenca) and followed the road Selva de Mar to the sea then turned right. Hotel was 2 blocks along. took about 10mins. Room was fine for the 3 of us (2adults &1 child). No tea or coffee facilities in room but you can get a coffee in the bar for less than \u20ac2. Beer was also reasonable for a hotel. Beds were very comfy and bathroom was a good size. Breakfasts were fine- the cheese with the black rind was gorgeous! We ate in the hotel one night. Opens at 8.30pm. \u20ac15 set meal was good value. 3 courses with glass of wine, bread and olives. We had steak which was nice enough. Didn't use gym didn't realise there was a jacuzzi as would have brought our cozzies. Diagonal Mar Shopping centre was 10 min walk away and there was a big supermarket to stock up on water and snacks. It was nice having the beach across the road and if it was warmer we would have used it. We did walk from la Ramblas and it took about an hour but lovely promenade.

We were delayed at the airport due to an Air traffic control in France and when we called the hotel they put us in the last available room without any fuss as all. The only downside to the room was that in the morning you got woken by other doors shutting and making the room shake!! We never took the metro but a station was very close by. We did go on the \"Bus Touristic\" and recommend this in order to see as much of Barcelona as you can. It stops at all the major attractions and you can jump on and off as much as you like for no extra cost. The closest stop is a 2 minute walk so is easy from this hotel.

We were told it doesn\u2019t get switched on until around Easter time regardless off the temperature outside. Therefore our room was very warm indeed. A rather unsatisfactory answer in my opinion! The hotel food was fairly standard. The breakfast buffet consisted of cold meats, cheese, fruit and croissants/pastries. The hot buffet however left a lot to be desired \u2013 consisting of the same 3 items each day \u2013 scrambled egg drenched in oil, mini sausages and broccoli (!). The hotel offers lunch and dinner but with a limited menu. The restaurant doesn\u2019t open in the evening until 8.30pm which we found inconvenient - it was usually empty. The bar/lounge has a much better menu which was available most of the day. There is a large shopping complex nearby (about 10min walk away) called Diagonal Mar.

You are at least a 7 to 10 Euro taxi ride to anything that you would want to see or do - except the beach. It is very close to it and it has a beautiful boardwalk that runs along the coast. In fact, I really enjoyed walking the boardwalk to the Pullman hotel that my colleagues were staying in (30 minute walk up the beach). Be aware, it is close to the beach but not the high traffic/restaurant area of the beach. A bus did stop in front of the hotel but I didn't use it. When I arrived at the hotel the reception staff were nice, bilingual, and helpful. However, there were no offers to take my bags (coming or going) and/or luggage cart that I saw. The hotel room was medium size for European standards but most North American visitors will think it small. The bed was comfortable, pillows were thin and firm. I was on the 10th floor and heard no traffic below or much of any sounds in the hotel. The room was clean and neat. The shower had excellent pressure and it came with a bathrobe and 2 bath towels. The room came with wireless internet and found it to be of a reasonable quality. The downside is that you can only authenticate one device at a time, not good for those with laptops, tablets, and phones. Room service was pretty quick (20 min.). The food was okay at a reasonable price - for hotel room service. The two times I had it the staff answering the phone were not fully bilingual which limited special orders, however, I was in Spain so I didn't have expectations of everyone being bilingual in the hotel. They were polite and seemed to have tried their best. The breakfast buffet was good. Decent selection of pastries, bread, meats, etc. It somewhat changed from day to day allowing you to eat there almost everyday without getting overly bored of it.

I had read many reviews on here about getting to the hotel from the airport, so decided to take the bus rather than the easy taxi journey. It was a little bit confusing and hectic to figure out but as soon as you did it was a doddle. This hotel is quite out of the hustle and bustle of main Barcelona city and you do have to get on a bus to get to Las Ramblas but i prefered this. The hotel is situated on the sea front (however you do have to cross a very busy main road to get to the beach), but the beach is definitely worth a visit - it was warm enough in May for us to both lie for a few hours of chilled sunbathing (watch out for the nudists tho - we were a little surprised to see men sunbathing naked there as we hadnt read any reviews stating this). Our room was small but comfortable and modernly decorated - unfortunately we didnt have a sea view but had a view of a park are behind the hotel which was ok. The main lobby area was very modern too and breakfast in the restaurant was lovely. If you come out of the main door of the hotel you would walk to your right to catch the bus into the main centre. If you turn left out of the doors you can walk a few minutes, take another left to Diagonal Mar shopping centre - this has restaurants and shops galore and is great...wish we'd had found it on the first night. We did the Nou Camp Open top bus tour route whilst there - definitely worth doing as you get to see some great historic sites including the cathedral, but remember suncream for your shoulders if your on the top deck in the summer months! Now i know how to get around Barcelona i would definitely go again and would consider staying at this hotel again, as i do like to walk whilst on holiday - however if you prefer to have the nightlife and main stretch at your feet i would stay nearer to the city centre.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rotterdam", "Title": "\u201cgreat place\u201d", "Author": "CarineSlot", "ReviewID": "UR122568333", "Content": "Friendly people, big and comfortable rooms, seasight close to the beach and the promenade and close to public transportation.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford, UK", "Title": "\u201cPleasant Stay in Hotel Near the Beach\u201d", "Author": "MrStraightTalker", "ReviewID": "UR121988146", "Content": "This hotel is very close to Barcelona beach, only separated by a main road.

We got off at Poblenou, but Selva de Mar is actually a bit nearer the hotel. Although we had booked a 'superior' (standard) room, we got upgraded to a sea-view room, which was excellent. The view was great and we saw the sunrise every morning. The room was in very good decorative condition, had a modern TV and a lovely bathroom, with lots of nice shower gels, shampoos etc, It had a bath and a shower over the bath. There was plenty of storage space and a safe. There was also a mini bar which we used to keep our bottled water cool. The only thing missing was a kettle and tea/coffee things. They even have free wifi . You have to ask about it at reception. The service was excellent too. I broke a glass and we put the wrong code in the safe and locked it with our things in it. When I told reception about both things they dealt with them very quickly - in about 2 minutes someone came to vacuum any remaining glass off the floor and within about 7 minutes someone came to sort the safe out. The reception staff were very helpful too - they rang a restaurant for us as our spanish is not so good. Breakfast was good, apart from the hot stuff (undercooked bacon & frankfurters) although the scrambled eggs were good. There was cold meat, cheese, hard boiled eggs, bread (and a toaster), lovely fresh pastries, cereal, yogurt (plain only), various juices, tea, coffee, hot chocolate - all self service. The restaurant had a E15 menu with 3 courses and a drink. We didn't try it as my husband didn't fancy anything on the menu (its a matter of personal taste!). We ate at the Chinese restaurant next door (Orilla de Mar) which was pretty standard chinese fare. We used the hop on/hop off bus to get into town. The green route stops just outside the hotel - don't believe the Turisme website which says the green route stops in September - it runs all the year round. You can get a pack from the hotel which has a discount voucher for the bus and a map of barcelona and get your ticket (for 1 or 2 days) the first time you use the bus.

This is a business hotel, they're not geared up for kids to be running around, nor do they have a play area, if it's what your family need then think again, this was not a problem for us with a 12 year old but it maybe if you have little one's. The staff were as helpful as we needed them to be, no problems there. Due to other reviews we opted to eat breakfast at the local restuarants a 3min walk away, they have a good variety of food including a fry up if you just can't live without one, much better value for money. For travel to the centre of Barcelona this is a good location, the 41 bus stops on the corner of the hotel and takes 15mins to Catalunya. The train station is a 10min walk and so is the shopping centre which has all you could need including food shops and restaurants, there are supermarkets behind the hotel which I recommend you buy your drinks from to store in the mini bar, unless you don't mind spending the extra on hotel prices. The beach, is a walk across the road and a fabulous bonus either before or after visiting all the amazing sights Barcelona has to offer. Be warned it is a topless beach but the Spanish are very blaze and this makes it a comfortable atmosphere,not sleazy. What a beautiful city this is. Everything you could ever want to buy is here, if you like to shop, you will not be disappointed, the architecture is incredible and the variety of food is plentiful. Take your walking shoes, each corner we turned had a new adventure, we seemed to stumble across so many surprises on our way around the city. The Gaudi is of course a must. Buy yourself a T10 card and every bus/ train journey will only cost 80 cents as apposed to 1.40 euro a trip. The Picasso museum is free on the first Sunday of every month after 3pm, the queues are endless but we went back around 5.30pm and had a 5min wait. We decided not to spend 40 euros each way on taxis to and from the airport and opted for the very easy service of the Aerobus, 5 euros each into Catalunya then the 41 to the hotel. We didn't try the food at the hotel, there were so many other places near by and we were out all day till late so we ate at the lovley places we came across, this was a nicer cultural experience rather than the same crowd of guests every day at the tables.

The hotel manager told us they did not offer that service, but he said he would inform the staff of our early arrival and try to help accommodate us.

The room itself was clean and spacious for a European hotel room. Our room was on the seventh floor and the beach view was excellent. The king bed was made of two double beds, and firm, but we still slept great. The shower was the best shower I have ever had in a hotel room. Being a big tall guy, I appreciated the ability to lift the shower head and pressure enough to massage a rhino. The television was small and outdated. Half of the 19 cable channels were blurry and only 2 \u00bd were in English. Two news, and the half a music video channel that covered many 1980\u2019s American hits, and odd ball varieties. Luckily I planned for this and brought a group of DVD\u2019s for the laptop, and used Netflix streamed from the Wi-Fi. You have to send a code to your cell phone and sign up for their Wi-Fi information. We did not have a GSM network phone so we had to get the sign-in information from the front desk. When we walked into the room we had to use one of the key cards to turn the power and air on. This became a bit of a problem considering the air conditioning barely worked. The window opens, but it sucks all of the air right out. We were here in April, the room got very warm during the day, so I would hate to see how hot the room was in July. It made taking a nap in the afternoon hard at times. The refrigerator for the mini bar was also warm, and the ice machine on the first floor was busted. Buying drinks around the corner is also a better deal for \u20ac 1 v. mini bar \u20ac3. Room service works out to be a better deal than some of the restaurants at times. One night we ordered the steak and salad with cheesecake, chocolate currant and cinnamon ice cream, and three cokes for \u20ac53. That may sound expensive here, but the restaurants around the corner will run you the same amount. The breakfast buffet in the restaurant was good, but the selection gets tiring in a few days. There are a few outdoor cafes less than a block away. We ate at the Modernista caf\u00e9 a few mornings. On the way to the subway there is a shop called Sweet Mas that any sweet tooth will enjoy. After one in the morning you will be lucky to find any food anywhere, and the breakfast buffet closes down at 10:30. Keep that in mind if you have a long night. The Poblenou station is a good 10min walk. Don\u2019t forget to check out the Poblenou Rambla, and the graveyard is a fifteen minute walk away. Condis supermarket is on the way to the station. The bus turistica is on the corner, but I found the subway faster getting around the city. Checkout the skateboarding park near the beach I would recommend the hotel add some alarm clocks, upgrade their televisions, add a handle to the safe, and get the air conditioners in the rooms working like the air conditioners in the lobby.

The hotel itself is also very comfortable, a good bed, internet connection, television, breakfast with a excellent spread.

Pros: large room and bath room, beach's view, really clean. fitness facilities. internet access (free) plus the possible to store the luggage before leaving. Cons: It is quite far from the Metro (10-15 min walk) . Yes there is a bus with the stops near to the hotel but it only takes us to Catalunya and we have to take another transport to get anywhere else. So basically, if you are doing a serious site seeing in town, it doens't worth to get back to the hotel and head out again for lunch/dinner. Upon our arrivals (around mid day) , the front desk sent us to a room which has already been occupied. Of course, it would have been a serious problem if someone had stayed in the room. So OK ! we changed the rooms but the lock in the room didn't work. By the time this is sorted, we lost our afternoon. So, overall, if you have a few days to spend in BCN, you better stay nearer to the city or to the Metro line. tips: would strongly advise you to get a bus map of BCN. Metro is good but buses allow you more options. You can get it from the tourist information centres which dotted around the city or get it from the transport office at Sant station. If you walk from the hotel towards Poblenou station, there are some mini marts which are good to get some nibbles and fruits or drinks. Best to go to Sagrada Familiar at the opening time.

We had two rooms since they don't allow more than 3 to a room. The rooms were very clean and the beds were very nice and comfortable. We had a nice view of the ocen from our room. The bathrooms are fantastic as many other reviewers have said, very roomy with a nice shower and plumbing fixtures. Free wireless internet was spotty from the room, but worked perfect in the lobby. They had two complimentory computers in the lobby, but they stayed busy. The plugs in the rooms are the standard European version so remember to bring your converters. Our flight from the US arrived at 8:30am so we took a taxi to the hotel arriving around 10:00 a.m. after clearing customs and locating a taxi. My brother-in-law also traveled with us and we learned that the taxis in Barcelona only hold a maximum of 4 passengers, so we took two from the airport. The Taxi ride for one cab ran us around $50 U.S. The hotel was full upon arrival and told us they would store our luggage behind the counter but couldn't offer us our rooms until 3:00 p.m., which was understandable. We had read reviews about the Diagonal Mar Mall not too far from the Hotel so we walked there for lunch. It is a very nice multi-story mall which includes a super market and many dining options, however most of them don't open until later in the day. The locals eat later lunches and much later dinners that we are accustomed to in the U.S. The McDonalds and other fast food places were open though so we had no problem finding a place to eat. The prices were much more reasonable at the food court at the mall than most restaurants we spotted nearby. Several reviewers said that the Chinese food at the restuarant next to the hotel was good and inexpensive. We at there one evening and thought it was pretty gross. Most of us had sweet and sour chicken which looked like they had put preformed chicken balls in some red sauce and added a can of fruit cocktail, NASTY. Also they don't even serve rice with their dinner entrees, rice has to be ordered separately which makes it not so cheap in the end. Don't bother with this place. Many of the restaurants you see near the hotel have the same signs on their sidewalks that have pictures of various plates of food that all look the same. I think they all have some sort of \"frozen\" entrees they buy they buy from the same supplier and just pop in an oven. For example we ordered Pizzas at one of them near the hotel and asked if we could remove the Anchovies from the pizza and they said no. Ha! Don't bother with these places either. They are perfect to stop and have a local beer and rest for a while, but not really for a decent dinner. We used the bus that stops on the Hotel corner to take us to Las Rambles our second day and it went smoothly and easy. However we got on the same number bus to come home and obviously we should have asked more questions because it ran a very long route and then made us pay again before it finally got us to the hotel an hour and a half later. It was a nice sight seeing tour though. The next day we took the subway back and it was much faster and cheaper since we only had to pay once! We learned to ask the price at the sandwich shops around Las Rambles before you pick one out. We stopped at a \"chain\" sandwich shop that has all of the sandwiches ready and sitting out. I pointed at two small sandwiches and my wife grabbed a can of coke from their refridgerator and the guy could tell we were tourists so after he heated them up he charged me 24 Euros! A couple of blocks away, we saw another location of same sandwich shop chain and I asked the prices and learned that the price should have been 12 Euros. Oh well, live and learn.

When we arrived and came to the front desk to check in we were ignored for a 5 minutes or so by the staff while they did absolutely nothing. Finally they took notice and took another 5 minutes to get us our room assignment and key while looking at us and talking to us in an angry tone as if we had done something wrong. We had specifically booked a non-smoking room when we made our reservations using Travelocity, but when we got to the room it reeked of cigarette smoke and caused an asthma induced coughing fit within a couple minutes That was really too bad because the room itself was well furnished, decorated, seemed bigger than a standard hotel room, and had a great view of the beach. After we trekked back down to the front desk ,and waited another 5 or more minutes for no good reason, we had to deal with the same rude front desk staff person and she kept insisting we did not request a non-smoking room and told us no other room was available and we would have to check back in another 30 minutes to an hour. At the point we just couldn't take it anymore and started giving the front desk staff person a piece of our mind and within a couple of minutes a non-smoking room magically became available. We went up to it and were disappointed that it was not quite as well appointed as our original room and had a view of other hotels and buildings instead of the ocean--but at least it did not smell of smoke and so there was no need to fear of an asthma attack from it. If we had to do it all over again we would have just called up Travelocity and made them fix it, I don't know why we didn't think of that at the time.

Barcelona itself is expensive, and if you don't eat more than one item with a cup of coffee, don't pay the extra 10 EUR/day to add to your hotel cost. There were 4 perfectly good restaurants literally one block down on the seafront side of the hotel, 2 of which served excellent breakfast for less than 5 EUR. Service is what impressed me. I noticed the room policy was if you had laundry, to place it in the bag provided and leave it on your bed and you would receive it after 5pm the enext day, but that same day service cost double the regular price. I was impressed to find that not only was my laundry returned to me the same day, but there was no extra cost for doing so.

Rooms were cleaned by staff every day, and even the bath looked like a brand new one with everything back in its place, or replaced, as the day you checked in. So it was a great bang for the buck.

The room was pretty average, with neutral decor and one large crinkled poster framed on the wall. Our refrigerator seemed to have issues, in that it smelled quite rotten and didn't keep our champagne cold, but as long as we didn't open it too much, that was okay. It would have been nice to have in-room coffee & tea service. This seems like a small change that would be easy to implement and would make one's stay more comfortable. We tried ordering peppermint tea two mornings in a row from room service (once in English, once in Spanish), and both times, we were brought black tea. Something was lost in translation there... There were two quite exceptional things about the room. The bathroom was great - very spacious with an *excellent* shower (which did result in a slightly wet bathroom after use, as another reviewer commented on). The bed was also fantastic- absolutely huge and very, very comfortable. In addition, the window with panoramic sea views was brilliant as well. As we were on a high floor in the hotel, it made for excellent people watching. Housekeeping did an excellent job keeping the room looking tidy, but we were a little disappointed to see that the champagne glasses we had brought with us were cleared away by the housekeeping staff after our first day at the hotel. We called reception and requested 2 more to be brought up, which they kindly did. Those were cleared away the next day too, so when we requested 2 more glasses on our final evening there, we thought it would be no problem to just borrow 2 more hotel glasses. However, this time we ended up calling 3 times over the course of an hour, and were told (by the third time) by a very curt individual at the front desk that they were very busy and we would have to wait until they had a moment to bring our glasses. This was at 6PM. Our glasses never arrived that evening. A bit of a poor show, if you ask me. In general, the staff at the front desk seemed hit or miss in terms of helpfulness and general interest in customer satisfaction. I must commend one gentleman in particular, who seemed to go out of his way to help me relocate a ring I mistakenly left in the restroom off the restaurant on the ground floor, and for that I am incredibly grateful. Other individuals seemed to convey a too-cool attitude or were just downright unfriendly. A little staff training might go a long way in the customer service department. Overall, I'd say it was a pretty average hotel. If you can find a rate for less than EUR100/night, I'd recommend considering staying there. As is, we were paying slightly more than \u00a3100/night, and I don't think it was worth that cost.

Black out curtains are in the room as the rooms are east facing and very bright in the early morning sun. Towels changed daily, the place was gleeming. Complimentary toiletries range from the normal shampoo etc to comb, toothbrush etc. It's a non smoking hotel and therefore smells really cleans and fresh Breakfasts are great - huge selection of freshly prepared fruits cereals, croissants, meats/ cheeses and hot foods - buffet style - so well worth the B&B booking we had organised. The Zen Room - is the gym which is accessed via the roasting hot under ground carpark. Its unstaffed and has little, if non, air conditioning so be prepared to sweat! The steam room and sauna were great to relax in after a day sightseeing however the jacuzzi was running with cold water - hmmm.. couldn't quite manage that!!!

To activate the electricity in the room, you have to put your key card into the slotted box on the wall as you enter. Even though the directions are on the folder that they put your key in, our check-in person did not point this out to us, so we had difficulty figuring out how to activate the lights. If it had been night-time, we would not have figured it out as the room is very dark with the curtains drawn (which makes it very nice for sleeping). The beds are very comfortable although not plush by any means. The carpeting was \"indoor - outdoor\" but was clean. There was plenty of storage space in the closet. The shower did not have a curtain but a half-glass so great care was needed for children showering and not flooding the tile floor.

Moreover, not real alternatives for food, drinks, bars in the area I loved Barcellona but if I went back I would choose a more central hotel with better customer service", "Date": "August 24, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Barcelo Atenea Mar", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d291590-Reviews-Barcelo_Atenea_Mar-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$106 - $198*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Paseo Garcia Faria 37-47</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08019</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "291590", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/95/8b/958b418a4a9ad63feaf4c91cf1b976b27large.jpg"}}
