The older motel we had stayed at the night before on our way to Florida was actually better than this one. When we arrived in the room, it was stifling hot and smelled. We turned on the air but it never did really get cool in the room. One of the kids went in the bathroom and couldn't find the toilet paper. After hunting for a few minutes, I managed to unearth a roll that was nearly gone. There wasn't any more. We ended up having to go to the other room to get some. When I went to put the kids to bed, I found that the comforter had just been pulled up and the bed wasn't made underneath. Rather than call housekeeping, I decided to make it myself, which is when I realized the sheets were dirty. The fridge wasn't plugged in so we pulled it out. There was probably a year's worth or dirt and cobwebs behind it. The ice bucket still had melted ice in it and there was mold on the lid. At that point, we called the front desk to complain. The attendant was rude and told us we would have to wait until the next day when the maid came. Since it was so late and one of the kids was sick, we decided to go ahead and stay. The shower was terrible. There was a crusty, used washcloth in the corner of the tub. There was no water pressure. When you turned the knob for the shower, it would only give you cold water. If you put it over on the bath setting, it only gave hot water. We had to run the bath and then let it cool for a while before we could put the kids in. The next morning, we went to make coffee and found an old filter still in the coffee pot. It had mold growing in it. Even if we'd been able to make coffee, there were no cups to put it in. My sister went downstairs to get some coffee and food from the continental breakfast and all they had was coffee. When the maid came by, we explained the problems with the room and were assured she would take care of it. We stripped the bed and left the fridge pulled out so she could see the dirt behind it. Then we left for the funeral we were in town for. When we got back, the room was even worse than it was when we left. The bed had been remade with the same dirty sheets. The towels had been replaced with even dirtier ones than we had before. We still didn't have cups, soap, shampoo or extra towels even though we had specifically asked for them. The people at the hotel, staff and clientele, made us nervous. Some people got into a fight outside our room. There were drunks out in the parking lot yelling and carrying on. When we were in the pool, there was a guy walking around the pool with a tracking bracelet on his ankle. We were standing on the balcony and the maintenance guy walked by and was craning his neck to look up my sisters skirt. There was some sort of bugs in our room. We're not sure if it was fleas or something else. All of us were itching and had bug bites all over us.

We were on our way from Miami to Tallahassee and had to stop here because my husband had food poisoning and wanted to rest. We noticed it was on SHADY LANE.

We both noticed that the water pressure was basically non existent and the temperature of the water went from freezing cold to cold. Parts of the wall were coming apart and it looked like it came out of some alien movie because it had a bubbling appearance. The last straw however was the next morning. At around 9 am someone knocked on our door disregarding the do not disturb sign. They said we couldn't have the dog without paying an extra $25. I said fine. We had been in a hurry the night before and didn't report the dog. He was barking and they discovered us. I have no problem paying but how was I supposed to know this guy was legit? So I ask if I can pay at check out. He says he needs the money now. I tell him I only have 2 $20's and he says I can get my change at check out. I freak out and tell my husband but he says just give it to the man. Ok. We go back to bed. 10 minutes later. KNOCK KNOCK. Housekeeping. I open and she says just wanted to make sure you were still here....? The do not disturb sign didn't give it away apparently. After that KNOCK KNOCK. I open. She says oh you're still here? I say what time is check out?! She says 12. I look at watch, it's 11:30. I close the door and say we will be out by checkout time. I begin to pack the car and housekeeping lady walks by clearly noticing me. 11:45 she knocks again. If we stay any longer the hotel will have to charge us another day. My husband is hurled over the toilet but we made an immediate exit. I go to the front desk where the man sees me and gives me my change and I walk away. No exchange of words.

We could barely abide by the fact that the room and facilities were sub-standard, but my son was extremely dissapointed not to have access to the pool.

The room was ill-equiped, and when things were asked for (such as a working coffee maker), they had to be reminded multiple times.

Where do I begin? There is so much, guess I'll start at the very beginning. I went to the Econo Lodge website, and booked the room from there. Everything there went fine, booked the room, got the confirmation, then printed it out. Easy, simple & fast. Everything from that point went down hill. Upon arrival at the hotel, I entered the lobby; Sort of run down, sort of old, but that didn't really matter to me. Walked up to the counter, and waited. Behind the counter, in a back office was \"Harsh.\" Harsh saw me, we made eye contact. He then proceeded to ignore me for a good 5 minutes. He carried on his conversation until he was good and ready to deal with me. When he decided to assist me, I handed him my confirmation. He then spent what seemed like another extended amount of time doing something on the computer. Shortly after being on the computer, his cell phone ranged. He stopped everything and answered it. I was then subjected to a 3-5 minute long conversation in Hindi. When Harsh was finished with his phone conversation, he went over to another computer. He spent an equally long amount of time on it. He then looked up at me and asked, what kind of room did I want. That sort of shocked me! I said it really didn't matter as long as there was a fridge. As we had insulin that needed to be kept cool. Harsh soon handed me the card key, and we were on our way. When I got to the room, everything seemed ok, but upon walking in and further inspection things were anything but good. The carpet was filthy, it hadn't been vacuumed in a while. There was no fridge, no microwave, no internet. Amazingly, the bathroom was spotless. It was 90+ degrees (32+ Celsius) outside and very humid. We were sweaty and just wanted to get cleaned up, and rest up before heading out. No one wanted to go back to the front desk and deal with a disinterested front desk clerk. So we made the best of it. It was upsetting that we were given a room without a fridge, especially after making a point of asking for one. Our stay at the hotel was short (thank God) only 2 nights. We were visiting friends in St. Cloud. Therefore we spend all of our time with my friends. Only used the hotel as a place to shower & sleep. We stopped at Walmart in St. Cloud and bought a cheap styrofoam cooler, filled it with ice, and used it to keep our beverages cold. Our insulin was kept cool in my friends fridge. It would have been nice to have a fridge in the room. At the end of that first day, my friends gave us a lot of food to take back to the hotel with us. Needless to say there was nothing in the room to heat it in, or refrigerate it in. (except our cooler) The next day we hardly spent any time in the room. We were up and out by 8am and back at 2am. (18 hours later) We returned to a room that was untouched by housekeeping. That was unacceptable. I went back to the front desk to complain and get some clean towels. While on my way to the front desk I passed a storage room. The door was partially open, and the housekeeping cart was in full view. It was loaded with clean towels & soap. I took what we needed and headed back to the room. So far, I've only spoken about what we experienced with our arrival and the room. The hotel is a totally different story. To be fair, I guess all that I can say about the hotel is that it's undergoing some sort of renovation. That is the only explanation I can see for whole wings of the hotel cordoned off with yellow tape. Also that can explain why there were open trenches all around the hotel with all sorts of exposed pipes. That might explain why it took about 5 minutes for us to get any type of warm water for our showers. Like I said earlier, it was hot & humid there. The hotel did not take care in the disposal of garbage. When I arrived I noticed all the garbage cans around the hotel were full. The next morning they were overflowing. When we finally left, there was no change. All the trash cans were more than overflowing with garbage. It may seem like this stay was a total disaster. Well it was, but there were a few positives. There were washers & dryers at the end of each floor. It seemed like all the vending & ice machines worked. And with everything else lacking, our room had an iron and ironing board. Other than the ice machine, we didn't use the other amenities. All in all, I can not and will not suggest this place to anyone. The overall lack of customer service, the condition of the rooms, and hotel in general makes this a place that I would stay away from. There are other hotels in the area, check them out!!! I wouldn't even suggest this place as a last resort.", "Date": "September 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Royal Palm Beach, FL", "Title": "\u201cWorst and most disgusting place ever..!\u201d", "Author": "FemaleSavage", "ReviewID": "UR35348113", "Content": "First, off let me start off by saying that they are false advertising over there!

In the shower there was hair all over the wall and the toilet had big stains of something in it. I had to go but things to clean the room with. Ontop of all that the first night we were there some other guest had a key to our room , which was rather scary! It looked like there was a bunch of crack heads that lived there ! Out side my room all I could see was a old car with dead bolts of the trunk. If that doesn't tell you something I don't know what will. House keeping didn'tcome at all , I checked out and went to a different hotel the second day because I was scared to step foot out of my door! There were cops there every other night and people were just weird . I was sitting in the room and some guy was outside my window (sliding glass do that didnt open) witha fiftth of liquor singing and dancing to himself!! DO NOT GO HERE !!!!

It sticks as u walk. Bath is very old and dirty. and hot water not hot at all. I was fed up so i put my bed sheets on the carpet all over the place to walk over, and brought some new sheets from house keeping for us to sleep. During the stay my kids had tummy ache and skin allergy. But i am not sure who to blame for this, but could be the dirty hotel. It has swimming pool but closed during my stay. they said it is not ready (something to do with ph balance.) It is located end part of kissimmee and about 15 mils to Florida center.

We felt as if we were guests in someone's home, rather than in a commercial establishment !! All of this for less than a good dinner in an excellent restaurant.
