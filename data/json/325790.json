During the day, sitting by the pool down the road (also part of the suites) is great for recovery time. Besides the cleanliness, the one complaint I had was with the air conditioning. They had a sign saying not to turn it below a certain temp. in order to prevent freezing. We ignored this and turned it down a few degrees cooler and it seemed to work just fine.

To be clear, I traveled to New Orleans with a large group (15) for Jazz Fest. We needed a large apartment (rented one of their townhouses) that was in an accessible area. We didn't want anything fancy, just a place to rest our heads in between shows and the festival. The townhouse was exactly what we were looking for. They are old buildings, so nothing is brand new, but that was perfect for our needs. It is walking distance from everything in the French Quarter and on Frenchman, on a main road with easy access to taxis, on the bus route that goes straight to Jazz Fest and also just far enough that you don't have loud bars right outside your place. We were also really impressed that we were allowed access to the hotel amenities, even though we were just staying in a townhouse. We had access to both pools, which was great for the hot afternoons. There was often a large, young crowd playing music and hanging out there, which was fun. The front desk was able to let us into the townhouse if one of us forgot keys (at all hours), which happened several times. But the biggest thing that wowed us all was the big crawfish broil they held on Saturday night at the pool. There was unlimited crawfish, corn, homemade fried chicken, and beer that was all completely out of this world. And it was ENTIRELY FREE (well, 'included,' but still). The servers wouldn't even take tips. To me, that was a really nice gesture to bring all their guests together for a gathering and some hospitality. So to reiterate, I would absolutely recommend this property to people who are looking for basic rooms/townhouses that are walking distance from the Quarter.

Most of our hotel staff was as well, but we were there for 5 days and our housekeeper only brought towels and dumped them on our beds! No change of sheets, No trash removal, no toilet paper, Nothing... just fresh towels! I mean come on, the least you can do is take out the trash! By the end of our trip we had a corner piled with trash as some form of containing it! Went to the front desk and asked for toilet paper as it had not been refreshed for our entire trip, I was told to get it from the bathroom in the hallway! Not really what you expect to here from someone who is supposed to be serviceing you! So I made sure i took all of the extra rolls there since i knew it would be a while before we recieved anymore!

We booked a two bedroom suite at the French Quarter Suites for 5 nights, online. We were told that we had to pay a 50%, non-refundable deposit when we booked (our credit card was charged in November for an April trip). The web site said \"steps from Bourbon Street\". We had read some of the reviews that said that folks who had stayed there before had some concerns about the safety of the neighborhood so when we checked in we asked and were told about the best route to take to Bourbon Street for safety sake. Believe me, it was not \"steps\". It was a good 7 blocks to take the safe route. We were really disappointed when we made our way to our suite. The carpets were very worn and had large holes in some spots that showed the floor beneath. There were cobwebs and accumulated dirt along the edges of all the carpets and in the corners. There was a quarter inch of dust on the tops of the drapes. The bathroom floor was filthy. When we wiped up a little water that was on the bathroom floor, the towel came up black. The bathtub had mold around it and the sheets and pillowcases were stained and worn. I wouldn't have touched the bedspread with any part of my body. The washcloths are what I use for rags at home. The television in the largest bedroom didn't work. The small bedroom had room for just a bed and a small nightstand. There was a coffee maker but only little thin plastic cups that would not have held hot coffee. The refrigerator didn't work and was dirty inside. After walking over to Bourbon Street by the \"safe\" route in the daylight we realized that we would not be comfortable walking back that way at night. We went into the Ramada Inn on Bourbon Street and asked them if they had any rooms available for the weekend (this was Wednesday night). They said they had just one. We asked them to hold it for us until we could speak with the French Quarter Suites to see about cutting our stay with them short. I called the young man at the desk and he said I would have to talk to his manager and she wouldn't be in for about an hour. It ended up being nearly 11 pm before I was able to speak with the manager so we had to spend the first night in this awful hotel. The manager said that we could leave early but we would not receive any of our 50% deposit back. She never asked why we were leaving. She obviously didn't care. They following morning a different young man at the front desk (if you can call it that as it is really like a motel office with a check- in office) listened to our complaints (unsolicited) and said, \"I'm sorry your room was dirty but we can certainly use the 2 bedroom suite this weekend.\" So we paid $700 for one night at this hotel and they were eager to re-rent it. The Ramada was wonderful. They gave us the regular rate for Thursday and Sunday night and the Jazz Fest rate for Friday and Saturday which we though was really nice of them. The four nights at the Ramada cost us just a little more than the 1 night at the French Quarter Suites and it was clean, comfortable and right on Bourbon Street. We had a courtyard view and no noise from the street. We were not expecting the French Quarter Suites to be luxury with a concierge and bellman, etc. but we did expect that it would be clean and comfortable.

There was a central room, a bathroom, and two separate bedrooms. The carpets and the bathroom were somewhat dingy, but not unsanitary. Our room came with a refrigerator and microwave, but some rooms offer full kitchens. My room was in the back of the motel and therefore my internet connection was pretty weak. My co-workers had rooms in the front of the motel and they said their signal was very robust, though. I found the service to be good. Except for one employee, everyone was very friendly and helpful. The motel offers a secure pay parking lot. The rate is $20/day ($15/day for AAA members). If you are there for just a couple days this rate is probably ok, but if you plan on staying for longer you might want to investigate other parking options.

I looked at many hotels but had difficulty finding one that could acommodate our large group without splitting us up into several rooms. Many of us had not seen each other in years and wanted to spend as much time together as possible. I am so happy that I stumbled upon this hotel on Trip Advisor! The staff at the hotel was responsive, polite and downright generous. I had initally booked two, two-room suites but after talking to the management switched to the three bedroom executive suite in the annex. With five beds, a comfortable couch and a rollaway bed, we were able to comfortably fit our whole group in one suite. And what a suite it was! If you're looking for luxury acommodations this isn't it - but everything was clean, in working order, spacious and nice. We particularly enjoyed the balcony and courtyard which provided ample space to lounge and visit, in addition to the nicely appointed living room. I have absolutely no complaints about the room or the service. As others have pointed out in their reviews, the neighborhood around the hotel is not exactly posh, but was in easy walking distance to everything we wanted to see in New Orleans and allowed us to come and go throughout the day. The weather was hot and sticky, so coming back during the day to cool off before going out at night was essential. Most importantly though, as a woman, I never felt unsafe walking down North Rampart Street but taking normal precautions (ie: not walking alone at night) is still a good idea, as it would be in any city. Overall, I can't rave enough about my group's experience at the French Quarter Suites.

After we checked in we walked into our room and our jaws dropped. We had a one bedroom suite, which has a full kitchen, a living room. It was awesome for what we wanted. The furnature was all very comfortable, and all the remotes worked (rare at hotels these days). The building felt VERY secure, and the pool was extremely clean, and you didn't get that \"over chlorine smell\" that you get from some hotel pools. The staff suggested many great places to eat, as well as fun things to check out. Also they arranged for three taxis to be out front to pick us up when we checked out (all our flights were at different times heading to different locations) with no hassles at all. We had a great trip down there. A few days later we checked our credit card balance and saw that we were charged for the rooms, in one quick phone call they took care of everything for us, as well as apologized several times for the mix up.

It is close to everything in the FrenchQuarter, on a main street easily accessed by car, unlike the traffic of the inner French Quarter. It has ample secured parking, which is unusual in this historic part of town. For a small hotel, the staff work exceedingly hard to meet all your needs just like their larger competitors. The pool area is lovely, and the on-site laundry is great if you are planning an extended stay. There is a breakfast room with free breakfast every morning with complimentary newspaper.

It was not our fault that they did not have the room available for what we reserved?!? I called back and asked for a manager. The man said he could help me. I told him our whole story and about how I did not agree that we had to pay more for an upgrad b/c they did not have our room available. He preceeded to tell me that we came in at a discount rate and that the room we stayed in was regular $250 (whatever, the website says $129) and all in all basically that he didn't care, he was the owner, we got a good rate, he didn't care what we thought and he would credit us back $40 and hung up on me.

I played along with it and asked for several rates for different room categories and each one was significantly higher. Finally I mentioned it and asked why he was charging me more, it is low season because no conventions or events were happening and he said this is what was posted on the web too. When I pointed out that it wasnt he apologized and offered me what was on the rate. I made the reservation and asked for a fax.

I called back and got someone who's name I forgot, he was very nasty pointing out that I called during check out time, and he couldnt talk to me. To call back on be put on hold. I told him I call back. When I did, I got the owner again. I told him that the rate for Sunday should have been lower than Fri and Sat and he agreed and cut off 50bucks. I was excited and asked for a fax, after days went by and no fax. I called again, the owner wasnt in but got someone else, who gave me a higher rate than what the owner gave me with no lower sunday rate. I was apalled and asked that the owner call me back. When he finally did, he said he never quoted me such rates. And it was back to square one. I was so upset that they never got the rates fixed and played around chargin what ever they pleased. I asked my reservation to be cancelled and they told me they had to charge me a processing fee. For what?? To rip up the index card my reservation was on.

We just got back from a 3 night stay. First the good. The staff here is extremely nice, and very helpful. They will go out of their way to make sure that you have a nice stay at their hotel. I give them an A+. Another feature that we enjoyed was the pool area, since we were there in the dead of summer it was nice to have a place to cool off. The building is also pretty secure. There are only two ways to enter, either through the lobby (that always has somebody in it) or through the gated parking area that you have to have a key to enter. If you plan on going out during the day to explore and coming back to the hotel before it gets late, then this is the place for you. It's a short walk to everything and the rates are very reasonable. We stayed in a 2 bedroom 1 bath unit w/ a living room and a small area w/ a mini-frig and microwave. There is also a balcony that runs all the way around both floors. The rooms were clean and spacious, but the furnishings were a bit outdated. Also, some of the lamps were not in working order. As other people have already mentioned. the hotel is located right on the outer fringe of the French Quarter in a high crime area. If you plan on going out at nights I strongly suggest that you either find someplace more towards the center of the FQ, travel in large groups, or that you take a taxi back to the hotel. On our last night there my husband and I were walking down Urseline only a block and a half from the hotel and we were assulted by two young men who robbed me of my purse.

Checking out the reviews on this site I must admit that I am a little surprised about the hotels high 5-star rating. Having stayed at this and other hotels throughout the country, I like to state in my opiniated review, and in fair comparisons to any other hotels I have visited in the past, that this hotel does not meet any compatible 5-star hotel standards, and nor does it even come close to any fair other first-class hotel ratings. I do not like to be taken wrong, especially as this hotel is in overall review OK, and deserves a moderate average rating. However, it is fair to state that the hotel has some problems it has to deal with, and that the location, because of the nearby crime area, is being one of the biggest ones. There is no doubt that the hotel, being located on the far N.E. side of the French Quarter, is just a few blocks away from the dangerous, high crime rate bothered East New Orleans neighbourhood, and that especially tourists, as told by local police forces, are being warned of potential night street crimes nearby the hotel when walking home, running the potential risks of being mugged (police words, not mine!). As stated already, the hotel itself is OK, but it certainly does not offer any services and standards of hotels that justify a hotel rating within the 3*star to 5*star brackets. Again, the rooms are of average size and well furnished, but need a little renovation. The hotel services and the staff itself can be considered as average to good, but do not come close to any first-class hotel standards. In conclusion of this review, I honestly have to state that I will stay at another hotel during my next visit to New Orleans, especially as I expect to see a better value in return for my Dollars spend for hotel overnights in New Orleans. Knowing now, there are many nice hotels in the central New Orleans area that are located much better and offer many more services at a much better price per room night!
