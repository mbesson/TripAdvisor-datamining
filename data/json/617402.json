{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Do Not Stay Here or book with Berlin30 I booked two rooms on the Berlin30 website. The Hotel staff/man who booked us in asked us to pay the stay ballance in cash - he said he was ina hurry to go out and if there was any problem he would sort it on his return. We paid - him and he gave us keys and left ( we have been to Germany many times without problems). The rooms were nothing like on the Berlin30 site. The rooms were tiny and did not smell fresh (our one had the bathroom accross a corridoor, and I suggest that the sing in the room was possibly used as a toilet).On his return we complained - he became really aggressive - he shouted at us and put his face into mine, our wives were terrified. When we said we were leaving and he relented and said we could have a room like on the site - but just one. We refused and he became even more angry - he then walked out of the hotel with our money. We walked around Berlin until 10.30pm before we got accomodation. We spent the next morning in the Police station - they advised this was a civil amtter and they could not help. We returned to the Hotel - the man refused to come to speak with us. We reported this matter the the Berlin tourist Office, Berlin30 and the German tourist board - none could help. Berlin30 tell us it is a matter between us and the Hotel - they refused to go a nd see the rooms although their site suggests the do- they are not a good organisation and I would not advise anyone to do business with them - they operate in many cities under various xxx30 names", "Date": "Nov 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR699143083", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Tourguide08"}, {"Content": "Nice place to stay and visit Berlin Lacated on 5 th floor of the bulding, closed to shoppong mall and S-Bahn station.
