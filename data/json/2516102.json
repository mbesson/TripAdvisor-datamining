Now the negatives: 1) \"Gym\" is a joke. Gear must be 15 years old--upright bike, no-name stairmaster, and two treadmills (one broken). I spoke to Ryan Block (GM) on my first visit and he assured me that the treadmill would be fixed when I returned the following week It wasn't. He didn't call to let me know and he didn't return my call (I have his business card with what is supposed to be a direct number on it) when I tried to find out the status. Since nobody uses upright bikes or stairmasters (some people might never have seen the latter if too young), working out at this hotel might be impossible, especially since the \"gym\" closes at 1100P -- it was for me on two separate times with people already waiting for someone to get off the treadmill. 2) I had a signficant load of dry cleaning and laundry -- about $50. Suit, jeans, dress shirts, casual shirts and a few tee-shirts. A tee shirrt was not returned to me and I inquired about it a number of times without anyone ever calling me back or finding out. Called Ryan, but he didn't return my call. It was only a Banana Republic tee so I gave up on the $25 or so item and guess I'll just have to pay to replace it myself. Fortunaltely they didn't lose my Armani suit. Other than losing an article of mine, the dry cleaning was probably a bit better than average. But it seems you have to sacrifice a piece of clothing (I couldn't find the offical rules on how this works) from time to time so you be the judge of whether it's worth it. 3) They have no store onsite which is fine and they do have a soda/snack vending machine. I tried to break a $20 at the front desk a little after midnight and the front desk clerk only had 3 one-dollar bills. IT was a little frustrating because I had a $10 and was at the hotel there for three nights and wanted to tip $15 ($5/night) and couldn't leave more than $10 as a result. I also couldn't ahve the bag of Cheesy Poofs I had my eye on. This lack of attention is a little odd because of one factor. I'm currently leading an engagement where one of the sales people signed a lousy T&E reimbursement policy so my team has to suck it up and stay in a less expensive alternative than say a Marriott or Hilton. I picked this hotel primarily because of location -- less than a mile to the client means that I can walk there and back. I indicated to Ryan that I was going to be in town three or four nights per week for 10-14 weeks, depending on how the engagement develops. As I indicated, he promised to fix the treadmill the first week -- I told him in no uncertain terms that I could not stay in a hotel where I cannot work out. I also indicated that the 40+ nights I would be there should generate enough revenue to not only fix the treadmill, but buy something like, say an elliptical trainer. And maybe some dumbbells. 4) TVs are not flat screens. Not that I watch a lot of TV, but if I do, I think that a hotel can spring $500 for 37\" flat screen for each room. Anyway, I've gone on long enough. Nothing special about this hotel (could use a remodel) and many problems. Nice staff can't come close to making up for deficiencies. I think that owners/management are just greedy and trying to make as much money while spending as little as possible. Some people never learn that soemtimes you have to spend money to make money -- I'll never return losing them about 40 nights of guaranteed business and some my team as I staff up this engagement. If you like Holiday Inns, I've heard that the Holiday Inn Express (apparently different owners) a couple of miles down Ventura Blvd. is nice enought, very new and about the same price.

The first time we stayed there we had a regular room that overlooked the swimming pool. It was great. You could see the pool but you couldn't hear the people in the pool. We ordered room service and it came very quickly and was delicious. The room had excellent air conditioning and the bed was very comfortable. We just came back from our second trip to Woodland Hills and this time we stayed in a suite. The room had so much space in it and the bathroom had a jacuzzi tub with sliding louvered windows that could open or close for privace. The shower was in a separate glassed in area and the water pressure was excellent. We had a 32 inch TV, a chair and a small couch in the room as well. My wife likes to sleep with a fan blowing on her and requested onr from the front desk. It was no problem, they said, and we soon had a fan in our room. Robes were provided for us as well. And of course, a coffee maker was provided, along with an iron and an ironing board. The staff couldn't have been nicer to us. Room service, again, was swift and delightful, and the food was excellent. All in all, both trips were excellent. The rooms are so nice and clean and the staff is the most friendly and courteous I have ever met. We will definitely go back to this hotel again.", "Date": "August 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Central Point, OR", "Title": "\u201cShop Around!\u201d", "Author": "Trube", "ReviewID": "UR5600442", "Content": "We were a little uncomfortable with the area.

Also, the beds were not very comfortable...we could practically feel the springs under our backs, but still the overall experience was great. The carpet was clean and the furniture was nice enough I would actually want to touch it, unlike many other hotels! We got the family suite and had 2 adjoining rooms, and both were nice.
