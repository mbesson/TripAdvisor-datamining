I did have some reservations as I was really struggling to find apartments that would house 10 of us (in single beds) close to the La Rambla. The MH site was clear and easy to use and above all the apartments had a floor plan, so I could see what I was getting. I managed to secure 3 apartments (2 - 1 bedroom apartments and a 2 bedroom apartment) for our group of 10 at a very reasonable rate. Upon arrival at Barcelona I rang the office as instructed and told MH that I was on my way, they gave me clear address information and a time to meet the check in person. We found the apartments easily and admittedly the street is not the best but it is not dangerous or anything! The man turned up on time to check us in, he was very friendly and informative and swiftly and efficiently dealt with our group and answered any questions we had. The apartment were clean and basic but had many amentities, they were very comfortable and suited us down to the ground. The free wifi worked fine and the beds were clean and very comfortable (although that might have been the Sangria and the beer!). Bathrooms were again very clean and towels were provided. The apartments were very secure and also a safe was provided free of charge in each apartment. The location of the apartments were excellent a mere 2 minutes walk away from the main La Rambla street. Opposite the apartments were a couple of little supermarkets and also a bar! All in all, a very enjoyable stay in Barcelona made even better by the good standard of the apartments and being dealt with very efficiently by MH Apartments.

We had four flats over four floors, we were considerate with our behaviour and therefore had no problems, including having late night beers on the roof. The staff at MH Apartments were very helpful especially when we had to extend our stay due to the Icelandic Volcano, although it wasnt possible to extend here, they did lock our stuff up, sent us out for the afternoon and called us a few hours later with an alternative place. There are some really useful places close by, a very good late night Irish bar a few doors down selling cheap beers, pool tables and live music, open til 3am, a few supermarkets and a very good deli directly opposite. The only issue is the red light district that starts at the end of the block. They never come down passed the Quiet man pub but do hand around all day from the end of the block and down around Marsala bar. After one run-in with them at 3 in the afternoon we just stayed away.

We originally booked the Guell Apartments and a specific room based on the reviews provided. However, a couple of days before we arrived we were informed by the Apartment that our booking had changed to Liceo instead - no reason was provided but I guess they were double booked. We were a little apprehensive about this but location-wise there wasn't much difference (Liceo actually backs onto the Guell block) and the apartment we were given was fine. The apartment was furnished adequately and to a good standard and roomy enough (just) for a family of 4. Although there were 2 bedrooms, the second bedroom is really a single room - when the rollaway bed is rolled-out there wasn't much room to manouvre! There was, however, an option to use the sofa in the lounge (which we didn't use). The area looks a little seedy but we didn't feel unsafe at any time - plenty of people always about. The location was great as the old town and museums etc are all within walking distance. It also wasn't noisy but we had an apartment at the back of the block, not street facing - but the street wasn't that busy either.

The man told me to meet him at the end of the street where the McDonald's was located to pick up the keys. The problem was - i couldnt see the McDonald's nearby, and asked to meet at the KFC which was clearly visible instead. He insisted on McDonald's, so i started to trek back to the McDonald's at Catalyna which was 10 minutes away as that was the only one i knew. In the end, he called again to say that he was outside KFC because the McDonald's wasnt recognisable as it was closed! (all the shutters were closed and at street level you cannot tell it is a McDonalds). The man led us down Union street and told us that the Opera apartments were all booked, and we were actually at the Liceo apartments instead. (which was down the quieter side of the same street). The street smells of sewerage and garbage, and upon entering the foyer of the apartments, it is no better. We stayed in apartment number 42 on the fourth floor. Avoid this apartment - even though it is clean and fit 5 of us easily, the bathroom drain smelled like sewerage, as did the kitchen drain. The apartment had one bathroom (smallish sized) and another toilet. There were two bedrooms - one with 2 single beds together, and the other had a single with a slide out bed underneath. The lounge had a fold out double bed, so the apartment can easily fit 6 people. It also has a dining area and kitchen but we never utilised the kitchen for cooking. If you stay here, you will need to bring your own soap and shampoo, as it is apartment style, and only comes with sheets/blankets and towels. There is no concierge, so if you have luggage to leave behind, it depends on whether there are people staying at that apartment the next day... you need to vacate at 12 noon, for the cleaners, but you can ring the night before and enquire whether you are allowed to store bags at the apartment for the day in the corner. Overall it was cheap accommodation, but the smell was quite off putting.

The guy that showed us the apartments was very friendly and we were pleasantly surprised by how new and clean everything was. The kitchen was well-equipped, even had a washer-dryer, and the rooms, although not huge, were fine. There wasn't enough room to put the cases in the rooms, but there was plenty of space in the living room area. The only thing that I would have liked to have seen in the apartment was a hairdryer. All in all, I was very impressed with the apartments and would highly recommend them to anyone who is going to Barcelona.

The location was superb & it's on a little street off Ramblas called Union, you could walk to Las Ramblas in 2 minutes and Placa Catalunya in 10 minutes. The shops and stalls on Las Ramblas were always open, 2 a.m....8 a.m. Only some were closed during the afternoon break. It's very quiet in the morning but packed with people, mostly tourists, at night. There was a great necklace store beside the apartment & you could get beautiful necklaces & hair accessories for only a few euros each. It cost us 30 Euros on a taxi from the airport but we had 6 big pieces of luggage. I think they could charge you 2 Euros per piece. It took about 20 minutes to get to the apartment as there was traffic congestion at 3 p.m. in the afternoon. Do remember to call from the airport so you don't have to wait for your key on the narrow street with your luggage. Pickpockets were terrible!! My husband almost got his wallet taken & the pickpockets worked in groups. Fortunately I was walking behind my husband on Las Ramblas and suddenly found that he was surrounded by 3 people, 2 on the side & 1 at the back so I yelled to him to hold on to his wallet & his hand almost touched the pickpocket's hand as both of them were reaching for his wallet at almost the same time. So do be careful...these things do happen and they are not just stories. Wear money belts to protect your valuables. Nevertheless, we liked Mh Liceo as it's very new and clean. We rented 2 apartments, one 1-bedroom & one 2-bedroom. Both were loaded with cooking utensils and the washer/dryer (1 machine that did everything) was brand new. Getting washing powder was easy as there was a 24-hour supermarkket (I think it's a Spar) 2 streets north of Union. Internet that was supposed to be free never worked during our stay (couldn't get any signal) and there was no hairdryer in the apartments. The air-conditioning was great as there were 2 A/C units there, one in the living room & one in the bedroom. There was no A/C unit in the smaller bedroom in the 2-bedroom apartment so you need to open the bedroom door & let the A/C in the living room to flow in, or simply sleep on the sofabed in the sitting room. The furniture was something you'll find in a 2-star motel but everything was very new. Beds were far from comfortable, nothing like the heavenly beds at Westin but for the price you pay and its central location it's unbeatable. We asked the person who gave us the key to book taxis for us to the pier after our stay as none of us speaks Spanish and he was very helpful. The taxis came on time as they couldn't park and wait on narrow streets like Union. Getting to the pier was easy & it only took about 10 minutes to get there. We had a great tapas dinner at Taller de Tapas but it was very expensive. There were lots of restaurants on Las Ramblas but we found that the one that we ate in (Axtaca) was not as good as another one on the side street just south of Placa Reial. A 3-course dinner at Compostela (starter, main course & dessert) including wine, pop or water cost only 16 Euros (tax incl.) & it was very delicious. As for breakfast, we ate at Cafe Lirica on Las Ramblas. It's opposite Union and the food was good for just a few euros. The Bus Turistic starting at Placa Catalunya was a must-do. For 19 Euros a day you could visit famous Barcelona sights like the Olympic Park, Park Guell, Montjuic & the Cable Car, Sagrada Familia and Guell's wierd- shape buildings. It's a hop-on hop-off bus and they provided you with written maps and audio guides(you could select your language) while touring on the bus. What we found best was the headset could be used with other audio guides that you rented from other sites and you didn't have to hold the machine & put it against your ear, instead, you wore the audio guide on your neck & just plugged in the headphones & listened. I would definitely stay at Mh Liceo again as it's super convenient.", "Date": "September 11, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "MH Apartments Liceo", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d639414-Reviews-MH_Apartments_Liceo-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$137 - $210*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Carrer de la Unio, 21</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08001</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "639414", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/ea/a7/1f/salon-1-bedroom-apartment.jpg"}}
