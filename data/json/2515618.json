We had a king suite (2 adults, 2 kids), which is actually two side-by-side suites, with a shared entrance-way. We could probably have squeezed into the largest one, with a bed and sofa bed. But with 2 rooms, we were positively swamped with space, TVs, kitchen amenities etc. Rooms are clean and well-equipped, service daily (the maid usually put the dish-washer on for us). No restaurant, which was fine by us, but a great litle shop for groceries, fresh snacks (wraps, sandwiches) etc. Small pool, not too busy. Easy walking distance (3 minutes) to the Flamingo and through to the Strip. Central location meant we didn't need to hire a car. Only down-side is the construction work next door, which can start as early as 6 a.m. and can be heard even in the south tower by anyone who, like me, is a fairly light sleeper. Also, the building air-con means the room has a constant low hum. I raised the issue with the staff, but although apologetic, said that nothing could be done, and did not offer a discount for the inconvenince, despite my hints. The only solution is ear-plugs.

The health club is all you need to get your workouts in and there is no additional charge. The Owners lounge is a great place to hangout of you want to and it has a pool table and ping pong ( great for families). There is also a piano on a balcony in the lobby if you wan to get some play time. I have nothing negative to say about this hotel. I didn't want to come home! the front desk staff was friendly and approachable, the bell hops were above and beyond helpful with taxis and our luggage. When you need a taxi they have to run over to the Flamingo cab stand and always did it with a smile. In fact when we checked out the Bell Captain came back with a stretch limo he already negociated to take us to the airport at the same price as a taxi. Our room was HUGE! It was a 2 bedroom lockout. We had a double door entry with a doorbell. It had a foyer and the kids had their own room with kitchenette, jacuzzi, TV a king bed and pullout full size sofa sleeper. Our suite was modern, clean and was basicaly a large one bedroom apt. The maid service kept our room spotless. I've never had a time share stay where there made you bed daily. The view was of the pools and each morning I woke up early and watched the sun rise up the Flamingo hotel.WOW! There is a Deli on site, a bit pricey but has all you need. There is also free WiFi which was important to my family. There was also a washer and dryer which we used everyday. There was lots of security in place and felt comfortable leaving our teenagers in the room so we could go out at night.If I could give this placde 10 stars I would. The only negative thing that I can say and it is out of the control of the HGVC Flamingo is the construction. It began at 5;30am!!!!! Thus, watching the sunrise. I had read earlier reviews on this hotel so I requested a high floor, which I got but the constrution was still noisy and began early and ended late. Apparently they are building some stores to be attached to the Flamingo and on the front of the HGVC they are building a ferris wheel. So I would recommed you ask for a high floor if you stay here.

The positive aspects of the suite we stayed in are, it was two completely separate rooms, with one main door leading into small foyer and a separate doors leading to each room inside the foyer area. The main suite contained a full kitchen, living/dining area, bedroom and master bath and a washer and dryer. The second was more of a typical hotel style room with a small refrigerator and microwave. The hotels location is pushed back away from the street, behind the Flamingo hotel located directly on the strip, but right in the center of the strip, making it a quiet place, yet still being within walking distance to almost everything. The reason for the average rating, is a result of the horrible smoke smell in the main suite, and the foul order arising from the shower drain in the master bath. The stench was of raw sewage and became enhanced whenever you turned on the water on. We were later informed by the maintenance person the stench was due to all the pipes being connected to city pipes, which sometime backup and smell. The other issue with the shower was lack of hot water. During our entire stay the water only reached a temperature of warm. Additionally, the score was given due to the old dilapidated jetted tubs. The tubs were huge but very worn, and the jets, upon close inspection were not very clean. The rest of the bathroom was updated and modern. Needless to say we did not use the tub in either room. Although we didn't utilize it, the pool area was very nice. There is construction going on outside in the back of the hotel, but on the 16th floor we could barely hear the heavy equipment.

They did have the smaller family pool at the Flamingo open for use but it was very crowded. Just saying - do your homework before you go.

As you may have read in earlier postings, the 2 bedrooms are just that, they share an entryway, but then immediately split off into two separate rooms with standard heavy hotel doors to each. Great for couples, maybe not so good for families. The location could not have been better. Out our window we could look down into the Flamingo pool, that was closed for the season. A little to the left you could watch the water display at the Bellagio. The Hilton is about a 1 min walk, if that, to the Flamingo. It's literally next door. I really loved being just a tad back from the strip, away from all the smoke and casinos. It was a little quiet oasis in the heart of all the action. You can walk anywhere from the Flamingo, which is about in the middle of the strip, very close to the Bellagio and Paris, etc. Some folks noted that there are steps from the lobby down to the desk for check-in and out. This is true, it's about 4 steps. I didn't find this an issue. You leave your bags at the top of the stairs, the bellmen watches it if being 15 feet from them is a worry. Check-in and out only took a few moments, there was never a line. Compare that to the tons of crowds waiting in line at the Flamingo or anywhere else, it was great. There is a small heated pool that the Hilton has on site, as well as a gym. This hotel looks and feels like a regular Hilton, from the rooms to the lobby. Expect the same workout machines and space for the gym. It's not huge, but it's also not too crowded, so we were able to get a good workout in without any issues.

The hotel itself is \"reasonable\" - its price justifies a lot of its shortcomings, but only to a point. So shop around. First, this is not a \"real\" Hilton property - this is a re-done former timeshare, and it shows. There is no Executive lounge, no room service, no upgrades (they give you 2000 bonus points), there is free WiFi, however. There is a concierge to store your bags and a tour operator to make a reservation for you.... There are steps to reach the check-in counter, so be ready for hauling your suitcases over the steps at least twice. The elevators buttons require a card at all times so your guests would need to wait for you downstairs. Two rooms share a single entrance door, so you will definitely hear your neighbor open two doors (the front and their own), which are VERY noisy. The checkout time is 10am, but the staff can adjust it to 12pm. After hours, the telephones, wakeup service and whatnot is handled by the phone operator at the Flamingo - which can lead to problems (it did for me - no wakeup call was recorded). There are rarely any taxis at the hotel entrance - you have to schlep all the way to Flamingo's taxi line to get out. a MAJOR inconvenience. You can also ask a concierge to order one for you - add extra time, a tip for a concierge, and a tad more for the taxi driver. The bedding is quite worn-out, but there is a jacuzzi in the room :) as well as a walk-in shower - so it is a good option for a short stay if you are a die-hard Hiltonite.

It's about a $16 cab ride from the airport so just a few more than taking a shuttle but more convenient. When you enter, there are 3 stairs going down to the check in.

The lobby area is nice, free wifi terrific, staff are excellent and the pool area is pretty good. We also liked their small grocery store where we could get Starbucks Lattes. But...we stayed on the 2nd Floor of the North Tower which had its drawbacks. Walking through a dismal hallway from the lobby to the North Tower to take the elevator to a floor that seemed to have only 4 rooms per floor, we felt out of touch in that area and never saw anyone else except if we looked out at the pool which was right below us and people sitting at the pool were no doubt easily able to see us if we were at the window. As a previous poster said, the carpeting need replacement and the hallways can use some cheering up. The suite itself was ok. We had a full one bedroom. The kitchen was well set up with granite counter, it was nice to have two separate rooms with sinks and if you like a swimming pool sized jacuzzi bathtub, this place is for you. The living room furniture could use an update. As far as bed comfort, I have a major pet peeve. For the life of me, if you are going to provide a duvet, get proper duvet covers with zippers rather than use a flat sheet as I am pretty sure these duvets are not cleaned in between guests. Others had commented about the noise from the Flamingo pool . We only noticed it on the day we arrived and wow is it thump thump loud. Think it's only on the weekends as we hadn't noticed it any other time. The walk to the strip is easy, either through the path to the Flamingo Hotel or a side lane off the North Tower. I was a bit hesitant about the lane but there is always lots going on with delivery trucks etc so never felt unsafe, except there are limited sidewalks and traffic so need to be careful. If you must have a car (we did), the parking garage is creepy (maybe just me), and while it is easy access from the North Tower, it would be a bit of a walk from anywhere else. I would pay the $10 per day valet and let someone else park and get your car for you. Would we stay here again?

My husband and I have been to Las Vegas numerous times over the years and have stayed up and down the entire strip (Caesars, Signature at MGM, Bally's, etc). Since I was bringing my young daughter and husband, we decided to try the suites since we were Hilton Honors Silver Elite members, for the convenience of the kitchen and in-room amenities (washer-dryer) and the great location near my conference. We arrived late Wednesday night and were given a corner, ground floor room in the South tower. I called a few weeks before to specifically request a quiet room away from the elevator. Apparently, the message was not received as we were put into a room that was one room away from the elevator and the windows faced the loud Flamingo \"adult\" pool. Because of the late hour and traveling with a young child, I decided to stay in the room. Here's a summary: Pros: 1) The room size was very large (1-bedroom suite) and fairly clean. A few years back we had stayed at the Signature at the MGM so the room size at the Hilton Grand Vacations was bigger but the rooms at the Signature were much nicer. 2) Kitchen was well stocked with kitchen utensils, plates and large refrigerator (for leftovers). Washer and dryer had detergent ready for use and was a nice convenience. 3) Location was perfect. You could walk easily to Bellagio to see the water show, City Center for shopping, Venetian and other casinos. The Flamingo casino was close by so having a place to gamble nearby was nice since there is no hotel casino. 4) There was a store in the hotel to grab quick drinks, food or other supplies. Employees were very friendly and cafe (didn't try the food) seemed like it had some nice selections. Cons: 1) The hotel is surrounded by a loud and noisy pool. The music from the Flamingo \"adult\" pool was unbearable. It started at about 9AM and continued until 5/6 PM, everyday. I tried to take a quick nap during the stay and the dance music was pulsating through the windows. Again, I didn't complain because I believe every room in this hotel can hear the obnoxious music. Dance music is fine, but keep it in the clubs. At the end, when I complained to the person checking me out, he just shrugged and said they could've moved me to another room that wasn't AS LOUD but most rooms could hear the music. Some friends were staying in the Flamingo hotel in a high floor room overlooking the pools and you could hear the music from their room so he was probably right. 2) I enjoy gambling some but really love going to Las Vegas to sit by the pool and relax in the sun. The hotel pool had no sun until about noon. It was gone by four or five. I wasn't even able to enjoy sunshine by the pool, especially with the 90+ degree weather. The only time I had available, the pool was chilly and the lack of sun made for a cold dip. The Flamingo (family) pool was similar in that sunshine was intermittent throughout the day since the pool was sandwiched between buildings. I believe the adult pool had more sun but didn't get a chance to go there. Having stayed at Caesars where the sun shines all day long around the pool, it was a very disappointing experience at the Hilton. 3) Beds were not that comfortable. The mattress was lumpy and the sheets that they replaced on one night had a large iron stain that had a hole burned through. For a Hilton, that was very disappointing to see. How hard was it to miss a big dark brown stain with a hole in the middle of the bed? 4) The shower glass door was not a tight seal so there was constantly water from the shower on the floor of the bathroom. Overall, I would not be staying here again. There are plenty of choices along the Strip that have better amenities and nicer rooms.

It's at the back of the Flamingo Hotel property, located mid-strip across the street from Caesar's. Other walkable properties nearby include Bally's, Paris, Bellagio, Mirage, Imperial Palace, Wynn, etc. If you're in Vegas for a long weekend and want to stay in the middle of the action, you can't beat this location. The HGV staff were very courteous and helpful. They patiently answered my questions and graciously helped me to find my way around. The concierge was not as knowledgeable as I've encountered before at HGV and Hilton properties, but the front desk service more than made up for that. I had a one-bedroom, which was perfect for me. The front desk assured me it was on the \"quiet\" side of the hotel. My buddy backed out at the last minute, so I had more than enough space for a solo traveler. The full kitchen, laundry equipment, wireless Internet, and comfortable bed were much appreciated. A balcony would have been nice also, but it seems most Vegas properties don't have balconies. What's up with that? Every time I travel, I forget one important item. On this trip, I inconveniently left many of my clothes in the clean laundry basket at home. The in-room laundry was a great help! I was also able to purchase supplies and miscellaneous items, such as fruit, water, yogurt, milk, eggs, etc., at the small onsite store. The noise from the Flamingo pool was very bothersome, especially my first night. I knew in advance a private party would be held that evening, but I was also told it would end by 1 am. Perhaps I was dreaming, but the bomp-bomp bass and the screams from partiers kept me awake until well past that time. The pool noise quieted down much earlier for the other nights of my stay, but the daytime noise was nonstop bomp-bomp bass and screaming. Since I was looking for a quieter place to do some business and relax in peace, I should not have selected this site for this particular stay in Vegas.

This was our fifth visit to this property, and even though we have tried other hotels, we always seem to come back to the HGVC Flamingo for its smaller feel and easy walk to the mid strip. Our room was a huge 2 bedroom/2 bathroom unit with more than enough space for four. I like the fact that in addition to the king bed in both rooms, the second bedroom also has a pull out sofa. This works out great for my son and daughter. The only drawback to the 2 bedroom unit is the entryway. You walk in a set of double doors to a small hallway, then each room has a separate entrance/locking door. Each unit is self contained, which may not be ideal for families traveling with very young children. I was hesitant to leave our doors open overnight, but also didn't want to lock out my 11 year old son (entrance would have been with key entry only) in case he needed something during the night. But it all worked out OK. There is a very well stocked deli and mini mart in the lobby for snacks that was open from 7am-10pm which was nice if you needed something and didn't want to drive or walk to get it. We rented a car, but it was more of a convenience than a necessity. It is a very short walk from the HGVC to the strip right through the Flamingo lobby and casino.

Our extended family stayed at the Flamingo Hotel, which was just steps away. Gina at check in was so kind to recommend the South Tower for us to stay in so we would be closer to them. That was great advice, which made our whole trip so much easier, especially getting around with a stroller. It was steps to the Flamingo Hotel and the strip. Our room was very nice and spacious. There were 2 flat screen TV's, one with a DVD player which was great for the kids. We had a 1 bedroom suite with plenty of room for a crib. Our room was not ready when we arrived, but the Bellman, Robert was so kind and held our luggage until our room was ready and brought it up promptly. My husband left his drivers license downstairs at the cafe and didn't even realize it until Robert called the room to inform him and he got it back within minutes, which we were very grateful for. Housekeeping service was excellent, we always came back to a clean room with plenty of towels. We requested clean towels on a day when we left the room too late for housekeeping to clean, and they were there in the bathroom when we returned. The security for this hotel is also excellent. A room key is required to get into the tower buildings as well as up the elevators. I felt very safe coming back at night with the children. On our seventh day, my room cards had deactivated and I couldn't get up the elevators. I called the front desk from the phone located by the elevators, the front desk sent security immediately. A very kind man, Kevin, came and got us up into our room. He even went and got me new room keys and brought them back to me up in my room within 10 minutes! Being by myself with kids, he saved me the hassle of having to walk around the building to the front desk and wait for keys. I can't thank Kevin enough for his professionalism and kindness. The entire staff at HGVS is what made our stay such a great experience.

They also gave us a small snack basket-gift to apologize for the inconvenience. The bellmen, front desk, valet, and pool bar hosts were all great. The Flamingo pool is a full on adult party until 6 pm and the kids pool at the Flamingo gets packed on weekends. The HGVC owner pool, however, was always available and had seating, even on fourth of July weekend. It is slightly heated in the day, and very warm at night. The drinks and snacks are cheaper at the HGVC pool than the ridiculously priced beach cafe at the flamingo pool or the drink stands. You can also get patio/cabana tables at the HGVC pool and have barbecues. Everyone in our family, the adults, the kids, and my elderly mother, had a great time.

The Flamingo Hotel/Casino begins blaring music from their pool about 10 a.m. every day, and they do not shut it off until about 6 p.m. It's loud, throbbing music with heavy bass that you clearly hear even in your room with the doors closed, because they have big speakers pointed right at the HGVC at the property boundary. The HGVC manager told me that they've unsuccessfully tried to get them to change it. The Flamingo has also erected a fence between the properties, so you have to walk around to an outside entrance and be processed through an airport security type station and get an armband after having your bags searched in order to enter the Flamingo pool area. Before Hilton sold the Flamingo to Harrah's you could just walk into the Flamingo pool area right next to the HGVC, which was very convenient, and then on into the casino.

We booked the Flamingo due to the central location but were very disappointed with the quality and general cleanliness of the public areas and our one bedrom suite. The check in area was clean and failry ok but there the positives ended. We made our way to our room through dirty carpeted corridors that looked as if they hadn't seen a vaccum in months. There was a damp and dirty odour throughout and when we got to our room it was very dark and dingy. We tried to get over the disappointment and unpacked then went for a walk along the strip. Whilst walking back to the suite I decided I would mention my concerns to reception. The gent we spoke to seemed very surprised at my opinion but he did offer to put us in an alternative room, he came with us to show us another room a few floors up but it was exactly the same. I was beginning to feel that our expensive purchse of HGVC points was not rewarding us with good accommodation!!!! I said I wasn't happy with the cleanliness of the rooms, especially the walkways and public areas. The noise from the pool area was alarmingly loud also which was rather annoying.

Comfy clean beds, lovely lounge, bedroom and bathroom. The fully equipped kitchen was fabulous for keep our drinks cool and for preparing our breakfast and light snacks. Its abit further away from the hustle and bustle of the strip but we used the regular bus for a few dollars for three day ticket.

We are Disney Vacation Club members and exchanged some points through RCI for a week in Vegas. A week in Vegas can be a long time but we had some day trips planned so we thought a week would fly by pretty fast and it did. My wife and I are not real \"needy, pay attention to me\" type of people. The more simple, the better. Our intention for this trip was to relax and enjoy the great weather, see the Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam, see some shows, gamble a little bit and spend some quality time around the pool. We were not disappointed with anything we did. If you are reading this review I think the information you want the most is what we thought of this facility so I will address that first. Check in was very easy and fast. We got there early and they were able to get us a room right away. The room was on the 2nd floor which turned out to be perfect as we were able to use the staircase in the main lobby opposed to having to use and wait on the elevator. We then did the \"welcome to the hotel\" spiel and what they were offering for \"the tour/timeshare sales presentation\" was not to our liking so we said \"no\" and that was the end of it with no pressure again to participate which was appreciated. When we arrived in our room we were very pleased with what we saw. We had a one bedroom and there was plenty of room for the two of us. We liked the way it was setup and the decor. As we moved around the rooms we discovered a couple issues and thought it was best to address them immediately. The TV in the living room was not working properly, the safe was locked in a position where we could not use it and there was some food crumbs around the coffee table in the living room. I called the front desk and they were very sorry and offered to move us to another room but we said that was necessary but would like to have the issues fixed and they sent up a maid and a maintenance man within minutes. Everything was taken care of very professionally and the employees were very friendly and apologetic. I was very impressed with this reaction from the staff. We also got a phone call an hour later checking to make sure everything was taken care of to our satisfaction. They even offered us some free credit in the snack shop which we declined as it was no big deal. We never had any other problems at the facility the rest of the vacation. The facility was bigger than I had imagined and was very clean. The pool is in a gated area and it not huge but was very well laid out. Never had any trouble getting chairs and the towels were just inside the gate. There was a small bar where you could get some snacks and drinks which was convenient. The one issue you had if you wanted to get some sun early was the main building blocked the sun at this time of year from hitting the pool area until about 10:30am. We both got early and wanted to hit the sun a little earlier than that so we used the Flamingo pool for this which opened at 9:00am and there usually was a line waiting to get in but it moved pretty fast. The drawback of the Flamingo pool was it was not heated and was pretty cold in my opinion. The HGV pool was a lot smaller but it was heated and I used it numerous times. I found the crowds a lot younger at the Flamingo and a little more our age at the HGV pool area. The music was a little less loud too. The location of the HGV @ the Flamingo was GREAT. It was just a short walk around the Flamingo pool to the Flamingo casino and gift shops (3-4 minute walk and you were on the strip). We elected to not get a car and used the buses (RTC) to get around which worked out perfect. There were stops on both sides of \u201cthe strip\u201d almost right across from the Flamingo which was very convenient. We used the bus system last time we were in Vegas and knew the ropes for getting around. We saw to Cirque shows \"Mystere\" and \"KA\" and really enjoyed both of them. If I was going to see one of them again I would choose \"Mystere\". I'm sure I would see many things that I missed the first time. Show tickets can be a little pricey but they really are worth the money. The day trips we took to the Grand Canyon (south rim) and the Hoover Dam were fantastic. The GC tour took about 14 hours and the HD tour was about 5-6 hours but well worth the time and money. Took the bus to the downtown casinos (Fremont Street) and enjoyed the \u201cFreemont Street Experience \u2013 light show\u201d which was way cool. Well worth the trip to see and watch the people in the crowds which can be a show in itself. In summary, we thought the HGV @ The Flamingo was an excellent facility and hope to visit again in the near future. I would highly recommend it to you and any of my friends. My only negative experience in Vegas is with the people on the sidewalks trying to pass out there prostitution flyers and cards to anyone that walks by them. I never made eye contact with them and pretended they did not exist but it was still a constant annoyance. Unfortunately there is an area out in front of the Flamingo Hotel that they use constantly.

(HGVC-F) Being center strip, having a nice room, and access to nice pools was a must....but we did not want to spend crazy money for the stay either! Finding this location was very easy using our GPS. They have short term self parking up front while you check in and take your bags to your room. The front desk staff was courteous and helpful. They had a room ready for us for early check in as requested but we decided we did not like that room, and opted to wait for a room that was in the main tower, up high, with a straight on view of the pool at the Flamingo. (High room gave us a sliver of a view of the strip towards Paris) We chose The HGVC-F because it had full access to all the pools at the Flamingo, but was a non gaming property. (Yes, they do have access...the reviewer that said this was not the case was wrong...maybe they tried to take their kids to the adult pool?) . The lobby is of acceptable size and welcoming with a breath of fresh air by not having to walk through a smoky casino. The room and bathrooms are nicely appointed and are very roomy. We booked a studio but opted to do a standby upgrade to a 1 bedroom for $19 per night. (If we booked a 1 bedroom it was $39 a night more). Room decoration is warm and they are very well kept. It was worth every penny to upgrade to the 1 bedroom. The room had a living room with sofa bed, kitchen table, full kitchen, washer/dryer, large bathroom, two person whirlpool tub, full shower, king bedroom (fully closed off from rest of suite). The room had plenty of desk space. The bed was very comfortable and the hotel had plenty of TV Channels and flat screen TV's in both the bedroom and living room. Climate control is acceptable and you can leave the blower motor on for white noise while still using the climate control. Absolutely no noise from the nearby strip, but yes you will get noise from the Flamingo pool during the day but it is only from 9am to 6pm so should not be of any consequence, and it is fun to people watch out your window. Regarding housekeeping...there seems to be some confusion on the board.....let me sum it up....if you are staying as part of the timeshare, you do not get daily housekeeping, but if you are booking as a traditional pay customer, you WILL get daily housekeeping. The housekeeping staff did an excellent job of meeting our needs. (Even running the dishwasher daily). Having the full kitchen was great. We did a bit of light shopping on our arrival day so that we could eat a few healthy breakfasts and lunches from our room. There was no charge for in room internet access and the service seemed to work well both in the room and also at the pool. They also nice gym / spa given this is a limited service location. The HGVC brand is a time share that also operates as a hotel/condo rental. Unfortunately there are virtually no HHonors Diamond benefits at this brand other than a few bonus points. (No breakfast, etc.) We knew this coming in and it was not an issue. They gave us a couple of bottles of water when we checked in (no charge) The one negative I will say is that their check out time of 10am is ridiculously early. We were only offered a noon check out as Diamond members and had to push for a later check out. They offered 2pm for $50 (crazy!) and I pushed for no charge and they finally relented after I pointed out this is to be a Diamond benefit, and if they could offer it for $50, they could offer it for free as it was not an availability issue! We were never harassed to attend a time share presentation. They asked us to stop by for a \"welcome gift\" which we skipped....we know that\u2019s just wanting to talk timeshare with us....no thanks. They also left one message in our room and that was it. I understand self parking is free and valet does have a charge. We did not use the parking amenities as we returned our rental car after check in and then just took a taxi to the airport on our final day. The bell desk was excellent at both storing / delivering our luggage on check in, as well as storing our luggage/getting us a cab on check out. Besides the great rooms and non gaming property, the pool scenario was excellent!!! You have the best of both worlds. Full use of the pools at the Flamingo....a short stroll down a nice walkway and the relaxing enjoyable pool at the HGVC-F. The upstairs pool at the Flamingo is a family pool, and the large lower pool is adults only....which is great. We went over to the Flamingo pool in the mornings when they had full sun and the crowds were not too bad. Unfortunately, the pools at the Flamingo are very crowded and the drink / food is over the top expensive. Well...when you have had enough of that....wala, welcome to the private oasis of the HGVC-F pool ONLY for guests of the HGVC-F. This was a very nice, smaller pool with a great hot tub and nice loungers. You did have the full on music from the Flamingo, (which some people may not like) just across the fence, but no crowds. We were able to find loungers either in the sun or shade almost any time. They also have several cabanas and tables (no charge). The pool is really shaded in the morning, but that\u2019s why we went over to the Flamingo Adults pool in the morning. The other cool thing about the pool is that they also allow you to bring in your own food and non alcoholic beverages. (You can bring alcohol in after the bar closes.) Note: No glass containers. They even have barbeque grills where you can grill a steak if you choose. Another great thing, the pool opens on hour before the Flamingo (8am for HGVC-F and 9am for Flamingo) and stays open several hours longer. (10pm for HGVC-F and 6pm for Flamingo) The poolside bar has excellent prices and great service on both food, and drinks (both adult and non adult beverages). Tim the bartender is excellent. If you are lucky enough to be there the days he works (usually Wednesday thru Sunday).....he will take great care of you. Food and drink prices are about half of what the prices are at the Flamingo....awesome! The food and drinks are all very good. Access to the strip is very easy....just go down the walkway to the pool (open 24 hours) and walk along side road past the Flamingo, and next to Bill's Gamblin Hall and there you are. Less than 3 minutes to the strip....This is much faster than walking through the Flamingo. We would stay here again in a heartbeat for our summer trips when we want to have the access to the pools. Winter time....it would be a toss up between this location and Planet Hollywood (so you don\u2019t have to go outside to get to the casino.)", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cgood times\u201d", "Author": "plpl", "ReviewID": "UR105330352", "Content": "Hello Friends, I read your review about not having access to the Flamingo pool.

And the girls liked shopping at the Fashion Show Mall and the Premium Outlets. There are many family-oriented shows on the strip including some of the Cirque du Soleil shows, Nathan Burton (excellent!), and Dick Arthur. The check-in process went very smoothly. The building is very well maintained. All staff were very polite and professional during our stay. The housekeeping staff responded very quickly to our one request. The kitchen was well stocked - paper towels, dishwasher soap, laundry detergent, shampoo, and lotion were provided. The unit had a washer/dryer, microwave, coffee maker, dishwasher, garbage disposal, plenty of pots and pans, towels, and dish sponge. The housekeeping staff came in mid-week to re-stock the kitchen and bring in new towels and linen. We had a nice pool of the pools, and partial views of the strip (Eiffel Tower, Bellagio fountains) and a partial view of the mountains. There were two flat-screen TVs in the unit and the bed and sofabed were very comfortable. Free wi-fi was available. The pools at the Flamingo are great, having just opened for the season during our stay there. HGVC Flamingo quests were allowed to use the Flamingo pools. However, the main pool is now adult only which was a bit of a disappointment but the family-oriented Beach Club is a very nice pool. The private heated year-around HGVC pool was also very nice albeit smaller than the main Flamingo pools. There is also a nice small Fitness Center onsite. The self-park is a bit of walk (maybe 5 minutes) but it is free, had plenty of space right by the elevator, and beats paying for valet parking + tips.

Our unit was at the end of the hall in the north tower, and we did not share a vestibule with a studio unit. It was very quiet and we never heard other guests in the hall, nextdoor, or above us. We had a nice view of the Flamingo pool, and could see some lights looking up the strip, but most of the strip was obscured by the Flamingo Hotel towers. As other reviews have mentioned, the location is really terrific. From the elevator in our tower (the 3 towers do not connect, except on the 1st floor) we could exit to a service road that we walked up one short block to get to Las Vegas Blvd right at Margaritaville. Or we could walk through the lobby or the pool area, and quickly get to Flamingo Blvd, and the over-street walkways to Caesar\u2019s or Bally\u2019s or Bellagio. Stage Door Liquor was very close, and a good place to buy bottled water and other convenience store-type items. The condo was missing some items when we arrived. There were no coffee filters, no iron or ironing board, and only one dishtowel and no dishrags. I called and someone brought up the coffee filters within about 30 minutes. The other items I noticed later, and left a note for housekeeping on the day of our mid-week maid service, and those items were left in the room for us. I would suggest checking the inventory of the room when you arrive, and requesting any items that are missing, because it\u2019s inconvenient to wait for them when you need them. The hairdryer was really wimpy. The only other criticism I have is that to call the HGVC front desk you have to dial 0, wait for a recording to run through, press 0 again, wait for an answer, and then the Flamingo Hotel operator answers, and you have to ask to be transferred to the HGVC desk. It gets old having to go through this every time you want to ask for the valet to bring your car, or have another question or request. I don\u2019t know why they can\u2019t have their own phone system; it\u2019s certainly a large enough facility to warrant that. The unit was nice, with attractive d\u00e9cor. There was a stacking washer/dryer in a closet, a small galley-style kitchen with stove/oven, microwave, full-sized refrigerator, and dishwasher. Dishes for four. Not a huge amount of counter space, but adequate. Living room had a sofa sleeper (double) and arm chair, coffee table and side table, and a credenza that housed a room safe, DVD player, and a good-sized flat-screen TV. The living area was completed with a built-in upholstered seating bench, a glass-topped rectangular table, and two dining chairs. The king-sized bed had nice sheets and a light-weight down comforter. Another flat-screen TV was atop a chest of drawers, and there was an upholstered chair in the bedroom. The bedroom area was open to part of the bathroom, containing the clothes closet, a sink and large countertop area, and a huge, round, jetted tub. The rest of the bathroom was a pass-through to the entry area, and had another sink and counter area, with a separate toilet and shower room, which could be closed off with a pocket door. This layout made for good traffic flow through the unit. We had a rental car, and rather than self-park (which I think involved a fairly long walk to/from the parking garage) we spent $50 for the all-week valet parking. Add to that the tips every time we took our car out, plus the cost of the car rental, and it really adds up to have a car. We mainly wanted a car so we could visit Hoover Dam and Valley of Fire, but I think for future trips we would skip the car and just walk everywhere. All of the staff were very nice and helpful. After check-in they send you to a \u201cWelcome Desk\u201d which is a code name for \u201ctimeshare promotion desk.\u201d You really could skip this step, but they do give some coupons, and of course offer you free tickets to a show (but not a top-notch show) if you attend a presentation.

Room: You had to go through two doors to get to you room, at first this was weird but we quickly realized this made it so we heard no nosy from the hallways. Which was great. The room at has a great little kitchenette. It had everything we needed which was a coffee maker and refrigerator to store snacks and leftovers. The bathroom had all nice features that you excepted and a jetted tub. The weird part was there was no separation from tub and room. So that meant nobody could use it on our trip. If they fixed that it would be great. The bed was super comfortable but the pull out couch bed was one of the worst I have ever been on and I have been on a few. The tv was a nice flat screen and you could play dvds which was a plus. Lots of storage and space in the room and it looked out over the pool. The room was super quite which was the best part of it after all the noise on the Strip. Over all the room was great, but would love them to fix the couch and have some privacy for the tub. Security: I felt very safe here as a woman. They had card to get into the elevator and they always had someone at the front desk. Pool: They had a great small pool with the great high quality lounge chairs. The pool bar and grill had everything you needed and the lady who was there was very friendly. Location: It is the center of the strip but behind the Flamingo so it is quite but in the action at the same time. Also it is very close to the monorail which turned out perfect to heading to the conference area. We actually had to walk less then the other people staying at the hotels next the the conference area. It was right next to a little store that you could get alcohol and food. Internet: They do have wireless which a lot of Las Vegas Hotels do not have or you have to pay for, but it is slow. It is fast though if you use it in lobby which is quite and comfortable so that is what I did when I needed to work. Extra: The best part of the hotel was you get to be at a smaller, quite hotel, but had access to all the amenities of the Flamingo hotel. It is like getting your cake and eating it too. You did not have to walk through the smoke filled casino to get to your room, but you could use all of Flamingo hotel like you were staying at it, including the Flamingo pool which seems to be the best on the strip.

When we got to the room we were very impressed, separate bedroom, whirlpool bath, roomy shower and fully equipped kitchen we don't cook on holiday but having the fridge and bits was so handy. The room was spotless and trust me i'm a clean and neat freak. It met all my fussy standards. The pool area is so nice. The staff at the bar called us by our names and were very helpful with iced water etc. There was always plenty of lounges and the towels were soft and clean. Staying at this hotel you have access to the Flamingo Pool, we are only in our thirtes but we found it very busy and over crowded and were more than happy to relax in the hilton pool. There is music played in the flamingo pool and yes you can hear it but i kinda liked it. The small deli in the hotel was great again staff very friendly, excellent breakfast snacks and coffee, and they also do light salads which were yummy. Made a change from the excess buffets that were about. We used valet and it was always quick and prompt you could ring down from your room, this way your car is cooling with the A/C when you get down. This is a timeshare condo hotel but we never got the chat 'would we be interested' there was a message left on the phone, we didn't reply and no more was mentioned.

We visited all the 'brand' hotels on the strip and i can honestly say that i would rather stay here. Vegas is all about excess and the other hotels seem overcrowded with tourists and i loved that although i could enjoy all the casinos and bars in the other hotels then i could escape at the end of the evening to the hilton.

I still had a lot of unanswered questions, so I am mainly going to answer the questions I had hoping the information will be of value to others too. This is a very nice property and well deserving of the high TA rating. This was the first time I stayed at a non casino hotel in Vegas. I never saw more than one or two people waiting at the front desk, which is totally different than the check in experience at many casino hotels. Also different is after we finished checking in we were sent to talk to the welcome lady, who is just trying to get people to commit to listening to the time share presentation. When I run into those people on the street I am very short. Because I was checking into the hotel I was trying to be polite, but after about the 3rd time she asked me why I wouldn't waste a morning listening to a high pressure sales pitch I lost my patience. So you might as well be rude right off the bat and save yourself some time. You won't get away from her any other way. If you book thru a time share you are an \"owner\" and if you book thru Hilton you are a \"renter\". The reviews on this forum lead me to believe there would not be daily maid service, which is true if you are a time share owner. But, because we booked thru Hilton and were renters we did have daily maid service and coffee packs were replenished daily. I had already checked in the deli and they were charging $2.29 for one coffee pack, so I am glad it was included in my room rate. The deli kind of ticked me off in that prices were not listed on most items. I asked about a 6 pack of bottled water and it was $ 7.50, no thank you. Some of the food was reasonably priced though, with muffins at $2.09 and breakfast sandwiches at about $3.29. If you have a car go to Von's or Albertson's for water, soda and snacks. We had a studio suite, which was spacious enough, but the kitchenette was crammed in a very small area with little counter space. The only sitting area was across the suite, not next to the kitchen area. We heard no noise except when people came out of the adjoining room. The doors slam very loud. I believe all suites face the Flamingo pool. There are only rooms on one side of the hallway. When you walk down the hallway you look out windows on one side and the rooms are all on the other side. There are three towers connected only at the ground floor. The check in desk and deli are in the center of the largest tower, which is the west tower. The HGV pool entrance and self parking garage are closer to the north tower. The Flamingo self park garage is across from the south tower. Valet parking is $10.00 per day. If you self park you can use the HGV reserved lot, which is across the street and down a short way from the north tower. It has an elevator. You can also park in the Flamingo self parking garage, which we did a few nights. I think it is more convenient, but there are only stairs near the exit across from the south tower. To use an elevator in the Flamingo lot you would have to go to the far end of the parking garage, away from the HGV. I parked on the 3rd floor near the HGV and walked down. The entrance to either garage is off Audrie Lane or Winnick Av. If you are driving and unfamiliar with the area I highly recommend you look at google street view to get your bearings. Winnick Ave runs directly under the monorail track, so that is a good landmark to use. Many of the reviews on this forum are written by travelers who came with children, so I was a little concerned about noise, etc., but we were not bothered at all. The walk to the Flamingo and on to the Strip was pleasant. You walk along the fence by the Flamingo pool for just 2 or 3 minutes and you are at the casino. It was dark at night, but there are security guards and cameras around. We even ran into a couple of guards on bikes riding thru the HGV parking garage one night. This is a great center Strip location. A car is convenient to get groceries and we wanted it to get to the Wisconsin/UNLV football game, but this is a great location if you won't have a car.

Realize the Strip is extremely long, there is a lot of walking, but with Caesar's right across the street, you really can't go wrong here. The service was incredible. From the front desk, to housekeeping, to the bellmen and everyone else, we were always greeted, smiled at, everything was impeccably clean. Our room was beautiful; a one-bedroom in the North Tower with a huge jacuzzi tub, beautiful bathroom, living area and kitchen. My only two gripes about the room were that (1) housekeeping apparently only comes once per week, which I find to be too little -- we arrived on Saturday and they cleaned on Tuesday, which left us with a mess from Tuesday on; (2) the shower water was seldom hot enough. In any event, we had a washer-dryer, a fully equipped kitchen, our room was immaculate and even I, a germophobe, was happy sleeping in the bed, in the sheets, walking barefoot in the room. The hotel has a cute little cafe, and they have amazing coffee if you like it strong. The patio area is great, the pool is cute and they have quite a few amenities. You do have to carry your key around all the time to get into the building, to use the elevator, etc; I had never seen that before, or noticed it, but apparently it is the status quo for timeshare properties. I'd be very happy to go back here, to be honest. This is a beautiful hotel, and the staff made a huge difference.

The sleeper sofa was hard as a boulder, and just about as comfortable. But I did enjoy the breakfast nook treatment for dining. To get anywhere within the resort you had to walk out through the pool area of the Flamingo, but the garden areas with wild life was fun. My major complaint came on the afternoon before my early moring departure. The Flamingo Hotel and Casino was having a private \"Pool Party\", and the management of the Grand Vacations Club informed everyone that there might be some noise. At 4:20PM the sound checks started. My room was shaking from the vibrations. Really. I felt the windows and walls, and could feel the movement. I decided it was not going to get any better so walked down to talk to the folks at the front desk. They said there was nothing they could do, and the music would probably stop around midnight. I asked to speak to a manager, and the assistant manager came out and was sympathetic to my objections. But there was nothing to be done, this happens every now and then, and they have no say over the noise. I could not even watch television because I could not hear it over the non-stop band outside. I had to get up at 4:00AM, and by midnight I was exhausted and upset. Earplugs, pillows over the head, nothing worked. I finally dragged sofa cushions onto the floor in the hallway, directly under the air conditioning vent to try to block out the pounding so I could sleep.

We chose this hotel base on other travelers opinions and we wanted to be in a hotel that did not have the noise and foot traffic of a casino hotel. This was a perfect fit for our needs. We booked a suite since it was just a short stay. The room was very clean and comfortable, overlooking the pool. I liked that the Hilton pool was much smaller and quieter than the Flamingo. Although there was no music at our pool, they cranked up the volume so high at the Flamingo pool that there was no problem hearing it. We never had a problem finding lounges at the pool, in fact, each day we were able to get a cabanna, since we prefer the shade. The pool bar service is friendy and relatively inexpensive. The deli carries almost everything you need for a short stay and the kitchenette in the studio is sufficient for 2 days. If you are staying for a week, I would recommend a 1 BR with a full kitchen so you would have more room and cooking options. The bathroom was updated, nice jetted tub and a separate toilet/shower room. Bed was comfortable as were the pillows. Hotel staff was vey helpful and friendly. I used the treadmill in the fitness center on Sunday. The fitness center is very clean, it has all the basic things you need/want for your workout while on the road. Towels and water are provided also. There is another small spa inside next to the fitnss center as well as a sauna. There is no charge to use any of these facilities. There were a few shortcomings; 1) there was no dish washing soap in the kitchen. I don't mind doing my own dishes, but I don't want to spend the money in the deli for a large dish detergent that I won't use but a few drops and is too large to carry-on in my suitcase. 2) is that there was no make-up mirror in the bathroom. 3) As someone else on this site mentioned, the room has a main door and then 2 doors off the small foyer. The main door is very heavy and \"loud\" when it closes. Fortunately, there was no one in the room next to us, or I'm sure they would have been really irritated at our coming and going.

The building itself is a little dated, but the rooms are nice and have all the amenities you need. Housekeeping service is good. The concierge service was okay-we actually found better prices by going on-line at the business centre and booking the shows we wanted to see that way. The noise factor in the room was reasonable- we couldn't hear people in the hallways or in their own rooms, but we did hear noise from the pool areas during the day. The beds were reasonably comfortable but not as plush as the beds and bedding in many Hilton Hotels. The shower door did not close/fit properly so there was a big mess in the room every time you showered. Guests here had their own pool, children's pool and hot tub, but could also use the large pool intended for guests of the Flamingo Hilton. The pool at the timeshare was not usually very busy, but the hot tub could get crowded. The pool at the Flamingo Hilton was always packed and always had music playing. The pools and hot tubs do not stay open through the evenings (closed around 6). The pools are not heated so it was chilly getting into them in March. There was a little store where you could pick up basic groceries at the timeshare but it was just as easy to walk over to the Flamingo Hotel to pick up some take out at the Voga Terrace or try one of their restaurants (I would recommend the breakfast buffet at the Paradise Buffet). The bird sanctuary at the Flamingo Hotel is nice to walk through. The monorail runs across the back of the property and the city bus runs down the strip in front of the Flamingo Hotel.

The jetted tub is huge and circular; made for two but could fit more if you want to. No complaints about the room. The entire interior was recently updated so all is nice, clean and new. The pool is small but quiet and relaxing with a full bar and misters. The Flamingo pool, which Hilton guests have full access to is a very crowded, mostly young scene. It is nice to be able to choose between the two pools. On weekdays the Go Pool at the Flamingo is not at all crowded. There is loud music and a bar with plenty of free lounges. It is $10 for men to get in and bikini tops are optional. There were very few who went topless. The small mini-mart and deli at the Hilton is convenient and has good Starbucks espresso drinks. The center strip location is excellent! It is a short walk over LV Blvd to Cesars and Bellagio. THe Venetian also isn't too bad a walk. To walk much further in the summer Vegas heat isn't fun. We took the monorail from Flamingo/HGVC a lot. There is an elevator right to the monorail stop outside the main lobby of Hilton or there's a bridge that goes from the Flamingo alongside the pool area to the monorail. It will take you as far as MGM Grand and Sahara. There is a free monorail if you walk across the street from the MGM to Excalibur. This one goes from Excalibur to Luxor and Mandalay Bay. If you want to be on the strip for some Vegas action this is the perfect spot! There is an Albertson's a short ($10 ?) cab ride away and a liquor and convenience store just behind the Hilton. We really enjoyed Pure at Cesars, dinner at the Voodoo Lounge on top of the Rio (excellent steaks! and view!), and the Thunder from Down Under show at the Excalibur. The show was perfect for a bachelorette party. Its a little cheesy but definitely a fun time. If you have a large group (6 or more people) the limos can be cheaper than cabs. They will negotiate on weeknights. In case you haven't already heard tell the cab driver to take Paradise Road to and from the airport and not the freeway. It is about the same amount of time and about $12-$15 instead of $25. Also, it is illegal for cabs and limos to stop on the strip to pick people up. It is well enforced so don't bother.

I had a studio room on the 16th floor. the room was very spacious. I enjoyed having a small fridge, microwave and coffee maker. there is an excellent whirlpool bath set up - there is a large opening between the bathtub and the main room, so you can have a good soak and watch TV if you want. There is a separate private shower and toilet area. The TV was a flat screen of decent size (42\" ?) and the channel selection was good. service was good - daily maid service and friendly staff all around. Small grocery store and deli on the premises was useful, fair prices and good food and excellent coffee. What really makes this place special is its location. It is at the backside of the Flamingo Hotel, and all the rooms overlook the Flamingo's expansive tropical pool grounds. You can use the flamingo pool (good for kids) if you want to hang with the crowd, or you can use the HGVC's small pool and hot tub. I chose to use the HGCV pool as the flamingo pool had all of the sunny chairs taken. There were kids in teh HGVC pool and they seemed to enjoy it. An earlier post on this site refers to the HGVC chairs all being \"reserved\" first thing in the morning. As far as I can tell, what really happens is that staff puts a rolled up towel on each chaise first thing in the morning and they are not being held for anyone. Great little pool bar too with reasonable prices. The grounds immediately adjacent to the hotel are a nice place to have coffee in the morning. I used the monorail to get to the convention center each day. The monorail is right behind the HGVC. It is a little convoluted to get to it as you have to exit the Flamingo pool, enter the Flamingo, and then backtrack along the monorail walkway. Not too far and the monorail comes at least every 10 minutes. I also found a really good pizza place in the Flamingo, over by the actual flamingo (the birds) exhibit. I got take out so I could watch a movie in my room and have a pizza and a couple of cold beers. Speaking of beer, I found a small microbrewery place in the Flamingo too - with stout on tap, which seems to be pretty hard to find in this town. The strip is readily accessible through the Flamingo hotel. I found it enjoyable to walk the strip and then take the monorail back and vice-versa. I would recommend the HGVC for business travelers as it is quiet and they have free internet access and can print your boarding passes. I would also recommend this for families, though I can't really imagine bringing my kids to Vegas. The Flamingo pool is the big family draw and the HGVC provides access to excellent pools and the all the Vegas sites without having to expose your kids to really drunk 20-somethings. I am not giving the HGVC five stars because it is not a five star hotel. However, it is a solid four star in my book. I've stayed at the Golden Nugget (a four-start hotel), which is a low four star in my book, and the HGVC room and service quality are better. It just doesn't have all the bells and whistles (restaurants, nightlife, spa etc.) that must be required to be a four-star. Not all was perfect and I have a few pet peeves. Bed was hotel standard - not one of those dream beds you get in some places. Nice down comforter and pillows though. Couch was a twin fold-out, and I find fold-out couches to be uncomfortable to sit on. I would have much preferred a good solid leather chair or two but I guess they are going for maximizing the guest bed potential. The TV is always pre-tuned to the commercial for the HGVC membership, which wouldn't be too annoying but the volume preset is too loud. The DVD player is a great touch, but the DVD rental kiosk downstairs was busted so I was at the mercy of TBS. On business trips I like to splurge for the overpriced new releases on demand and I was looking forward to watching the new Bond movie, but the HGVC doesn't offer on-demand and the DVD kiosk selection, when working, is limited. The room shares a private foyer with the adjacent one-bedroom condo. The foyer door is keyed too which is nice if you want to rent out the whole two bedroom set-up for a larger group. However, both the foyer door and the two split unit doors close really loud, and on my last night my new neighbors were coming and going from 11PM to midnight (they had friends in another unit, had just gotten in and were situating - yup I heard all their conversations in the foyer) and the loud doors kept me awake. I could not hear their conversations once they went into their room. The key positive to me was the grounds - being able to sit outside and relax surrounded by vegetation and no crowds. I could not find any other hotel on my strip wanderings that offered such a relaxing outdoor area. They all seem to focus on the indoors, or close their pool areas at 5 (nice move for business people), or are so crowded as to not be relaxing. So, if you are still bothering to read this rather lengthy review, I hope this has been of help in making your decision.

Cons: Upon checking in i was told i could show my white charge card and charge things to my room,but after going to numerous restaurant and shops at the Flamingo that was indeed not the case (nor had it for over a month) Brought it to the attention of the front desk and was told that they would look into it.

I had never stayed in Las Vegas before for vacation so I was not sure what to expect. We checked in late Sunday evening and it went very smooth. We had rented a car and the valet was great. Cheap money for the week, about $40 and easy access. Also since HGVC at Flamingo is behind the Flamingo, street access is simple. You do not need to drive down the strip. We were the first ones in a newly renovated 2 bedroom suite. 42\" flat screen tvs in the living room and studio and a smaller flat screen on the wall of the master bedroom. All upgraded granite counters. New furniture. Everything was great. Both rooms had jacuzzi tubs and separate showers. The new shower heads had no pressure adjustments and stung when you used them. If they had a way of turning down the water pressure or using an adjustable head, I think it would have been better. The only other thing that I would prefer they changed is the old 1970 hotel style heating and cooling. The temperature gauge went from cool to heat. Then there is the switch for low, medium and high fan and another switch for low, medium and off. I would prefer a thermostat with a temperature setting that allows the fan to turn off, but otherwise it functioned fine. You have complete access to the Flamingo pool, but since we were there the end of September, the pool closed at 4pm because it is \"OFF SEASON\"...although it was 96 degrees out.. Strange.... HGVC also has their own pool next to the Flamingo pool. It is fenced off and only accessible to guests of HGVC. It is smaller with a hot tub, small bar for drinks and a nice pool. It is much quieter and open until 10pm. This was great. The people at the HGVC were excellent. Always smiling, always saying hello and very helpful. Any issues we had were addressed almost immediately. My brother in law was in a wheel chair and we were able to rent an electric scooter type chair in the lobby. The bellman, Jesus, helped us get a good discount off the original listed price and we appreciated his help. There is a a deli that has good food and is reasonably priced.

I was told this is one of their original properties, purchased around 1994. It is on the grounds of the Flamingo Las Vegas. However, we discovered that they are no longer affiliated in any way. Hilton has a much newer, nicer property at the north end of the strip, but you can't beat this one's location. It is on the strip behind the Flamingo which is next to Bally's and Paris and across the street from Caeser's and Bellagio. Check-in was good, however the parking for HGVC is actually about a five to ten minute walk to the Flamingo's employee garage which has NO ELEVATOR'S, and guests can only park on level three or higher (because this is the employee garage for the Flamingo). It would have been nice to have been told this by the check-in desk. Do yourself a favor and drop you bags off at your room first if you're parking a car. And be careful because the walk is behind the Flamingo on an access road that doesn't always have a sidewalk. Imagine walking in the street in Vegas with luggage while delivery trucks and taxi's speed by. It is the most ridiculous parking situation I've ever seen -- but it's free! The HGVC has it's own pool/jacuzzi area which is separate from the Flamingo. This is a good thing as the Flamingo pool area was always extremely crowded with hundreds of people and lots of kids (as well as really murky, cloudy water). The HGVC has a deli/market open until 10pm with a pretty extensive variety of items. Think of it as a cross between a small convenience store and Starbucks. It also serves breakfast sandwiches, wraps, subs, and pizza. And if you're an owner you get a 10% discount on all purchases. Our unit was a one bedroom apartment. On the plus side, it was a good size and was extremely clean. On the negative side, the decor was obviously inspired by the Flamingo in the early 90's and has a Golden Girls pink/green theme. The stove and microwave in the kitchen were functional, but old. The bathroom was enormous, with an extremely large jacuzzi tub that easily fit two people. However, the sinks and tub were very dated. My biggest complaint was the sofa in the living room was very old and had multiple stains. I have one complaint in terms of service --- the binder in your rooms that explains \"owner\" benefits include a 10% discount at all restaurants at the adjoining Flamingo Las Vegas as well as any Flamingo Las Vegas logo items from their gift store. As I mentioned earlier, the Flamingo and HGVC are no longer affiliated in any way and the Flamingo did not honor this 10% discount AT ALL. I brought this to the attention of someone at the check-in desk and she shrugged her shoulder's and said, \"Yeah, it's real hit or miss. The manager is trying to work something out with them. You can fill out a comment card if you want\". I told her it was not the fact that the Flamingo wasn't honoring it, it was the fact that the binder in my room says they are! Change the binders if you no longer have an agreement! I realize this is not a huge issue, but it irked me. Overall, this property is for you if you are interested in a central location on the strip. It's clean and spacious and the staff were (overall) extremely friendly and helpful.

Walking distance to Bally's, Harrah's, Bellagio etc. If you want to go along the Strip and see the various casino's - purchase a 24-hour monorail ticket ($9) since there is a station connected at the Flamingo. Monorail runs from MGM to the Sahara. There is a separate monorail that runs from the Excalibur to Mandalay Bay.

This composed of two bedrooms (king beds) with TVs, w/a DVD or VCR and a sleeper sofa, two hot tubs (a single and double), two shower stalls, small kitchen, dining table, sleeper sofa and living room area with a TV. Beds were super firm, basic 'hotel' type bedding - nothing dreamy or super fluffy about them. Couch had minor stains from leftovers. Walls were dirty with handprints and food stains in the kitchen. Dishwasher, coffee makes, toaster, etc. Sub par cleaning performed or at least to my personal cleaning standards. Room overlooked the pool and faced Bally's.

The Flaming has a very large pool (3.5 - 4 feet deep only), life guards, has a kids slide at one end, a separate European sunbathing area - adults only & a pair of tennis courts. About the pool area - When we were there, adults would go down to the HGVC pool starting around 6am to reserve Cabana's (there is a total of 5 available - they have fans and water-misters) and chairs. Very annoying since it was the same families time after time. I complained to the pool staff and had their items removed from the Cabana since the family left for the other Flamingo pool for over 2 hours while leaving their item within the cabana. A lot of kids, a lot of teenagers and young adults. Loud music plays at both pools. Heavy smoking going on around the pools too.. since the HGVC is non-smoking inside. 2nd hand smoke all around the pool. Parents at times put their kids - in diapers - into the pool - GROSS! When we were their - a child (4/5) swallowed too much pool water and puked his lunch into the pool. Hence it was shut down and needed to be cleaned for the day...

Went on all the rollercoasters the Manhatten Express was fastastic and Stratosphere tower the rides are crazy!!! We saw many shows I can reccomend Jubilee, Ka (was amazing a must see) Blue Man group and mystere. Take as much money as you can cause there is soooo much to do. Go and see the sound and light show downtown at the old part of vegas it's cheaper to eat and drink there too. Shopping is fantastic...go to fashion show mall near Treasure Island. We hired a car and drove to death Vally and stopped off at the very eeerie junction, beautifl landscapes at furnace creek. We also went LA which was pretty cool. Go to Calico which is a little ghost town it's a bit touristy but quite good! Oh and go to the Hoover Dam visitor centre it's very interesting!!! I would definatly go back to Vegas but maybe for a week next time!", "Date": "June 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cHighly recommended.\u201d", "Author": "docajenk", "ReviewID": "UR7656030", "Content": "Excellent in all respects.

It was also very quiet but that may have been because we had the room at the far south end of the 6th floor. We didn't share an entry way with a studio room like some of the other one bedroom suites did. The only problem with the room was the corner of the wallpaper by the shower was peeling up slightly. The maid service was great. They even did the dishes for us every day. And the timeshare presentation we got was very low pressure. But that may just have been our salesguy \"Big Jim\".

Because I'm a Diamond Hilton member, he booked this place - not knowing it was a timeshare project. We were not upgraded upon check-in, but did receive deli coupons (for overpriced, inedible breakfat selections). The one-bedroom was great with an enormous, jetted tub. However, we were constantly awakened by our neighbors going in and out of their room. There is one central double door for two rooms - then another door once inside the central area. Be warned that this is not a regular hotel. The only maid service was changing of the towels and our bed being made. There is no other cleaning beyond that. There are no restaurants on property - only a deli with nasty, overpriced food. The staff was not informed on the restaurants or shows of the area. And the main activity of the place is selling timeshares. Be aware that if you refuse their first offer of \"cash or chips\" for 90 minutes of your time, they may up the ante (after all, this is Las Vegas)!", "Date": "March 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "geneseo il", "Title": "\u201cAnother nice stay at the HGVC at the Flamingo\u201d", "Author": "kalcansb", "ReviewID": "UR4583019", "Content": "Stayed here Jan.13th(Friday) thru Jan.16th(Monday). Had another nice stay here (first time was Aug 2002), we chose to return here mostly because I thought it was the most reasonable rate for a room with a jacuzzi. The location is excellent, you are a short walk to the Flamingo which I would say is about right in the middle of the strip. The monorail has a stop at the Flamingo(the monorail is pretty much in the parking lot of the HGVC) this was a surprise since it was not here in 2002. We did not ride the monorail since some friends of ours stayed here at the HGVC also, so it was cheaper just to take a quick cab ride. Both times we have stayed here we have never been bothered by the HGVC trying to sell us a timeshare, I wish I could say that for everywhere else we walked, it seems Vegas has discovered the timeshare in a big way. This time we did not have our children with us and had a studio instead of a 1 bedroom. Overall the 1 bedroom was better(duh) but still the studio was quite nice. Overall the stay was excellent and would easily stay here again.", "Date": "March 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alaska", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed\u201d", "Author": "Crazy", "ReviewID": "UR4521898", "Content": "I was really disappointed with this Hilton. We stayed in a studio room (I am a Hilton gold but was not upgraded at check-in). The timeshare part of this hotel was on the verge of harassing, as they would call us in our room a few times a day leaving us message after message. The few times we were in the room and answered the phone, the gal wanted to know how many of us there were, was I there with my husband, etc. and she was very disappointed when finding out I was not interested in the timeshare part. Still, that did not stop the phone calls from continuing! Finally, after 4 days of this, I went down to the desk and asked to speak with the manager. She was very nice, understanding, and put an end to the phone calls for the rest of our trip. It's ironic that this hotel would push the timeshare here anyway as the towels are very thin (even had a few with substanital holes in them), the floor of our shower had part of the tile missing, and our bed was really hard,uncomfortable, and on two different days was made up with stained sheets! Definitely not up to par with the other Hiltons I have stayed in. The tub and the kitchenette were nice but didin't make up for the negatives. There are so many better hotels in Vegas.
