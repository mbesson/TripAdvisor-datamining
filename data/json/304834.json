The overall vibe is elegant and luxurious. The location is amazing - not only is it a five-minute walk from Taksim and Istiklal, but the hotel's neighbourhood, Talimhane, is a fantastic area in its own right. There are several great restaurants and night spots within two blocks of The Central Palace, so even if you don't feel like going out-out one night, you can pop into Rouge bar across the street or Udonya on the corner and have a great meal or some drinks. As a female photographer travelling alone, I felt perfectly safe and comfortable walking around the neighbourhood alone, at night, with my camera out. I asked for a high floor, and was given room 901. Some (perhaps all) of the 9th-floor rooms have private terraces, and I believe 9 is the only floor with terraces (certainly the floors above me did not have them). It was snowing during my trip, so I can't say I particularly used the terrace much, but I can imagine it would be nice to sit out there in the spring or autumn. However, there's not much in the way of privacy, as those staying in upper-floor rooms can look out their windows and see what you're doing on your terrace. There go your plans for naked terrace dancing. 901 doesn't have a spectacular view, but you can see bits of skyline here and there. It's not a terrible view, either. The room was comfortable, and although I didn't have my own thermostat, the room always seemed to be a reasonable temperature. I slept very well in the bed. It was described as a king-sized bed, but I would say it was a large double or maybe a small queen-sized at most. Definitely not a king. Still, I was on my own, so it wasn't that big a deal in my case. I've seen others complaining that their jacuzzi didn't work... the one in 901 worked perfectly. It was a great way to warm up after coming in from the snow. Again, it's only large enough for one person, so if you're looking at the jacuzzi option as part of a romantic getaway, there's no way two people will fit in there (or three, if that's your thing - I'm not judging you, I'm just telling you there won't be much jacuzzi action). Nice big TV in the room with many international channels... personally I didn't come to Istanbul to watch TV, but if you're planning on spending a lot of time in the room, you won't be disappointed. The staff were very helpful and responded well to requests. Everyone I talked to spoke good English, I had no communication problems whatsoever. Food: I only took advantage of the included breakfast twice. I read reviews saying how great the selection is, but really I think it's made to look bigger than it actually is by the addition of eight million different kinds of bread. So if you like a lot of bread at breakfast, you'll be very happy. Unfortunately powdered Nescaf\u00c3\u00a9 was the only drink resembling coffee, so I found myself going out to have breakfast at places where real coffee was served. I did also have room service one evening, and it was delicious - they sent up a club sandwich that was just phenomenal, and the price was similar to other restaurants in the area, so that was nice. Very pleased with that. In terms of my specific room, 901 worked out well for me. It's away from any other rooms, so it was pretty quiet, and I wasn't even aware of any other guests on my floor. As a solo traveller, the room was a perfect size. It would also be suitable for couples who like each other, but maybe a bit small for two people who are not in a romantic relationship (though if you stay in 901, feelings may develop between you two by the end of the second or third day). The only down side to the room is that it's right near the service lift, so there is some noise from housekeeping coming in and out of the lift with trolleys, and sometimes in the morning they failed to keep their voices down. Oh, speaking of housekeeping - my advice to you is to make liberal use of your Do Not Disturb sign. Otherwise the cleaning crew will just come barging in without warning at 8.30 in the morning. Once I started using the DND sign everything was fine, I would just take the sign off when I went out for the day, and the room would be clean when I came back in the late afternoon. Housekeeping does an excellent job, the room was spotless, but they are a bit overzealous when it comes to trying to gain access to the room. I almost felt like they were trying to catch me doing something. Overall, I had a great time. I do visit Istanbul semi-frequently, and I'd be very likely to stay at The Central Palace again. The location is perfect, the hotel is well-maintained, and the area is safe. Next time, though, I'll probably ask for a room on the opposite side of the hotel from the service lift, just to get that little bit of extra silence.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kathmandu, Nepal", "Title": "\u201cA hotel in a stone throw away from Taksim Square\u201d", "Author": "ckanchan", "ReviewID": "UR118854760", "Content": "This is a small hotel which is just a stone throw away from Taksim Square.

Please note the acoustic insulation towards the corridor was really poor. Changing the room proved to be very very difficult. Only after repeated complaints, they changed my room. My colleague's room was located on the front side of the hotel, where live music from a bar next to the hotel made it impossible to get some sleep until nearly 2.30 Even if the situation improved after changing the rooms, we still endured some discomfort as the build-on building is under construction (as well as another construction site over the way).

The hotel is in quite a sweet location, being quietly located in a traffic free area by Taksim Square.

Noise isn't really a problem as the windows are double glazed, however there is quite a lot of dust around and building materials strewn about, messing up an otherwise cute little street.

I stayed 5 nights in The Central Palace, this is my 2nd time staying in this hotel, I arrived at 3:00 pm but the room was not ready, I waited m0re than half an hour, I was upset because of that, when I entered the room all that forgotten, the room was big & fantastic & luxury. Location: excellent location in Taksim area, the most beautiful area in Istanbul, you can find every thing you need there, restaurants, coffee shops, shops, & the subway is steps from the hotel. Recommended hotel for the persons who are looking for great room with great value.", "Date": "August 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid", "Title": "\u201cGreat location but lack of cleanliness\u201d", "Author": "Madrid_2007", "ReviewID": "UR35932152", "Content": "The location at Taskim Square is great. Close to the main shopping street and eating out areas. The hotel is a bit old, but quite nice; front desk is very friendly. Breakfast was ok, obviousely it is not Western style, but one cannot expect this I think. However, our room was not clean; when we entered it was not cleaned properly, but we did not say anything; but the following days the cleaning was very poor. A cup of tea we used did not get cleaned; the following day we used two cups, which were afterwards dirty and did not get cleaned. We needed to call management to get a cleaner send over. She cleaned and took cups and glasses away...but without replacing them. For that reason and only for that I cannot recommend this hotel.", "Date": "July 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "Tigger210", "ReviewID": "UR35375156", "Content": "would highly recommend the hotel.
