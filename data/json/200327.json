As I was a student travelling to Berlin to see the historical sites, I was extremely pleased with the choice of hotel the school had chosen. The hotel is modern with clean, comfortable rooms and amazing breakfasts. Just what you need when you are out and about the entire day.  The rooms themselves are cosy and were cleaned every day by the cleaners. I especially enjoyed the fact that there was a hairdryer equipped in the bathroom with a fantastic power shower. The hotel isn't that close to the airport, we took public transport (tube and bus station are literally round the corner) and that took 20 mins.All in all a good base for exploring Berlin. Even though school groups were hustled into the back room so as not to agitate the normal guests!", "Date": "Mar 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR307731600", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "5", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Frizzbomb"}, {"Content": "Simple, functional and friendly The hotel is very close to the airport... unfortunately to the end of the runway and not the terminal... and so from 7 a.m. - 10 p.m. there are very low flying aircraft bearing down on the hotel. It did nt bother me as I was out all day on business at the Messe. Taxi fare to or from Tegel Airport was about 10 Euro... took almost 15 minutes arriving and under ten when leaving.The local area has nothing special about it but on the other hand it is safe and there are quite a few shops and a shopping centre and a couple of nice restaurants nearby ( one of them called Angelo and Antonio's next to the Hotel Barlin was very good ) plus fast food outlets.I booked through Bookings.com and found it all went very smoothly. I had emailed the hotel as well advising that I would arrive late but never got a reply.Check in was late at night but was handled in an efficient, quick and friendly manner. Check out three nights later was early morning and also done rapidly. The breakfast buffet is good without being fantastic with my only complaint being that the scrambled eggs were always really over cooked. Despite being busy there was plentiful seating space. The bar staff are an excellent, friendly and kind team... really well done.The room is a little tired but was well cleaned all the time. Fridge, microwave, and television in the room ( almost 30 German language channels plus Sky News - strange that a French company does not include French TV channels ). The bed was a bit too soft for my liking. I had asked for a large bed and got two singles. The room looked as if only one single was supposed to be there and another had been added. Bathroom and towels were clean, shower nice and strong, but the floor collected too much water when having a shower and the basin drain was weak.In short, not the best hotel, but good value for money and I would willingly return next year. In previous years I have stayed at two different Holiday Inns and found this Mercure would probably get my booking over the HIs next time. Though I did notice that the Mercure City West also has a very good location.", "Date": "Mar 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR147898774", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "swisssinai"}, {"Content": "Not An Airport Hotel Don't be misled that this is an airport hotel; it is not. There is no shuttle and to reach it from the airport takes over 15 minutes by bus or taxi. When we arrived on Sunday the dining room/coffee shop was not continuously open. The hotel is located in a rather uninteresting part of town. It may be OK if you have business in Berlin-Reinickendorf, but otherwise I see no reason to stay there. We felt cheated by the name of the establishment.", "Date": "Jun 6, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR428592740", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "siestageorge"}, {"Content": "Excellent Hotel Excellent hotel. Only a 10 minute journey by bus from Tegel airport. Rooms and bathroom large and clean. Buffet brekfast - delicious and plenty of choice. Only a couple of minutes walk from Kurt Schumacher Platz underground station (U6). The public transport system in Berlin is excellent - the best I've come accross. If you're there for any length of time get a 5 or 7 day ticket which lets you have unlimited journeys on the U-bahn, s-bahn, trams and buses (but be sure you get your ticket date stamped before you first use it or you could be fined).I would definately reccomend staying here.", "Date": "Mar 21, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR809789025", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "BrianW01"}, {"Content": "Professionality, cleanliness, hospitality...
