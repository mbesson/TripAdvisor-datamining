I didn't have much time to research but know the Tsim Sha Tsui area and this seemed to be the best deal for the price. The taxi driver had problems finding it (as did others in the reviews) and we directed him using our map. I was a bit shocked at the location in what looked like a bit of a shabby back street up a steep, if short hill. First impressions were not good as the hotel doesn't have a proper reception, just a side doorway into a lift lobby. The lift was in the process of refurbishment and was lined with plywood and tape - rather depressing! The reception on the 9th floor was just a very small area in front of the lift and there were virtually no facilities other than a very small bar/lounge area which I couldn't have imagined spending time in. The room was pleasant if compact and the bathroom an attractive but unusual design which rather dominated the room. Definitely not for anyone who values their privacy. It looked new and was very nicely decorated. I would really put this more in the category of an apartotel rather than a hotel. The staff were pleasant at the desk but other than check in/check out there was no service or facilities to enjoy. The dual aspect views from the windows on our very high floor were great. I was envious of the large public pool complex in the park below. The free wifi was a bonus, a major irritant when it's lacking or charged for. The area seemed very strange at night. We ventured out for something to eat, by this time very late at night and had a bad experience in the local traditional chinese restaurant (didn't note the name) but they appeared not to understand English. Even though I carefully pointed out and confirmed my dish I was brought something totally different containing lots of fatty pork (I don't eat meat!) the waiter just walked off when I objected and asked for it to be changed. By this time I was too tired to bother. Incidentally this was the only bad meal I had in HK. The next day the area appeared less seedy and and turned out to be very convenient for sightseeing. The free airport bus at the bottom of the short hill was a real bonus. I wouldn't plan to stay again at this hotel, though if it was the cheapest in the category I might be swayed. It was however preferable to the BP International where we stayed the following night.", "Date": "May 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWell-priced hotel in the centre of Hong Kong\u201d", "Author": "charlie_steel", "ReviewID": "UR127514895", "Content": "Great room with excellent facilities, bathroom clean and well-equipped.

The location was perfect, everything within walking distance; very easy access to subways and the ferry which takes you to the other part of the island. In Hong Kong, if you want grocery store with European/Western food, go to either the Elements plaza (by the Ritz Carlton) or to the Queensplaza - you can access both locations very easy by subway. The Queensplaza had an excellent restaurant (in the basement/ in the grocery shop) that served western type breakfast and lunches, very good price as well. We had a great experience and absolutely loved this hotel. We will definitely stay at this place again while in Hong Kong. Great value for your money.

However there are also a lot of choices for budget/valued conscious minded travels and this is one of my favorite! I travel to HK a lot and because of a friend working in the Starwood group I always stay at the W in Kowloon station. So I consider myself pretty spoiled about hotels in HK. When I no longer can get the family and friends rate at the W, I've been experimenting with boutique hotels in the Tsim Sha Tsui area. The rule of thumb I had is, hotels get cheaper and better with each city block you are willing to walk away from a MTR station or the Harbor City mall. This hotel fits the description the best! If you are someone who only need a decent place to rest at night while you roam the city by day this one of the place for you! As my title suggests, you pay for the things you need and nothing you don't! I got upgraded into a harbor view room upon arriving for free which was great! The hotel is great (4 star), roomy for HK, has free internet, and just 4 blocks from the closest MTR entrance. It doesn't have a giant lobby or a hotel front which you don't need anyway. Note there is no swimming pool which is something you may like to have for a vacation. However because it the 15-19th floor rooms on a top of a hill you actually get a view of the harbor and the sea, which usually cost an arm or a leg in HK! The only down side is 35 degree uphill leading into the hotel. Its not for disabled or heavy luggage. Also the walls a bit thing so its easy to hear noise from the hallway. In the area I've tried, the Marco Polo Prince, The Mira, and the Butterfly on Prat. The Prince is your standard 4 star hotel roomy and great location in the middle of the shopping mall, but it doesn't have free internet and cost twice ($200-$300) as Butterfly. The Mira is trendy and most W like, but when you take a step back, its an older 3 star hotel layout with a giant face lift decorated into a 5 star boutique and cost like a 5 star. The Bauhinia and Butterfly are both great values. The Bauhinia is a bit farther away but I find it to be a even better value than Butterfly on Prat in terms of the quality of the room and price!

The room was designed to utalise space in a way i had never seen before, the shower was placed almost in the centre of the room with an external curtain for privacy and the way it opened up the room was great it made the whole area seem larger. All the good things were included here such as free wifi and cable tv. The hotel also had a small vending machine and free computers with internet for guests as well as offering printing via the front desk ($5HKD per sheet). A business/meeting room was also on the reception level it looked nice from the outside. The location was great as it was not far from the MTR station or shops but in particular a small row of restuarants and bars just over the road was great lots of variety and quality food available. Our favorite was the ben and jerry's ice cream stand. It is a great hotel for what it is, reasonably priced, small but uses it well. It lacked some features like room service or a restaurant but made up for all this through locaton. Also the mini fridge in the room was empty which actually proved quite practical for us.

It's really 45degree steep and imagine we are carrying big luggages and climb all the way up. phewww...sweat but if you take cab, this should not be a prob for you. Also if you have more than 2 persons, advise you to take the cab. Save time, energy and money too!! It tooks about HK$ 230 per cab from airport to TST.

I took the train to Kowloon station from the airport and then a taxi - Train cost $hk90, and taxi was about $hk50. Observatory court is off Observatory road which is off Kimberly road. My Taxi driver didn't know where it was, but did find it. I was upgraded to a harbour view room on arrival which was lovely.The room was small, with the shower room being in the room, I quite liked it and being on my own was great, but if tere were 2 of you could be a bit cramped for more than a couple of nights. Complimentary Wifi in the room helped. Many of to places to eat in the immediate area are chinese and good value, I ate a couple of times on Kimberly road in a 'cafe; no one spoke english, but picture food is a good send and it was good. Walk to the Main MTR station was about 10 mins Max entrance by teh HSBC bank on Nathan road. MTR is a touch screen and is a great way to get around teh city. Took the metro to the central district where the IFC shopping mall is and to my mind a lot more westernised! That cost about $hk9, whilst the Star Ferry about a 20 minute walk is $hk2. if you are staying there for a while invest in an Octopys card. a Great Restaurant to eat in, in the central district is Wagyu in Wyndham street - Do book, it is rammed especially on a weekend. Food it great and reasonable prices, wine very expensive! Went up to the peak by tram, paid for a return, but actually came back by the number 14 bus which cost $hk 10, well worth it as it winds down the peak, you get a great perspective of the city. Also if you are gong to do the Buddha on Lantau, take the MTR to central change and get the Orange line straight to the cable car. $hk16.50 from TST, takes about 30 mins and is teh quickest wayto get there. Cable car return is about $hk145. well worth it - get great views of teh new airport and obviously the surrounding countryside. The Buddha is absolutely amazing, but the 26o odd steps to teh stop do take it out of yu if you are not fit. Also if it is a hot day take a hat or brolly as the locals do! Final tip, on leaveing you can pick up the K4 on the corner of Kimberly and Observatory, this is free to Kowloon station, and you can then check in at the station and let your bags go off to teh airport, whilst you travel without the agro. no queues, it was great. Even greater to see my bag arrivce at destination :-) (initially was a bit worried). Great service and something I think the UK Lacks! Aother Final tip, there is a local supermarket on Kimberly, where I bought water, $hk5, for 2 litre of water, well worth the purchase. Was only there 1 half days/2 nights so did not get a chance to do Mong kok or the night market or all the other things that there are to do, however I have no hesitation of recommending teh Bauhinia, once you get your bearings it is easy to get around and teh reception staff were lovely.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shenzhen, China", "Title": "\u201cGave our rooms away - Untrustworthy\u201d", "Author": "powerrose", "ReviewID": "UR118589783", "Content": "We booked 2 rooms for 4 people through Agoda at this hotel. We prepaid in full for the rooms several weeks in advance. We booked two superior rooms with double beds for two nights.

My opinion about this hotel is that they could care less about customers and won't think twice about selling your reserved room to make a few bucks. They knew we would have trouble finding other accommodations on short notice and screwed us, because they could. They were even so dishonest that they labeled their very low quality handicapped rooms as \"deluxe\" and think their customers are stupid enough to fall for it. They had every opportunity to offer ANYTHING to compensate us or make us happy and they didn't. Even when we switched to the room with 2 single beds, the rooms were not great quality.

Catch the Airport Express train from the Airport to Kowloon, then take the free K4 hotel transfer bus from the train station to the Empire hotel, it's just up the hill from there. Costs about US$15 I think, and it's quicker than a taxi. Also on the way back to the airport you can check in at the train station (bag check-in and all). At least we could with Cathay Pacific.

Turns out, we were thrilled with this hotel. Some of the TripAdvisor reviews had mentioned the dreaded hill that this hotel is located on, (and me being very unfit was not looking forward to) but the hill was no problem - it's very short and has stairs. This hotel was great. We managed to get upgraded and the room ended up being quite large and very modern and funky - loved the shower! It was a pleasure to stay here for our holiday. Our room came with all the little luxuries (in terms of soaps, shampoos etc) plus FREE internet which was a godsend. I'd bought a cute little Panda toy which I sat on the bed each morning when I made it (I always make the bed somewhat regardless of room service) and there happened to be a cap sitting on the other side.....one night we'd returned back to the room and I'd found the little Panda sitting on my bed wearing the cap on his head (which clearly room service had done).....it was sooooo cute! I loved that they'd done that! A word of advice - being such a new hotel, many taxi drivers are not aware of it's location, but as the Stanford Hillview hotel is just opposite, it's easier to direct the taxi driver to it instead as they are well aware of it's location. We were aware that the hotel has no restaurant as we were up early each day and back to the hotel late at night, this was never a problem as we ate when we were out. And besides, not having a restaurant means cheaper accommodation rates! Aside from the funky modern rooms, the other great thing about this hotel is the location!! Walk to the Science Centre, Museum, Tsim Sha Shui Ferry Terminal and esplanade overlooking the harbour, MTR, Kowloon park, the list goes on!! But all up, this hotel was a nice modern comfortable (in fact the beds were so comfy I slept like a baby) place to stay and the location was just amazing.

This hotel does not have meal service, but there is plenty in the area, including bars across the street. I did not once wish that they served food. Honestly, the only bad thing I can say is that our second day there, housekeeping forgot to leave a roll of toilet tissue, but it was quickly fixed. The room was cleaned amazingly each day and all of the shampoos etc replaced, including the toothbrushes despite those being easily reusable! Hong Kong rooms are notoriously small, even in the 5-star hotels, but I found there to be plenty of space. My friend and I had 1 fairly large suitcase to share, and we found that there were places out of the way to tuck it.
