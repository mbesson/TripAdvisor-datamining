On arrival, we were very well greeted by Franco and another colleague. Our bags were taken to our room straight away. They also warned me about the hotel lift and that my baby's pushchair will not fit into the lift... And it very nearly did not. It is the tiniest lift ever.. The chair and me fitted but only just. The room was clean but small especially for a triple room. Bathroom was ok. There is a fridge so I could buy milk for my daughter. On the first night I asked for milk at the hotel as the supermarkets were already shut and they charged me \u20ac3 for a small jug. Not complaining as glad I managed to get milk but was glad to find a supermarket the next day as 1 litre bottle of milk cost only around \u20ac1.50. No kettle though. We edit not try the breakfast as heard it was all cold food and I don't like cold breakfast. Also I got a password for the wifi which is fast and I had connection in the room perfectly fine even though we were on the 5th floor. If you need a cot for babies, they charge a shocking \u20ac15 per night. Location is pretty good. From termini station, it takes around 10mins walk though there is a metro station about 5mins away from the hotel. Rome is a fantastic city and is best seen on foot.

Rooms are a bit dark but it is a part of general interior design so it actually looks even interesting and creates the \"old mansion\" atmosphere. First thing that surprised me was the size of the elevator. People suffering from claustropfobia - deffinitely ask for a room on lower floors so that you wouldn't need to use the elevator!!! It's aprox 70cm wide and 1m deep. So the first time we used it i was really feeling uncomfortable, but later after walking for 10 hours i felt quite okay riding that \"glass coffin\" to the 5th floor so you'll get used to it. Personnel is really nice and polite. TV has no English channels so be sure to have a laptop with you if you wish to wach a movie in the evening. WiFi is free, just ask administrator for a password, connection is also very good and stable. In January in the evening it get's rather cold even in Italy but it's no problem as air conditioning keeps the air in the room as warm as you like. Breakfast is very light, no warm dishes but it is totally sufficient for a day start and the coffee is really good (same as pastries). If you need to open a bottle of wine go downstairs to the bar( in case if bartender is away just ask administrator to help). The only thing that i could complain about is the low level of soundproofing - i could hear what is happening in the corridor and they could hear what was happening in our room. But it is Italy, so feel free to be noisy and be ready to hear people talking emotionally and all the time :) In case of night check-out they offer a transfer to Fiumicino for 55euros, but you can also use the night Cotral bus.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNana x 2\u201d", "Author": "Sandra L", "ReviewID": "UR122806888", "Content": "We (two females) booked this hotel through my Travel Agent and all reports seemed to be good.

I even had to close the bathroom door. The single bed was also very narrow so be warned if you're not accustomed to sleeping on a narrow single bed.

We had breakfast three mornings and weren't bored by the varieties on offer. Lots of fresh meats and cheeses, pastries, cakes, bread rolls, fruit and fruit juice, coffee and many varieties of tea. Filled up on breakfast, we didn't eat until the evenings, it was enough to keep us going as we trekked around Rome. We'd read comments about the antiquated lift, but we had no problems with it, Only once did someone leave the outer door open on another floor so we couldn't use it.

The hotel decor is dated and the rooms are dark. The elevator often would not work during our stay, usually because someone left its gate open on any of the floors, which caused it not to work. The stair hike from any of the upper floors to the lobby or breakfast room was difficult (especially for my arthritic knees). I was initially pleased that our room had a bathtub with shower rather than the tiny shower stall in other rooms. However, the tub had no glass screen or curtain and it was just about impossible to take a shower without the entire bathroom getting soaked. The towels were thin and skimpy. The breakfast selections were only OK. As breakfast is included in the price of the room, the limited continental breakfast (juice, coffee & tea, canned fruit -- no fresh, cold cereal, cheese & ham) was understandable but not as good as comparable hotels we stayed at during our trip. The staff was not good at giving directions (They did but we usually found better routes). The restaurants they recommended were the ones they got a kick-back for and definitely not the best around. Nevertheless there were literally hundreds of restaurants and cafes within walking distance so good choices were plentiful. The location was OK and as others have said, you could walk to the train station (where there are also hop-on-off buses. Because we had luggage, the hotel advised us to get there initially by cab so we did, not knowing that the charge for the 6 block ride was going to be 37 EURO! We walked back to the station when we left, rolling our luggage. Even then, when I asked for the best walking route, the desk attendant directed us down the narrowest street with uneven sidewalks, which was partially blocked by a street market. We cut off onto a much wider street with smooth sidewalks. So if you stay at the Montecarlo, either walk or take one of the hotel shuttle buses or a city bus from and to the train station.

Being just north-west of a major station the area is a bit rough-and-ready, with more than its fair share of local \"wildlife\", but we never felt unsafe or threatened. Also, for those who care about such things, there's an adult cinema and strip club round the corner. Again, you won't notice them except the frontage (no pun intended). Busses run from Termini to everywhere you want to go, and the metro \"A\" and \"B\" lines cross there so it's the perfect starting point for your journeys around the city. The rooms have decent bathrooms, beds and aircon. Staff are on the whole friendly and helpful and the prices were great for the location.

You're in Rome!) so I can't tell you anything about the food. My main positive about this place is location for the price, which is pretty darn good. My main negative would be that the beds are very hard. This is a general Italian thing, and the hotel provide blankets which we used under the sheets to soften the beds.. Finally a couple of tips if you stay here: First: There's a great cafe down the road (Ristocampo, V.

But it was decent enough for out stay that we did not notice it to much. There was a small tv in the room and it was kinda of fun to watch old reruns of eight is enough and the A-Team in Italian. We payed extra to have breakfast at the hotel. It was good, pastries, cereals, fruits and a lady that would make coffees for you. The hotel is a good distance from many of the major landmarks but it was still walkable. It was also near the train station where you could catch a train or subway or a cab if you did not feel like walking. There are several good restaurants near the hotel and they all had great food. Only bad thing about the hotel was that the a/c was very weak about all it did was keep the humidity down so we would have to keep our window open a bit to keep the room cooled.

The Hotel Montecarlo is well situated close to Roma Termini railway station (ca 10 min walk). However, the metro station Castro Pretorio (line B) is closer to the hotel than the Termini station. There are plenty of hotels in the area and also many embassies are located near the hotel (incl. e.g. Turkey and United Kingdom), so there were soldiers guarding on the nearby streets 24 hours a day. There is an adult cinema theatre around the corner from the hotel but it did not cause any nuisance to passers-by. The hotel seemed to be rather recently renovated as the bathrooms were pretty new and the rooms were clean. The staff in the reception and at breakfast was very helpful. We had booked a double and a single room in the \"classic\" (i.e. cheaper) category. They proved to be very good and filled all our needs. Views from both rooms were normal street views. Beds were good and rooms of decent size, not very big though. The rooms have wall-to-wall carpets which made the air a bit stuffy. The double room was similar to those advertised on hotel's website. The single room was with similar decor but naturally smaller. In the single room the bathroom was rather cramped and the shower cubicle very small and the slat door of the cubicle was very difficult to close causing water from the shower watering half of the bathroom before you managed to get the door closed. Air-conditioning in the rooms was efficient but rather noisy. The air-conditioning could be regulated from the room, but adjusting it did not affect the noise it made (unless you switched it off completely). The rooms were equipped with a safe and minibar where the prices were the same as in the hotel's lounge bar. The hotel building seems to be an old residential building. There are still private residences in the 3rd and 6th floor as well as in the parts behind the actual hotel. Owners of these private residences use the same staircase as hotel residents although they have their own entrance from the side street. The biggest drawback in the hotel is its poor breakfast. It is a continental type buffet breakfast with very very limited selection. There is absolutely nothing fresh on the table and no meat cutlets or sausages, either. The breakfast consists of bread rolls, butter and processed cheese, jams, sweet pastries and sweet pies, cereals, and tinned fruits and tinned fruitsalad and a selection of juices. Coffee and tea are served to the tables. The breakfast room is a rather small place (two small rooms). Notice! This hotel is not suitable for the disabled due to the number of stairs. There are half a dozen steps from the street to the reception, then a couple of steps to the bar lounge from which again half a dozen steps down to the lift. Also the breakfast room is located in the basement to which lead only a narrow staircase.

The bathroom had all modern facilities including bath/shower, bidet and large sink. All were very clean. Unfortunately we did not receive the room as shown in the pictures advertised. The room we did get was similarly decorated but on the small side, almost cramped. Although perfectly sized for one person. Our biggest grumble with our room was the lighting. Where the ceiling light should have been was a smoke detector (a good thing), the only illumination came from two dull wall lights, both situated on the same side of the room. If you like your gadgets or simply wish to charge your phone/camera, there were only two sockets, one for the TV and one for the fridge. The only spare was located in the bathroom for the shaver or toothbrush. The view from our window was a building so close you could almost touch it. Breakfast was a cosy affair, but very limited in choice of food. A small range of a continental breakfast, with cereal. If the room was booked with no breakfast included you were charged 10 Euros per person per day. Not really worth it in our opinion, due to shops in town offering a wider selection for a cheaper price. We did not use any of the other amenities offered by the hotel. We just used it for a bed between lots of sightseeing. I would recommend this hotel to people only staying a couple of nights. Which are going to be out all day, so just using it for somewhere to rest their heads. It maybe an idea to ask to see the room before accepting it if you want something a little more spacious.

When we returned to Termini at the end of our vacation, we tried to get a cab at the station, but the cab drivers wouldn't take us, so we ended up walking again. I think it was too short of a haul for them. The staff at the Montecarlo arranged a minivan back to the airport for us on our last day.

Upon arriving late, 9pm, we were upgraded to a balcony room which was wonderful. Room was large enough and ensuite bathroom was nice, both were very clean. There was a lift that was plenty spacious but we were only on the 1st floor so always chose to take the stairs as was faster then waiting on the lift. Breakfast was included in the price and plentiful, consisted of breads, cheese, fruit, cold cereals, several juices to choose from and hot drinks to order. Hotel also had a bar for drinks, computer was supplied but it cost for the internet at 1 eruo for 10 minutes. Only complaint was that the 1st floor where our room was it had a heavy smell of smoke from cigaretts, as I belive there was a staff room on that floor. Even though the smell was strong in the hallway are non-smoking room never smelt. We did have a street side room with large window that opened to the balcony but when window was shut was very quite, didn't hear much noice at all.

Hotel is a little off the beatin path but only about 5-6 blocks from busy tourist section. We used the Ciao Roma tourist buses, the hotel sells tickets you can purchase them from them & then they call and arrange for you at a pickup. You pay a partial fee to the hotel and they give you a ticket then you present ticket to driver and pay the remained to him. The bus service took us to all the major tourist spots that you would want to go to, they are general pickup/dropoff spots so you do have to do alot of walking. Finding the bus stops took a little bit but you just have to look for the blue bus stop signs as there are several different type of tourist buses and you have to make sure you get on the right one or your ticket is no good.

What a great guy, totally service-minded. - The beautifully decorated room. Very cosy. - The proximity to Termini station. - The excellent restaurants in the neighbourhood.

A diabetic would have problems finding something to eat without too much sugar. - The beds that were pretty hard and uncomfortable. - The hydro-massage shower that sometimes inflicted more pain than pleasure... To summarize: a good hotel for the price and Mr Franco Spaccialbelli really made our day. I guess we were extremely lucky with timing as well since we spent 14-16 Dec in Rome and there were almost no tourists anywhere. We had been warned about the long queues and therefore paid extra to pre-book tickets to the Vatican but it turned out to be completely unnecessary since there was no queue at all! We could walk right through. The same applied for Colosseum. Maybe some people who heard about the recent flooding of the Tiber canceled in the last minute.

The walk from Termini station took us just over 5 mins, the pavement did not cause us any problems whatsoever and was easy to find following the directions from the hotel website. I had emailed the hotel prior to arriving with a couple of questions and they were very quick with their response, which was good... The room was ready when we checked in at 11am which was handy being there for only three full days!! The room was very clean and decorated in a beautiful way. I am fussy when it comes to the room and cleanliness and this got 10 out of 10 for it all. It was perfect for a place to sleep when visiting this beautiul city for a long weekend!! The bathroom was also very clean and they supplied you with toilettries along with fresh towels every day. The location of the hotel was great for the money that we paid for the hotel. It was a 5min walk from Termini where you can catch trains/buses/metro from to explore the whole city. We opted to buy a Hop on Hop off tourist bus ticket rather than using the normal buses as we had no idea where they went to and how to pay to use them!!! The sight seeing tour buses suited us fine and we got to see all of the sites that we set out to during the three day break. I highly reccomend that you visit the Vatican and Colusseum and that you pre book tickets beforehand to enable you to jump the queue. The queues were so long it would have put me off going to visit them, but well worth paying the little bit extra to guarantee a place there... There was a fantastic restaurant that we ate out in that was oposite the Pantheon. If you are stood with your back to the entrance, there are a number of cafe/restaurants in the square oposite. It was the second one on the left (I can't remember the name now!) and the food was out of this world! It cost 12 euros for a pizza or pasta disa, plus a wine/beer/juice and then a coffee to finish. It was the tastiest meal I had during my visit there. We also ate in Piazza Navona, and it cost us a small fortune for a very small portion! My boyfriend had to eat again 1/2 hr later!! You must throw a coin in Trevi Fountain for your return to the city and you also need to sample the Galeta ice creams that are found on many corners throughout the city, they are out of this world! Considering it was November when we visited, it was still very busy in restaurants and most of the attractions, so I would dread to think what it would be like in the height of Summer!! The weather was a bit hit and miss while we were there but it did not stop us from visiting everything we wanted to. All in all, the hotel was fantastic, very quaint but with modern features. The lift was beautiful and very quiet!! We did not hear anyone in the ajoining rooms nor did we get disturbed by anyone in the corridors. Infact it was the best sleep that the pair of us have had in a long while!! The TV had a couple of english channels on and there was a minibar in the room too. We kept a couple of bottles of drink in there that we bought from the loal supermarket and they did not seem to mind. As for the Temini area as a whole, I felt extremely safe at all times of the day and night, there is a chinese restaurant between the hotel and the station where we ate one night and the walk back at just after mid night was pleasant!

The service was really great here from the off. The staff at the desk was friendly, helpful and comfortable at speaking a number of languages. They also helped us book tickets for the Villa Borghese; they also provided a map of the city centre and a small guide book as well. The interior of the hotel reminded me of a Parisian apartment building. Our room was small but newly furnished (bar a little wear and tear but nothing major) with plenty of storage space for 2 people as well as a flat screen TV. There was little background noise unless you had the window open. The air conditioning was cold enough to keep the room cool anyway. Probably the only complaints about the room was the size of the bathroom which was a little tight if two of you were trying to get ready and the lack of free plug sockets. The power shower was excellent after a busy day walking and there were no problems with pressure or hot water. Breakfast was also included.

We thought to take the Leonardo Da Vinci express train to Termini station, and this was the biggest mistake. Everyone scared us that the taxis are expensive etc, and we took the train. There was no air conditioning, and the hotel was 800 meters away from the Termini station. We walked the distance... but we were literally exhausted by the time we got to the hotel. The staff was quite friendly,and led us to the elevator. We expected that the room was going to be a little bigger... instead, it was tiny. The tv was tiny too. The view from the window, was the roof of another building. But , we did not complaint. After all, we chose that hotel. Everything was closed at three, including restaurants and pizzerias. We were hungry, but we had nothing to eat, but chocolates. The breakfast at the hotel was poor, a coffee machine and a lot of breads with butter and marmalades to eat with. 3 juice types were also available, and cornflakes as well. We expected english breakfast... But we did not complaint about that neither. The only thing that made us complaint, was the noise next to our room, every morning. There were bulding works, and it was a terrible noise. My husband made a complaint to the hotel, but the only thing they had to say was:' I can't do anything, it is Sunday tomorrow, so they will stop. ' So, they did not help us with that. Monday morning, while we were sleeping, the door of our room opened and a housekeeper left a bottle of water on the floor and left again! I didn't notice what had happened, because I was sleeping, but my husband, who saw the whole thing, called the housekeeper, but she didn't give any attention. She got in, and left as if it was her own room. I was very angry.

Booked it direct on the website had a great offer and it was certainly value for the money. Rooms were more than adequate, recently refurbished and it showed. Sound proofed and quiet. Air conditioning a bonus and a must for this time of year. Spotlessly clean bathroom but one word of caution, rooms without a bath have very small shower cubicles. I am 6 ft and 17 stone any larger and you'll not get into the gap for the shower cubicle, or even worst not get out, I had to lever myself in and out. A small minus for an otherwise good hotel. Staff friendly and knowledgeable re transport etc. Location on opposite side of city to most of the Iconic Sites but only 2 minute walk to metro and buses. Then only ten minutes to sites etc. Rome public transport is very good and cheap. If staying for more than a couple of days buy a week's ticket for 16 Euros a great saving. Hotel is located adjacent to the British, Russian and other Embassies so it is the safest place to walk back to from the transport there are 24/7 armed police on the street corners. Breakfast is the normal European breakfast not a great choice but plenty of what was available. Cereals bread cheese yoghurts cakes etc. As for Rome itself I went for the Iconic and Historical sites which were a must and fanastic. Pre booked tours with Icon of Rome tours a little above the average but what great value. No queueing at Vatican and the Clossium. Very knowledgeable guides. At the Vatican tour there was six of us and only two couples for the Historic tour.I have travelled many Cities,Rome is certainly not amongst my favourites, very dirty everywhere seems to have a layer of soot whatever you touch leaves a black mark on your clothes. The metro is exceptionally dirty do not touch any wall or poster and there are thieves about they roam in groups they have the appearance of Romany Gypsys, they are small in stature and one woman will be carrying a baby to distract you . No violence but they are about so watch your bag like a hawk. Romans must be amongst the most rude, surly and ignorant of people. Food was also a disappointment.

I can't say enough good things about them. Our room was on the 4th floor, accessed by way of a very small but fun elevator. The room was small, but fine for the 2 of us. The room was always clean and felt very secure. The hotel provides FREE high speed internet access in the rooms. Bring a Cat-5 cable if you decide to use it. There is also a paid internet point near the lobby. We never tried the breakfast, but it looked like packaged bake goods. However, just around the corner, across from the adult theater is a fantastic little pizza joint that is fun, has good local food and is very cheap. Ok, the area, you saw the thing on the adult theater. Yes it is around the corner, but it isn't like some place crawling with pervs. You ignore it. Down this same street are a couple of laundramats within about 5 blocks of the hotel and some little shops. To the opposite, there are 2 embassies within a couple of blocks of the hotel, so there is 24 hour security at both ends of the street. While the side streets aren't the prettiest, they aren't that bad either. The hotel is actually about 600 meters from Termini and 300 meters from the Castro Pretorio metro line.

There is all the usual juices, coffee, tea etc plus some cereal (could have been pieces of cardboard - it was hard to tell) and pastries. It's fine to fill you up before a day of sightseeing but if you're there for more than a few days I'd look elsewhere for breakfast. The hotel is on the edge of the central, main part of Rome but is near to the metro line stations of Termini and Castro Pretoria so is well located to visit the Vatican, Collosseum, Trevi fountain etc. Anywhere else, however, is a bit of a walk. There are a couple of nice restaurants near by, one in particular is just round the corner and does excellent pizza for not very much money. the further into the centre of Rome you get the more expensive it is but the food isn't necessarily any better.
