A valuable lesson I learnt in Japan is if you are arriving at your destination on a Friday night book your accomodation at least a week before! After quite a few hours and yen spent in an internet cafe the day before we arrived in Tokyo, the only vacancies we could find in the areas we wanted to stay were the Park Hyatt and Hotel Monterey. Due to our credit card not being unlimted, we chose the latter. This hotel is in a geat location but there MUST be better value for money out there. We had to pay for our internet, the room was tiny and the bathroom had a rather mouldy aroma (though it was spotlessly clean). I also was not a fan of the European decor and strange white satues in the foyer. I did, however, LOVE the free Hearald Tribune delivered to our room everydays That was great. And they have BBC.The front desk were friendly and spoke great English and the hotel is around 100m to the subway but I would search around prior to booking here as there is way better value for money in Tokyo.", "Date": "Sep 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR269876692", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "funwithlia"}, {"Content": "Very nice accomodation in Tokyo I suggest this hotel, first of all, for its placement. It's close to the metro line and the borough is good. Very important is the direct connection to Tokyo Station (only four stops by metro). The room are confortable even if they are small.

Its practically a brand new hotel, so the overall facilities are excellent. Very conveneintly located. Just 2 minutes walk from the Akasaka Station (Exit A). Extremely helpful staff, think of the littlest things (loaner umbrellas when it was raining, if you call for something say an iron...its in your room in less than 2 minutes etc). The only problem was that the room was extremely small...and I mean that! Its advertised as 189 sf...which I am sure is correct. But when you actually look at it...you realize how small is that. As an example...I was sitting on the chair at the desk, there was not enough space for my wife to pass behind me without hopping on the bed. So if you are not claustrophobic or dont have to spend much time in the room...then you are OK. I would definitely go back. TIP: to get to this place from Narita airport, two ways:- Narita Express: Take it to Tokyo Station, take the subway from there to Akasaka Mitsuke Station (Line M), get out at Exit A, walk straight for 300-400 meters. You will pass a Starbucks, and a Doutor Coffee Shop. Its right after the Aston Martin Showroom. Slightly cheaper than the next option, and is faster but less convenient. - Airport Express: Take it to Hotel Excel. If you have a lot of luggage, get the name/address of the hotel written in Japanese at the Aiport Express Ticket counter, and cab it. Otherwise its only a 5 min walk from Excel. Walk out of Excel, cross the mainroad and turn left. Walk for just a block, and then make a left turn at 60degrees. You will pass a First City Conveneince Kitchen...a Starbucks...and its next to the Aston Martin Showroom on your left.", "Date": "Jul 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR327439697", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "sam737"}, {"Content": "Little Gem in Tokyo       The hotel entrance", "Date": "Jun 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR490835187", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Kobayashiii"}, {"Content": "Liked it!

The airport bus does not go here so take it to the Excel and grab a taxi from there. It is best if you know the location in Japanese as this is not a big hotel and the taxi drivers are not great at this even with the Garmin! Once there we took business cards from the desk when we traveled to and from Tokyo station. This was most helpful. We also had the staff do the Japanese address for the hotel in Kyoto as well. The staff were most helpful with good English skills. The hotel rooms are SMALL - average by Tokyo standard. Either don't bring a lot of luggage or prepare to leave some of your things packed. The hotel price on the internet was great so we booked the week and traveled from there with the smaller suitcases we brought for the shinkansen - there is little luggage space on Japanese trains. We did not use the restaurant as there are many places to eat near Akasaka-Mitsuke. Amenities were excellent with high speed internet included. We had no problem getting a non-smoking room.

I lived in Tokyo for 3 years so have some knowledge of the city. The Monterey Akasaka is a great value for what it offers. It is spanking new, incredibly clean and one of the most quiet hotels I have ever stayed at in my life. Not what I expected in downtown Tokyo. I am used being woken by hallway and street noise but this did not happen. Rooms are not overly large, but hey this is Japan and the rates cannot be beat. Rooms are very clean, stylish and filled with lots of great ameneties including all you would expect such as free internet access (not wireless) but cord supplied, nice but small desk, stocked mini-bar, complete bathroom supplies (soap, shampoo, toothbrush, etc). Location is excellent -- 4 minutes walk downhill to nearest subway Akasaka Mitsukemae on the convenient Marunouchi (red) subway line. Minutes to Tokyo station and all central locations including Roppongi for some evening fun! I liked the local coffee shop nearby for breakfast and there is a Starbucks by station and lots of 24hour convenience stores. Hotel staff was professional and helpful, but somewhat reserved. Typical for Japan. I would guess about 40% of guests are non-Japanese business travelers so they are set up for non-Japanese visitors pretty well. All-in-all I had feeling I was staying at much more expensive hotel than I paid for. Tip - I brought way too much luggage and clothing. Closet is very small! They have same day drop off cleaning service. Next time I will only take 2 suits and use reasonably priced laundry service. If you go here they will not tell you but you need to insert key in a magnetic holder near door for electricity to turn on -- smart conversation idea as all goes off when you leave. Just a bit hard to find in the dark when I arrived.

On reflection, a twin might have been a better bet.Although the hotel website offers complementary internet access we found it wasn't actually available. Although we discovered when we were checking out that we could have rented a laptop...

The hotel is clean and well equipped and its location is excellent. The metro station is not far away, with excellent connections.

The area is also very safe with a lot of excellent restaurants and ramen bars. I also got a complimentary english language newspaper every day. Overall, highly recommended.
