I think the hotel has been given a makeover since this review although the room was very small it was very clean. The swimming pool is on the top floor it looked ok although we didnt use it. On the down side the breakfast wasnt very good not really a lot of choice. the staff were very polite and friendly. Take the mtr to central then take a 15 bus to victoria peak its amazing, the views over hong kong are brilliant. round by the hotel there are lots of local shops, the bigger shopping malls are more central.

I picked this hotel for its location. But the room was terrible. Basic, everything is functional but you don't feel like staying in there. The room is extremely small even for Hong Kong standard. Very dirty, small old TV. Small bathroom, with plumbing problem. Even you only want to use it to show and sleep, fine. Do not expect too much. You will be disappointed.The only good thing is the location, near MTR and plenty to see and to eat. We had a room with beautiful view of the city. But still I would never stay there again.

We changed rooms twice before we had an acceptable room. Beds were very hard and small, as in all Hong Kong Hotels with very little hanging space. But the shower was good. Staff were not very helpful. But to be fair did deal with complaints efficiently. We did end up with a harbour view room which in a little way compensated for the very sparse furnishings in the room. The breakfast was awful - foolishly we had booked beakfast for everyone of our 12 days stay. There was very little choice of food and on many occasions would run out - when requested the food to be replenished - it took a very long time and was of such poor quality it was not worth the wait. Would recommend that you forget breakfast and go over the road to Starbucks., or one of the many coffee shops around. Lots of Chinese eating houses also if you want the real Hong Kong experience. Much more friendly, cheaper and more palateable. On the plus side Hotel is well placed to get around Hong Kong very close to MTR station at Fortress Hill and buses and trams to everywhere. Give the swimming pool a miss - not worth the lift ride to the top of the hotel - not very clean and looking very dated. The hotel is undergoing a refurbishment at the moment but the rooms although clean are still looking tired. Certainly restaurant and other publis rooms look very tatty. But if you are on a budget and only need a bed for a few nights then the location is good. Worth walking into North Point to see the shops and market areas. Much more like the real Hong Kong than Causeway Bay and Central. Take a tram to Happy Valley to see the races. Or go in the opposite direction and see what you can find. Great experiences out there. Hong Kong is very easy to get around and buses regularly will take you to Repulse Bay and Stanley Market and give you a tour of the island at the same time.", "Date": "May 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR214227017", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Momoi"}, {"Content": "Well what can one say? Well lets start with the one Positive; NEVER NEVER NEVER AGAIN will we stay at this Hotel. Tenko would have been pure Luxury compared with this DUMP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.On arrival from Bali we entered the Hotel to be greeted with the Assistant Manager Fooling about ,how unprofessional. The room well ,POKEY is not the word you could not swing a cat around. The Bathroom had mould around the taps on the bath and the tiles. The staff were most unhelpful to say the least. We went to find the Bar only to find it now situated in the Breakfast room, we were the only two people in there. Breakfast was a disaster we entered the Breakfast room no greeting ,tickets snatched out of our hands a Grunt and point in the direction of tables,no help on what to do. There was a selection of cold and hot food .Bacon was cold even though on a hot plate only boiled eggs no scrabbled or fried available. (Second morning half cooked scrambled eggs)Coffee was terrible as was the tea, staff never talked to guests only to each other and were watching television behind a screen where dirty plates were stacked. We decided to try them for dinner, a Special Buffet was advertised but the staff in the Resturant knew nothing about it so went and asked at Reception and was told to see staff in Restaurant told them they knew nothing about it, so decided to look elsewhere we found a wonderful place called The Wooden Table, what a different place staff friendly used by the local residents food good, Shame the Hotel staff could not have been like them. Suggested to the Groups CEO that his staff need training in being helpful and friendly. Asked Conceige directions to the Peak she gave information that was incorrect. MTR advisor was most helpful at least that saved us time by not getting lost. On morning of checking out Conceige was behind her desk eating and reading newspaper and did not see us there.

They must be joking I recently stayed for four nights at the Newton Hotel on a package tour to the annual Hong Kong rugby 7s tournament.Well, let me start with the positive. This hotel is well located, very close to the MTR (underground train) station Fortress Hill, which is just a few stops from Central and Admiralty stations. And that\u9225\u6a9a about it on the positive side.The hotel is apparently rated with four stars, most likely because of its roof-top pool. I would hesitate before giving this hotel even two stars, however.Firstly, the rooms were very small. There was very little space to put anything, other than yourself. Fortunately, there was a carpeted (!?) window-sill where we were able to put a bag or two. There was very little space to hang your clothes (enough for one person perhaps, but certainly not for two people). The furnishing of the room was very old and dirty, something out of the 1970s/80s. Maybe the hotel was built then and has not been renovated since. The hairdryer was ancient. It took us a few days to get the TV (also ancient) to work. The bath was old and dirty-looking. The shower only had hot water intermittently. The bathroom towels were old and like sandpaper (I would have thrown them out years ago). We did have a view, from a distance, of the harbour, but it was from a fairly low level and partially obscured by docks, cranes, etc.I cannot comment very much on the service as I didn\u9225\u6a9b have much contact with the hotel staff while I was there. The front desk staff were not unpleasant and the bar staff were friendly enough, although the advice they gave us (on how to get to a certain place) was totally incorrect.I didn\u9225\u6a9b eat at the hotel, but a few of my mates had breakfast there. They said it was mostly okay. My room mate ordered food from room service one evening and told me it was inedible.As another poster mentioned, this hotel seems popular with other Asian tourist groups, and there weren\u9225\u6a9b that many westerners.I went up to check out the roof-top open-air swimming pool on my last day in the evening, but it was closed for no clear reason when it should have been open. This was a bit like the hotel\u9225\u6a9a main entrance doors which were 'temporarily\u9225?closed for the duration of my stay. The swimming pool looked okay but the plastic garden furniture around parts of it looked cheap and the glass windows surrounding it (to stop you falling off the top of the building) were filthy. The carpet in the hotel corridors was also filthy and worn-out.This hotel is a dive. I\u9225\u6a93 sure there must be better elsewhere in Hong Kong for the money.", "Date": "Apr 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR988193340", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "MikeMoss"}, {"Content": "It's OK but room too small Lived in this hotel for 2 nights on 10-12Dec 2005.
