The advertised one night for 2 people deal was sold for around $130 and the printed voucher said it was worth $245. There were conditions - black out dates and a request for early booking and rooms subject to availability. I wrote asking for a booking (I did not mention the deal as the voucher just said hand over on arrival). I was offered two kinds of room - standard at $159 and superior at $179 with extra for parking and breakfast. I wrote back accepting the deal and provided the voucher number. The hotel advised that they did not have available rooms, that 'voucher rooms' had all gone and perhaps later in the year would be better. I have major problems with this attitude and failure to honour a promise: 1. available rooms are not available for pre-purchased voucher holders 2. the cost of the room was not much more than the voucher, but it said the deal was worth $245. 3. the attitude of the hotel staff was of complete lack of responsibility or sense of obligation.

If you want to be close to everything, yet still feel relaxed, this is your hotel. This would be a perfect hotel for an affordable, comfortable and relaxed family getaway to see the sights of Sydney, to anyone who wants to be near everything they need to do in Sydney Above all the customer service was impeccable. Any query, and the reception staff were fantastic. Which for us was highly valued as it made us feel very comfortable and valued. Especially as we were there for an intensive two day course at UTS. (which if you are going to is two blocks away, 5min walk, just cut through the 'Tafe' building, which we did with no hassle both days). I have noticed other reviews calling it outdated, personally, best value for money hotel I have ever stayed at. The room we stayed in (116) was just as nice, only smaller than a hotel I stayed last year that was more than double the price. Everything I want in a hotel, relaxing, safe, nice interior, easy access to everything, value for money and above all being valued as a customer, I found in this hotel. Our only problem was the restraunt. We had the \"$15 extra\" breakfast and were very disappointed. The fruit wasn't fresh, the hot food was unappetizing, there was little variety for a 'buffet' breakfast and they even served what we assumed to be last night's left overs as a part of their hot food. We later found out the restaurant is a seperately run business. Which made a lot of sense when our dealings with the reception staff greatly polarized our experience with the restaurant. The restaurant does have a pleasing atmosphere with a nice covered outside area and if you want the convenience of having breakfast before you go out for the day its fine. But only if you you want to get ripped off at $15 per person, per day, for off fruit and hot food the caliber of a bad overnight school excursion. They only food I liked was a bowl of nutrigrain cereal and a piece of toast with butter and jam. I highly agree with \"melwollongong\" positive review of their family's experience. And like her, I \"will definitely be staying here\" for all my future trips to Sydney. Just not having the breakfast in the restaurant, which has not tainted my great experience at the hotel, as it is a separately run business.

We got an upgrade to a deluxe room which was basically the same as a standard but had more space. The next time we stay we will get a chance in a draw for free accommadation. The rooms are clean and tidy but are showing their age. Wash basin is plastic and has a lot of cracks (unhygienic). The ensuite/bathroom needs an exhaust fan. Tv is outdated, channels very limited. Doors and wooden trims are in an outdated dark burgundy varnish finish. Makes the overall look too dull compared to more modern decors of hotels.

One of the staff on duty was VERY helpful, any question we had he was able to give us detailed help, another staff member was much more vague, and if we had been oversease or interstate visitors her 'instructions' would have got us hopelessly lost, but we knew the area somewhat.

If you are prepared to walk, you wont need money for cabs - spend that on an extra bottle of vino at dinner. The Hotel is, however, outside of the CBD and there is nothing to do within direct proximity of the Hotel itself. Which brings me to the negatives. The rooms are cave-like, the service worthy of a cave, the decor purely functional, the views from the cave uninspiring, the lifts to your room more akin to a coffin than a modern piece of machinery.

True it is now a little worn, with some of the varnish chipped on the woodwork, and similar signs of fraying around the edges. But everything was clean, and kept clean throughout my 8 day stay. It is situated in a quiet street one block back from Harris St, to find any hotel so central in Sydney on such a quiet street was surprising. Obviously not one of the wealthiest streets in Sydney it cannot be described as in any way \"dirty\" unless one is referring to the varied ethnicity of the residents. It is tree-lined, with some of the original terrace houses still in existence. An outdoor cafe in a pleasant treed square a few doors up was a good place for breakfast. It was very convenient. Only a short walk from Darling Harbour with its museums, attractions, restaurants and shops, and a slightly longer walk into Chinatown. As I was working at the Exhibition Centre, it was an easy walk to work in the morning. Convenient monorail and tram stops gave quick access to the centre of the city and Central Station respectively. One aspect is that there were not many amenities. The TV was analogue, and inhouse movies consisted of a DVD player and DVD's that had to be hired specially. A digital TV, with all the additional channels would have improved the stay enormously. There was also no room service, a little inconvenient. But again there were takeaways a short walk away, and plenty of other options a little further. There was a free morning paper, breakfast was available in the restaurant, and the bathroom had a good selection of bits and pieces.

In between we went on a cruise from Auckland NZ to Sydney Australia. This hotel was chosen since it was close to our son's apartment in Glebe. The price was even better when compared to other hotels. Great location, you can walk to Darling Harbour (10 mins), Circular Quay (30 mins.), Sydney Uni. (15 mins.) and Glebe Point Rd. shops (10 mins.). There is a great little coffee shop at Macarthur St and Bulwara Rd. called Cafe Dendu, great cappuccinos and breakfast. The area is residential, quiet and beautiful. Love the birds that make that aaahhhhing sound three to four times ending in the lamenting sounds of cats in heat. All the birds are totally different, from the cockatoos to the Ibis bird. We found the staff genuinely sincere and helpful to meet your needs. I reserved the hotel using their on-line reservations, easy. Check-in was early due to our flight getting in at 10 AM, arriving at the hotel at 11:30 AM. We were given an upgraded room, standard to deluxe. The room is large, with a sliding patio door to a balcony. Nice views of the city and surrounding areas. The bathroom is large and has dispensers of soap, shaving cream and lotion at the vanity, with the shower/tub having shampoo, body wash and conditioner. A real convenience. An in room safe and even 110 volt power in the bathroom. The hotel is in need of refurbishing badly. You can see this on entering the lobby, worn carpet and dated reception counter. The elevator is old but gets you up the 4 floors. The rooms we stayed in are date in their decor, have mold on the ceiling of the bathrooms, dust build up on the baseboards and carpet around the wall. The furniture, couches, are worn on the ends of the arms, carpet is worn and thin, the bureau is old and it still has the old stereo built into the night table. The A/C didn't work for the last two nights of the Jan. stay, even after complaining it was noted and no follow up to my complaint. No one knew anything was wrong, I was dismayed by this hiding of a problem, especially when the temperatures were 30 to 34 C each day. Well, prior to getting into Sydney, I called and was told the A/C problem was repaired. Good, until we arrive and are told, after asking, that it is working sporadically. Great, they put us in another room, funny why we would get placed back into a room that the A/C has problems with. End result, we get an extension of our check out time on the day of our departure. The Reservation Manager was apologetic and forthright in our criticism of the staff. This was the only shortfall, of the staff, that I experienced, no explanation why. All in all, if you look the other way at the shortfalls, pay about $125.00, you get a hotel that is inexpensive and close to the heart of Sydney, with the ambiance of residential living.", "Date": "March 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "british columbia", "Title": "\u201cMaintenance issues for sure\u201d", "Author": "ikelmay", "ReviewID": "UR24213456", "Content": "There were positives and negatives for us with our stay.

Not flash, but a good-sized room with all the things you expect plus a big balcony with sliding doors that opened. I was on the third floor and looked out onto roof-tops so I could leave the door/curtains wide and have a sense of the outside extending beyond my room. The neighbourhood was leafy and residential, as another tripadvisor reviewer had said - surprisingly so given that it was a block back from Harris St and a few minutes walk from Broadway. I felt that I'd made a good choice for my $115/night. On my first morning I was up at 6am thinking I'd walk briskly around Darling Harbour, but was seduced by Bulwara St and explored it and surrounding areas instead, admiring the tenacity of quiet, tree-lined residential spaces in such proximity to the city centre and the snarling mass of arterial roads. I longed to peek inside the victorian terraces and see how many were expensively done up inside and how many might be affordable - judging from the outside, not all were renovated, some (with bicycles chained on the tiny verandahs and none-too-flash exteriors) looked liked they might be student accommodation. I found myself imagining that I could live here, if I had to. I think there'd be a good community feel to it, if only because they all had to turn inwards to appreciate their little patches of peace. I was glad that I'd found out about the Ian Thorpe Aquatic Centre (near the Powerhouse Museum, on Harris St) before I came because otherwise I might not have thought of bringing my swimmers and goggles with me.
