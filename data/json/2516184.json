Towels are gross - thin, and stained, which really doesn't go with the rest of the updated nice decor in public areas of hotel. Here is our major issue - think twice before using the hotel service to ship your wine home! It has left a bad mark on an otherwise great trip. The hotel needs to switch shipping companies because the one they use, Buffalo's Shipping Post has awful customer service. Somewhere along the line after we left our 12 bottles of wine for shipping with the front desk staff, one bottle came up missing - the most expensive bottle. The shipping company still picked it up which puts replacing it in their court instead of Avia's. It sat there for 8 days with the shipping company and no one bothered to call us and get to the bottom of this. Only after spending much time back and forth on calls between Avia and Buffalo was it resolved and Buffalo is STILL charging us a crazy amount for all this hasle - they hardly discounted anything and instead of getting our shipment in 3-4 business days it's now 19 (hopefully)!

This review is for the AVIA Napa in Napa California, where I stayed following a concert at the Uptown Theater about a block away. Room Type/Class: Tower Suite Date: November 20-21, 2011 Overall Rating: 4.5/5 (rounded up to 5 for TripAdvisor) I had stayed here about a year earlier and did not have the best experience. There was a Christmas parade going on, on the main road in front of the hotel, and it took about an hour of driving around and being stuck in traffic to park, and then walk a long way to even get to the hotel. Given that, I thought the hotel should have alerted incoming guests as to what was going on, to plan accordingly. In any event, hotel management had said that they would make up for it if I should ever give them another chance. About a year later, I was making plans to see The Pixies at Uptown Theater, which is literally across the street from the AVIA, so I thought I would try them again. They were nice enough to provide an upgraded room at a reduced rate, so I stayed in their nicest room, the \"Tower Suite\". It was a very spacious room, with a living area as you walk in with couch, wet bar, and dual-sided fireplace that also faces out to the sleeping area (there is an LCD TV on both sides of the wall in-between as well). It has a very modern appearance, and there is a very large tub adjacent to the bed, as well as a full (very large) bathroom with double sinks and a standing shower. The customer service was top notch - they even sent up a note with champagne. It is the perfect property if you are going to an event at Uptown Theater, as it is literally a one minute walk out the lobby and across the street. I would definitely recommend it if you are staying in and around downtown Napa.

Downtown Napa is actually a destination! Avia Hotel was a big part of why we enjoyed our brief overnight getaway to hear music at the newly renovated Uptown Theatre. A great dinner at Celadon and fun show by Little Feat completed the experience. Booked Avia mostly for its closeness to the Uptown - 3 blocks away. The reviews that commented on decor, service, and style also helped. The final deciding factor was the price of $150 (aaa breakfast rate) which included our choice of full meals served up to 11 a.m. in the restaurant. Room: small, stylish, hardwood floors, nice double sheeted bed with comforter. Great attention to detail, e.g. charging station for electronics, shelf as you enter for keys, cool one cup coffee setup with pitcher for water, etc. Bathroom was deluxe with amazing large rainshower and stylish vanity, first class amenities, and nice towels. Free wifi worked great, windows opened, heating system on thermostat worked perfectly. While the sensor system for snacks was a bit scary , they did provide a shelf for our own items in the fridge. On the downside - the hotel offers \"guaranteed upgrade\" where, for a small fee, you can assure yourself the larger room, suite, fireplace, etc. To me this is just upselling packaged differently. Normally in off season on an off night a good hotel would automatically have given us an upgrade free of charge. But since I didn't opt for the option, we were given the room in our category which, while adequate for one night, was very small, had no bathtub, and looked at the parking garage. The best part of the stay was the breakfast. The restaurant is lovely with a large skylight and unique furnishings. The menu was really fun and included lots of fresh and local items. David had Dungeness Crab Benedict which was served on Model Bakery English Muffins ( the most amazing you could imagine!) with just the right amount of perfectly done Hollendaise. I had eggs and chicken sausage which they happily served with fresh fruit instead of toast. Both dishes came with the fabulous home fries - they looked like nothing special, but omg....crispy on the outside, warm and perfectly cooked inside, and deliciously seasoned. David also has fresh apple juice which, I have to say, tasted like nothing I gave ever has before. All of this totaled $40 which was credited back as part of our package deal.

A couple of complaints about the large open shower, the overhead rain shower is a nice plus but it cannot be operated at the same time as the regular directional shower head. Additionally, on a Saturday morning around 9 to 10 am, there was no hot water. There is a restaurant in the lobby, but we experienced poor service, and extremely overpriced food. Our party of 4 waited 45minutes for food, while the waitress kept apologizing but doing nothing to help. Overpriced because for 2, 2 egg breakfasts with 2 lattes was $50. While opting for convience we were actually delayed, gobbled our food in a rush, and made late to our appointment with Far Niente. Overall, great hotel, but avoid the restaurant. Many great restaurants around the area. Also, an issue with noise late night noise from terrace with firepit on the 2nd floor, which is great for casual gatherings. The 2nd floor rooms facing the terrace can hear and see everything, there needs to be a reasonable closing time for its use. At midnight, we heard a very inebriated group of people shouting on the terrace for about 45 minutes.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "seattle, wa", "Title": "\u201cModern hotel in Napa\u201d", "Author": "dubupak", "ReviewID": "UR125817207", "Content": "It was great to find a modern hotel in Napa, with a great location.

We even asked what kind of sheets they used and checked the mattress label. The bathroom was gorgeous as well....two sinks, huge standing shower with a rainfall shower head. Just awesome. Only complaint is that the rolling barn door to the bathroom wasn't quite seamless so it was a little uncomfortable using the bathroom since we were staying with friends. The door itself was cool though. It wouldn't have been a concern if we weren't sharing a room. And the iPod dock in our room had a bad speaker. That is all.

The staff seemed to really go out of their way - the front desk, the bartender (Hunter rocked!), bellmen, etc. They also had free wine tasting that Friday and Saturday night we stayed there which was neat. A few words of caution. We had breakfast that Saturday morning at the hotel restaurant. The food was really good and not overly priced but the service was VERY slow and it took FOREVER (I would say about 30 min from the time we ordered to when it was served). They did come an apologize and the charge was never applied to our room. The other caution I have is DO NOT get a room facing First Street. We had a room on the 2nd floor on the corner of First and more like an alley street (room 234). At 6:30 am Saturday the recycling truck woke us up and we could hear people coming in from a late night out. We also had electrical work outside our room window that woke us up on Monday about 6:45 am. I would try to get a room in the back of hotel and not close to the street.

It was my birthday so I decided to spoil myself with the Lux Tub Suite. I highly recommend this room. The hotel has a very modern feel and the rooms are decorated beautifully. I loved the wall color and hardwood floors. We also had a great view of downtown Napa. There\u2019s a spacious living area with a comfortable couch and chair, a flat screen TV, and a mini-bar stocked with snacks, drinks, wine glasses, and cork screw. The top shelf in the fridge is open for guest use, but don\u2019t pick up anything on the bottom shelves unless you want to pay for it. The bedroom area has a comfy bed, a second flat screen TV, desk, and bathtub. Yes, the bathtub is in the bedroom but trust me it makes perfect sense. Connecting both the living area and bedroom is a fireplace that makes the room nice and toasty (why bother with the heater?). When you\u2019re in the giant bathtub, you can watch the fireplace and spend the night relaxing. The bathroom has two sinks and an enormous shower with two shower heads. The bath products are great and the shower is wonderful. There is a restaurant downstairs that serves breakfast. While we had a great meal, it was a little pricey for breakfast items. My only complaints are similar to the AVIA in Savannah. The front desk employee we had was accommodating by letting us check in early but was also a little short. The concierge, while nice, I think was judging us a little bit. Yes, we are a younger couple and probably don\u2019t look like we come from money like other guests in Napa, but being in sales I know that doesn\u2019t really mean much. All the restaurants she suggested had entrees priced at less than $15 a person and I was hoping to have a really nice meal for my birthday. Also, all the wineries she suggested were giant and where all the tour busses drop off thousands of people a day. I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m wrong. Maybe that\u2019s what most of the guests are looking for and she suggests them to everyone. Also, if you make a reservation with a particular discount code and need to change your reservation, make sure the same discount code is applied to your new reservation. I had originally had a AAA rate with free breakfast but needed to change the date of our stay. It\u2019s easy to change your reservation online, but they had given me the AAA rate without the breakfast. When I went to check in, I asked about our free breakfast and was informed that I didn\u2019t qualify. After checking my reservations later (the original and the changed date), I saw that the discount code had been changed. Overall, this is a beautiful hotel right in downtown Napa and within walking distance to many restaurants and shops. Treat yourself right with a Lux Tub Suite. Free Wi-Fi and parking, valet extra.

Here are what I consider design and service flaws. 1. Desk in room has no outlet by it. 2. NO SOUNDPROOFING (the windows are like paper/hardwood floors echo) 3. Seating is AWFUL. Chairs in the room and very low to the ground and uncomfortable. Chairs in the lobby are narrow and generally not good to sit in. This includes the restaurant, the bar and every other space. The chairs may be stylish but are not functional. 4. The bar only serves wine and beer (often improperly chilled) 5. The granola breakfast is portioned so small you could be jealous of an airline breakfast. It consists of about 4 tablespoons of yogurt, 1 spoonful of granola and a 1/3 of a pear. 6. They only pour 1/2 cups of coffee at breakfast. 7. At the restaurant consistently you have hiccups, no cream for coffee, dinner menu not breakfast and staff ignoring you. 8. The bartender did not have a clue about wine defects as they served flawed wines. (We are in Napa, hello!) 9. The wine list is poorly conceived (Random foreign selections limited and usually very commercial local selections that lack any inspiration) 10. The bar did not have a second bottle of wine we ordered even though it was on the by the glass list also. (Silly and mindless) The few positives point at this hotel are location, the bedding quality and a nice bathroom.

The price was quite reasonable for the Napa area, and I LOVED the modern style of the hotel. This hotel had just recently been acquired by Hyatt, previously the name was just \"Avia Napa.\" Even though this hotel was now technically a Hyatt hotel, we didn't really feel like we were staying in a chain hotel. The hotel still retained a lot of its \"boutique\" feel which we liked. The hotel is located in downtown Napa. We have been to Napa a number of times, but surprisingly haven't been to this area of town. The hotel is on a quiet street area, across shops and restaurants. It was nice to be able to walk around and check out downtown Napa from our hotel. One thing to note, we thought that the parking was valet only ($15/night). We had a lot of luggage for our stay :p so decided to valet. On the second day did we realize that we could have actually self parked at the parking garage in the back for free. We booked the hotel via hotels.com and after reading many reviews on Trip Advisor, we splurged and booked the Master Tub Suite. The Master Tub Suite had a separate living room area, as well as a HUGE tub. :) The room was quite spacious, and there were actually 2 flat screen TVs (one in the living room and another one in the bedroom). The bedroom area was beautiful! There was a HUGE tub to the side of the room, which was very unique and so lovely! The tub was GIGANTIC! If we ever build our own house, I would want a tub like that! The bathroom area was also really spacious, with a separate shower area and dual his/her sinks. There wasn't a swimming pool in this hotel, which I thought was a little surprising. But we didn't mind since we only stayed for one night. Their evening turndown service was a nice touch, which included 2 free bottled waters and mini chocolates. The hotel also provided free drinks/appetizers in the lobby area from 5:30-7:00 PM nightly as well as free chair massages. How awesome is that?

We attended a radio hosted part on the outdoor landing and met some great people. The staff was extremely friendly, there was always someone new to chat with.

For the price paid, this is definitely not somewhere I would recommend. I'll start with the pros: The hotel has free parking in the garage behind the street and is within walking distance to restaurants. In addition, the staff was really nice. They did do everything they could to make the stay pleasant. Here are the cons: We reserved a Lux Suite Balcony room (Room 317). I was really looking forward to having a room with a balcony. Unfortunately, our balcony suite overlooked the concrete wall of a parking garage. It was definitely not worth the extra money that I paid. I have no idea why this hotel would sell balcony rooms with no view. The room itself was a good size, but getting a little worn (couch had pulls in it). No bathrobes in the room, we had to call down to get some stocked. I'm not sure how those could be missed as part of a room cleaning and preparation, but they were. In fact, for 2 nights we didn't have them. But the worst part of the room was the horrible sewerage smell in the bathroom. It got worse at certain times of the day, but it was really awful. I mentioned this to the front desk on my second day, but nothing changed, nor did anyone provide me with any feedback that they had looked into it. The restaurant had a great breakfast, but the service was really slow. This was a management issue, I cannot blame the servers for this. They were understaffed, and could not get keep up with the demand. It took 10 minutes just to seat us for breakfast. There were lots of open tables, just no one to set them. It then took 10 minutes to just get coffee. Just a really bad experience overall. When I checked out I was asked how my stay was. When I explained the above, the gentleman at the front desk wrote everything down and was extremely nice, and asked if it was okay if his Manager emailed me. I told him that I would be more than happy to discuss this with the Manager. No email was sent. As I said before, I see this hotel as having a Management issue. This just confirms that.

Based on the pictures on the Hyatt and former Avia web sites, along with numerous Yelp and Trip Advisor reviews, we thought we were making a great choice of accommodation in Napa. My husband is a Hyatt Diamond Passport so our expectations are always high. I had called the hotel manager about a week before the conversion to Hyatt (September 1st was their \"live\" date) asking if we could book using our Diamond suite upgrade awards for two nights and pay for the rest. She was very accommodating in obtaining a suite for us during high season. Check in was smooth although the front desk is not quite Hyatt-savvy. The front desk agent was very kind, but really neglected to give us the dog and pony show to which we have become accustomed, especially when it is our first stay at a particular property. Although the manager was helpful with making the reservation, I really believed that as Diamond Passport, they would have pulled out all the stops for us. Not! Not even a welcome letter in our suite! The front desk agent said we have already blocked you a great room! Ha! We were given the lowest level of suite (a lux suite) with a view of the parking lot behind the property! It was also right next to the elevators! It would have been an insult to any Hyatt Diamond. It is important to note that this property is not a view property and a \"premium\" view would be overlooking First Street in downtown Napa, and maybe, it might have a balcony . . . Ours didn't. Fortunately for us, we didn't need a view or a balcony, but for those who want to have accommodations that overlook the vineyards, gardens or even a pool or water feature, this is not the place for you! On the positive side, the property has a lovely patio area with fire pits where you can order your wine or BYOB and enjoy the crisp air in the evenings and relax after a long day of wine tasting. The hotel also offers some wine tasting events in the evening, a plus if you want even more wine. Service was good, but not great. The concierge was definitely on her game when she was able to get us a much-coveted appointment at Pride Vineyards! I would definitely rely on their concierges for any and all information you might need. There was otherwise very little in personal attention for this boutique hotel. Our suite was sweet, but nothing about which I could rave as others have previously done in their reviews. The bathroom does have a quasi walk-in shower with a rain shower head, but unless you tilt it towards the wall, all the water overflows onto the bathroom floor. You don't even realize it until you step out into a huge puddle! In our bathroom, the toilet faced the windows, so if the drapes were open and you forgot to close the sliding bathroom door, the entire parking lot can see you squat! In addition, the web site shows a lux suite with double sinks, but in ours, there was only one! Breakfast service is very slow. We waited ten minutes for our server to offer us coffee. The weekend buffet is, however, lovely with lots of options including yummy hot items and an egg and omelet station. The applewood smoked bacon and chicken apple sausage are delish! The location is perfect for exploring downtown Napa which has had a massive revitalization since our last visit over six years ago. You can walk to great markets, eclectic shops, wine tasting stores and fabulous four-star restaurants. I think that is the Hyatt Avia's strongest selling point since it definitely does NOT have any of the following amenities that one associates with the typical wine country experience. Nothing near the quaintness and personality of a bed and breakfast or small inn. No luxurious grounds to meander. No spa, although they do have privileges with the fitness center next door. No pool. No hot tub. For $400 per night (that is what we paid for a SUNDAY night stay), I think you can get a lot more bang for your buck in Napa Valley. We were so enamored by the fact that Hyatt finally had a property in the Napa Valley (they have a Hyatt in Santa Rosa which is too far from the main attractions) that I forgot to do my homework! When we returned home, I looked up some of the rates and amenities of comparable properties, like the Westin Napa, and found the rates very similar for the last weekend in October, and the Westin has its own fitness facility, outdoor pool and spa. Are we too spoiled? I think not, given that we stay pretty much exclusively at Hyatt unless there isn't a convenient location. We have expect a certain level of bend over backward-ness as Hyatt Diamond guests. In conclusion, I would by no means discount the Hyatt Avia as a contender when deciding on a property in the Napa area of the Wine Country, but I would seriously consider what amenities are offered before I plunked down my credit card guarantee!", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cA great place to stay.\u201d", "Author": "Leomj", "ReviewID": "UR118897308", "Content": "My husband and I spent 5 nights here in September and really enjoyed ourselves.

The hotel made several errors, starting out with making both our room keys nonfunctional on the second day of our reserved stay, apparently forgetting we were staying another night. Yet the maid had made up the room as if we were staying another night, so I don't actually understand the disconnect. Apparently there was a major miscommunication between departments. We went to Reception to have our room keys reactivated and asked for an explanation as to why they didn\u2019t function. Reception staff gave us two different reasons why it may have happened, from the possibility the batteries in the door lock may have stopped functioning (clearly not the case, but in any case maintenance should be replacing the batteries on a schedule to ensure that couldn\u2019t happen) to the possibility the keys came too close to another credit card. (That has actually always been a myth, credit cards do not have the necessary electromagnetic charge to deactivate other magnetic striped cards.) We asked to speak to a manager, and Paul [--], the Front Desk Manager, gave us the most probable and truthful explanation: the staff member who checked us in the night before had most likely erroneously entered us into the computer system as staying for only one night. That explanation was satisfactory, as simple mistakes sometimes happen. We thanked him, and Reception then issued newly activated key cards to us. But when attempting to unlock our room door with the replacement key cards, we soon discovered they again didn\u2019t work. Reception would tell us later the reissued cards unlocked not our room, but a room a floor above ours. (Imagine the surprise of the occupants if we had actually used them for that room.) Then, while attempting to use the newly issued but erroneous room keys, one of the housekeeping staff let us into our room without ever asking for a name, or identification, or anything, but just because our keys were apparently not working on that room door. (Imagine our surprise if she had done that for someone that wasn't staying in that room.) Both of these incidents are obvious breaches of guest security. We again returned to Reception to have them correct their second error concerning our room key cards. Insisting to speak to a manager, Engineering Manager Sam [--] was presented to us as the Manager On Duty. A Saturday during the peak season in the Napa Valley, and the Engineering Manager, someone who is expert at repairing the air conditioning or an electrical problem is sent to handle our front desk room complaint. The General Manager and Assistant Manager were not in the building, not on duty, we were told. The Front Desk Manager, Paul [--], was suddenly sent on a \u201cwork break\u201d and left the building. On a Saturday, in Napa Valley during the peak wine release season. Unbelievable. It immediately became obvious Sam [--]\u2019 plan for handling the complaint was to attempt to bully us into submission. He was combative, argumentative, hostile and demeaning. Arms folded, he looked past us, no eye contact, scowling; his body language couldn\u2019t have been more insulting. He clearly cared nothing about our complaint, except as a nuisance, and he wanted us to just go away. He clearly despised our presence in the lobby of \u201chis\u201d hotel. Sam [--], Manager On Duty, refused to bring front desk manager Paul [--] back from his sudden \u201cwork break\u201d, which had begun inexplicably in the middle of the complaint process. We wanted Paul [--] to confirm Sam [--] stated contention we had told Reception we were occupying room 301 rather than 201. We in fact had not, having only shown the reservation confirmation email to identify ourselves initially. The room number was never mentioned, and was presumably ascertained from our room key cards and/or the reservation confirmation email information. We told Sam [--] we were not leaving until Paul [--] came back from his break and we could ask him directly, to his face, if we had ever mentioned any specific room number. We witnessed Paul [--] return from his \u201cbreak\u201d, but he went directly past us without stopping, into the back office, at Sam [--]\u2019 direction. Our call to him to stop to answer a question went unheeded. Sam [--] then followed Paul [--] into the back office. After a few moments, both Paul [--] and Sam [--] returned to the front desk, and Mr. [--] asserted we told him we were staying in room 301 rather than 201. We asserted this was not true, and he asserted that would be his final testimony on the matter. That was blatantly false testimony, a lie, presumably after being instructed by Sam [--] to do so. However, even if that were the case, reception should have verified our room number prior to issuing keys to that room. What if we had been some kind of criminal element looking to do harm to the occupants of any room in that hotel? Is it sufficient we simply could go to Reception, give a false room number, and get keys to that room issued? Obviously, that is an unacceptable security risk to all occupants of the hotel. We stated we would not leave Reception until we received our final bill indicating the charges for our stay up to that point had been reversed. We were not about to pay any establishment for such insulting treatment, blaming us for their own obvious mistakes, blatantly lying to us about the matter and accusing us, their paying guests, of lying ourselves. We were informed the reception data servers in Omaha had lost contact with the Avia hotel, and no bill could be produced until service was restored. We insisted we would wait until that was accomplished. Sam [--] then threatened us, asking \u201cDo you want me to call the police and have you \u2018escorted\u2019 from the hotel property? Because I\u2019ll do it.\u201d There was absolutely no provocation on our part for such a threat. Our voices were never raised during any of the conversation, there was no indication of any threatening move or statement on our part. For the record, I\u2019m a 54 year old man who is 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 125 pounds; it is not possible for me to be threatening to anyone. As proof, one only need check the Reception security camera footage for the period of time between approximately 2:30 and 3:00 PM on September 17. You\u2019ll find no provocative actions on our part on the video. There was and continues to be no excuse for such insulting, bullying and unprofessional behavior by any Hyatt employee, especially a manager, the declared most senior manager present on the property. Eventually the server connection to Omaha was restored, and we received our bill indicating we owed the hotel nothing. While no other outcome would be acceptable to us, the behavior of the staff, specifically that of Sam [--], Engineering Manager, remains absolutely unacceptable. Such behavior should not be tolerated within the Hyatt corporation, and is not the professionalism and courtesy we\u2019ve come to expect from Hyatt staff. We understand Hyatt acquired Avia very recently, on September 1 of this year. Perhaps some auditing of the current Avia staff is needed to ascertain if they meet Hyatt standards. It is my contention Sam [--], specifically, does not.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cModern hotel, great downtown Napa location\u201d", "Author": "kellyonthego905", "ReviewID": "UR118492864", "Content": "This was our first stay at Avia Napa. It's in a great location in downtown Napa within walking distance of good restaurants, shops and lots and lots of wine tasting rooms. The drive into Napa Valley for winery visits is an easy one from this location. I'd say that the customer service was good, with a little room for improvement. The front desk, restaurant and bar staff were all very good, but the valet and bell staff was not so great. They brought the wrong car around twice and were very slow regardless of how busy they were (or weren't!), and some of them were not very pleasant. I'd recommend using the free self-parking instead of valet. We just used valet for convenience but it didn't really pay off. Our room was 321, which was close to the elevator and I had concerns, but we didn't hear any noise from that. The room was a master tub suite, with modern decor, and a separate sitting room from the bedroom. It was clean and nicely appointed. Both the bedroom and sitting room had televisions. Loved the giant bath tub, which is actually in the suite, next to the bathroom, not in it. The large, open-style shower has an overhead raindrop and a regular wall spray.The only reason I'd steer clear of this particular room is that it was right over the outside patio area and people hung out there and were kind of loud. They also have live music but it was over early enough not to interfere with trying to sleep. We had breakfast in the restaurant twice. The regular menu was fine and reasonably priced. The weekend buffet, however, was not great and they didn't replenish the fruit. The buffet is the only choice on the weekend. We stopped at the bar for some wine (go figure) flights and the bartender was very personable and knowledgeable about what he was serving. There's no gym in the hotel, but they provide you with complementary access to the ExerTec which is right next door, so it's like having a gym in the hotel anyway.

We stayed 3 nights. My boyfriend (now fianc\u00e9) told the hotel he was going to propose that weekend so they set up reservations in advance for us to top notch restaurants (Redd, Mustard) and wine tastings. Even though the hotel was at full capacity they put us in one of the best rooms/best views in hotel ahead of time. They also sent a bottle of Chandon champagne to our room to toast to our engagement. The concierge ladies (Jenny and Pamela) were wonderful! They went above and beyond to make our stay special. Even the hotel staff were extremely helpful and had excellent service. We stayed in the king master tub balcony suite overlooking First Street. The room was top notch from the comfy bed to the dual sided flat panel tvs and fireplace to the giant terrace balcony. Very clean, very spacious. You also get free gym passes which is next to the hotel and has plenty of treadmills, weights, and cardio-even classes along with a sauna, steam room, etc. The breakfast buffet wasn't cheap ($17/person plus tip) but was well worth it. The food quality was excellent and the spread of food was great. There are fireplaces throughout the hotel which was great on a cool night. The only negative I can think of is no hot tub or pool. The fire pits and cabannas were cool but there were so many people out there it was hard to enjoy a quiet moment. Glad we got the room with a balcony. The price was $399/night during the weekend and $309 Monday. That isn't bad at all for a 4 diamond AAA hotel on a holiday weekend in Napa. The location was perfect and there were a ton of great restaurants, nightlife, and shops on our street and a 10 minute walk from Oxbow Market. The wineries are very close driving distance. I wouldn't stay anywhere else as that part of Napa has so much to do and is new and nice. Also I can't imagine any hotel or inn being as spacious and new as Avia so I wouldn't risk staying elsewhere.

The lobby is very nice, the rooms are great, aesthetically, it is a very pleasing hotel. The location is also an added bonus as you can walk to top quality restaurants near by. The hotel comes with several flaws though: 1) The dining options are sub-par. The menu is very limited and the room service menu is even more limited. I went to dinner at the restaurant and there were two entrees! What kind of restaurant has only two entrees?? Also, it was completely vacant at 8pm, there was one couple in the entire restaurant which was a big turn off. Fortunately, there are great dining options nearby since Avia's don't quite cut it. 2) No pool. There is an indoor pool at the free gym next door but no pool to dip your toe into after a long day of wine tasting. Kind of a bummer. 3) The staff while very nice is in desperate need of training. I was told contradictory things on multiple occasions. Someone said there would be live music, but when I got to the patio, I found out it wasn't happening. I'd ask for nearby breakfast places and got contradictory responses. Worst, I asked for my car to be ready and they just forgot about my request and I had to wait 15 minutes which was a huge pain considering that we had a flight to catch. 4) They are doing construction and room upgrades during the weekend. I don't want to see people moving furniture in the hotel and using a passenger elevator as a freight elevator - super tacky! Do this during off peak times. So while I think Avia has great potential, it really needs improvement on the service and dining side for me to consider staying there again. I'd give it 3.5 starts.

It is on first street within walking distance of several restaurants and some limited shopping. The hotel is nice from the outside, the lobby is very modern, trendy and very nice. The rooms are nice, too. We had a king tub suite. The tub is basically in the bedroom. I thought it was strange but if you are into sitting in a tub in the bedroom you will like this. The room was divided by a wall and fireplace with a sitting area on the other sde. Nice touch, but not big. The shower was very large and the bathroom space was good. I would call these room accommodations a 3.5 to 4 star quality. Above average but not great. The staff at the hotel were very friendly, however they seemed to lack training. One morning I sat at the coffee bar in the lobby where someone was supposed to be making latte's etc. There was a machine and all the evidence of a coffee bar but no one to service it. We ate breakfast at the hotel once and it was just a bit unorganized, from being seated to being waited on and getting coffee refills it just wasn't a smooth process. Hyatt has purchased this small chain of hotels and my feeling is that they will train the staff which will take this hotel up to a 4 and even 5 star facility. Like I said, it has potential. The terrace bar is beautiful, but it only serves wine and beer as does the bar in the lobby. So if you want a mixed drink you have to find someplace else.

The hotel is well-situated and relatively new, and our Master Tub Suite was spacious and comfortable (spoiled just a little by a sorry view of the rear of the neighbouring Safeway supermarket.). The valet parking staff and porters were personable and helpful, offering useful tips for eating and drinking nearby (big thanks to the young man who recommended Morimoto for our evening meal - it was wonderful.). But from there it all seemed to go inexplicably downhill. We'd both arranged to get massages (after three weeks driving around in a cramped convertible we were more than ready for these) and had enlisted the help of the 'concierge service' here. Inexplicably, the duty concierge subsequently took it upon herself to cancel one of our massages, meaning that another had to be arranged at very short notice, for a later time. This knocked our whole evening out of sync, and rendered the 'relaxation' element of the enterprise somewhat redundant. We had also asked for some help in arranging a tour of the Frog's Leap Winery, which we were very keen to visit, but were told by the same concierge that this would not be possible. She did not offer any alternatives, though we had asked for some (by email, prior to our arrival) if Frog's Leap turned out to be full, so more time was wasted as we sorted out some visits under our own steam, the last of which turned out to be...Frog's Leap, who kindly fitted us in on the last tasting of the day - which begged the question of how hard the concierge had actually tried in the first place. Most of the staff were, to be fair, perfectly pleasant and helpful, though at breakfast there seemed to be a discrepancy between the vast numbers of waiters buzzing around and the actual service being delivered - we had to ask for coffee three times! The receptionist allocating tables at breakfast also struck a discordant note, with a somewhat disdainful manner that jarred. Eye contact costs nothing, Miss! One further detail that disappointed was that free internet wireless connection is only available in-room for a limited time - after that you have to pay, or use a public computer on the first floor. This is particularly mean-spirited in a hotel so visibly aiming to provide a 'high end' experience. We did feed back our comments directly to the hotel, and received an emailed assurance that our disappointments were taken most seriously and would be investigated, but that was the last we heard, back in May. Hopefully, staff training has been tightened up a little and the concierge service given something of an overhaul...but I guess we'll never know.

I'm not sure whether or not we got an unusually good rate for our mid-week stay but I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by how posh this hotel was for what I would consider to be a very reasonable rate compared to everything else we looked at in Napa/Yountsville. The room: We opted to upgrade to the Master Tub Suite for $20 more/night and it was totally worth it! The suite had a two-sided fireplace that separated two distinct spaces for living/sleeping. Both sides of the fireplace also featured a large flatscreen TV above it. I also took advantage of the HUGE soaking tub which sits just outside the bathroom (where the equally huge shower, vanity and toilet reside) so you can actually sit in the soaking tub and either watch TV or enjoy the fireplace. There is a curtain you can close around the tub but if you were looking for privacy from the rest of the suite, the semi-transparent curtain won't deliver. Hotel overall: The hotel overall was also very hip/modern. We didn't eat at any of the onsite restaurants so I can't comment on those but we were a little disappointed to find out upon check-in that the advertised \"free wine tastings every evening\" didn't apply Sunday-Wednesday. The other thing that we noticed was (as another reviewer noted) it seemed that the hotel was lacking in staff in some areas. For example, we attempted to visit the 2nd floor veranda/fire pit bar but there was nobody tending to the bar and yet there were dirty dishes/wine glasses everywhere. We actually went back out the next morning and the dishes were still unattended to which was unfortunate because it certainly didn't make you want to sit down and enjoy it. The other two things to be aware of with this hotel are that 1.) there isn't a pool and 2.) there isn't an on-site fitness facility (you can, however visit the gym nearby for free.) Again, not the end of the world for us but I was a bit surprised that a hotel that has so much else to offer would not offer such basic amenities. Location: The location of the hotel was great-- very central to Napa and within walking distance to many restaurants, shops, the wine train, etc. Be aware that Napa itself is transitioning a bit so although it seems very safe it's not (yet) as much of an up-scale yuppie of a town as Yountsville, for example. Having said that, there are lots of very upscale shops/restaurants especially along the riverfront if that's what you're looking for. But if you're like us you might appreciate that because it's not quite as up-scale of a town there are lots more reasonably priced restaurants to choose from within walking distance. Our favorite place that we visited was the Oxbow Public Market. You simply MUST check this place out if you visit Napa... a great place to grab breakfast/lunch. Also check out ZuZu for dinner (tapas)... delish! Overall Experience: Overall we really enjoyed our stay at Avia so although I debated between giving it 4 or 5 stars ultimately I came back to value for the money and (assuming it stays reasonably priced) I wouldn't hesitate to give it 5 stars.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cFantastic and helpful team, central location and modern\u201d", "Author": "montegrappa", "ReviewID": "UR114809724", "Content": "We found the Avia through recommendations in Trip Adviser.

It is right in the city of Napa, which if you have not been to the valley before is not really the center of things. If you picutre a town in the Napa valley, you're picturing St. Helena or Yontville, not Napa. Napa is a nice enough town, though much of it holds little interest to tourists and is really the industrial working part of the wine business. All that said, if you want a good base from which to explore, or you have business in Napa, and you want a cool hotel with good food and huge nice rooms, this is it. I've stayed here a few times now and will keep coming back whenever I have business in Napa. There are however, a few shortcomings. First, the hotel staff is very, very nice and they are really trying to be helpful. However, I think their training must fall somewhat short as basic things often go by the boards. Things like no change at the front desk, which is irritating, especially if you're trying to tip someone. I noted the valets, again super nice guys trying hard, didn't know directions to other hotels/meeting facilities that turned out to be 5 minutes drive away. It's tough to blame them as the concierge didn't know either and by the time both trying looking it up, I had it on my phone and was on my way. Lastly, no one should have to have a phone ring 50+ times to order room service. This has happened to me on every stay at this place and they really need to get on their phone system. All that said, I'd still go back. I love beautiful design and this place has it. The rooms and beds are very comfortable and there's plenty of space to spread out.

It was a delight to find that the hotel would ship our wine for us using a trusted shipping service for a very reasonable price. We didn't have to do anything but drop off the wine and fill out a form! The only cons we agreed on was that the parking was a pain because it was on the 3rd floor of a parking garage behind the hotel with no direct access and it was raining a lot. Also, we would have preferred more lighting in the hotel and more privacy in the bathroom. But those are little things that were due to our preference.

The Master Tub Suite is very roomy with a separate sitting and sleeping area with a nice double sided gas fireplace.

It is not a relaxing quaint stay among the vineyards. It is also not quite a luxury hotel. There is no onsite fitness center or spa. Both are provided by partnership businesses nearby. Self parking is in a detached parking garage which isn't all that far away - of course you can valet. And our room overlooked said parking garage.

We had no issues whatsoever with housekeeping, our room was clean and every day we had enough towels, soap etc etc. We had room service (hamburgers and fries) the first night there and we were pleasantly surprised at how good it was. The next morning we had the buffet breakfast, which was also very good. Our waiter was extremely attentive, as was the lady custom making our omelettes. Other hotels would charge much more than the $17.00 (or so) that the AVIA charged for the buffet. Check in and check out was a smooth process. The only glitch (charged for something on the mini bar that we didn't use), was fixed quickly with no issue at all. The valet service was also very efficient.

Avia wants to be a high end hotel but lacks the service to achieve that. I think the issues reflect the way the hotel is managed. It would be so easy to make this a nice experience but they missed the mark. What we expereinced: * Valet parking - No notification that this costs $15/day. No sign, no printing on the ticket, no discussion by the personanel. I discovered this when checking out. The valet parking and self park are in the same parking garage behind the hotel. It's easy to self park and I would have done so had I known. At checkout, I protested the fee since it was not disclosed but the attendant would not change the charge. Bad management. * Gym - We asked for the location of the gym and were told it's \"next door\". So, we walked down the street looking for it. It was next door but the entrance was behind the building. Once we arrived, the gym told us we needed a form filled out at the hotel. So, we had to return to the hotel for the form. Again, no one told us we needed a form. This unnecessary delay, walking back-forth and confusion could have been avoided had the personnel mentioned the process and entrance location when we inquired. Bad management. * Doormen - There was a group of doormen that serve to open the door and answer questions. It would be great if they had any knowledge to share - they don't. I saw people ask about restaurants, gym, etc and they seemed ill prepared to answer and their answers were incomplete (gmy, parking as examples). Why don't they have a prepared list to provide of local restaurants? Bad management. * Maid service - We left our room in the late morning. While in the room, we had a \"do-not-disurb\" sign. When we left, we flipped it to \"service-room\". We returned at the end of day and no service was performed. Since they do a turn down service, that means it was missed twice. * Room - The room has nice ammenities but is very, very small. The bed was extremely comfortable. * Restaurant - We ate at their restaurant the first night because it had good reviews. The food was fine but the seating was uncomfortable (weird shaped chairs) and staff amaturish. The restaurant is open and a loud group of people were sitting at the lounge area behind us, which was disturbing. It was an ok meal but for these prices, you'd expect better. We would not eat there again. *Location - It's in the heart of the city of Napa. The entire downtown area has been redeveloped and is fairly new. With the downturn in the economy over the last few years, many of the establishments in downtown Napa have left. We saw a lot of empty store fronts while walking to the Opera House.

I recommend booking the upgraded Master Tub Suite.

The Master Tub Suite included a comfortable king size bed, 42\" flat screen television, iPod docking station, coffee maker and organic gourmet coffee, fluffy bath robes, a waterfall shower and an oversized tub located in the bedroom to soak in.

I travelled to Napa as part of a birthday/anniversary surprise for my wife. I do extensive research for my accomodations especially when it concerns a special event. I landed on the Avia with an impression of a decent rate for a slightly upscale hotel. I chose the deluxe suite with fireplace/large tub. We arrived in Napa early hoping to check in early for which I was told that they had a full hotel the night before and that the room would not be ready. This was understandable and not a big deal, we ventured out to explore interesting places near Napa including the petrified forest, old faithful geyser (this time of season height was about 30' and very short in duration...), wineries, etc. Upon return I checked in to the hotel and inquired about the room that we were in explaining to the person at the front desk that this was a special occasion and that I would prefer a room that may be less prone to noise. He said that he understood and congratulated me on the celebration of our birthday/anniversary. He moved me to the floor that opened up to a public veranda (I believe the 2nd floor). Thank you very little. The window had a splendid view of the public veranda (a wood deck and wall was our view...)which would be occupied with people until it closed. When I discovered this I went back to the front desk to see if there had been a mistake. I spoke with another representative and explained what had happened. He said that this was very odd that we would be put there and that this was a horrible room for privacy. He moved me to a more desirable room (on the 3rd floor) overlooking main street with a good view of a parade that happened to be going that night. Some of the furniture in the room was chipped and generally not in great shape. Normally I understand that this is a function of being in a \"public\" space (in that guests use these rooms every night and not all are respectful). However this is not very common for a \"high end\" hotel. The bathroom was not cleaned thoroughly-(there was what looked like a toothpaste spit stain on one of the glasses in the bathroom which was still upside down and had not been used), and there was a stain of unknown origin on the floor in the part of the bathroom where the toilet was. I travel extensively and I have stayed in all levels of hotels. I don't review them because I have an expectation of what I am getting into and I am usually pretty forgiving. I am reviewing this hotel in part due to the staff members attempted sabotage of our accomodations as well as the general cleanliness of a property that touts itself as being a \"high end\" accomodation. I would love to review the bathrobes that I heard so much about but our room did not have them... The walk in shower was nice, bathtub was nice and the fireplace was nice. The bed was also comfortable. The rate was not too high (this is VERY relative) and was inline with the area. However I believe that better accomodations could have been found for the same price without the hassel. Also, be careful with the minibar if staying at the Avia. I drank two beverages and was charged for three (due to one being moved and disrupting the sensor in the minibar). I should note that this charge was reversed hassel free after waiting in line at the front desk for 5 minutes, but I don't think that it should have been incurred in the first place. If you are studious, you can find excellent accomodations in the area including vacation rentals (if staying 2 nights or more) that will be a much better value than what is being offerred at Avia.

In an area where they know how to do luxury well, but they also know how to charge for it then AVIA represents tremendous value for money. Firstly the booking process is novel, with the option to request upgraded rooms at reduced rates (and subject to availability at check-in time). So you don't know for sure whether you'll snag an upgrade, but if you do it won't cost as much as the standard rate for the room. This is a really good idea, and we got a tub suite at check-in instead of the standard room we had booked for a modest increase in price. The room was great; large, modern and sleek, but yet also cozy. The bed was really comfortable and as well as the tub, we also had a small sitting area with a second flat screen TV, and a fireplace. They offer a wine tasting most evenings in the lobby bar (incidentally the bar doubles as a coffee shop in the mornings), and we were lucky as the night we checked in it was a local brewery showcasing their beers. Just what the doctor ordered after tasting wine for a few days. We ate breakfast in their restaurant and were pleasantly surprised by the prices - we'd just come from a resort which charged $10 for an orange juice, and $8 for a coffee; at AVIA it was more like $3 each, and the quality was really no different. We also really enjoyed sitting by the fire-pit and talking with other guests as the sun went down, enjoying a glass of wine. We also can't praise the concierge enough, they found a shop selling difficult to get wine for me, and also gave us free tasting passes for several really good wineries. As much as I would like to, I just can't give the AVIA a rating of 5 as our room suffered a bit of a noise problem. It was seemingly above a loud refrigeration or air-conditioning unit which rumbled into life of its own accord during the night, and did wake us both on a few occasions (but we'd just come from the quietest hotel we'd ever stayed at, so anything would suffer in comparison). Also the housekeeping staff knocked to do a turn-down service just as my wife was stepping out of the shower. I asked them to give us 15-20 minutes as we were going out, and they agreed. Yet when we came back to the room after dinner, they hadn't returned. It would also be nice if the hotel had a pool. However, despite that I was still hugely impressed and pleasantly surprised by AVIA. Having stayed at a number of different hotels in the Napa Valley I thought that getting value and luxury in the same place was something that was impossible to find. It seems that AVIA proved me wrong, and we'll be staying there again when we go back next year.", "Date": "December 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cExcellent.

The hotel has a restaurant that we did not partake in, but it was very busy for breakfast so I must assume it was good. Where the hotel severely falls short is on it's cleaning staff. Not one day went by that we didn't have to call down for supplies to be replenished - be it coffee, soap, coffee mugs, wine glasses, etc. All items, by the way, were initially in the room when we checked in, so it would be safe to assume that these items would be replenished as part of the daily cleaning. The guest services staff were more than accommodating, and items were brought to us almost immediately. Our room was outside of their supply closet and we were awoken on most mornings around 8 by the chatter and laughing of the maids in the hallway.

It was one of the few hotels left in Napa with rooms available on the holiday weekend. We lucked out! Our room was reasonably priced, and we opted to pay $25 for an upgrade if one was available. The room we got was beautiful--a soaking tub and huge rain shower. The hotel employees were all very helpful and eager to please. We found the attention to detail impressive--turndown service, a chocolate on your pillow. I had wanted a massage, and without a spa on the premises, I asked the concierge for suggestions and found a fabulous spa within walking distance.

My only complaint was having to choose between privacy or natural light. Our room (443?) looked out directly onto the top floor of the parking garage (we could've practically touched the cars). The lack of view by itself would not have bothered me, but there was no light filtering curtain, just a see-through open grid pattern drape and a blackout curtain. So, any time we didn't want to be in full view of anyone in the garage, we had to have the blackout shades pulled. This could easily be remedied by putting light filtering, yet opaque, drapes in rooms with this problem. We felt this hotel was competitively priced with other similar properties.

Firstly, on the upside, the location is very good both in terms of the position in Napa Valley and being central in Napa itself. The staff were helpful and friendly and the hotel and our room were clean and decorated very nicely to a high modern standard. We made use of the free standing bath-tub which was very nice. Parking was free on dedicated floors of the adjacent public car park. Also a big plus for me was the free wireless internet connection in our room. Actually I expect nothing less, so not so much of a big plus\u2026 but good avoidance of a large minus. Regardless\u2026 it\u2019s always nice when you find it for free. Downsides were few and rank no higher than an irritation\u2026 worthy of a mention as \u201croom for improvement\u201d though and a suggestion that the room rate on our room for off season was set about 10% to 15% too high. Firstly our view (room 306) was of high brick walls about 5 to 10m from our window. We didn\u2019t have the cheapest room and expected much better. Secondly the gym was very small and you couldn\u2019t get on the running machines at peak times. As it happens we turned this into a positive by heading outside for a beautiful clear and crisp morning run along the river. However I wasn\u2019t able to supplement this with any resistance work upon our return to the hotel due to the over-occupancy of the gym. Lastly watch out for the bathroom door arrangement. Ours was of a sliding nature leaving a large half-inch gap all the way around when closed which doesn\u2019t provide for much in the way of acoustic privacy. This was of no consequence to my girlfriend and I but watch out if your relationship is still in the early stages of suppressing bodily announcements. To the hotel management\u2026 the design of your bathroom would readily facilitate a door across the toilet room allowing one person to be using the toilet while the other is in the shower or at the basin. In isolation and depending on your priorities none of the above rank higher than a minor annoyance or inconvenience and the hotel admirably serves the purpose of a safe refuge in a great location. We don\u2019t spend much time in the hotel room itself whenever we travel and had a truly fantastic time in Napa and so should you\u2026 but if we ever went back, we\u2019d probably just go for the cheapest room this hotel had to offer in an attempt to improve value for money.", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vincennes, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cLOVED THIS HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "Wendy056", "ReviewID": "UR63161640", "Content": "Found this hotel on TripAdvisor - super location - just opened in 2009 - beautiful rooms - big bathrooms with 2 sinks - came in handy as we were traveling with our 25 year old daughter.

Room-The rooms were very nice and had great amenities. The bathrooms were very nice and there was a huge tub to relax in. The room we stayed in was separated into a bedroom area and a living room area, which was nice. Location- The hotel is located in downtown Napa, and is within walking distance to several restaurants, such as the Bounty Hunter. The downtown Napa area is cute and the hotel is right in the middle of everything. This area is about 15 minutes away from Yountville, where a lot of the larger wineries are.

First of all it's in the heart of downtown Napa. It's within walking distance of several great restaurants and bars. A great starting off point to head north on your wine tasting adventures. We arrived to the hotel a few days after they had a large water line burst and flooded the ground floor ( lobby ) with two inches of water warping the floors. They were in the process of attempting to restore the wood floors when we arrived so there was a bit of construction going on, but so what..... things happen. I heard several people mention that the floors actually looked very rustic because of the warping. Any way, it wasn't a big deal. Check in went smoothly and everyone we encountered was very pleasant and helpful. There is free self parking at the back of the the hotel with a very short walk to the front door or a $15 valet fee per day with all the in and out privileges you need. The room we had was on the 5th floor. 519. Right next to the elevators. We could never hear the elevators or anyone out in front of them so it was never a problem. But we could hear the people on the other side of the elevators, which again wasn't a problem for us because it was my sister. But if you didn't like listening to my sister and brother in law laughing.... it may be a problem. The rooms are Fantastic!!!! They are very large (we had a Luxe room) nice hardwood floors, swivel TV so you could watch it while in bed or while watching it in the sitting area that has a small couch. Very comfortable king size bed with comfortable crisp sheets. There is a large bathroom with one sink and plenty of counter space. There is a lighted magnified mirror. Ladies... Don't look deeply into this!!!!!! You will scream and run for the tweezers! But... do what you gotta do! The shower has two shower heads, one rain head shower and a hand held shower head. Our water was as hot as you want for as long as you want. The only complaint or suggestion would be about the open shower area. there is just small glass pane that really doesn't keep any of the water in the shower. So just make sure you have 2 or 3 towels down to soak up the water and keep you from slipping and breaking you neck while getting out of the shower. I didn't have a problem wiping up the water, but you shouldn't have to and I can see some people really complaining about this. The view from our 5th floor room was of the parking structure at the rear of the hotel. beautiful.... no but we really didn't spend that much time looking out at the views. We were there for the room. If I'm going to get an amazing view, it's probably not going to be for the price I paid for this hotel which was a bit over $200. They had a very nice outdoor area with wood swings and rocking chairs surrounding a large fire pit and the second floor. We spent a very nice evening around this fire pit and met some very nice interesting people. They is a very great breakfast buffet for around $20 per person. Eggs, omeletts, bagels, muffins, fruits, cereals, meats, cheeses, yogurts and all kinds of other wonderful filling things. In the evening they have a complimentary wine tasting with a few appetizers. In the morning the have a coffee station set up in the lobby if you would like to take a coffee on the go. Over all, myself and all my companions who stayed here had nothing bad to say about this hotel. We were very pleased and felt like we got a great deal for the price. I did a lot of research on hotels and bed and breakfasts in the area and thought that this looked like the nicest hotel for the price.

Loved the bathroom large enough for us to shower together, the double sinks and the lighting and cleanliness of it all was just perfect. We were on the 3rd floor facing the street but we were never bothered with noise in or out of the hotel. We had breakfast in the hotel the first morning. It was good but we found other places near the hotel that was better and much less expensive. The lady at the concierge desk really knows her restaurants. She recommended the 2 breakfast spots which we loved and a cute little place for lunch, Gracie's Table (I think). Excellent service and food! The evening wine was a lot of fun. But we didn't take advantage of it enough. There's just so much to do, taste, drink in Napa that we only participated on our first day. Next time...There will be a next time! Avia, as new as it is, they have really worked out their little glitches. The service was impeccable through out. I still can't get over the value. Because we saved from accommodations, we splurged with wonderful dinners at La Toque (highly recommended) and Bistro Jeanty. It was a wonderful birthday weekend, one to remember.", "Date": "February 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cHigh Californian hospitality!\u201d", "Author": "Stevev98", "ReviewID": "UR56055645", "Content": "My stay was for 5 nights, attending a business conference. The hotel was very welcoming and the friendly barman provided a great supper in the open-plan restaurant bar, which proved an excellent antidote for the 12-hour flight from London to San Francisco. Much better than the welcome offered by most British hotels! The standard room was comfortable and modern, with plenty of room and a fantastic bathroom with huge shower. All conveniences provided: coffee maker, safe, iPod-docking radio, air-con, ironing board, mini-bar and free WiFi internet. The bed was huge and provided a great sleep - despite jet-lag! My only slight niggles were: 1. the air-con which, as the only heater for the room in winter, was a little noisy at night. I solved the problem by heating the room up and then switching it off before going to bed. Not a big problem though. 2. If you move anything in the mini-bar they'll automatically add something to your bill. We like fresh milk in our coffee and put a carton in the bar to keep cool. This confused their system - but it was soon smoothed out when we checked out. Everything else was fine, clean and well-maintained. The restaurant has a lovely atmosphere with a large skylight over a large communal table in the centre and lots of comfortable seating and tables round the room. The conference room was well designed and kept us all awake for 3 days! I should mention the hotel concierge especially. She was extra helpful with finding out about local sightseeing, shopping and a tricky car hire arrangement which she managed with aplomb.

By the time I got around to booking it, it was 4 days later, and unfortunately the deal was no longer on their website. I called the hotel just to check if they were still doing it, and they called me right back, and honored the deal I had found on their website a few days earlier. Sweet! We got to the hotel, and everything was beautiful. The lobby feels modern, yet warm, and the staff were friendly and accommodating. We had the Master Suite with Tub with fireplace, it was perfect for 3 gals. The bathroom is plenty big, with a huge rain shower, and as it was rainy and cold, the fireplace was much needed. About 15 minutes into our stay, we got a call from the concierge confirming it was my birthday, and then Juliette from the hotel stopped by with a vase of roses requested by my husband. The most amazing thing is, Juliette went to the local grocery store, (as my husband didn't want to spend the $70 charged by the local florists for a dozen roses), bought a dozen gorgeous red roses, and arranged them herself in a vase for me. How awesome is that? What hotel would go that far out of their way to do that???Thank you Juilette!!!! And then a plate of chocolate dipped strawberries arrived (also courtesy of my fabulous husband) but they were soooo yummy!

The hotel was clean and very tastefully decorated. The concierge Maria was fabulous. She helped us to book a great tour to visit some of the wineries that was excellent. She recommended a small company that took out groups of four so that the tour had a private feel but was very reasonably priced. She also recommended several great restaurants and each one that we went to exceeded our expectations. The breakfast buffet while not extensive had just enough offerings to make it just right after a night of drinking and fine dining. The wait staff at the restaurant was extremely friendly and attentive. The chief chef was also very personable and took the time to answer questions about the menu. Don't miss the free tastings between 5-6PM. They are a great start to the evening or a nice way to wind down a long day. The location was great, several restaurants and sights were within walking distance. I would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "September 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco Bay Area", "Title": "\u201cNapa's Hidden Gem\u201d", "Author": "LCordair", "ReviewID": "UR38492028", "Content": "What a wonderful find! Nestled in the heart of downtown is this \"urban oasis\" that delivers a warm and hospitable lodging experience. A definite departure from some of the \"teddy bear and lace\" experiences from previous trips, the AVIA Napa starts and ends with you feeling as if you were a long-lost member of the family, home for a short visit. The rooms are comfortable and inviting. Appointed with luxurious linens that covered one of the most comfortable beds that we have ever slept in. The bathrooms are bright and spacious with plenty of room for two. Our room had a lovely soaking tub and a large flat screen television. The restaurant only serves breakfast and lunch, which works out fine since most people are out wine tasting or shopping during the day. Breakfast was a feast for the eyes and the stomach, offering everything from steel cut oatmeal to perfect omelets. The dinner menu features a variety of delectable \"small plates\" with something for every palate.

I returned from a day of working to find that at 5pm my room had still not been cleaned. When I called the front desk they said they would send someone - the maids were still in the hall going from room to room at 5pm. Since I needed to get ready for the evening I said no - but would they take off something on the room rate. They said they could not but could only offer me a free continental breakfast. Not what I would say the equivalent of having a dirty room and unmade bed. When I came back to the room after dinner I turned on the Tv - which did not work. I called the front desk again and they said they would send someone up. In the meantime the maid turn down service ran the bell. the bell was a shrieking alarm that sounded like a fire alarm. Extremely loud.I thought we were evacuating the hotel. When I opened the door the maid tried to explain that I was in a handicapped room - which I am not sure why I was put in. When I called the front desk again after waiting awhile for the tv to be fixed I asked about this \"bell\". they said it was for the hearing impaired - hmm. On a lot of levels this doesn't work. Hearing impaired couldn't hear it and anyone that had hearing may have lost it with that shrieking bell. I could go on - hot water in the shower not really hot., food in the restaurant mediocre at best, very loud airconditioning in the room. Maybe they will work out the kinks - maybe not.

The hotel is very beautiful and modern, the front desk people are very friendly and willing to help you out with everything.

We stayed in the Lux King suite and it was the most amazing thing ever. the floor was a beautiful hardwood, and the bed was super comfy. You got robes to wear and the bathroom was gorgeous with a marble floor and shower with a waterfall shower head. The only down side was the room was very expensive and that did not include any of the refreshment bar that was stocked, anything you took out was charged to your room stay. Also the hallways were rather dimly light and there are no ice machines yet. They don't have a pool, spa, or workout room, but they do have a terrace with swings. :) The breakfast is an extra charge of $12.95 again something I was hoping would be included with the room.
