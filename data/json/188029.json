I was greatly impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of the lobby staff at check-in and check-out and immediately took notice how well kept this hotel is from a cleanliness standpoint. Something I appreciated after a long flight! My room was small, but comfortable, had great lighting, nice bathroom that had an awesome shower, and decent sized flat-screen tv. The king-sized bed I had was comforable and the hotel really makes a point to be green-friendly, something I find admirable. I ate breakfast and dinner in the restaurant and found the quality of the food as well as the price to be very good. It had a nice Italian-themed bar which had a wide selection of wine, beer and cocktails. I got a big kick out of the staff there, they were extremely friendly, professional and good natured, which was a good reason to patronize my new friends downstairs. My colleagues and I also used a small conference room which was small, but we only had eight of us, so we were pleased with the accommodations. Again the staff was top notch providing refreshments throughout the day. Location-wise, the Radisson Bloomsbury is centrally located between the Bloomsbury and Soho neighborhoods, so a diverse dining, socializing and close proximity to the theatre district await you. I would definitely stay here again!", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bournemouth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location in West End\u201d", "Author": "Bournemouthlady", "ReviewID": "UR126536735", "Content": "We recently made our second visit to this hotel.

Loads of great, reasonably priced restaurants in SOHO. The staff at this hotel cannot do enough to be helpful and are very polite. The Breakfast is very good also, with a help yourself hot buffet as well as all the usual continental selection. You can can also have the wait staff bring your cooked breakfast or pancakes or Eggs Benedict (there was a small extra charge for the Eggs Benedict). The room was a litte small, but then they always are in London. But quite big enough for 2 people. Nice bathroom. The weekend package which includes breakfast and the in-house movie package is great. We really enjoyed the opportunity to have a little 'down-time' with a good movie.

We had the buffet breakfast, which was also excellent. The staff were courteous and very helpful to us (we were travelling with a baby). My only point of feedback is on the shower - the walls dont extend as much and if you are a big person (6 ft +), you may have water outside the stall - which can be mopped up.

Several people familiar with the city suggested Russell Sq as a good area to stay in. I investigated multiple B&Bs, but saw so many negative reviews that I decided to pay more and stay at a full service hotel. The Radisson on Bloomsbury was highly recommended by a business colleague of mine. I went with his recommendation and was delighted with my experience. The hotel is in a perfect location for getting around the city. We took the Tube from Heathrow to Holborn and had a 10 min walk to the hotel. We stayed in a 2nd floor room facing Bloomsbury St - I was initially concerned about possible street noise, but the person we spoke to when checking in said they have never had any complaints - and they were correct. We ended up with a very nice street view from our room - there was some street noise in the morning, but nothing that bothered us or disturbed our sleep. The British Museum is 2 blks away. We walked to Piccadilly (15 min) - saw the Hockney show (fantastic!) at the Royal Academy, continued to Trafalgar Sq (10 min further) just enjoying being part of the crowds on the streets. The next day we walked to St James Park (25 min) and on to Westminster Abby, Big Ben, across the Waterloo Bridge to the Hayward Gallery. By late afternoon we had walked enough and took a bus back to Tottenham Court Rd, a few blocks from the hotel. Riding on the top level of a double-decker bus is another great way to get a good view and 'feel' for the city. The hotel was a great experience - EVERY person on the staff was helpful, cordial and well informed! The lounge was a great place to unwind after a day of walking - reasonably priced (for London...) snacks and drinks with a contemporary, casual (but not obnoxiously hip) atmosphere. Our room was very comfortable with a contemporary decor. If you are used to US-sized rooms, be advised that the rooms are similar to those in New York - not cramped, but noticeably smaller. We hope to return to London for another visit in the near future and look forward to staying at the Radisson again.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous hotel and wonderful service\u201d", "Author": "ejseymour", "ReviewID": "UR124894953", "Content": "My boyfriend and I just love this hotel.

(or 4. I don't remember) visit at this hotel. Nice hotel with nice design all over. Standard rooms are small so this time I booked a Deluxe room. The reason why I booked a deluxe is that I got a almost \u00a3100 off (or just to get me to book the room fast?) the roomrate (for 2 nights) because I booked early at Radisson.com (but I could not cancel the reservation at this price, if I did I would not get any money back). So I payed \u00a3355 for 2 nights but still I think it was a little expensive. I will not book it again for this price. I think it's not worth it. And is the normal price for deluxe room really \u00a3450 for 2 nights? I don't think so! Room was good size and nice designed. Bed was great! And I got a room with view of the courtyard. So it was a quiet room. And I could open window, so I used it as refrigerator for my water and beer as it was no space left in the minibar due to the automatic system in it (remove 1 item and put it back but you still have to pay for it). And minibar was not so cold either. I didn't like that the tv was so high up. And the picturequality was not good. Reading light on the bed was bad, and the light switches next to bed was far away so I have to almost get out of bed to switch the lights off. There is free WiFi at this hotel. But it was very very slow. And it didn't work several times. And it didn't work at all for many hours (3.30pm to 8pm!). I called reception. They could not do anything but advice me to buy internet via cable (!). This costs \u00a314! Of course I didn't. Free WiFi is great but it isn't when it's not working. It worked later but is was very very slow. And often it just disconnected. Bad! I wonder why internet with cable is so expensive, oh of course it's working and it's faster!

We ate in the Restaurant but from the bar menu and two of us shared a plate of the fish and chips. Within two hours, we were both very poorly - vomiting and dizziness. We had been fine all day up until this point and the only thing we had both eaten was the meal at the Radisson. When we complained about this to the Receptionist the next morning, the Restaurant Manager was called and my colleague let him know about our experience. At the time he tried to brush it off and said that it would not have happened that quickly if it were food poisoning. We needed to leave the hotel as the three of us were running an event in London that day, so we asked for the problem to be followed up and they would get back to us. By the Tuesday of the following week, we had heard nothing, so I rang the hotel and spoke to a Duty Manager who said he would look into it and get back to me. He took all the details regarding the incident. By Thursday 19th, again, I had heard nothing, so called again. I left a message with a different Duty Manager and a few hours later the Restaurant Manager, who we had seen the day after, called me back. He seemed surprised to hear from me, and said he had not been informed that I had called the week before, and also said that he felt the matter had been dealt with when he spoke with my college. I told him that I disagreed and that a complaint of that nature should be taken seriously and looked into and that we were expecting some feedback from what he uncovered. To cut a long story short, he was in denial that our sickness was anything to do with what we had eaten and was not prepared to accept any liability for this nor take it any further. When I pursued the point, he said that he felt that if we had been poorly due to fish poisoning, we would have been hospitalised. When I asked him to explain what his sources were for that position, he could, or would, not. So, not only had they failed to follow up on a serious complaint, they had apparently not even taken any measures to investigate any likelihood that our sickness was caused by the fish, nor done anything to mitigate any further problems if we were right. He just kept saying, \"what do you want me to do?\" He was very unsympathetic, quite abrasive and not at all understanding of why I might have expected a different reaction from him or the hotel. Apart from that, I found the hotel very dark, oppressive and overly-priced. My room (a deluxe double) had a long corridor once inside the door, however was very small. The bathroom was hard-edged and not comfortable to spend time in. I will not, needless to say, be staying here again, nor recommending it to anyone else.

When we arrived at reception to check in the receptionist couldn't find our reservation on the system. We were asked to leave our bags & come back later & they would have to put our details on to their system. I was asked for my confirmation at this time,which I had to leave with them.On our return we were advised everything was sorted out & given our door card.I asked if they had the late check out room on the system. The receptionist asked me if I had paid for this & I again showed it on my confirmation. He said that it was o.k.The next problem was the door card did not work,so my husband had to go back to recepton for another card. That night after returning from the Theatre we tried to get a movie but could only get T.v chanels. In the morning we went to get breakfast that was booked in the package & was queried about this as they only had us down for one breakfast? We were beggining to feel like outcasts. We decided to go shopping & come back later in the afternoon as we had the late check out room. I had a feeling there was going to be a problem & when we returned we couldn,t use our door card! We again had to go to reception & explain we had a late check out. At 4pm we went to reception to hand in the door card & were asked to pay extra for the late check out room.

Stepping out of the lift on the 6th floor , the surrounds were very plush - we felt like VIP's - really luxurious decor and ambient lighting gave a great sense of decadence. Once we got to our room , it was exactly as described - admittedly , the superior room was a little small - but I already expected that as you are in central london and it clearly told you the room size when you booked. The room was spotless , the bathroom was immaculately clean and the room felt very cosy and homely. We popped to the bar for a quick spot of lunch and a drink before we went out - the bar felt intimate , clean and inviting. Nice comfy sofas if you were lucky enough to grab them ! The bar staff were really friendly and the food was just what we needed. The location of the Hotel is perfect for theatreland - We went to the Shaftesbury Theatre which was literally a 3-4 minute walk from the Hotel - Perfect ! We came back later after seeing fab show and a great meal at the Savoy and again , relaxed in the bar and enjoyed a nightcap - or two - on the super comfy sofas !

Following fantastic stays at some of the international Radisson hotels I decided to have a look at what they had to offer in London and was not disappointed. I soon contacted the Radisson Edwardian Bloomsbury Street hotel and booked myself into their amazing King Deluxe Suite, the idea was that upon arrival to our suite my girlfriend would find a bouquet of 50 red roses, petals on the bed, Champaign and a card which read \u201cwill you marry me?\u201d But how to organize all of this? After my booking I emailed Guest Relations Manager Mr.. Luke Jozef Francois to see if he could make this possible and later that same day I received a call from him. Luke was extremely helpful and excited about the surprise which I had in mind, we discussed the idea in length and Luke kept in contact right up to the date. Upon arrival at the Radisson Bloomsbury my Girlfriend and I were struck by the decor of the hotel, it really was a beautiful place full with fantastic artwork with a real lavish feeling. By this time was I getting rather nervous, however I had already received a text from Luke letting me know that the suite was ready so nerves were settled a little. Luke actually checked us into the hotel and showed us up to our suite, the Kings Deluxe Suite was simply breath taking to say the least, every little detail of the front room was perfect and then of course to top it off my girlfriend opened the door and walked into the bedroom. Dimmed lights, romantic music, rose petals on the bed, bouquet, campaign, rose petals in the bath it really was something special. Her face was so happy as she opened the card which read \u201cwill you marry me?\u201d, as she looked around I was on one knee with the ring and she said yes.

At check in I was informed that they had no single rooms left but could accommodate me at The Bloomsbury St. So I was accompanied by a very polite man from reception at the Kenilworth across the road to The Bloomsbury St, where he checked me in upgrading me to a standard double so I was quite pleased. I remember the hotel from when it was called The Marlborough and was quite chintzy. There is now no chintz in sight, anywhere. It's undergone a complete transformation into a sleek (and dark) contemporary hotel. It's lost a bit of character though and now looks much like many other 4* modern hotels. The room itself was small, but more than ample for one person. Two people would be fine. As it faced an inner courtyard / rooftops, it was quiet but there was some noise from the corridor which was not helped by a sizeable gap beneath the door. I did not appreciate being woken by the chambermaid at 8:30 on Saturday morning in order to clean the room; my fault for not switching on the do not disturb light the previous night. A nice bathroom with an excellent shower. I was pleased to see a full-size window in both the bedroom and bathroom as so often hotel bathrooms have no natural light. The room was decorated in muted, dark colours but it felt as though they had forgotten to hang several more pictures as many of the walls were blank. The bed was comfortable with good linen and spare pillows in the wardrobe. A few biscuits would have been nice to see with the tea/coffee set up but at least there was complimentary wi-fi in the room. Check out the following morning was also professional yet even at 10:30 people were already checking in and storing luggage so with only 2 people at reception there was a slight wait.

The hotel rates are, as we all know, never as good as the ones from your bank.

The room itself seemed a bit small compared to the pictures of a deluxe suite on the hotel website (we didn't have a sofa in the room - it wouldn't have fit), but it had a nice layout and we appreciated all the windows (that opened!) and the distance from other guest rooms. We also appreciated having North American outlets available in the room (a pleasant surprise). I was a bit confused by the fluctuating daily rates - I'm used to a hotel having one static rate for each day of my stay. Also, the air freshener or scent used in the entrance of the hotel was a bit strong. That said, the hotel was clean, comfortable, modern and perfectly located in the city. In fact, it was so close to the British Museum that we ended up visiting it five times. There is also a sandwich shop (Pret) and a 24 hour grocery just down the street. Very convenient. We also greatly appreciated the friendly and attentive staff. It is always good to start a hotel stay with a warm greeting at the front desk. Another reviewer had it right - there is a certain understated efficiency with the staff here that just works. With so many hotels to choose from in London, I think we made a good choice with the Radisson Edwardian Bloomsbury Street. If we return to London, I don't see why we wouldn't stay here again. One further observation - the hotel might need to be a little less steathly and work to raise its profile a bit. My wife and I took many taxis during our stay and only three drivers knew of the hotel.

Leicester Square (and the nearby Chinatown, which has some decently priced and authentic Asian food) is only a ten-minute walk from the hotel, and additional ten-minute walk from there you are in Trafalgar Square. In another direction, the heart of Oxford Road is only a ten-minute walk away. There are lots of restaurants and shopping within in walking distance. Even if you don't enjoy exploring by foot, the hotel is located near two tube stations for you to get around. Second, the hotel and my room was clean with modern decor; the beds are comfortable; and bathroom was good size. Finally, the hotel for its caliber was reasonably priced, especially for London. I booked early and pre-paid to receive a 20% discount. A couple of things to note: I had a Deluxe room, which was much larger than the Superior room my friends occupied (it felt cramped to be honest). Sometimes there is not a big difference between Deluxe and Superior rooms, but at this hotel there is a difference. I recommend spending the extra for the Deluxe room; it is worth it.

For those of you familiar with London, this is the old Marlborough Hotel at Bloomsbury and Great Russell Street. This is one of the best locations in the entire city, convenient to almost everything. The British Museum is a block away, as is Oxford Street and Bedford Square. Easy walk to Covent Garden and the Tottenham Court Tube Station. The hotel has recently gone through a thorough upgrade and renovation. Though the decor is somewhat bizarre (part Las Vegas, part Phillipe Starke wanna be; e.g. benches in the lobby that are \"works of art\" and require small plaques that say \"Do not Sit\".)

Around 25 minutes later the very attentive receptionist then reappeared to explain there had been an overbooking however, it had now been dealt with and we were to be upgraded into two higher graded rooms along with free breakfasts. It was a difficult situation, although handled very well. The rooms are well designed with really nice fixtures & fittings, beds are extremely comfortable with a high quality mattress and pillows, my only real criticism of the room would be having a shower in the bath tub, I much prefer a purpose built cubicle with a powerful spray, although the watering can type at this place was very relaxing.

We were offered an upgrade to a larger room for an extra \u00a350 per night, but we declined. The room itself was smaller than I expected, but not terribly so, it was comfortably furnished and had excellent air conditioning. The bathroom was large and elegant with marble tiling, a shallow bath and an excellent shower, the toiletries were large bottles mounted on the wall in convenient places. Cleanliness of the room was fine, although my wife noticed that one of the glasses (actually porcelain beakers) had not been changed or cleaned for a couple of days, an oversight I presume. Our room faced the side of the hotel overlooking a small residential courtyard and was very quiet, the window had an excellent blackout blind. Soundproofing was good. The bed, although smaller than we are used to, was very comfortable. There was an in room safe, bathrobes,slippers, an ironing board and iron, and a trouser press, kettle and tea/coffee etc. We didnt eat in the hotel, although the menu looked interesting and actually not too expensive, bar prices looked on a par with elsewhere outside the hotel, spirits looked expensive, but the measures are doubles. Service was friendly and efficient. Room service breakfast was rather ambitiously priced at \u00a321!, so i'm assuming it was the same price in the restaurant, we found to very nice Italian snack bar called Giovanni's on Museum street and another Italian cafe directly opposite it on the same street which gave a full cooked breakfast for around \u00a35, a no brainer and both delicious! This area has plenty of places to eat at night, within walking distance our favourites were, \"Tas\", a Turkish restaurant diagonally opposite the hotel, Zizzis on Bow St (italian) and great place called Kopapa which did fusion style dishes in a Tapas way, utterly delicious and great service.

Oddly there is no space in front to pull over and nobody comes out to help with luggage (or open the door for the most part). This seemed odd in such a high end hotel. The bar and restaurant were excellent. I just wished they had an a la carte breakfast menu and not a 21 pound buffet which is excessive for most. The only major drawback was the noise from Bloomsbury Street. There must be a nearby hospital or police station with sirens all night long.

The bathroom was wall to wall marble, well stocked with towels and lotions and had the most powerful power shower I have used in ages. There was even an ice making machine in the corridor. The mini-bar was well socked and also large enough for us to put our own drinks in. Our room had it's own AC which we could set to whatever temperature we wanted. Even though the hotel was just great, the best thing about this hotel was the location. It was just 5 minutes walk from the centre of Covent Garden with it's vast array of eating places and bars.

Equally we walked to Euston fgrom there in around 15 minutes. There is a cashpoint opposite the hotel and a newsagents, both very handy. The hotel had a good business centre if you need to use a PC but equally the free wifi was excellent. A real bonus is the Barclays bikes outside the hotel - you can bike around London all day for \u00a31 provided you keep docking the bikes and get a new one - there are so many of these bikes and docking stations around now that you can go around the whole of London for the day for \u00a31. It is far better than going on the Tube and having the docking station outside the hotel makes it a great and convenient way of getting around - London is fairly flat. The hotel is very contemporary and extremely clean. The carpet in the corridors is very deep and spongey which is great to walk down after a hard day.

The standard room was small, but again, comfortable and light with a small ensuite shower room only. We drank at the bar and ate in the restaurant during both our stays. The cost of doing so reflects the standard of the hotel. It is not for a cheap stay!

Excellent food and very friendly and helpful staff. Bar drinks very pricey. Extremely comfortable bed and very quiet room, as requested. Standard room booked through Superbreaks is very small. Only just about adequate. It was a good job that we only had hand luggage with us or we would have been tripping over suitcases. I am not sure that the best use is made of the small wardrobe space by having an iron, ironing board and trouser press in there. There would have been no room to erect the ironing board if we had wanted to use it anyway! The bathroom was a reasonable size and very modern with a polished granite floor, which of course is very hygenic and easy to keep clean. However, I do think that a towelling bath mat should be provided as a)the floor is very cold to stand on and b)a wet floor can be slippery and cause accidents. We did not like the opaque glass door separating the bedroom and bathroom as if one has to visit the bathroom in the night, whenever the bathroom light is turned on it floods the bedroom with light and disturbs the person sleeping in the bed. Maybe either a roller blind on the bathroom side of the door or a small night light in an unobtrusive place in the bathroom would be helpful. Also the frosted external window in the bathroom is not frosted enough to leave the blind open when the bathroom light is on. Very good size flatscreen TV on wall but would have liked sports channels to be available as well. The room keycards really do need sorting out. We kept our keycards completely separate from our mobile phones and credit cards but every day for 3 days when we returned to the hotel in the evening our cards would not work and we had to return to reception to have new ones done. The receptionist suggested that the alarm mechanisms in the shops demagnetised them but we have stayed in hotels all over the world that have these cards and have never had this trouble before. Would definitely stay here again. Much better than any other London hotel we have stayed in previously. I know that room size is always a problem in London and this hotel is no different to any other in that respect. The free wi-fi in the rooms was greatly appreciated.The small newsagents shop opposite the hotel entrance in Bloomsbury Street is a very good place to buy and top up the Oyster cards for travel around London.", "Date": "February 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester", "Title": "\u201cLovely rooms...but rather noisy!\u201d", "Author": "msra8kc4", "ReviewID": "UR97503560", "Content": "I stayed at the Radisson Edwardian Bloomsbury Street Hotel for 1 night on 26th January 2011. Check-in was extremely fast and the lady who dealt with this was efficient, friendly and informed me that my room had been upgraded. Staff were waiting in the wings to carry my luggage up to the room, which I declined, as I was only carrying a small case. As other reviewers have mentioned - I disliked the way that the lifts functioned. Having to put your key into the lift in order to operate it was slightly confusing with no prior explanation, but this was solved swiftly by a member of staff. Upon arrival in the room, it was clean and had everything that I needed - a comfy bed, a big tv and a beautiful bathroom. The bedside light didn't work, but this wasn't really an issue. The room was air conditioned - not necessary for January weather, but a plus if you stay at this hotel during the summer. The bathroom was lovely and pristine, although if I had been staying for longer, I would have expected there to be extra bathroom provisions such as nail files etc. However, all in all, the room had everything that I needed and was decorated to a high standard. The only problem that I had was that the rooms are not insulated well in terms of being sound-proof. I found it difficult to fall asleep because I could hear people walking down the corridor outside and people who were talking on their way to their rooms sounded as though they were actually inside my room! The redeeming factor is that the people that stayed on my floor on this occasion were not too noisy, but this could be a problem perhaps on a weekend, when there are less business guests staying in the hotel. The hotel is very central and close to many lovely restaurants and within walking distance to most tourist locations. Check-out was swift and the hotel stored my bags safely until I had finished my assessment day at 5pm that evening. Definitely not the cheapest hotel at \u00a3195 a pop, but I do believe that if you book in advance, you can get some good deals!", "Date": "February 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, hotel and helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "MrandMrsGNewcastle", "ReviewID": "UR97401609", "Content": "This is a lovely modern hotel in a great location for exploring covent garden, leicester square, Theatreland etc with lots of lovely bars and restaurants on your doorstep.

As it was just a short break we decided to treat ourselves to one of the few suites that they have at the hotel. It was nicely furnished with most things that you would generally expect. A CD player or IPod dock would have been a worthwhile extra and not really too much to ask for their top rooms. The suites are located on the corner of the \u201cL\u201d shaped hotel with curving windows giving a pleasant view of the streets and rooftops. With the exception of the odd emergency siren the double glassing kept the street sounds down to an acceptable level. The highlight of the room is the free standing bath in the bedroom which certainly helped us get the most out of our few precious hours of relaxation. The main bathroom is compact but features a large walk in shower with a range of jets We booked direct via their website a chose a package which included some added extras, most of the staff didn\u2019t seem too familiar with this offer but it didn\u2019t any great problems. Part of the deal included afternoon tea which they kindly served for us in our lounge. Another added bonus was a late check out until 4:00PM which for us trying to make the most of our time was a very useful add-on.

I was told the second time that they could not ring the bell of the room due to the late hour. Both times rowdy patrons have also been a problem: yelling in the hallways late at night, loud parties. This trip when I called the front desk, these issues were addressed. To follow-up on the smoking issue: I completed their customer survey after my trip and received an email from the hotel manager saying he had spoken to the staff involved and hoped I would give the hotel another chance. This is the first time a hotel has responded directly to a survey and I thought this was an excellent example of customer service.

Our room over looked the main road, so it was very noisy all night with people shouting and talking, bin lorrys and sirens, but thats London not everyone is in bed and quite for midnight. We had our breakfast delivered to our room in the morning which was lovely, we were brought a full english, toast, breakfast cakes and fruit salad also coffee and juice. There is a charge of \u00a31.50 for this but its lovely to have it in your room so you dont need to get dressed before you eat. We were also brought a bottle of red wine, strawberrys and chocolates as a treat for my husbands birthday, which we both thought was just so lovely. The location of the hotel is great, we went to the Lyric theatre and it was a 10 minute stroll and we had a meal in a restaurant on route.

My husband and I arrived separately at the hotel. My husband got there first early in the morning to leave his bags as the room was not available yet and go to a work meeting. He told the people at the reception that I will be arriving in the afternoon and since it was my birthday he asked them to leave some kind of \"happy birthday\" note for me. I later found out that he also made this request a few days before our arrival by email. His requests were ignored and he was disappointed by it when he came into the room in the evening and I said no when he asked if any greeting was left for me. I found the room modern and very beautifully (minimally) decorated and the bathroom spacious and pleasant but the bathtub had hairs in it (yuck!) when I first came in (I cleaned the entire bathroom with disinfectant wipes I brought with me). The bed was very comfortable but we had just one sleeping pillow in the room and it was with feathers when I specifically asked for hypoallergenic synthetic pillows when making the reservation online at the hotel web site a few month earlier (it was one of the options offered there). We had to ask the reception for more pillows. The electric kettle with tea and coffee that was refilled every day was very nice and so was the free wifi (!). They even had free printing service at the concierge desk (not the best quality, but I was able to print our e-tickets for the way back home) The location on a quiet street within easy walking distance to the British Museum, Covent Garden, Soho, central underground stations and shopping on Oxford st. was perfect.

Quite pricey but wanted something nice for my moms 71st birthday weekend. 4 of us travelled, 2 rooms. (Saw Priscilla which was AMAZING!!!). Arrived at the hotel to be told that the twin room for my mom wasn't ready. I wanted this trip to be really special for her and having to wait for the room took the edge off a bit. I wanted 2 rooms on the same floor as I thought this would be easier for sharing items such as hair straighteners etc. The reception did offer to give us another room but it was on another floor so we waited for the initial room. A nice gesture would have been to offer us a complimentary drink while we waited, but sadly non was offered. Instead we went out for a walk and bought our own. When we got both the rooms, the decor was lovely, very plush, lovely bathrooms, really big in both rooms. The rooms don't have much of a view but then thats not what we were there for. I had booked a table for dinner before the theatre on the saturday. Through superbreak we were offered a 2 4 1 deal in the hotel restaurant. Previous to arriving for our break, I e-mailed the hotel about a table and was told that not only could we have 2 4 1 off the set menu but we could also have 50% off food from the main a la carte menu. Great I thought, good job I printed this e-mail off because when I arrived in the restaurant, they were unaware of this offer and I had to show the e-mail. Then I was told that we would have to have two courses to qualify for this offer, these conditions were not highlighted in the mail when I booked so I talked to the manager and she agreed to uphold the offer for our 1 course (didn't have enough time for 2 as theatre beckoned). I have to say, this annoyed me no end becuase I was made to feel embarrassed by the manager in front of my mom for the way it was handled.That did not go down well with me at all. No tip was left that night. That said, the food we had was lovely. However, coincidence maybe, but everyone else in the restaurant had their food before we did, and that felt like they were just making a point. Breakfast in the hotel was lovely, better on our 2nd morning than our 1st, on the 1st morning we had to ask for things to be re-filled but not the 2nd, they seemed much more on the ball that day. Pretty much everything was there and as with dinner, good quality and tasty.

The concierge desk was unmanned and we had to wait about 5 to 10 minutes for the concierge to return while the reception staff booked in other guests.

In other hotels we have stayed in the concierge desk is manned almost permenantly and they have other people to take the bags to the rooms and store them when required.

Our package included breakfast that was buffet style and very good with attentive professional staff and a constant supply of food but if breakfast is not included in the room rate it will cost \u00a318.00 per person that I personally think is on the high side.

I scoured over hotel ratings and read review after review looking for a hotel that had the feel of the W Hotels in the US. I wanted to splurge on this extravagance since I was traveling alone but unfortunately the W London doesn't open until Spring 2011 so I decided booked a MUCH more expensive hotel in the hopes of great room service and pampering. Two days before I was leaving I reeled myself in and decided a cheaper hotel was really the right thing for my wallet so I started over. I am sooooo glad I did! Now the Radisson Edwardian is not exactly cheap, but it was definitely cheaper than my original choice by a ton. It is also a preferred hotel for international travelers at my corporation so I figured what the heck. In the US, Radisson Hotels are usually 2/3 stars out of 5. I would say this hotel is a 3/4 star hotel on that same scale.....based on booking the King Deluxe room. I was pleasantly greeted upon arrival and they even had a room ready for me to check into at 11am which was great. The interior was not perfect, but the rooms were big, the bathroom was modern, the air conditioning worked great and most importantly the bed was comfortable with nice linens. Very W-ish in style. The only draw back were the cable options were VERY limited...I think there might have only been 5 local channels? But there were several movie options which was fine with me. There was an Underground Station close by, but I have to admit that London was packed with things to see. As many of the reviews have said, if you have the time...walk everywhere that you can. Its very rewarding and doable! I walked to many of the attractions which was great and it helped me get my sense of direction. I also enjoyed being just outside the crazy, tourist zones. It was nice to come home to a quieter area. As far as food options.....you could get your room with breakfast included but I'm just not a big breakfast person. Starbucks was right around the corner and that was a great/cheaper option for me. Beyond that, I didn't really seek to spend my money on upscale restaurants (not much fun by yourself) but there were lots of pubs and reasonably priced restaurants in the neighborhood. I even found a fabulous fish and chips place (recommended by a local that I met) 10 minutes away called Rock & Sole Plaice. It was so good that I went there 2 nights out of 5!

This was sold to us by informing us that the alternative hotel was a 4* deluxe rather than the 4* we had booked. We agreed to move as we are not the sort of people to cause a fuss and understood that these things happen occasionally. We were too early to book in the room, therefore we arranged to leave our luggage and spend the day sightseeing etc. On returning to the hotel we had a limited amount of time to book in, shower and change as we had theatre tickets and needed to be out rather quickly. Our initial reaction to the hotel room was a little disappointing, small, dark, quite obviously a room set up for disabled users, which in itself isn\u2019t a problem but I do think it would have been polite to have informed us. The lack of natural light and noise from a huge air conditioning unit situated outside the window was also disheartening. On further inspection there was litter on the floor under the bedside table and the glass dining table had a good layer of dust. When sat at the dressing table I was unable to see in the mirror as it was placed far too high and this would have been impossible for a wheelchair user. My husband was the first to use the bathroom, the toilet was situated extremely close to the wall, the sinks did not have plugs and the area around the main sink had marks and looked very unclean. The shower head had obviously been damaged by previous users and when switched on sprayed water all over the bathroom floor, there was a hole in the wall were the small mirror had been fitted incorrectly and damage to the wall where the mirror continuously hit the wall. All of these discoveries were very disappointing to find not only because the weekend was meant as my special birthday weekend but also because we didn\u2019t have time to deal with the issues straight away. The main reception and restaurant areas are extremely stylish and the staff were very polite and helpful, especially Katie.

The concierge basically refused to send a doctor over because I do not have over over 100 pound cash on me and even when I offered to pay with credit card (come on, I am not poor if I can stay at a four star hotel).

So we decide to choose the Radisson Edwardian Bloomsbury Street Hotel for the 2009 Christmas and New Year Eve. We didn\u00b4t know anything about the april 2008 negative documentary on ITV. Perhaps it such case we would have changed our mind and looked for an other hotel. Fortunately this was not the case. The place is an excellent option in London and the price for Christmas 2009 was reasonable in London hotel's terms (186\u00a3 plus taxes including breakfast for a superior room). The room was exactly as described in the website: wide and well provided (with complimentary wifi access) and the bathroom spacious (although without heating system except for the towels). And housekeeping was efficient and kind, including the days the hotel was full and were surpassed by the work they had. The breakfast buffet was quite good in spite of the lack of space for so many guests the hotel had. Unfortunately, there most of the persons who supposedly were in charge were complete incompetents. Only their less recognized peers solved the mistakes they made and their lack of skills for the job.I still remember one of them, called Denise, who clearly thought, and I imagine still thinks, she was not born to help guests. Not everything in the room should be considered OK. I have mentioned the lack of heating system in the bath which is not very understandable in winter months. But that applies specially to the heating system, very noisy and difficult to adjust. Our room had two independent machines that work at their owm rhythm with no relation with the temperature selected and one of them switched off automatically late every night. Perhaps we should have contacted with reception, but we didn't because the noise was \"unfixable\". And in addition to that, the hotel (or other firms) have placed the exterior air conditioning machines in the common courtyard floor. The high number of them (see photo) translates in a considerable noise that has to be hard to carry in the lower floors rooms. We didn't stay at one of them, however some nights the noise was very disturbing (in spite of the windows insulation). So next time it will be a good idea to make the reservation by phone (if prices remain the same) and to ask for a room with window to one of the three streets that surrounds the hotel.

Room service was prompt, and the gentleman who took our orders was also really friendly and helpful. Being able to have a full English breakfast delivered to our room was another welcome bonus: we went down for breakfast on the Sunday and had to wait a while as it was very busy, so the tray charge for room service was definitely worth it on the other two days. This is a gorgeous, modern hotel, perfectly situated for a stay in London. yes, it is expensive, but I do think it's worth it if you really want to be sure of having a fantastic time. All the staff are friendly, courteous and efficient without being obsequious or coming across as false. Checkout was efficient and friendly too.

The rate was reasonable but not cheap and I paid a litlle more, specifically for a deluxe twin. To be fair it is a nice stylish hotel, contemporary furnishings etc until after we checked in and got to the end of the corridor, to our corner bedroom. Not quite sure were the 'Deluxe' title came into the equation, but this was a dark, extremely small twin room. One bed against the wall, next to the entrance door, a tiny space inbetween, we may as well have booked a double room and the bathroom door and toilet pretty much squashed facing the bottom of the other bed. If i was travelling on my own for work and secured a cheap deal, this would have been an ok 'just get your head down for the night' type of room and I wouldnt have complained. However as it was for a special occassion and I had also booked and paid for a deluxe I was miffed to say the least. Even more so when I went back down to reception to request a room change, only to discover the hotel wasnt full and was then shown a whole host of different, much BIGGER rooms throughout the Hotel. In all fairness the female Receptionist (who hadn't actually checked us in) handled my complaint very well but my issue is why Stefan, the guy that did check us in, fobbed us off with what really was a cr*p room. Had I checked in with my husband ,I somehow get the feeling we would have ended up with a totally different room allocation tsk tsk.

The only slight adverse comments I would venture to make were two. 1. I chose to pay for my 'incidentals' by cash rather than credit card after encountering the situation at other hotels where this money is effectively 'frozen' for one month, even after checking out. Having sorted this out at check-in, when it came time for room service I was advised (more than once) that I had I had not left any 'incidental' money. This also applied to when I tried to make a phone call I was advised that the phone had not been connected as I had not left any money for incidentals. Very frustrating trying to sort this out.... again more than once. 2. As a solo traveller (by choice!) over the Christmas period I had my eye on the Christmas menu which was on display for a few days before Christmas Day. There was what one could describe as a 'budget' Christmas meal and then a more expensive and elaborate one. On Christmas Night I was ready to order the budget one (still around 40 pounds from memory) and I find out it was not on offer. So to plan B rather disappointingly which was room service of mushroom risotto. Not really a Christmas meal but very appetising, none-the-less. Breakfast times were very busy on most days, and it would have been a good idea to let guests know that this might be the case by advising or displaying messages to this effect, which I encountered at another 4 star hotel in the London area.

But after a few minutes they called back and said that the didn\u2019t have potatoes. I canceled my order. Then I ordered the Pizza Extravaganza. It looked very good with pepperoni, green pepper, ham, mushrooms, red onions and olives so I ordered it. After 25 min. pizza came to my door and he told me that they didn't have any pepperoni and if it was ok? Of course not! They could have said this before and I wouldn't have ordered. But the pizza was also missing cheese!! What kind of a restaurant makes a pizza without cheese!!?? And they didn't bother to tell me before making it!! I called to roomservice and they were sorry. But they could have told me before making it! Without cheese you can't call it a pizza. And ofcourse I would not order a pizza without cheese. Manager called me afterwards and offered me a free sandwich. That was ok. And ofcourse I didn't pay for the \"pizza\". Next day I wanted to try the pizza again. So I called roomservice and asked if they had pepperoni and cheese. Yes they had. Minutes later they called me and said that they didn't have pepperoni! (I was not suprised) But I could have salami instead. I said ok to that. After 25 min. my pizza with cheese arrived at my door. But where is the ham!!? Yes, this time it was no ham on the pizza (but there was cheese). And one olive had a stone in it. And there was no red onion but ordinary onion. I didn't bother to call back. When I checked out next day I said I wanted a discount for the pizza. But I got it for free. Maybe I will be back, but I will not use the roomservice again!

I mentioned to the receptionist that my TV remote was dead and she said someone would sort it ....but of course no one did. The small bathroom was clean but the shower had low pressure. The room was also a bit dusty which a colleague of mine in another room also mentioned the next morning. To top it off, I received a wake up call the next morning at 730am which I hadn't requested...later found out that the lady in the queue behind me (while I was telling the receptionist about the remote control) had asked for a 730am wake up call which she never got. Overall I wasn't at all impressed. Am just glad that I didn't have to pay for it. Maybe we were put in 'second class' rooms because it was a mass booking by a company.

Literally a 3 min walk from a station which has great access to other areas i.e. leiscester square. And easily walkable to oxford street's great shops. Dont bother walking from Holborn. We arrived at the hotel around 9pm and prior to arrival I emailed the hotel to give my requests i.e. high floor. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a lovely receptionist who completed check-in. This hotel is very very modern, funky, and boutique i.e. black floor, velvet walls however there was quite large music around the reception area and both if us could hear what each other was saying. The receptionist explained that we had to put the keycard in the lift before pressing the floor button but people still seemed to get confused about this coming back to reception to say the lift didnt work! On entering our floor the hallways are just amazing, big sculptures and plush carpets. Even better when we got to our superior room (6020) which although cosy, was filled with a few special touches i.e. round glass table, big flatscreen tv, and velvet bed throw and extra pillows. They have done a good job. If you like a good bathroom then come here... rainforest shower head, gilchrest & soames bath products, hand wash & body lotion. Best of all the bathroom is huge!!! Breakfast was included with the package and it really was good. There was a menu where you could have anything cooked up for you, some free, and some chargeable like smoked haddock or kipper (\u00a32). Still good value. If you like your fruit then they offer fresh strawberrys, raspberrys as well as melon, orange, and pineapple. Cooked breakfast was great with 2 types of bacon, sausages, eggs and lots more. Hardly ever had to wait and got seated straight away both days. However we did notice that once my parter drank a yakult that it was a week out of date! He informed Robin the restaurant supervisor and he apologised and offered us a free drink in the bar, which was quite generous. Once we left for the day we forgot to put our 'clean room' button on, but I though that all the hotels I have been to they would clean the room anyway.. wrong, we returned at 4pm to find the room hadnt been cleaned, but once we went out and put the light on, we came back to find it had all been done. Great service considering most housekeeping go home at 2pm. My only major gripe was that our safe didnt work in the room for the entire trip. Initially I phoned reception who could barely hear me due to the music as mentioned before but she came up straight away and said that maintanence had gone home and will be in the next day.

Obviously the first pieces of trash you throw into it,, the plastic bag falls to the floor of the pale and is now rendered useless and annoying as you must constanrtly bend down to open it and try tro fit tre gardage into it. A quick fix and no anxiety for the guest- A proper size Plastic bag (SOlVED) the only minor other problem was teh lighting. There are ample ceiling lights throughout the room, on a dimmer, so all the lights on high work great, or dimmed low for moos wonderful, however I you want to sit at the chairs b y the table an read,, you must keep the lights up high,and it makes it impossible for someone else in teh room to simply take a nap. The addition of a lamp on that table for not too much money would solve teh problem easily. Lastly- the placement of the hotel is WONDERFUL. A stroll to Soho and the restaurants and theartres.

The Radisson hotel has some very positive points - in particular the location. Very close to Tottenham Court Road Tube Station and within walking distance of Covent Garden, Soho, Oxford Street. It is 15 seconds walk from the British Museum. The staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful and I would put them top of the list for this. This is especially the case for the reception and concierge staff. Well Done. Staff in the breakfast room were the complete opposite though. Thats another story. First time I've even been shouted at in a restaurant. I asked for butter - none came with the cold toast - and was walking back to my table when I heard the girl shout an Oi Mate at me and handed me a small dish of butter. So much for table service and manners!!! The rooms: TINY TINY TINY - even compared to other similar London hotels. I know we had a good deal through superbreak that included breakfast, but it was only 15stg of a saving and that does not permit putting a 6ft 2 person into a room where the roof was almost hitting his head and legs off the end of the tiny double bed. Ok - they did change us when I explained the situation. Was told it was an upgrade. What a load of rubbish.... if it was an upgrade I would have been so angry to have paid more for it. Almost no room to walk around the bed. Obviously close to a bar/nightclub playing techno music until 1.30am. When I lied down in bed I could see the ripples in my bedside water glass from the thumping music. I would say it was one of the most noise afflicted hotels I have stayed in. Doors banging all night, front of house powerhosing at 5.30am followed by room above having bath at 6am. They might as well have been in the room with us. The noise insulation is bad. Room was very dark. Bathroom was large, with heated towel rain and lovely fluffy towels. However, the flood that was on the slippy floor when we had a shower meant that we had to use one of the bath towels to mop up the leakage from the inadequate shower screen. I slipped getting out of the bath but managed to right myself. I mentioned this to the check-out staff but was just told it would be looked into and sorry about that. Breakfast was just OK. Typical english breakfast and some fruit, cereal and youghurt available. Q was massive and the room was full to capacity. Tables all on top of each other and only 3 staff visible. One of which was the rude butter girl. Orange juice was like acid. I know this review sounds bad and I guess it wasnt the worst experience ever - but it was just for one night and when converted to Euro it cost 200 euro. Not worth it at all.

Having stayed at a number of Hilton hotels before with a view to being loyal to one particular chain, I had noticed an inconsistency in the quality of their hotels and the appalling maintenance and housekeeping of the rooms and grounds in a couple we stayed in recently in Scotland, so we decided to try somewhere different. The online booking process was straightforward and provided a good room rate. The reception staff were friendly and efficient. The hotel exterior and communal areas were very well maintained and appeared immaculately clean and orderly. The room was immaculate and the housekeeping staff were polite and friendly when we spoke to them. The room was in an almost perfect state of repair and the air conditioning was quiet and kept our room comfortable during our stay which was during warm weather. My only minor negative comments would be that the shaving mirror in the bathroom was loose and the large towel rail wasn't working (turned off due to warm weather perhaps?). The reception on the large plasma screen in the room was quite poor however holidays aren't about watching television so this was no problem although if I'd been staying there alone on business this might have been an issue. The room was luxurious and quiet and the bed was very comfortable - almost too comfortable. The ice/water dispenser in the corridor was a nice touch too. The breakfasts were of a high quality with a varied range of foods (buffet/continental/fruits/yoghurts etc.) and the serving and bar staff were courteous and efficient. I hope that these high standards are maintaned as the hotel matures as I realise that it was recently refurbished. I will definitely be choosing one of their hotels over any Hilton when I stay away and hope that the the standards of the other hotels in this range are consistent with those in Bloomsbury Street. The nearest tube station was Tottenham Court Road (5 mins walk) and there are a few restaurants and takeaways around the hotel. The hotel is a short walk to Oxford Street and Russell Square.

There were many windows, all of which opened easily and the room was light and airy, air conditioning was also an option. The decor was subtle and added to the quietness of the room.

I find the front-of-house reception always welcoming and helpful, without becoming overbearingly obsequious, while any query or request has without fail received the necessary attention. Rooms are spacious and well equipped (including air conditioning), with suitable sound-proofing to keep the traffic noise to a minimum. The hotel is ideally situated to allow walking access to the varied delights of Theatreland, Oxford Street, Covent Garden and Soho while the proximity (5 mins) of Tottenham Court Road station allows easy entry to the underground system.

On our arrival at the hotel our room wasn't quite ready and immediately tea and coffee appeared with compliments of the hotel. I absolutely loved the little cast iron teapot. The staff were very helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Our room, an upgrade, was very spacious and extremely comfortable and our walk in rain shower was huge. Bliss! As someone with MS, space to move around easily is essential and I later realised we'd been moved to a much nicer room so I owe the reception manager (I think that's his title) a huge thank you. I appreciate all the extra effort he went to. The breakfast was exceptionally good and the breakfast manager (I think that was his title) who had served us the tea and coffee the previous day had obviously remembered our conversation because porridge appeared almost without me having to order it. Scrumptious. The cooked buffet was hot, very fresh and had an excellent selection. My husband said it was the best breakfast he'd had in a hotel in a long time. The cold buffet was just as good and there was plenty of different freshly cut fruit to choose from. An excellent start to the day. The hotel is walking distance, even for someone with MS, to Covent Garden and the West End so the location is brilliant and there is lots to see and do nearby. If you can't walk that far there are lots of bikes that could be hired and take you wherever you need to go and they're more fun than a taxi. The British Museum is just across the road and the garden is a really nice place to sit and people watch or just experience the beautiful building and artefacts. It was the perfect weekend and we are already planning another theatre trip. We will definitely go back to the hotel again and hopefully very soon.
