Both times we stayed in a 2 queen bed suite that had a living area, full kitchen, two separate bedrooms and each bedroom had its own bathroom - all for significantly less than other Toronto airport hotels. This type of suite had a gas fireplace. Each room had a tv, approx 24\", so three TVs in total. They also had a full kitchen with a stove, microwave, fridge (with ice maker), dishwasher, toaster and coffee maker, and the kitchen was suited with dinnerware, cutlery, can openers, measuring cups, cutting board and linen. A small four seat dining table accompanied the kitchen area. The living area had a long chaise/loveseat that could be used as a pull-out with linen in the suite. The beds were firm but comfortable with your choice of five pillows in each bed - 3 feather, 2 foam (and comfy!). To add to the suite, the hotel provides complimentary toiletries, which is handy when you're missing a toothbrush or razor in the wee hours of the morning before or after a flight. The hotel also offers a grocery shopping service for a VERY small fee, and they will have your items in the suite later in the afternoon. The complimentary breakfast is quite decent. Hot food included scrambled eggs, sausages, french toast, potato hash, and waffles. An assortment of cereals and other pastries are available along with all sorts of condiments (jellies, peanut butter, cream cheese, etc.) The breakfast can also be taken to go up to your room if you choose. Quite enjoyable! Never been to the onsite pool yet or attended any of the weeknight social activities they have in their main lounge and dining area during the week. For the price of the room for three to five people, we found this to be an absolutely wonderful stay when coming to and from the airport. It's mere minutes by car to the airport and they also participate in the Park n' Fly programs. The only drawback that I found - make sure you're up to get breakfast before 8:30 a.m. otherwise the dining room is full of parents and kids.

Ambience works to make it seem more than just a hotel room for extended stay(which I think is the whole idea behind this concept!) We had a two bedroom suite with a living room and kitchen area. Really liked the working fireplace (gas)in the living room. Nice to sit and have a drink after a day at work. Each bedroom was self-contained with its own bathroom and tv so you could get away from your co-worker if desired. Kitchen was fully equipped but we rarely used it except for the fridge and micro wave. We left a list of grocery items with the front desk and it appeared the same day. The cost of items appeared on room bill. There was no extra charge for shopping. The free breakfast at first seemed great! But as the days wore on seemed repetitive and industrial. NO ONE, I REPEAT, NO ONE ate the turkey bacon. This stuff was GOD AWFUL! As I sat and watched a busy breakfast room for 8 days people stayed away from the turkey bacon. Oh my kingdom for real bacon......One day I was all excited, looked like a version of eggs florentine,,,,I even had it out of the chaffing dish, practically on my plate...and then I saw it , hiding under the eggs and spinache...turkey bacon!

The location on the #58 Malton bus line was an added bonus, as I could use it to go downtown. This time, Pat stayed home in Indianapolis to tend to the pets, so it was just Linda and Pete accompanying me on this trip to Canada. On our first night, we were astonished that we were getting a complimentary dinner as well as the standard continental breakfasts. So we put away the take-out dinner we ordered from Swiss Chalet in London and, instead, settled down to a dinner of pierogies, three-bean salad, regular salad, some fiery coleslaw, and two kinds of pie. During our stay, Linda had to have prosthetic breast cancer surgery, which was done by visiting practitioner Irene Healy, who maintained offices in Rochester, NY as well as Toronto. Linda also conducted a breast cancer support group meeting at our hotel room on the third evening of our stay in Toronto. Linda even befriended the RI's housekeeping staff, which is a great sign. The only hangup was that the indoor pool was not heated; and Linda, Pete and I could not swim very long. The hot tub more than made up for it, however. I managed to take in a Toronto Argonauts game as well as visit Eaton Centre and the Royal Ontario Museum plus ride the subway. I did, however, have to remind Pete about the Gardiner Expressway being closed for maintenance, as I had been listening to traffic reports on 680 AM. The fitness room was like the one at Mississauga, with free weights, treadmills and Nordic Track-type machines plus a TV to watch if you like and a water cooler. I used the fitness room twice during my stay. The continental breakfasts that were served at Toronto Airport were usually the same--sausages with scrambled eggs and home-style potatoes; four types of cereal (thankfully, none of them pre-sweetened); muffins; waffles, which you made yourself; Dannon's Silhouette yogurt (the brand marketed in Canada); skim or 2% milk; and four types of fruit juice. The first morning I ate breakfast, I had to leave the crowded dining room ASAP, because there was a police convention. On the morning of check-out, there was no fresh fruit--neither apples, bananas or even oranges. The front desk staff was very helpful with everything I would want to know about Toronto. They even exchanged my American currency so I wouldn't have to do it at the local bank, where I would be given unfavorable rates. I even got to use the Internet terminals located on the first floor to track down my G-Mail, which was helpful in communicating with family back in Indiana. Apart from some minor inconveniences such as the ones mentioned, I had a very enjoyable stay and had some pleasant nights of sleeping, though on one evening (after I went to the game), I was so overwhelmed with excitement that I couldn't sleep. I don't blame that on the hotel. The fireplace and the painting added a nice touch to the hotel room.

As per previous reviews, management of this hotel has grown indifferent, cheap, and lazy. A myriad of small unpleast issues could have been shrugged off but not the final insult. First, an unpublished and unadvertised $8 per night charge to park in their badly lit unsupervised lot. I can understand charging for parking at a prime location, or for extended use of the lot if you are flying out, but this was just a straight up 'extra cash' grab. Second, the staff paid NO attention to detail. The rooms were cleaned, but if you expected food at breakfast, good luck. The hotel was busy and massively understaffed so that the small vessels at the breakfast buffet emptied rapidly and took forever to get refilled. 3 out of 4 morhings I had to wait around to get coffee, wait around for the juice to be refilled, wait for more bread, etc.... A 15 minute breakfast dragged into an hour waiting for food to be brought out. ONE poor server trying to take care of the entire dining area; it wasn't her fault, but trying to cater to the number of guests they had with 1/3 of the required staff is a clear sign of bad, cheap management. The pool never had towels. I mean never. We would ask at the desk, be told 'someone is coming', and a full hour later, still no towels. My teenager asked for the code to get on to their lobby PC's. They were told condescendingly that the terminals are \"not for children to use\". Nice attitude, great customer service for a 'family' hotel. The last straw was an issue with our furniture. The night of our last stay we picked up the coffee table to move it away from the fold out sofa bed so our son could go to bed. One corner of the table top came away in my hand. The table top was a heavy marble and the table top separated right along the vein of the marble. All of this was explained to the hotel, but they still charged my credit card for 'breaking' the furniture. Speaking to me and scolding me like a small child for this was icing on the cake.

All indications it was the room that was the cause of this. I advised reception and they put me into another room. Then another issue happened. With my suitcase in the room, my laptop on, I left the room. I could not get back in. The electronic lock didn't unlock. Another key and master key could not open the door, the electronic lock had failed. Now they could have called a locksmith straight away. But instead they decided to save a few bucks. I had to wait several hours for the manager to drive to the hotel. He had to drive to another hotel to pick up a metal bar that slid under the door to open it from the other side. This exercise itself took about 30 minutes. Now they did offer another room in the interim, but what good was that when all my belongings were locked in a room I couldn't get into any I had a long overseas trip the following day.

We've learned the hard way not to take chances with that drive, especially in the winter! Anyway, we didn't get in until about 9 pm and left the next morning at 6:40, so I don't have a lot to review here. I can tell you the following: -the rooms are clean and spacious. We've stayed at the Residence Inn in downtown Toronto as well, and the room layout was very similar. It would probably be ideal for a longer stay, since you have the kitchenette and \"living room\" area separate from the bedroom. -Breakfast on the weekend doesn't start until 7, so we asked if there was a way to get some breakfast to go. They don't offer anything (I know many hotels do \"to go bags\" with muffins, yogurt, fruit--something like that), but we were told that they started setting up breakfast early so we could just take whatever was out. Unfortunately, there wasn't much out yet at 6:30, so we just had coffee and ate some food that I'd packed just in case. -The airport shuttle seems to run on a set schedule, every 30 minutes (10 and 40 past the hour). It does stop at one other hotel on the way to the airport. I got nervous when we did that, because we were already a few minutes later than I wanted to be, but it was a quick stop and then we were at the airport right away. Terminal 3 was the shuttle's first stop for us, so if you're going to Terminal 1 you may want to allow a few more minutes. -We were able to park our car right beside the hotel, so I felt it was really safe. And when we came home, our car was just fine--I know that can be a worry with some airport park & fly hotel deals, so I thought it was worth mentioning. -To get the shuttle back from the airport, apparently you are supposed to use a courtesy phone in the terminal. In terminal 3 we never saw these phones (we heard later that they were at the opposite end of the terminal from the shuttle pick up point. Obviously that's not the hotel's fault, it's the airport's!), so when we got out to the pick up point we say the sign that said call for pick up and just called from our cell. The operator didn't give us any specific information about how long it would be, but said they were sending the shuttle for us, so we assumed it wouldn't be long. It was about 30 minutes before the shuttle turned up! However, it turned out that the driver had been told by the dispatcher that we were at terminal 1, so he had been sitting there for a LONG time before he called back in and they gave him the correct information. I felt bad for him, and even worse for the other couple who had apparently been stuck sitting on the shuttle all that time while he waited for us. I'm guessing this is an aberration and that normally pick-up would be pretty prompt. All in all, we would probably stay here again on a future early morning flight.

Also, the sheets they provide for it are see through. -the blankets. Before we realized that we'd need a blanket to pad the bed, we thought we'd need it to sleep.

We ate at Ton'y Roma's and with the tip spent $80. There are no cheap places to eat. The drive to downtown is about 18 miles if going via the 401 then down Yonge Street. A better choice might be the TTC from the Yorkdale Mall. Cost is $2.25 per person each way if you buy at least 10 tokens at the mall entrance to the train. Parking at the mall is free and safe.

The only negative was one of the two TV remotes was bad but they had it fixed within 1 hour. Only overall disappointment is the lack of live music/dancing at the airport hotels, a lost art perhaps?

Upon our arrival we told the front desk that we would be leaving 2 days earlier than originally booked and were then told that our room rate would increase an add'l $20/night-much to our surprise -we thought we had a confirmed rate of $209 per night so be aware of this rate fluctuation. Our 2 bedroom suite was spotless and in very good condition and although we requested a high floor we ended up on the 3rd floor-there was too much traffic noise so upon our request we were moved to the 5th floor-there was no availability on the higher floors. There is one community computer for use by hotel patrons but a good majority of the time it is occupied by children...understandable. The pool is okay and the jacuzzi warm but in need of stronger jets to get that therapuetic affect. The breakfast buffet was great-many hot items to choose from and always well stocked no matter what time of the morning it was. The staff that worked the buffet were wonderful-pleasant and helpful. We did not try the evening reception so I cannot comment on that. Beside the disappointment of the rate fluctuation I have two other issues with the hotel. The first being that it is in the middle of a business park and there is NOTHING around for entertainment save for the adults -only place that I'm sure many businessmen frequent while there. The hotel itself did not even have pay TV so my children couldn't even watch a pay movie if they had wanted to. The nearest movie theater was a 25 minute drive through some not so nice sections of Toronto. So we basically felt like we had to stay out really late as there was nothing to do once we got back except for swimming or trying to use the mini basketball court that was always in use. My other issue is that restaurant selection in the area ,was very poor...there is a Montanas, Marketplace, Boston Pizza, Tony Romas and Outback by the business park and everything else was fast food....it was amazing-we ended up at Boston Pizza twice and on the second night my 13 yr old commented that her Ravioli bake tasted just like canned Chef Boyardee and she was completely correct!
