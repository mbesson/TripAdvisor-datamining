I told the man at the desk what had happened and he told me he had a single room with private bathroom available for 60 euros a night. Not a terrible price. I told him that I was in Venice for 4 nights but would only take the room for one until I figured things out. When I got into the room (which was difficult to find), I found it to be rather cramped and dingy. Not dirty, just old and run down. It smelled funny both in the room and in the hallways. It was quite noisy as well; I could here the people in the room next to mine as well as anyone who was walking past my room in the hallway. I really didn't want to stay there for more than one night so I headed to the tourist agency by the train station (as the hotel is about 2 minutes walk to the station) and they found me a room fairly close(more expensive, but it was well worth it). As for sleeping...the mattress and pillow were both extremely uncomfortable. I think I slept maybe 3 out of the 8 hours I was in bed. The bathroom looked quite dirty so I didn't even bother showering in the morning (thank goodness I didn't need to), just washed my face in the sink in the bedroom. I quickly packed my suitcases and headed to check out. The man at the desk looked quite confused as to why I was leaving and I told him why. I guess he must have misunderstood me and had set the room aside for the four nights I was going to be in Venice. He the proceeded to give me a lecture about how rude and inconsiderate I was. If you ask me, that is terrible customer service and no matter what, you should NEVER tell your customers that they are rude, especially after they apologize for the misunderstanding. On top of that, I paid cash (5 euros) for the city tax (1,50 euros) and he refused to give me change. After reading some of the reviews on here I'm surprised they're still in business. Some said they offered a free breakfast but that was never mentioned to me at all.

This was the first hotel that disappointed us on all levels. We are not fussy people and do not travel first class, but I think a 3 star rating is not correct on this hotel. Lobby is extremely depressing to enter. Furniture lined up in rows, no tables, old cracked mirrors. This was our first impression and it went downhill from there. Check in clerk was not very friendly and when son inquired about internet access (even though it says it is available in hotel), clerk pointed and said \"Down the road 100 meters\". The route to room got us ready for the twisting, turning alleys in Venice. We thought we would need a map to find our way there. No elevator service, but there was a bagboy who carried everything (God Bless him). Room was depressing also. Loose tiles on floors, drab colors, room needed to be painted. We had a family room with 1 double, 2 twins. Double mattress was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in. It was mattress on metal spring frame (no boxspring). I thought I was back at summer camp. There was AC in room, but controls were limited, so we either froze or had to shut it off. The only good thing about the room was a recently updated bathroom. However on first day, when we went to take showers at 8:00-there was no hot water. Breakfast was really poor-stale rolls and croissants, liquid yogurt, coffee machine dispensed 6 different things and coffee was undrinkable.

The hotel staff was the friendliest and most pleasant of all the ones we encountered on our 10 day trip, during which we stayed at The Cadogan in London, the Hotel Majestic Roma in Rome, the Hotel Bernini Bristol also in Rome and the Plaza Lucchesi in Florence. Although those were all higher end hotels, the service and attitude of the staff at those establishments could not hold a candle to the staff at the Universo Nord Hotel. It was the only time we felt so genuinely welcome and that the staff was not miserable, but seemed to thoroughly enjoy their jobs! Other positive aspects of the hotel are that it is a stone's throw from the train station and they charged us 98 euros for a triple (since that is the price we booked at the other hotel). I think their usual rate is slightly higher. Beyond that, the hotel was a bit depressing. We had to walk up a maze of stairs to find our room, which was threadbare. The room was made up of a double bed, a separate twin bed, a tiny tv that didn't work, a closet and the equally tiny bathroom. The shower (no bath) barely fit my boyfriend and it had this weird design where to get in, you had to slide two doors that met at the corner of the shower away from each other. I don't know if that makes sense, but if you ever see it, you'll know what I mean. Don't go for the breakfast unless you're desperate. There was a really scary coffee machine, and equally scary juice machine, cured meats and cheeses that looked crusty around the edges and some stale bread.

Having someone yelling at you every night after you had a great day at Venice is not nice. If the bitter guy in the night shift is gone you will enjoy this hotel.", "Date": "June 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connaught", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel\u201d", "Author": "funpeopleConnaught", "ReviewID": "UR7641747", "Content": "Having read other reviews, we were a little apprehensive entering this hotel.

Therefore, I didn't mind that the hotel gave me the usual 'pay up front' demand and the usual 'credit machine broken, only cash accepted' excuse. I also didn't mind that on check-in, the room wasn't made up. Cigarette butts on the floor, dirty sink, towels and sheets. Went out for sightseeing and returned to find it cleaned. Also, didn't mind that there are no elevators in this 'hotel'. What bothered me was that the hotel locks its gates after midnight without volunteering that information on check in. I came back at half past 12 on the first night to find it locked and no one was manning the lobby. The staff who eventually let me in was rude and never apologised. The following day, another hotel staff explained that because they are a 3 star hotel, they lock the front gate at night. Checked with other 3 and 2 star hotels in the vicinity and was told that 'they don't lock the doors until all guests have returned'. Not the case with Hotel Universo. So make sure you adhere to the curfew. This is more of a high priced pensione or hostel than a hotel. Oh, and that hotel staff who begrudingly opened the gate for me that night, on the day of my check-out, he told me rudely, ganging up with his colleague that it was my fault I got locked out and that it was not a big deal because I didn't have to wait more than 5 - 10 minutes.

My companion and I took the bus from the airport into Venice, and the ride was only ~25 mins (3 euro each person). We stayed in Venice for one night and had to head out the next morning by train, so this hotel location was perfect because it was only a block away from the train station (St. Lucia), and not too far from the bus station (Piazzale Roma). The staff was nice, and they let us leave our luggage with with them since we arrived before check-in time. The room itself was clean but small. We had a room facing the back alley so no view for us. However, we didn't mind since we only spent minimal amount of time in the room. We didn't have a lot of time in the morning, so didn't get to try the breakfast. One complain about the room was that the the water pipe must be near the bed, and we can hear upstairs flushing the toilet.... Overall, this is an ok hotel choice if you are on a budget and need easy access to transportation. However, if you are looking for something more unique and wouldn't mind spending a few more bucks then I would suggest you look somewhere else.", "Date": "December 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco Bay Area, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat location; other than that, so-so hotel\u201d", "Author": "JessBeth", "ReviewID": "UR5891766", "Content": "The Universo Nord Hotel could not be in a more convenient (or kitschy/touristy) location--just about a block from the train station.

I know Venice is expensive, but we paid about $200 for a spare room with no amenities or creature comforts, and everything seemed a little bit shabby. The selling point of the room was that it was at the back of the hotel, off the main (and very noisy) street.

When we arrived, the hotel did not have our reservations (although we had pre-paid two months prior). The individual immediately got defensive and insulted both myself and my wife calling us \"stupid Americans\" despite us being \"stupid Canadians\" - but I digress. I felt we were more than reasonable people during the entire affair, in both our attitudes and position, with the staff. We stood our ground and a room was \"granted\" to us - we were continuously verbally abused during the check-in process by the particular individual. As in many three star hotels in Italy, the room was certainly not perfectly clean, with mildew all over the bathroom, stained carpets, etc. However, at the end of the day, it wasn't, in relative terms, a horrible hotel to come back to at the end of the night and things could have been a lot worse. Other staff members were nice enough. The breakfast was half-decent for a Venice hotel, with some deli meats and cheeses, but overall, fairly poor. Overall, Venice is a city that isn't too interested in making sure you have a good time.
