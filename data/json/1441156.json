The rooms here are so small that those with luggage will find that they need to put the suitcases into the bathroom first to be able to close the hotel room door upon arrival and departure. Then once the door is closed, you'll have the swing space to put the case into the room. The window ledge is the only option where to place a case - there is not even enough floor space to open an average size suitcase. The window saved me from feeling claustrophobic. The most notable thing about the room is that the toilet is in the shower stall. Showering even with the showerhead pointed to the left wall will wet the toilet paper (and seat!) on the right wall. The hotel is clean, offers few amenities and their bar was not open very late so no food was available. There is a hairdryer in the room and two small bottles of water provided. The staff is not service oriented or helpful. I asked for some ice and the front desk team was able to provide it to me if I could bring down a cup from my room. I wondered why they couldn't just provide me a glass instead of forcing me to return to my room to get a glass to fill with the ice. Later, I asked for restaurant recommendations and the many front desk staff just said \"we're not going to help these local restaurant owners\", which was unhelpful for me. The location is a little far from the downtown but close to some outdoor food stands. If lighting is your need, this is the right place to stay; otherwise it is not an interesting neighbourhood. All the shops on this street seem to sell lamps. I traveled solo but the bed was huge so I doubt other rooms given to couples are any bigger. Based on the size of the room and the location/ dull neighbourhood, I'd recommend staying elsewhere.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Bar Hospitality\u201d", "Author": "DemonTW", "ReviewID": "UR127052421", "Content": "There is a Bar/Cafe located in this hotel and the hospitality the staffs there are simply great.

As a family of 4 we needed to separate over two rooms on the same floor, sharing a queen bed in each room with a child each. Unfortunately they could only accommodate on a smoking floor to be able to keep both rooms together on the same level. Given the opportunity again I would have much preferred for us to be on separate floors to avoid the smoking floor. If you are not a smoker please bear in mind that the smoke was completely unbearable to the point where we had to run a towel along the base of the door and open the window to humid Singapore weather just to get rid of the smoke from the air, it was thick. The staff were quite helpful in reception and helped with directions, taxi wherever possible. Their English skills were quite good. Our room attendant was brilliant she was friendly, kept the rooms immaculate and also her service was exceptional. The hotel was approx. 15 minutes by bus to the CBD and after catching the bus a couple of times we realized that the taxi was so inexpensive. I think it only cost about $8 - $10 Singapore each way. Price was very fair for the accommodation given the quality of the rooms and of course this is Singapore where accommodation is more on the expensive side. In fact it was great value for money. The size of the room was a bit claustrophobic but perfect because we were only there to sleep. The bathroom in one of the rooms was smaller and it did almost feel like you were showering over the toilet in a tiny bathroom cubicle, it seemed to be because of the layout of one of the corner rooms. It was quiet enough. There were also plenty of suitable places to eat with a couple of food courts within close proximity on the other side of the road, plenty of restaurants and also some Hawkers markets nearby as well. There were no restaurant or breakfast facilities at the hotel when we stayed there in May 2011. The area is reasonably busy but we found it quiet and slept well. There was no fridge in the room. I would definitely recommend this accommodation for business travelers who are not concerned about being just out of the CBD area. I would also recommend for families with older children who would not be spending much time at the hotel and who don't need to be entertained or need lots of room because there is only enough room to just walk around the bed and into the toilet. The rooms are extremely compact. I would definitely stay here again with no hesitation BUT on a non smoking floor.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Batemans Bay, Australia", "Title": "\u201cTiny rooms\u201d", "Author": "elgor", "ReviewID": "UR126317456", "Content": "My friends and I were very disappointed with this hotel.

In a city where a name-brand hotel is upwards of $300, this place is a bargain. Your room will be so small that there isn't room enough for two, even in the \"queen\" room, which, by Western standards is just slightly wider than a cot with just inches to spare on either side. That's about the only downside. There's an in-room safe, electric kettle, a/c, the hot water works, and there's an elevator. Your bath is pint-sized and when you shower, so does the entire little bath, including the toilet. Some people are grossed out by that but it's pretty common in Asia. There's a nice little lobby. The hotel is well-situated along a busy road but it's still quiet. The road outside has a million little cheap (really cheap) Chinese eateries and just up the road (walking distance) are a bunch of chain and fast-food joints along with a mall with a decent supermarket in the basement. That, and if you're in need of lighting or bathroom fixtures, you'll find it just steps away! Virtually out the door is a bus stop that takes you to various places including the MRT (metro) station at Novena. There are also a bunch of other cheap hotels along the road... and when I say cheap, we're talking Singapore cheap. That $50 Ibis you find around Europe is nearly $200 US here. The staff is pretty nice too. Below this price, you have a few other decent hotels around but there are precious few of them of this quality. Your next-best choice, I guess, would be one of the hostels but I was never very good at sharing things with strangers, much less a bedroom with bunks in it.

We got to Singapore by train from Kuala Lumpur at 6.00 am and around that time we also got into hotel, in spite of checking in policy which I think allows customers to check in, in afternoon time, we got our room strait away in the early morning at our arrival as we been very tired after the all night journey. That was surprising, because if you been to other Asian countries you will notice that Singapore its quite strict to its rules (no haggling with taxi, no transport of cigarettes into Singapore or products with price tags from other countries, otherwise you will be in trouble) I found room a bit funny by being so compact, however we read before that rooms at Singapore are very tiny, so we knew what to expect, room wasn't that small, but obviously having bathroom (shower) inside the room, and the toilet inside the shower cabin behind glass wall, makes impression of something different. Rooms are very clean, nice and tidy, room design its quite modern and updated. However its not like we spent any time chilling in the room as being in the city made us go out a lot and spend time outside. Location its fine, but not the best, we travelled by sub everywhere in the city, closes sub station was 15 min walk then catching a bus, passing two bus stops, and there you have sub station, or you can catch a taxi from the hotel strait to the tube, where you can start your journey. We found taxi very expensive comparable to UK prices or even more, so sub was great option, pick up the sub map from the reception at the hotel plus few good tips on location. Opposite hotel its mall and MCd and Kfc, that was our breakfast spot to start a day, mall has also supermarket downstairs and cash point inside this supermarket.

My only quibble was the aircon which seemed to be too cold even when set to 27 degrees so I ended up having it off most of the time. I think the price is fair (compared to other hotels in singapore). I was kept waiting for quite some time at check-in but the receptionist was very apologetic and polite. The free wifi works well most of the time. There is also a laundry service but I didn't use it.

It has free wifi connection inside the room assigned to you upon check-in.

The toiletries are complete like shower gel, shampoo, disposable toothbrush and toothpaste, disposable shaver and cream, shower cap, bath and hand towels even slippers. Overall, I was impressed with the room accommodation and overall hotel-amenities. The elevator is accessible only by guests of the hotel as you cannot press your floor without tapping your room access-card. By the way, the room access is via tapping as well.

A few meters away is the Shaw Plaza which has the Fair Price grocery in the basement, McDonalds, KFC, local atms and other shops even decent cinemas on the upper level. The only downside I can think of is that its not so near Novena MRT. For me, its still far walk which takes about more than 20minutes down Thomson Road then another down the road along Balestier. I usually take taxi to/from Novena Square and Aqueen Hotel (taxi fare averages to SGD5.00). Also they do not have business facilities like if you want to print your airline boarding pass. Balestier Road is a pleasant residential/commercial area, I have been there last March and stayed for about 2 weeks in a not so distant hotel down Thomson Road.

The air con (which only works when the keycard is inserted in the slot) was incredibly weak so the first night I couldn' t sleep until 3,00 am; the next day I asked the reception if they could give me a second key to leave in the slot so that the air con could start cooling the room while I was away; they kindly agreed, so the next night I was alright. Unfortunately there is a huge building site opposite to the room (they just started digging the foundations now, so I don' t think they' ll finish before the end of 2011 at least); again the reception seemed to agree to give me a room facing the other side, which at the end I didn' t ask because the construction work started at 8,00 am, a pretty reasonable time for me.

This is not the place to stay on a vacation. Probably good for a nights stay on a business visit. 1. Boring Location: Nothing to see in the surrounding locality except a Buddhist temple. The nearest MRT station is at Novena for which you have to take a Bus. But thanks to the excellent public transportation system of Singapore, this should not be a problem. 2. Tiny Room: Rooms are Tiny!! Bathroom is very Tiny. (U can see in the pic attached). Its triangular shaped and about 6 ft width, probably not enough place for a fat person to move about!!! The rooms had facilities like TV, hair dryer, soaps and other accessories. It was clean enough and the bed was comfortable. 3. Uncourteous Staff: Staff can probably take a lesson or two on hospitality. We encountered rigid staff. Our flight arrived in morning, but we were made to sit in lobby till 2 pm. This despite informing them in advance about our early arrival. We had extended the check out till 6 pm by paying half day price. Since my wife was feeling tired and needed rest, I asked if we could check out one hour later. They said we have to pay the entire days fee in that case. During check out the reception staff was inattentive and after moving out of the hotel, she summoned us back again to take our signature. Which she could and should have taken when we were waiting in front of her!!! 4. Attached cafeteria: There is a small Cafe attached which provides breakfast for about 10 SGD. Besides this cafe, the hotel has no other amenities. 5. Price: was 88 SGD/ night, which was very affordable. But retrospectively, I feel it would have been better to shell out a little more and take a 3 star hotel instead. This hotel had great previous reviews and thus we had opted it. Unfortunately it did not stand upto our expectation. I do not recommend this for people going with families or those going on a vacation.

Read about other hotels in Singapore on TripAdvisor and the ones I liked within my budget were built long back and were mostly damp because of the tropical climate. This hotel was a welcome change being newly built. The location is not central, but made perfect sense for us as we arrived in Singapore in the evening and had to go for the night safari which is closer to the hotel on the MRT line till Ang Moo Kee from where there are buses to the safari. About the room: The room was tiny but well packaged with a queen sized bed occupying about 60% of the floor area. There was a shower-room right next to the bed along with a wash basin. LCD TV on the wall allowed space for a corner table - no place for chair in the room though. Also there was a cabinet for clothes along with an electronic safe. The place between the corner table and the cabinet, along the large window, presented with a flat place to sit or act as a table. About the hotel & staff: The hotel is also quite small with no dining facilities \u2013 only a small caf\u00e9, which we didn\u2019t use as we didn\u2019t have much time on hand. The staff on reception was courteous and check-in was quick. I had already made reservation over the email \u2013 they just charged my card at check-in. My sister called from India when we were out and a computer print-out message was slipped under the door of our room \u2013 I found it professional. The staff at the reception was helpful in telling us about the bus number that\u2019ll take us to our destination and they also told us where nearby eating joints were. Balestier road is a sort of eating hot-spot with a couple of high-end restaurants and a food court within walking distance to the hotel. This is also one of the reasons why I chose this hotel \u2013 as staff of new hotel are more courteous and amenable to the needs of the customer. The staff tripped on the morning of check-out, when they gave the wake-up call half an hour late and we had to catch an early morning flight. The person at reception was sorry and apologetic. Even though we had already woken up before the call, but nonetheless a slip-up it was. At S$88 a night, this was a steal. Mind you this is an introductory offer \u2013 the regular rate is in the range of S$200 a night.
