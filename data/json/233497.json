We just came and went and it seemed they hardly noticed. But the room was comfortable enough and it was quiet. No complaints, just nothing that was memorable. If the price is in your budget and the location is about where you want to be, you could do a lot worse.", "Date": "Oct 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR420253134", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "MaxOregon"}, {"Content": "Bellisima Villa Betania       Terrace - great for breakfast", "Date": "Sep 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR264334023", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Wandering_Scientist"}, {"Content": "Good service, large rooms with great breakfast included We were pleased with this quiet location outside of Florence. It is a long walk so we preferred to take the public bus that runs in front of the hotel and goes directly into the city. We also took a cab home one night from the city. We had a rental car which we kept parked in the hotel driveway. The rooms were very spacious and clean. The bathrooms were also large. The breakfast was sufficient and lovely on the outside patio. The staff was very attentive and helpful. Do not stay here if you like to stay at big hotel chains.

The floor in our room shook when you walked on it. The bed was so uncomfortably we had to put the mattress on the floor to get any sleep, and the mirror in the bathroom doubled as a window!! The remaining furniture in the room looked like it had been rescued from a skip. All in all a complete rip off. I have never before paid so much money for such a bad room. The cost should be at least half what it is before anyone considers going there.", "Date": "Jul 1, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR880900771", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "a lifetime of memories A PERFECT place to stay, Villa Betania had all the ammenities of a hotel without the feeling of anonymity. What I am trying to say is that as soon as we pulled up the crunchy gravel drive, parked the car and walked up the herb lined front walkway, I felt like I was at home or at least an heiress to a wonderful estate. We were greeted by handsome dogs and the friendliest, most welcoming man you could imagine. The place was warmly decorated for the holidays and the more permanent artwork, furniture and fixtures further instilled in us the feeling of Italian supremecy in the field of interior design! The foyer was home-y and beautiful at the same time. (by no means stuffy or impersonal) Our room was spacious (and we slept three to a room!) as was the bathroom which we have found to be quite unusual in our travels around Italy. Every morning we rose, got dressed for the day, and went (dare I say sashayed) downstairs to the sunny kitchen to enjoy yummy treats from a beautifully laid buffet. We sat at small round cafe tables and enjoyed the garden view out a set of tall French doors. Every night, we would drag our bodies home from a full day of sightseeing,shopping and eating the most amazing meals. We were always welcomed at the door. Then we climbed the stairs and opened our door to see perfectly made beds and lots of fluffy white towels...I will ALWAYS recommend this wonderful place to stay for absolutely anyone who wants to enjoy an Italian dream", "Date": "Jan 1, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR442477251", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Never will forget the rooster!

The young owners are nice and do their best to help you with whatever need. The Villa itself is an old Tuscan residence, and it is very pleasant to sit in the garden for a coffee or an aperitif.
