We typically opt for nightlife and nicer accommodations - one of our faves is Hotel Solamar. That said, I researched a number of hotels near qualcomm and found this one to have the most favorable outlook considering I wanted to stay in a semi-decent place that wasn't filthy but also wasn't pricey. Long story short: it was a TERRIFIC CHOICE! Check-in was smooth and the reception was efficient. Parking was near the room and we didnt mind climbing the stairs to our 3rd floor room (not sure if they had an elevator). The room is TINY but was very clean. The stacked appliances (microwave, fridge, safe) were convenient, although we did not use them. The bathroom was clean. The only negative was the archaic tube/box TV in the room that evoked a motel-ish feel to the room. Before game time we walked to the trolley station (3 min walk) from the hotel room, bought our all-day pass ($5/person) and waited (5 min) for the next trolley. After a 5 min ride and 3 min walk down the walkway we were at qualcomm! Very convenient and very efficient, much to our happiness. The return trip was even more convenient b/c almost everyone was headed in the opposite direction so our wait time for the trolley was insignificant compared to those headed back to Seau's/other direction- that was a great surprise and really sealed the deal relative to our acknowledgment that this was the best way for an out of towner to avoid long waits/crowds and attend a game at qualcomm. For that purpose, I highly recommend! Some reviews mentioned that the rooms were noisy b/c of the adjacent freeway, but we asked for a quieter room and got one opposite the freeway. Must do. I used the free PC/internet in the lobby which I have no complaints about. The free breakfast is a nice touch but I say skip it and go to the best breakfast spot around - The Mission (North Park) which you can get to in less than 20 mins. In fact, we were planning to go the location near the Gaslamp District but to our surprise and delight, found that they had a location so close to us.

This was our first visit to the Qualcomm Stadium area (football Sunday - January 3rd) and it was so convenient! Yards away from the trolley station, and a small walk up the hill. We drove from Los Angeles, arriving in the area at approximately 11:30AM. The hotel was just off the freeway. Clean, parking lot, ample spaces. Nice lobby with a small concession fridge that sold juices, snacks, etc. The clerk secured our room for an early check-in and told us to enjoy the game \u2013 that was it! Totally hassle free and two minutes later we walked five minutes up the hill to the trolley station and purchased an all day pass for $5.00. Parking in the trolley lot looked like it was an absolute nightmare, but we didn\u2019t have to worry about it! We had already parked at the hotel in front of our room. Literally 15 minutes later we were exiting the station and walked right IN to Qualcomm stadium. We\u2019ve never had an easier trip! Back at the hotel\u2026 our bed was so comfortable and the room was immaculate. No weird stains, odors or issues whatsoever. Even the spacious bathroom & shower had an adjustable head for me to wash off the shame of the Redskins\u2019 loss to the Chargers. (Boo!) Nice complementary amenities, phone in the bathroom and crisp, bright vanity lighting. There was a fridge, microwave, coffeemaker \u2013 all pristine. Closet space was ample, and we even had a sitting area with table and two chairs. We seriously contemplated staying an additional night because the room was so awesome. Before booking, I initially saw other comments regarding the surroundings of the hotel. True \u2013 the neighborhood seemed like an industrial setting, but I mean, we weren\u2019t sleeping outside. It is safe and QUIET- there are gas stations, stores and restaurants including a Chili\u2019s within view of the hotel lot, and after partying so much at the game (complete with $9.00 beers!!! Yikes!!!), we just wanted a place to crash and burn afterwards. There was also a HUGE dining room and continental breakfast that I actually didn\u2019t notice until checking out \u2013 so sorry I missed it!

The previous reviews were written when this property was a \u2018Super 8\u2019 \u2013 Now it is a Ramada. Apparently the new owner has decided to invest in the property \u2013 and it shows. I stayed there for several days and I noticed that the whole exterior has been repainted, the pool area and the breakfast area look renovated. They told me there are new beds and bathrooms as well. While I was there, there were paving crews doing some minor asphalt repairs to what looked like a redone parking lot. The staff was helpful and friendly. I would say they are aiming for 2.5 star status\u2026 The complementary breakfast had small cheese omelets occasionally in addition to the regular toast, make-your-own waffles, cereal and yogurt. Heading others\u2019 advice, I requested to stay on the top (3rd) floor and found it very quiet. My room had a decent-sized fridge and microwave. They have a mini-mart in the lobby that sells some frozen dinners, drinks, snacks, etc. Free Wi-Fi is available \u2013 it is very hit or miss though. I couldn\u2019t get reception in my room, but it seemed to work very well by the pool. There is also a PC in the lobby area for guests to use\u2026 it is using the same wireless network though.. so it can be hit or miss as well. Cons \u2013 the comments made about the location still apply of course. There is lots of highway noise if you are facing the highway, and the view from the rear of the building isn\u2019t picture postcard material. I found being close to the highway on/off ramp a bonus though. The only windows in each unit face the corridor, so if you leave the curtains open, everyone walking by can see in. Also, there is a surprise $1 per day additional charge at check-in for the room safe that is not included in your quoted price. Area: There is a Starbucks very close to the Ramada for your morning coffee (I don\u2019t recommend the coffee they offer at breakfast). There are lots of restaurants on Mission Gorge Road as well as a Vons grocery store. A 5 minute drive down Mission Gorge Road takes you to Mission Trails park \u2013 a large city park that makes you think you are in the mountains.. worth checking out. Conclusion: For a clean, decent 2/2.5 * room at a great price (I got mine through Expedia) at a hotel with good staff that is obviously is trying hard, I say go for the Ramada Qualcomm.", "Date": "March 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles", "Title": "\u201cI highly recommend this hotel!\u201d", "Author": "steve1616", "ReviewID": "UR19362673", "Content": "My family and I decided to spend a few days down in San Diego.

Giving them the benefit of the doubt, it may have been a stayover in which the beds were made but not changed and then only one bed was unmade when the last people checked out and only the one bed may have gotten cleaned by the maid on the day of checkout.

I requested a n/s room and they put us next to 2 rooms that were under construction and our room stunk of mold and smoke and was dusty from the construction. So they moved us to the end of the hallway; which we did not notice the big plastic tarp hanging at the end (it was dark when we arrived). The room was ok, but very drafty. I woke up to being cold, the bed was hard, hearing the plastic flapping in the wind, and the people shouting across the way. (I literally came home with a tremendous earache and had to go the doctor for an inner ear infection.) We complained to management when we checked out and they took a whole $20.00 off per night. (We stayed for 2 nights because there was something going on in town.) My boyfriend told them also that I was going home sick do the draftiness of the room (Oh, yea the heater forget it.) and all they could say was: are you sure she wasn't sick before.\" NO!!!

This is a no frills establishment, but my room was clean and quiet. I don't know if the quiet was due to the room not being on the side closest to the traffic, but you can probably offset any traffic noise by simply turning the fan on on the air conditioner and creating white noise. The parking area in the back seemed a little secluded and creepy, but even though my room was on that side of the motel I tried to park in the front parking lot where I felt my (new) car was more visible and safer. Forget the continental breakfast. I don't know...maybe there were more offerings earlier on than there were when I got there shortly after 9, but all that I found available were donuts, raisin bagels and cold cereal.
