Having had a bad experience at a similarly priced budget chain in Florida on this trip, I was slightly apprehensive on the drive over. I needn't have worried. Yes, this hotel is at the lower end of the market but has bought into the belief that this doesn't mean it has to be dark, dingy and dirty. It was absolutely immaculate. The lady on reception who checked us in could not have been more friendly. She went out of the way to make us feel comfortable, offered suggestions on places to eat and even gave us a call about 20 minutes after we checked in to make sure that everything was ok. GREAT customer service! The rooms are a decent size (but there were only 2 of us - it might be a bit of a squeeze with any more that that). The beds were comfortable - the only issue was the mattress protector. As other reviewers have mentioned, these appear to be plastic and when you move they make a noise. The hotel is right on the oceanfront, the pool being between the building and the beach so you have the best of both worlds. Free continental breakfast is a nice touch as is the free wifi in all rooms - something that you wouldn't necessarily expect at a chain like this. All in all, this is a great hotel from which to base yourself in Daytona. I look forward to returning the next time I make the trip over - hopefully the mattress issue will be resolved by then.", "Date": "August 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami", "Title": "\u201cOcean Front and Clean\u201d", "Author": "MiaInMiami", "ReviewID": "UR137591471", "Content": "I was very happy because the room was CLEAN hard to find for a budget hotel.

The room had been remodeled with new bedding and mostly new appliances. All the needed things are supplied. The mattresses are of the firm variety, so make sure you can sleep on a firm mattress. The pool and hot tub area have been completely remodeled and are very nice. They were kept clean on a daily basis. There were always plenty of chars and there are a couple of showers to clean off. They are saltwater treated, so you don't have the constant chlorine chemicals to deal with. They are limited on parking and the lot was almost always full. I never had to invent a parking spot, but saw a couple people who did. Although, I think there were people who had multiple vehicles per room. The pastry breakfast never really had much more than toast and ran out quickly if it did. This could use some serious improvement. Overall, I would go back because it had exactly what I needed.
