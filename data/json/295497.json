I don't like to complain all that much but usually when you are motivated to take the time to write a review online, it's because a place was great or not so good. This hotel and city gave me more of the latter feeling like it was all just a huge rip off to a tourist. I flew jn from Kuwait (I'm American working there for several years now) on a 3 day weekend short trip, to see the \"sites\" and experience the nightlife, picking this hotel because it was near Taskim Square and I read a few reviews that this area was loaded with disco's. OK so that was the plan, the airfare was only around 225 USD roundtrip so I figured I could afford it even if just for 2 1/2 days. First bad news was when I arrived, I flew into Sabiha airport (Jazeera air has great sale prices but I've now twice flown into smaller airports that are far away and you end up paying through the nose in taxi fare). The duty free place since I arrived at 22:00 and wanted some liqour (none in Kuwait), was the first rip off. They put the prices in Euro's and then rip you off on the exchange rate, by the time it was converted to US dollars on my credit card, two fifths of whiskey (one Chevas and one Johnny Red) came out to 120.00 USD on my credit card, not a great start. I think liqour stores are available in town so the duty free store was a mistake to do. Taxi ride to Taskim from Sabiha Airport, I read to make sure they use a meter Taxi, which I did. Cost for a 35 minute ride was 78.00 Turk Lira, then the driver said it was 90.00 Lira to pay for tolls, ok, that kind of hurt but what am I to do? Going back to the airport I was charged 58.00 lira for another meter taxi and no charge for the tolls, I tipped the secong guy but not the first feeling pretty ripped off, I never pay that much for taxi's anywhere I've traveled and I have seen a lot of this planet. Checkin into Vardar \"Palace\", the sign out front said something like your special place FYI, LOL! Anyway they had my reservation at the desk even though they never replyied to my emails to confirm the room like I asked. They questioned if I wanted a single or double room since I was by myself, I asked for a double so I would not get a closet to sleep in, happy I did that. Checked into a room on the second floor in the back, happy I got that as well. The front has no view and the traffic in the street is very very noisy. Room was clean and bed comfortable. I asked the front desk for an adapter plug so I could run my laptop, no luck on that. I figured that if I offered a tip I could get better service on the plug, the guy who worked at night after I said I'd give him 20 lira to find me a plug came up with a plug, imagine that! Now get this, he says its his personal plug for his cell phone and I could only use it for one hour! I asked him what time he got off and I got it extended till 8 am (its midnight when I got the stupid plug, no big freaking deal to find in the town during the day). So you get my drift that these people are kind of heartless and only out for a quick buck. Food inside this \"4 star\" rip off is another joke and you know how you can tolerate one bad thing (taxi), then two bad thigs (front desk idiot), but upon waking up for the \"breakfast\" it really set me off. They only served bread and cold cheap cheese and salami. I asked the staff for some cooked eggs (no meat , mind you just eggs as they had hard boiled eggs there) the manager said cooked eggs are only at the 5 star hotels! I loaded up a plate of cold cuts and cheese and left it on the table uneaten in front of all the other tourists there to show my displeasure, and walked out to McDonalds because I was hungry and didn't want any more Turkish surprises.They do serve cooked eggs at the Turkish McDonlads just not at the Vardar \"Palace\". Room service is available 24 hours 7 days a week, just drinks though no food, no drink list either so don't even go there or your really asking to be raped. I restocked my mini fridge with beers at the many stores in the street. Taskim has a lot of history, it seemed to be very old, the streets very narrow, I walked around a lot arriving on a Saturday night, went into about a dozen bars, usually one drink minimum for 6 to 10 lira cover charge. The typical \"club\" was a one story place about the size of a studio apartment in NYC and totally wall to wall people, a real death trip if a fire broke out and you had to walk always to the back through trongs of bodies t get to the bar, it reminded me of when I rode on a Tokyo train they were all that packed. I didn't see many torists, 95% Turks. The only Turks that spoke to me were hustlers in the street (At least 6 to 10 during my stay). They approach you talking in Turkish and ask for a light, as a lead to talk (I was smoking), I usually didnt say anything back but when ever I did, they always said, oh your not Turkish in English. This was ment as come on compliment and then it would be lets go have a beer. I blew them all off, I got bored my second night there and talked some more to see where it would go, it was just a come on to get into some rip off, I never went into a place with them. I did see Turkey, and although I spent 1,000.00 USD total with my airfare, hotel and booze and food and of course the high taxi roundtrip to Sabiha airport, for a 2 1/2 day stay it was a good learning experience, it sure beat the many times higher price I would have paid in airfare from America that I may have done later on in life, no I don't plan on a repeat visit to Turkey, lol. I rate the trip above Cyprus (at least I found some good food, unlike there), but the nightlife was nothing to write home about and the prices and people were expensive and looking to totally rip you off. If your working in the Middle East like me my favorite place has been Bahrain, pretty good value there and a much nicer Hotel with a nighclub, room service, pool and cheaper to boot!. If you really want to see Turkey see it for the history only and go in a pre paid tour only, otherwise buyer beware you will get took. I'm not sure the Vardar was bad as far as Turkish standards go but it was bad as far as WORLD standards go. Oh and of course they got me on the exchange rate checking out taking on another 30.00 USD for my stay then what I was quoted in Euro's on Booking.com. Just grin and bear it and move on.

First of all, when you book your hotel in Istanbul, think twice what you want to see and what you want to do there. Istanbul is a huuge city, and staying far away from your points of interests coud be a real trouble. Pretty bad public transport, big traffic shufle, and if you use a taxi keep your eyes wide open. This hotel is very close to Taksim square, and major shopping - pedestrian street in Istanbul. When I say shopping, you can find a lot of stores of all kind all around Istanbul, but here I think about some decent, quality, stuff. Fashion and clothes mostly. In this street (about 3 minute walk from hotel) you can find some good fashion stores and boutiques, some antique shops, pattiseries, restaurants, cake shops, etc... Quality wise speaking, similar places with quality goods (besides this street), I only saw in two big shopping malls in other parts of town (about 20-25 taxi drive both). But don't be surprise when you see that quality stuff (from Turkish fashion companies for example), are not that cheap. Now about hotel: Most of the hotels I saw in Istanbul are usually rated as a 4 star. Most of them are not that level. This is small hotel with decent rooms and very good location. Beds are nice, something called good view from the room does'nt exist, (personally I looked to wall of other building from my window.) (see photo of the room and the view). But, I wasn't on holiday, didn't spend a lot of time in the room, and that didn't bother me. What bothered me was pretty bad condition of the bathroom, which was pretty small, with a bath, sink, tiles and other stuff probably from the late 70's. (see the photos of the bathroom). Breakfast was basic as can be (much worse than any 3-star in EU countries). Very small lobby , and despite rated (by God knows who), as a 4 star, this hotel doesn't have bar where you can have a drink or cofee. In mini bar (old, ruined piece of furniture from 70's), only drink was coca-cola and sparkling water, if I remember well (see the photo of the mini bar). Actually, before traveling, I visited their web site, and saw the pics there, and after coming to hotel I tought I made some mistake by telling taxi driver the hotel name. Then I checked again, and yes my friend that's the same hotel you've booked. Yes, hotel web sites and pics there could be misleading, but that's why we are all here to tell the right story. Overall, in Istanbul you can see a lot of interesting stuff, and spend couple amuzing days. Just be aware of taxi drivers (ask for a price before entering in ), don't go to night clubs without some Turkish friends, and whatever you are buying always argue and negotiate about the price.

The breakfast is nothing to write home about, and the staff is rather surly.", "Date": "July 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "romania", "Title": "\u201cGood option in Taksim\u201d", "Author": "ggabi", "ReviewID": "UR6541185", "Content": "Small hotel, friendly and polite staff, very clean,breakfast above average.

As well as I stayed in the hotel from the 16th till the 20th of November 2005 but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the free transfer. The personal on the reception were not polite. They told me that I cant get it through my arrival but promise me that it will be for my departure from the hotel. But just when I was asking about this service they just told me that give me room more comfortable and its more expensive. Asked me to made a choose to pay more for the hotel or be without transfer. I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a scandal and it could be like this. They need to pay more attention for the service that provide and check the information that put in webpage. My opinion that the hotel is not good about service and people shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go there.
