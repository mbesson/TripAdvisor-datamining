Gym facilities are basic, but, from our point of view, sufficient. It has also free facilities for Turkish bath and sauna which we found very relaxing. During our last visit to Istanbul, from the moment that we walked into the building, we were welcomed very kindly, the staff already knew our names, so we practically felt like \"home\". And now I think we became addicted to Avantgarde Hotel, so definitely we will recommend it to our friends for theirs trips and for sure we will choose it every time we will come again.

The bellboy did not help me with luggage (but I travel light, maybe that's why). But he gave me nice directions to the shopping mall and was further helpfull. The restaurant is quite expensive (portions are small), but excells in desserts. Especially the one with white chocolate is delicious. Be aware that the airport transfer service is quite expensive.

The hotel is 5 min walk from the metro, but you will notice that the air pollution is very heavy due to the 5-lane-highways and junctions right outside the main door.

All the bathroom's I have had on my visits have been different, but each beautifully appointed. I even asked the reception staff where they found the tiles and they were kind enough to forward me the supplier's contact information. The staff here are ALL friendly. I arrived at midnight in the pouring rain to check in for my stay. The chap who opened the door of the taxi holding the umbrella knew my name and welcomed me despite the late hour and horrible weather he was standing in. Similarly, the reception desk asked how my journey had been and offered me a drink whilst I waited for my bags to be taken up and all paperwork to be sorted out. For the price you pay, this hotel is far better than the Swissotel. Its better appointed, offers a great location to get around Istanbul from and the staff are genuinely friendly. I dined one evening at the hotel restaurant, \"Ace\" where the food was surprisingly good. All our group were pleasantly surprised at how good the food was and two of them asked the chef for the recipe to their fabulous tiramisu and pumpkin desserts.
