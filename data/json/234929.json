Guess, because the hotel is in an old building. Location is good, however, not excellent - you still need to walk both to U-bahn (metro) and to the major shops of Kurfustendamm.

The hotel is located in a good area just ten minutes stroll to Kurfustendam. There are nearby restaurants which the hotel staff were able to recommend and each was ideal in its own way. Our rooms were small but the hotel more than made up for this with their friendly care and attention. Breakfast was included in our package and was just about the best continental breakfast that we have had. The rooms were spotless and the whole hotel is furnished in an attractive art decor style. We purchased the Berlin Welcome cards from the hotel and this allowed us to walk to Kurfustendam and pick up a local bus to the Zoo area terminus where we were able to to use the 100 and 200 local buses that seem to include virtually all of the tourist sights on route. If we return to Berlin we will definitely stay at Hotel Alexander.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgreat great great\u201d", "Author": "drsuess2000", "ReviewID": "UR120086852", "Content": "bought it last minute, great location, HUGE room very clean lovely staff they took all our fake tan towels away and never said anything!!

Although the official rating is 3 stars - it is very much 3* superior. With its' sophisticated entrance and red,black and grey colour theme it is very chic - like a boutique hotel. It is housed on a few floors in a turn of the 20th century buildings with high ceilings and the original ceiling mouldings. Location-wise, you are a stone's throw from the main street the Kurfurstendamm. Breakfast is served in the Bar/Dining room and offers everything from eggs, cold meats, fruit, cheeses, pastries, fruit juices and a variety of hot drinks. We were lucky enough to have a room with a balcony. Bikes are available to hire from the hotel owner. With these we went on a self-guided tour making full use of the bike lanes that are prevalent in Berlin. Room rates vary from Euros 79 to 125 for a double room with breakfast depending on the season.", "Date": "June 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, good value\u201d", "Author": "BAEdinburgh", "ReviewID": "UR7148410", "Content": "A good value hotel.

The first time I stayed here I got it recommended by locals. When I had to stay in Berlin for a second time on a low budget business trip (which ruled out the standard hotels such as the intercontinental) I did not hesitate booking this hotel again. It is in a safe, quiet area just outside the tourist area, a 3 minutes walk from the nearest subway station on the kurfursten damm, and about 15 minutes walk to the zoo area. The rooms are large enough to move around (though maybe a bit over-designed), the beds are comfortable, the bathrooms are clean and the breakfast very good. There are cheap (non-tourist) restaurants nearby. I think this is all you need. BTW, if I remember well, they don\u00b4t have an elevator. You can get in late using a night key but don\u00b4t forget to ask the location of the electronic lock. In case of a late arrival (my second visit) they wait if you tell in advance.", "Date": "November 8, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Alexander", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d234929-Reviews-Hotel_Alexander-Berlin.html", "Price": "$77 - $143*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "234929", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/03/0a/030a78b026303913c5d37a6bf3491e651large.jpg"}}
