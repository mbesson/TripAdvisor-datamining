We enjoyed the breakfasts, which set us up for the day, and found plenty of good places to eat nearly, especially just round the corner in Utrechtsestraat (Tempo Doeloe, for example).

I gave a great review in 2010 and I am pleased to say that the stay here was as good as last time. I stayed here with my mother for 3 nights in February 2012. This time we had a room that had been newly open when I was there last. This is a really lovely room. It is at the back of the hotel, on the ground floor and faces on to a garden. You can also see other canal houses plus their gardens from your window. The room is extra large with almost floor to ceiling windows on one side. The bathroom is clean and spacious. All of this was extra important as I had a really bad cold and needed to stay indoors for a day. The stay in Amsterdam also coincided with the cold snap which hit Europe in February. On the day I stayed in it snowed heavily all day. We were able to watch the snow falling via the large windows \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it looked magical. The heating also worked beautifully. Another bonus was the fact that the hotel has a variety of TV channels. I could watch BBC1 and BBC2 and not CNN all day. There is free Wi-Fi as well. I was also able to access the kitchen to prepare my cold medication. Rose and Paul are wonderful hosts. On the first day we arrived early before the room was ready. Rose made us a pot of tea and we warmed ourselves by the fire in the breakfast room. They also helped us with transport and were happy to provide information if needed. Breakfast was good and plentiful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Ham, cheese, boiled eggs, cereal, bread, croissants, tea, coffee, orange juice and yoghurt. We had to leave early on the last day, before the usual breakfast time. Rose arrived earlier at the hotel so that we were able to have breakfast before our departure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c much appreciated. Hotel Orlando is in a great location and you can walk to most sites from here. We had dinner each night in Utrechtsestraat. We visited the restaurant L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Express on two occasions this trip and two occasions on the previous trip. Nice food, well priced. The hotel is perfect for the self sufficient traveller who wants to get a feel of what it would be like to have a canal house as their home.

It is within walking distance of most sites even though it looks a little far away on the map, it really isn't. A stop/go bus passes the hotel frequently and follows the Prinsengracht. You can flag it down and it will take you up down the canal. You can then walk through to Dam square etc. We used this bus frequently. It stops at the train station and one trip costs 1 euro.

We lived there for a year almost 10 years ago and like to go back once a year to say hello. So we've stayed in a few different hotels.

We've often played safe and stayed at the luxury end in the Pulitzer or the like but this time thought we'd try a budget option and came across Hotel Orlando. We were very pleasantly surprised - we stayed in room 117, 1st floor overlooking Prinsengracht. The room was the width of the whole canal house, 3 large windows letting in lots of light in to the huge room. Ok, the furniture has probably seen better days, beds a little soft, but has charm and is tastefully put together. It feels homely. And even though really it's a B&B there is a mini-bar that does have reasonable prices if you just want a little drink in your room. The greeting was extremely friendly, the easiest check-in we've ever experienced anywhere in the world and immediately the room was ours for the weekend. The stay felt very authentically Dutch. Breakfast was fine, hot drinks, bread, eggs and cheese/ham to get you started. There are so many lovely cafes and patisseries nearby you can always nip up the road to get something more substantial if need be, and Amsterdam is a city of food so you'd be wise not to eat too big a breakfast and spoil your opportunity for a good lunch.

On the positive side: the hotel is well placed for seeing Amsterdam, being away from the noise and general grubbiness of the inner city but within easy reach by foot (or tram) of all main attractions. The bedlinen was clean; at least one of the twin beds pushed together to form the double was comfortable; there was a hairdryer in the bathroom and a mini fridge in the bedroom; and the young woman who showed us the room, made breakfast and handled check-out was extremely pleasant and friendly. The negatives, however, were considerable. We had chosen Room 111 because we liked the look (from the hotel's website) of the courtyard outside and because we like fresh air when we sleep (however cold it is). However, the photos did NOT show that the ceiling was so low that we barely scraped in, nor that the so-called courtyard (perhaps photographed immediately after renovation?) was now just a damp, rather dingy area inaccessible to guests (unless you wanted to climb out the window). The bathroom had no exterior window or any kind of working ventilation system so became extremely steamy and was no doubt the reason why the paintwork above the tiled area of the shower recess was dark with mould. The grouting of the wall tiles around the handbasin area was also mouldy and the timber benchtop was showing its age with water spotting. We had read comments on the hotel's website about the tastefulness of the interior decor and were amused to see that this translated into two plastic tub chairs, one plastic footstool, a plastic table, and on the tiny bedside tables were Ikea-style bedside lights of which one was temperamental and didn't always light. There was also a strange lattice arrangement painted bright red (but with the paint scuffed around the base) that housed the mini fridge and the TV. Behind and extruding from this curious item was a huge tangle of white plastic wiring that obviously no none could be bothered to coil up and stow away neatly. My husband reported that his bed was extremely lumpy and uncomfortable. The only items that could perhaps be described as antiques were the bathroom towels which were so thin that they were like rags after one use. I peeked in a vacated upstairs room (I didn't note the number) and didn't see any sign of tasteful decor there either - just the bare minimum of ordinary furniture required to classify as a hotel room. Other Trip Advisor reviews commented favourably on the breakfast - again, to our amazement. The coffee was good and plentiful but the food consisted of a few slices of the cheapest kind of sliced cheese and processed ham, one croissant, 3 small rolls and two slices of dark supermarket style \"foam\" bread, small pots of jam and marmalade, and two tubs of supermarket fruit yoghurt. There was the offer of a boiled egg and orange juice but we declined. I mean - OK but nothing to get excited about.

We ended up eating two meals in our room, once from a take-out-only Thai shop and once a light meal of cheese and deli items that started as an appetizer and ended up being dinner.

Double bed, table and chairs, TV with BBC 1 and 2 (good for watching match of the day), free safe, large wardrobe space all really nice. The bed were comfy and the shower was quite large too with a constant supply of warn water no matter what the time.

Then when we arrived at the hotel and rang the bell, twice, and no one answered, I was also a bit nervous. But I guess the third time is a charm and finally Paul let us in, showed us our room (room 111, huge and downstairs across from the absolutely lovely breakfast room), explained some things to us, and we were all settled. Room 111 is supposedly the smallest of the hotel's 5 rooms, but if it is the smallest, I can't imagine how huge the other rooms must be. One room is on the main floor where the entrance is, the other 3 are up what appeared to be a very steep narrow winding staircase typical of the Amsterdam canal houses, and 111 is down a straight and relatively ordinary but short flight of stairs, so access to this room is easier than some of the others. The room is huge. Two beds, a TV getting over 30 channels (many English), a huge closet/mirror thing along one wall, a little table to sit at, and a piece of furniture containing the TV, a little safe (which we were freely given the key to with our room keys), and a minibar with fridge we could use for our own things (the prices for the minibar were about 2 euros for all the drinks, which I didn't think was too bad). Everything in the room was in great shape and very clean. The room opens onto a little courtyard, meaning it is incredibly quiet and we cracked the window open even during the cool nights just to get a little air. The bathroom is also good-sized and has a shower that is very spacious and plenty of room to lay out toiletries, etc. There are plenty of plugs in the room for charging things, and a little table and chairs that was nice to be able to spread out papers, leave the keys, eat snacks, etc. A nice surprise was a free ethernet cable to plug my laptop in. This wasn't advertised and I wasn't expecting any internet connection at such a small establishment, but it was a really welcome touch. We had no problems with Paul (although I am not sure which of the two Pauls we dealt with!). He was very helpful and was never rude. He wasn't the warmest person I've ever encountered, but he was perfectly cordial and happy to help us when we had a problem opening the door (had to pull the handle towards us to turn the key, no problem once he showed us). On Saturday and Sunday morning, another young man was in the breakfast room. I believe he was just an employee there temporarily and unfortunately I did not get his name, but he was unbelievably nice and we chatted for a while each of the mornings he was there serving breakfast. The location is great - it is on a quiet part of the Prinsengracht canal just a couple long blocks from the Rembrandtplein - there are tons of restaurants within a 5-10 minute walk and the Tram #4 which goes to the station and to Dam Square and other tourist places is right at the end of the street a half block away from the hotel at Utrechtstraat (a street lined with stores, restaurants, bakeries, a bank with ATM, and more). Being so close to the tram made it easy and convenient to take the tram back from the sightseeing when my feet were tired. But everything important in town is probably a half hour away or less - and made easier by the tram. As the real heart of Amsterdam can be a crazy place, I personally really enjoyed the peaceful respite of the Hotel Orlando's quiet and peaceful location. But if you want to stay right in the heart of all the action and don't mind noise and drunkards and litter 24/7, this is probably not the hotel for you and you might want to look for a place more in the middle of all the action. Breakfast is continental, but very nice. Freshly-squeezed (sometimes right in front of your eyes!) orange juice was a really nice touch, a big cup of yogurt, slices of excellent cheese and also some ham, two kinds of bread/rolls with amazing quality butter (you know the butter must be good when someone can actually tell that it tastes good!), very good coffee, a selection of teas should you want it, a boiled egg, and a couple of jams if you want. Paul or whoever is there in the morning serves you everything and it is a nice little classy room and nice service. It was a little boring after 4 days but more than enough to start the day with. It does start a little bit late, breakfast is from 9-11am, but this was never a problem for me. The only thing that was even slightly off was that on Saturday, I returned from my day of sight-seeing and my room wasn't cleaned. It didn't bother me in the slightest, and I don't know if it was a one-off or if they don't clean on Saturdays or whatever, but if this is an issue for you, maybe check and make sure the room will be cleaned every day. Keep in mind that this is a canal house and that the owners live in the building. Therefore, for disabled visitors, booking room 115 would be a must as no stairs inside are required to get to that room (though as I said, breakfast is downstairs). As with almost all of the canal houses, there is no elevator and outside the building there are about 6 or so stairs. We booked right with the hotel's website via email and paid 100 euros for the room when it was 2 of us and after my friend went home halfway through our stay, it was 85 euros for just me - a very good deal. Another convenience is that even though the hotel is small, they happily accepted credit cards for the room payment with no surcharge. All in all I can't recommend the hotel enough. It is so unfortunate that some people had bad experiences with the hotel and/or Paul - the only thing I can think of is that perhaps he was going through a bad time or something and unfortunately took it out on his hotel or his guests. But I really enjoyed my time there and would recommend it to anyone and would definitely stay there again should I ever return to Amsterdam.", "Date": "September 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWe will return one day!\u201d", "Author": "myu7", "ReviewID": "UR8458373", "Content": "After much research, we booked hotel orlando and we loved this hotel.

On the basis of the service we received I can't recommend this hotel.", "Date": "May 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cWeekend Visit\u201d", "Author": "Cambridgevisitor", "ReviewID": "UR7624808", "Content": "Splendid. We were in Amsterdam for a wedding and stayed for a long weekend. We also had the absolutely vast Room 117 overlooking the Prinsengracht. It's super...spacious yet romantic. Nice big bathroom too. Comfy beds and stylish decor. Mandy was warm and helpful and got us hairdryer, iron &c. Location excellent. The smallness is an absolutely huge plus. You feel special and as though you have really discovered somewhere. Only very slight negative was that parts of the room including the intriguing TV/Bar box hadn't been dusted and were a little dirty. ...but that's not enough to detract from my 5. We would definitely stay here again...if there was space.", "Date": "May 15, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Orlando", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d197798-Reviews-Hotel_Orlando-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$119 - $211*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Prinsengracht 1099</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1017 JH</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "197798", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/14/14/1c/l-hotel-orlando.jpg"}}
