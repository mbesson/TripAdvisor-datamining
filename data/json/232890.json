Check in took forever..Just poor customer service i think.. Anyway the room was quite nice, we had a double bed and a single bed and it was still quite spacious.There was a sink in the room and our room overlooked the courtyard so it was nice and quiet. A weird thing about the room is that you get a room key and another little key that you put into a hole near the door for the electricity and such, when you put this key in a red light turns on outside your door to show that you are in the room.....opportunity for someone to rob you when they notice the light is not on?? We left that key in there while we were out, so that the light was constantly on. The bathrooms were never in use when we needed them and they are quite clean.

Our booking was for a double ensuite room and included breakfast. Our room was situated on the 4th floor. It was a good size, nicely decorated and had sufficient drawer/hanging space for our needs. There was a large comfortable doublebed, good air conditioning, a small electronic safe and a mini-fridge which was useful for keeping our water cool. The TV had 2 English channels (BBC World and CNN international). The bathroom was small but clean and modern and consisted of a (good) shower, toilet, washbasin and bidet. We did not use the hairdryer or heated towel rail. Rooms were cleaned daily (by a friendly cleaning-lady) and towels, shower gel, soap and bath-hat were replenished if necessary. There were no in-room coffee-making facilities. The hotel itself was a 5 storey building (one lift), with reception (24 hour) located on the 5th floor. Reception staff were helpful and knowledgeable. Check-in was from 14:00 and check out time was at 10:30am though there was a (locked) luggage store on the ground floor which was available as required. The roof terrace was very pleasant (and you could take your own food and drink there) but provided views into other hotels rooms rather over the rooftops of Rome (as claimed by the hotel website). Breakfast (buffet) was available (from 7.30 - 10am) on the first floor with a choice of rolls, croissants, bread (feeble toaster), cakes, pastries, cereals, cold meats, cheese and a variety of spreads, yogurt, bacon, eggs, frankfurters, milk, juice and water. A coffee machine provided a variety of hot drinks and the lady in change of the area was always friendly and quick to replenish items running low. We chose this hotel because it was well-positioned close to both termini and pretoria stations (a single metro journey cost one euro). There was a supermarket (called Sigma) practically at the end of the street and a small bar (also serving food) just across the road. Our favourite bar (called The Yellow) was just one street away, served wine (decent-sized glass!) from 2 euros upwards as well as having a resaonably priced small menu and pleasant inside and outside seating areas.

Since it was only just over 50 euros per night for the room and breakfast we weren't expecting too much. But boy were we in for a surprise! First of all the hotel is very easy to find being less than a ten minute walk from the main Termini rail and bus station where the bus from the airport drops you off (slight deviation here - if you are on a budget don't bother getting the train from Leonardo Da Vinci airport as the shuttle bus is half the price and we found it to be perfectly adequate and took about 35-40 minutes which is not much longer than the train). Upon entering the hotel we found the reception staff very friendly and helpful and the check-in process was completed in about ten minutes. The reception area itself, although quite small is inviting, relaxed and cool - a welcome relief from the heat outside which, during our visit was around 35deg celsius (98deg fahrenheit)! We were told tha the reception is open 24/7 so there is always someone there to help with any questions. We were then directed to our room using the quietest lift I have ever been in! We were on the third floor (room 311) and when we entered we could not believe that this hotel does not have an extra star or two. OK, the room wasn't the biggest we've ever stayed in but certainly not the smallest (by a looong way!) and was spotless and tastefully decorated. The refridgerator was a nice touch although I thought it could be a little larger. There was perfectly adequate hanging space and our luggage also fitted into the wardrobe. The bathroom was also spotless and very well fitted out. There have been comments on here about the size of the shower and, yes, it is on the small side. In our room it was in the corner of the bathroom and had a curved front rather that square sides. This did make it a little cramped but having said that it was not really a problem and although I am not the worlds largest person (180lbs 5'6\") I didn't find it too much of an inconvenience. On the plus side there was never an issue with hot water and the pressure was just fine. The bed itself was large and dominated the room. I like quite a firm matress and I was not dissapointed and both myself and my partner slept very well. The room was quiet although we were at the rear of the hotel which overlooks a small courtyard bounded by hotels and residential appartments. It is possible that the rooms at the front could be noisier on account of the bar across the street so if you can, ask for a room at the rear. The room was fitted with an air conditioning unit but we never turned it on and despite the heat had no problem getting to sleep with the window open and the shutters closed. I believe (although I haven't confirmed this) that there is an extra charge for the air conditioning of something like 5 euros. Like I said, we didn't use it so can't comment on its effectiveness. The breakfast room must have been extended if previous comments are anything to go by because it was perfectly adequate, being in three seperate joining open-plan type rooms. Once again the room was nicely decorated and spotless. Breakfast itself was great: an all-you-can-eat buffet style - when I say all-you-can-eat that we were never told that but we had as much as we wanted and never got any dissaproving looks ;-) There was bread, pastries, hard boiled eggs, cold meats, cheese, three types of cereal, yoghurt, fruit juice (this was from powder mix and was the only \"slight\" dissapointment), tea, coffee (normal and esspresso) and hot chocolate. All-in-all we thought that Des Artistes represented outstanding value for money and would be hard pressed to find any negative things to say about it. If we were being picky we would probably say that the refridgerator in the room could have been larger (the cabinet it was in was certainly able to house one twice the size) and there could have been \"real\" fruit juice at breakfast. One of the really nice things about this hotel is the roof terrace which was great for relaxing on after a hard day sight-seeing and the hotel are fine with you bringing your own food to eat in the evening - once again the roof terrace is ideal for this. In terms of getting around the city there is a Metro stop about a five minute walk away and, as previously stated, the main station is about ten minutes. If you visit Vatican City (highly recommended by the way) you will need to get a cab or a #40 bus as there is no convenient metro. Everything else is pretty much in walking distance - it took us about half an hour gentle walk to reach the Coluseum. We found the red \"official\" hop-on-hop-off tour bus to be a great way of getting around and at 18 euros for 48 hours (timed from when you first use your ticket) was pretty good value also. So if you are looking for a great budget hotel for a short break in Rome you really couldn't do better than Des Artistes. We will certainly stay there again when we visit Rome.", "Date": "September 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sheffield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat value and comfort after a day exploring beautiful Rome\u201d", "Author": "sarahmichelledec", "ReviewID": "UR76057905", "Content": "On arrival/Location: We found it very easy to find as I'd got instructions from the hotel itself and google maps. It's a 5 minute walk from the Termini Station (perfect location, never get lost as there's always a tube train or bus going there!) and was perfect considering this was our first holiday without adults. When we arrived the staff were very friendly. They gave us a map of the city and pinpointed some tourist hotspots including a popular icecream parlour (but as you explore the city you find your own favourite places). There's an old rickety style lift to take you up to your floor which was crucial after walking all day but it isn't a big hotel so wouldn't have been hard to get to our room via the stairs, we were just lazy! Room: I booked this hotel based on the reviews and prices. There are three types of room available: shared bedrooms and bathrooms, private room with a shared bathroom and private en suite rooms. We went with the private rooms with a shared bathroom as I decided we'd be spending most of the day away from the hotel and we saved a lot of money. The room was traditionally decorated, not to my personal taste but was fitting for the holiday! it came with a T.V. and sink so we did not have to queue to brush our teeth. The room was cleaned every day and the bathrooms were also cleaned daily. They were abit messy towards the end of the day but only because it was high time for showers so the floor was quite soggy. Occassionally we had to queue but there is about 3 bathrooms on our floor so we just used one of the others. Can't complain about the room or bathrooms at all; for the money we saved it was brilliant and the room was great to come back to for a rest before finding somewhere to eat. It got a bit hot though as there was only a ceiling fan and no air con but it was bearable. This was the perfect hotel for a young couple's first holiday. It was basic but very homely too. I didn't feel homesick and felt safe too. I had some qualms as i read that some areas around the Termini station were rough but this area was fine. Near to many resteraunts, pizza bars, cafes, a bank, an internet cafe and a laundrette so we did not have to walk far for anything.

Our first stay at a 3* hotel, will return to Des Artistes, we choose Des Artistes because of the pics on the website and the reviews and were travelling without kids. Tips to the budget traveller, buy drinks, coke, beer, water etc at the supermarket and keep in your minibar, very cheap, also take out can be very good and cheaper if u take back to the hotel, u can eat at the rooftop terrace or in your room, we did this after long and tiring days as we experienced quite a wait in all the restaurants we sat down to eat. the train from the airport to Termini station is quite easy and only $11.00 euros per person the hotel is within walking distance, and busses are quite easy and accessible, we had allready booked tours online, so we know for next time. Beers & Wine was relatively cheap in the bars and restaurants, note very well for the seafood lover, my prawns, fish was cooked with the eyes and tail etc, so I opted for veg take out spageti and tomato sauce and mushroom pizza with red sauce, fried cheese/rice balls, really good and the hotel is simly surrounded by lots of places to eat, also 10-15% is charged on your bill (excludes take out) so be sure u look at your bill so u tip at your discression, also very good gelato, best at the Trevi Fountain, my husband went in twice, I loved the coconut and hazelnut, be prepared to see some graffiti, and be really careful crossing the streets. The sites are amazing in Rome, I wish everyone gets a chance to see it, and please ensure that you take proper walking shoes, even with flat ballerina shoes the cobble stones and uneven sidewalks will take a toll on your feet also don't get fooled or scared when u see the line up, the line up to the Vatican does not take 2 hrs although it looks it, it is a mere 20 mins or less to get through security, the line moves, take what you want from this review and totally enjoy your trip.

I stayed in the main part of the hotel (as opposed to the annex). The hotel had several strong points. Rooms were large by European standards, with large bathrooms. The rooms were comfortable, tastefully decorated, with a nice window. It was quite a good value for money (in part because they offered a substantial discount for staying a full week). The staff were very friendly and very helpful. All of them spoke excellent English, and were extremely cheerful and helpful. The room was pretty quiet (I was on the 3rd floor), which, combined with a comfortable bed, meant that I slept well every night. In general there was a little bit of noise around 8-8:30 am as people headed to breakfast, and a little bit of noise around 11:30 pm or so as people came home. On the whole, it was no big deal -- I am a very light sleeper and am very sensitive to noise, and even so I really had no problems sleeping. I do have one point of caution: the location really isn't ideal. It's by no means dangerous (there are a few rough areas near Termini, but none are within 4-5 blocks of the hotel and there's a safe path from either the metro or Termini to the hotel). That said, it's not particularly charming either. The area is loaded with tourist hotels and the restaurants in the area make their money providing them with overpriced and substandard fare. Tourists will want to spend as much time as possible in other parts of the city. As noted, it's close to both Termini and the metro, but the Rome metro doesn't cover that much of the city. We spent a good bit of time walking, which wasn't too big a deal for us, but I could see it bothering some types of travelers. The breakfast (which was included with our room) was OK but nothing to write home about. On the whole, this was a reasonable priced hotel which provided comfortable rooms and good service.

While the room size was just as expected (typical European Quad room - a tight fit for 4 with luggage), it was clean and comfortable. The mini fridge in the room was a bonus as it was quite hot that week (34 C / 93 F degrees). We went to the market less than 1 block away and got several snacks and bottles of water to put in the fridge. The breakfast was adequate and filling but nothing special. However, the front desk staff was great. We spoke with three different employees during our stay and all were polite, helpful and spoke conversational English. After expressing to them that we do not like tourist type restaurants, they truly made an effort to send us to restaurants that locals frequent. We had some truly simple, affordable and wonderful food (no fast food) thanks to the guidance of the front desk staff. Our reservation said we would have to pay a key deposit, but we were never asked or billed for that during or after our stay. Lastly, the hotel had contracted with a taxi service for a flat rate to the airport (FCO) - 40 Euros. It was cheaper for a family of four to take a taxi than use the airport express train from Tremini. Location We stayed in the hotel's main building. The hotel's location is fairly close to Tremini Station about 6 blocks or so. But you do not want to be right next to Tremini because it is noisy and not so safe at night according to the locals. We are adventurous and walked to Tremini one night - and I was not completely comfortable like I was in other parts of Rome. The hotel is also about 1-2 blocks from the Castro Pretorio metro station on the blue line (3 stops away from the Colesseum). The street Via Villafranca is quiet and there are at least a dozen hotels within a 3 block radius. Some other notes about the hotel: Small elevator - 2 trips for us with our luggage. Lots of international guests - several college aged backpackers / cyclers Clean spacious bathroom in our room (for Europe) Security door for the lobby - must be buzzed in and out In-room safe Affordable Wi-Fi & local calls Pleasant other hotel staffers This is not a luxury or American style hotel, but if you are looking for something more interesting Hotel des Artistes was affordable and comfortable.", "Date": "June 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cGreat Friendly Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Twinkle79", "ReviewID": "UR32225928", "Content": "We travelled to Rome for my 30th Birthday last week and had chosen Des Artistes due to good reviews and good price for location, well they were all true!

We went up to the 6th Floor where the lovely terrace is, the hotel is only missing one thing - a proper bar at the top. You can get drinks from reception but it would really make a difference with a nice bar. Apart from that we could not fault the hotel at all. They even give you breakfast vouchers for Bruce and Franks cafe just around the corner, Cappuccino and a croissant for 1.50euros, well worth using as most cafes are charging 4euro a coffee!! Most things are within walking distance although the tube stops at the top of the main road, I'd advise buying a 3 or 7 day ticket as you can use on buses too.

The hotel is elegant and our room was organized with really good taste, with bourgeois furnishing and a plasma tv set. The bathroom had a marble sink and the deep blue walls created a very relaxing and pleasant atmosphere. All spotless clean. We had a room in the annexe part that seemed to be a residential hotel in itself. Very quiet and comfortable, with no noise or disturbance at night. We were given an electronic key that we kept with us for the whole stay, so there was no need to ask the reception for it every time we came back from our seesightings. The key opened the front gate, then an inner door and at the end our room. The validity of our key expired on our departure day and with such a security system we felt really safe. Moreover there was an electronic safe in our room where we stored our values. Breakfast was served in the breakfast room on the fifth floor in the next door hotel section. We used the very pretty roof top terrace for our breakfast, a floor up from the breakfast room. It is an ideal place to have a cup of coffee and croissant while reading a newspaper (you can find one at the lobby area) during a sunny day, and we did just that! For those used to have a full breakfast there is a wide choice of other food such as ham, salami and cheese. The staff we met there were extremely welcoming, smiling and helpful and some of them spoke French as well! Upon arrival we were given all useful information regarding the city, hotel area and places for lunch/ dinner. Moreover we received a great assistance from them every time we ask for it.

My family and I reserved two private rooms for our first night in Rome and our last. Upon check in the clerk (friendly enough) didn't seem sure of what she was doing but finally assigned our two rooms. Small and clean they were not close together as I requested but on different floors. Since the hotel had no security and business offices were on the same floor as one of the rooms (a really weird setup that did not make me feel safe at all), my husband and son shared a room and I shared a room with my two girls. On checkout the next day, my credit card was declined. I knew something was wrong as it was only the beginning of our vacation and the card had ample room to charge all of our hotel stays and rental car. I tried to pay in travellers cheques but they refused stating cash or credit only. So I told my children to stay in the room and their father and I would find a bank to get the required cash. We walked all the way to the Temini before we could find a bank machine (our bill for two rooms was over $500..) In the meantime the front desk was phoning my children telling them they had to vacate the room and threatening them -they were terrified. We decided we should pick up the rental car, but the credit card was again declined -the rental car company determined on our behalf that the hotel had incorrectly put a hold on our card for an exhorbitant amount -hence the declines, unfortunately although the credit card company would reverse it, the process would require confirmation from the hotel that we did not actually owe the amount and as a resut the reversal would take several days before the card could be used again. Fortunately we had another card and manged to get the car. When we returned to the hotel the owner was belligerent with us and had been yelling at our kids. As I paid the bill I asked that they cancel our reservation for the last night as there was no way we would return -my childrens first day in Rome had been ruined. You can guess the rest -we were charged $400. for a no show on the last evening of our trip -on the card that was declined initially!!

When we turned up, we realised that the walk from the train station to the hotel was shorter than it had seemed to us on the map at first. It's only a couple of minutes walk from the main train station and the area is full of nice restaurants. Not at all like the shady areas you sometimes find around train stations in big cities around Europe. You felt that you were in a \"real\" Rome, where real Romans lived. Of course it was handy to be close to the train station with its metro lines and busses all around the city, but, frankly, everything was within walking distance anyway. Now, I had let the hotel know that it was my girlfriend's birthday, but I didn't expect them to take notice. On the contrary, when we arrived, they had put a bottle of prosecco in the room for us! The room was fantastic as well. Very classy. Definitely more than you would expect in this price range. Nice paintings on the walls. Not the cheap, mass produced things that you get in chain hotels. It added a personal touch to the place. Of course, in a city like Rome, you don't spend much time in the hotel, but it was still a very nice atmosphere to come back to after full days of sightseeing. The hotel seemed to be fairly popular at the time we stayed there, but we didn't hear the any noise from other rooms, so we got nothing but great sleeps all nights.

The double room we checked into was a good size, given that hotels in continental Europe tend to have small rooms. It was clean and the linen was changed daily. A baby bed was provided at no extra cost. The only snag was that the AC was not powerful enough and this was annoying given the heat in Rome. The price at EUR 110 per night per room might be a bit steep, but given the location (a 5 min walk from Termini station) and a decent area, we are not complaining. The price included breakfast, charged at EUR 7.75 per person, which though plentiful, was standard continental fare of croissants, coffee, cheese etc. I suggest you give this a miss and head out for breakfast. Much cheaper and more options. Another tip is regarding the hop-on-hop-off tourist buses in Rome. The best deal is on the \"110 Open Trambus\" which is run by Rome municipality. They have a frequency of a bus every 10 min (whereas the others are at one bus every half hour) and the two day EUR 24 deal including the Archeobus is a good buy.

The disappointment began from the first moment we got there.The reception is on the fifth floor, where we ascended via a rickety,rattling archaic lift (which could barely hold one person with two average pieces of luggage), to be met by a \"fakely polite\",\"foreign\" Italian woman who was interested in one thing - getting clients TO PAY IN ADVANCE! Of course we objected to this as we had not agreed to do so in our previous email.(We realized why clients are asked to pay up front - if you stay the first night, no wonder you will change your mind about the place.) We had requested a QUIET room in our communication, so we were given a room on the fourth floor. For 137.ooEur. we did expect to HAVE QUIET! but, the room was completely inundatedby NOISE. Noise coming from everywhere - the hostel annex on the floor above; the tiny crowded reception hall; the miserable breakfast buffet area; the luggage hold - all on the fifth floor, and, added to this, the human traffic of clumsy clodding up and down the stairs leading to the infamous \"roof garden\"\".Oh did I mention the rattling lift, and the old wooden twin doors BANGING every time the lift was being used?Or what about the gurgling of the water running down the pipes, every time someone took a shower, or used the WC? A word about the \"roof garden\" - the breakfast area is so tiny and poorly laid out the you can't get out of there fast enough, once you've got something on your breakfasr tray (if you can manage to find something decent). So, you escape to the roof garden where you are met by hundreds of fat pigeons flapping about, landing on tables and (broken) chairs, sending little \"poopy\" messages, just so you don't forget the place.The place was dirty and poorly set out.And don't be fooled that you will see the Roman skyline! The breakfast on all three mornings was of very poor quality. We finally spoke up on the third day, having been fed up with the previous days' empty platters and empty bowls! We directly told the signora on duty that \"there was NO yoghurt left\" or, \"NO cereal left\", or \"NO oranje juice\"!Absolutely UNACCEPTABLE! for a hotel of that price to offer such poor standard.

Eight hours later, on a flying visit to the hotel between excursions, we spoke to the staff again, and were reassured that the maintenance man was as we spoke looking at the problem.

The woman at reception was very pleasant but unable to offer any solutions until the next morning, aside from emptying half a can of air freshener ( mandarin) into the bathroom - not so good if you are asthmatic, like me. The next day the drains were treated with bleach, so that night we were overwhelmed with the smell of chlorine! We were not happy campers at all. To add the cherry on top, that night my sister got her bag stolen. We were eating outside at the restaurant immedatiately around the corner from the hotel, at the junction of Via Villafranca and Via Vincenza. Without going into details I would strongly advise any trip advisor members to avoid that particular establishement! And the receptionist on that night at the hotel was less than helpful. Overall the room was small and very dark, with little natural light. It was however clean. The breakfast was unexceptional but late-comers be warned! My sister arrived about 1 minute after the end of breakfast, food still on the buffet table and hotel guests clearly in evidence and she had to endure a telling off from the lady in charge!

The rooms and property itself is of very good construction and there are beautiful marble floors and appointments. The free breakfast is certainly sufficient for the purpose. That said, the reception, breakfast and \"bar\" are on the fifth floor of the main building and is a tremendous inconvenience. I'm used to small elevators in Europe, but to have to lug luggage up and down it and use it to get to breakfast or other things during the stay was just not acceptable, in my opinion. We were in the annex, as so many others have mentioned, so that made the trips to the reception/breakfast all the more inconvenient. The \"bar\" consisted of a refrigerator with beer, bottled water and wine. If you thought to ask, they'd sell you something from it. Otherwise, there is not really a bar there, just the tables that are used for breakfast and the refrigerator... this really seems to stretch the concept, in my opinion. The breakfast area also was not large enough for the number of guests and was basically as hot as an oven in the middle of December. I could not imagine being there in the summer. The attitude and helpfulness of the staff was very inconsistent. They'd be very helpful with some things and be completely weird about others, such as the time I had to explain to the man at the reception that I had not received a map from anyone when I checked in. He questioned me about it as if I were a ten year old or was hoarding them to sell on the black market! Once he was convinced, he handed me the map and gave somewhat incorrect directions to the Villa Borghese; which he said was a 15 minute walk and turned out to be more like 45, due to his spotty directions and the actual distance. Also, my traveling companion lost most of her electricity and phone service on our last night there. When she went over to report it, they basically thanked her and did not even attempt to correct it. There were lots of back-packing 20 something year olds here and it hit me that this was precisely the issue. This should not be advertised as a hotel but a hostel.

Better was to book and experience the first night. If it was okay, then you book and pay also for the other three nights. First the first time ( this was not a business trip) I thrusted somebody in a new town.. The receptionist, somebody who didn't seem to know much about Rome ( he didn't know certain restaurants) a male obviously coming from the United States, led us to the ground floor where somebody should pick us up to show us the room in the annex building. Nobody came, after I grabbed the phone.. the American receptionist came down. He led us to the annex building, four blocks further! It didn't have the looks of a hotel, more an appartment building where a lot of construction work was going on. It was extremely noisy. The whole day. Maybe that was the reason to pay the price ahead.. anyway we thougt to give them a chance. Besides we left the hotel every morning at ten to return at ten in the evening. No bother with that construction work.. unless they started at 7.30 u - 8.00 u AM already. Two times they woke us up very early ( we went to bed around two 'o clock AM) and we made our complaints at the staff. They tried to arrange a discount via the manager, but that wasn't so easy.. the manager wasn't always in the hotel. Finally, he gave us a discount of 50 euro on the total amount of 510 euro. It was arranged by a friendly receptionist the last night of our staying in the hotel. He phoned the manager. That was a very nasty thing in Hotel des Artistes. The main problem was that they didn't tell it before I booked the room and not before I payed the 510 euro's in cash. And that's not very polite. It looks even like cheating. Further information: The elevator is too small. If you go inside with more then two people it is as if you're making love or trying to make love with all the elevator occupants. The breakfast is so so.. the bread is all right, but there is no espresso, and we are in Italy! The coffee is bad and tasted like american coffee ( more like tasty dark water) And they serve no fresh orange juice in a country where the orange grow on trees.. The roof terrace on the other hand is very nice. But again: why no isolation for the airconditioner? The streetnoise is less then the airco. So if you sit at the streetside on the terrace then it's more quiet. The rooms are clean and tasteful, the airco works all right, there is a safe locker. But no bath tub ( not possible in a small bathroom) and the rooms are extreme small. The view is terrible, you can close the curtains the whole day because the only thing we saw was a blind wall.

We understood his eagerness to get away when we realised we were 4 sharing a bathroom instead of the agreed 2.

We also had an elderly gentleman hammering on metal shelving for hours in a cupboard next to our room when we arrived, after 10 hours travelling. It was a nightmare! We complained when a young girl turned up with yet another family ready to share 'the annex'. They refused the room after looking around, with their youngest childs departing words 'Mummy, get me out of this place'. The only reason we agreed to stay was because almost everybody had gone for our last 2 nights, and the annex is closer to town.

After a blazing row at 5.30 in the morning with the night man, he gave me the 10 Euros from another customers sleeve.
