Service was great, always with a smile. So for me it awsn't like some before me mentioned that service could be better. I was told the hotel finds it important to create jobs for the locals, educating them and making sure they get proper income. Maybe therefore they are less experienced and still learning. Anyway good bed, traditional furniture and nice artwork there. The stones are carved out beautifully. Rooms are tidied nicely when you get back from dinner and decorated with flowers. whith that weather it's great to take a plunge in the wonderful private pool with the serene background sound of the waterfall and nature surrounding you. I don't agree with the reviews before that interior is kitsch in a negative way - it is real Balinese and that what's makes it so different from other hotels where you alsmost forget that you're in bali and not inany other modern city. What I wasn't too keen on was the roof, which looks stunning but you''ll sometimes find some dust (whats the english word) of it on the sheets. Also the bath tub is not that handy if you want to take a quick shower and need to close all curtains around you if you want to make sure youre having a private bath. There's no bathroom door to close so it's more suited for honeymoon or than friends travelling. What i'm also missing is the bidet or toilet shower you find everywhere in indonesia. Hope they will work on that. But still, what a great place. The paronamic view from the upper restaurant is so stunning. The hotel has 2 restaurants underneath the upper one which all serve the same food although seem to be themed differently. The view there is still fantastic but not as great as on top. Near the river is another restaurant which serves different food, all organic. The plot of land where the veggies are grown can be seen lays right next to the river so you can see people farming from the restaurants! Taste was ok and again you're seated so peacefully near the river. Only thing is you need to walk all the way down which is a real bummer. I'm in good shape but with the indonesian weather it's no fun doing. You can also take the shuttle and eat in the centre of ubud. The shuttle bus goes regularly so no problem doing that. Would definately recommend a stay here for some nights.", "Date": "Jul 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR791973621", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "QWelsh"}, {"Content": "Great place with authentic Bali feel We stayed in July 2008 for 5 nights and loved it. The hotel as stated in the other reviews here is located right in the jungle and by the Ayung river. The scenery from the villas (all the rooms are villas with pools). and the main lobby are breathtaking. The architecture of the hotel, the villas are done in a traditional Bali style that makes you feel like you're really in Bali (unlike some other hotels). The villas themselves are big. The ones we stayed at had a bedroom, dinining area, bathroom with a gigantic tub (enough to have couple of adults in there )and a huge pool that you can actually swim and do laps (unlike some other pool at other villas of other hotels). The staff was always friendly and most spoke decent English and was very accomodating. The hotel picked us up from the airport and returned us there for free, they also have free shuttles to the Ubud town center so you can shop and dine there (try the Dirty Duck, Lotus Cafe for eats). They also arranged a personalized tour of the surrounding area for us (this was charged but inexpensive). The only downsides would be: 1) There's no internet in the villas (although they have free wireless in the main lobby and one computer in the business center you can use for free for the internet). 2) The villas themselves have a limited hot water, and if you fill the huge tub up with water, you may have to wait a little to get hot water at the shower...3) Since the hotel is located in the middle of the jungle, there are lots of bugs including mosquitoes. And although the Bali architecture is beautiful, it meas there are some space between the doors for the bugs to get through. They do have a bug screen aroung the bed, but I suggest bringing bug spray as well.But overall, I would definelt stay here again for the room and the service you get here for the price.", "Date": "Jul 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR190774277", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Tokyodude"}, {"Content": "Absolutely stunning       the lagoon pool", "Date": "Jul 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR484922796", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "shooxou"}, {"Content": "Stunning location, but could be so much better... We stayed 3 nights at the Royal Pita Maha during our 3rd visit to Bali and Ubud. Overall the resort is stunning in terms of rchitecture and landscaping: the moment you enter the resort you're overwhelmed by the detailed architecture, and the views on the Ayung valey from the restaurants. Stairs and elevators bring you all the way down to the river, a true sanctuary, but not much to do there beyond the spa and laguna pool. Our villa was extremely nice: spacious, large bathroom, large sized outdoor pool and 2 deck chairs. On the minus side, we had the impression that the hotel was struggling with food quality. We only had breakfast in the hotel, but it said enough: fruit juice was either not fresh or thinned with water, fruit served was not ripe, bakery was rather industrial than home made, etc... Service was OK but not up to standard of any other $350 the room resort. Because of the rain, we asked for check out 1 day earlier, which was no problem.

The facility might be the most beautiful I have seen especially the landscaping, facility and location. It has a lower area by the river that is extremely beautiful and serine. What is lacking is is food quality and basic hotel operations from housekeeping, to funishings (except the bed) to ants all over the floor because they have never installed doors that seal them out. The pools are beautiful but steps to get into them would help. They are a small operation and do not have professional management.

The landscape and views are to truly die for and the pools are everything to write home about. There was lots of privacy and space between the villas. The staff was absolutely wonderful and nothing was too much trouble. The bed was comfy and enormous and so was the bathroom. Everything outdoor was extremely well kept - I would have gladly rented the room just for the terrace and pool. Having said that, do not expect the real 5-star experience with all the extras and fine details. I was following the latest TA reviews before my trip and I really really wanted to disagree with a previous poster\u9225\u6a9a comments on kitsch, but kitsch it was. The place is in serious need of a d\u8305cor facelift and, at those prices, it should really consider replacing the scruffy towels. The sitting room is uncomfortable and uninviting; I doubt many people use that space. There is a serious bug issue although I personally didn\u9225\u6a9b have a problem with that - part and parcel of the luxury jungle experience I guess. Do not expect a proper turndown service, after struggling (with no luck) to get the mosquito net tucked into position the first night I had to ask them for a turndown service (and remind them every night). But I think what annoyed me most was the processed pineapple juice \u9225?a hotel that charges these prices should be able to come up with freshly squeezed pineapple juice \u9225?it\u9225\u6a9a so readily available all over Bali and I\u9225\u6a9de stayed at many cheaper and cheap hotels where fresh juice was the norm. Overall, I\u9225\u6a93 glad I went because those memories of sitting by the pool in awe and listening to the birds sing away and the river flow in the background are mine to keep forever.

Our Villa was perched high above the valley and had views across to distant vocanos .Very morning we opened the curtains and just gazed out in wonder, and this was from our bed!!!

Handcrafted stone work everywhere. Athough we were told the hotel was 80% occupied you hardly saw anyone else it was so quite , peaceful and very relaxing. The staff were very attentive and helpful and you could tell had great pride in the hotel which shone through in their `service.The only down side was it is quite a way from Ubud ( about 15min drive) and shuttles go very hour, but they were prepared to pick you up from where ever you were in Ubud which was great at night. Also the food at the Hotel was very limited and very expensive ( All prices in $US dollars) which was disappointing, but this made you get out and try some of Ubuds great resturaunts like Indus, Cafe Luna, and Mosaic.

Spending an hour at the pool in the moonlight or even in the rain, and then plunging into the hottub in the bathroom made me feel really relaxed and heavenly.In the morning I could see fogs flow along the Ayung River gorge, and the breakfast at the restaurant couldn't be better. It was not a buffet-type, but served course by course. The restaurant also had a great view, the food was that of a 5-star class, and the atmosphere was marvellous. There are many stairs up and down, so it may be a little problem for someone but was not for me. Rather I enjoyed it because the paths are beautifully decorated. As for the mosquito, my family never got a bite at Royal. I was also worried about it when I read the review below, so at the check-in time, I asked the staff to set up the mosqutto net, and before going to bed, I sprayed the mosquito repellent. (The mosquito spray is equipped in the villa) The mosquitto net is also very romantic, which hung high on the ceilling, and my son loved it.Overall, the hotel itself is an art, and I never thought it was expensive.
