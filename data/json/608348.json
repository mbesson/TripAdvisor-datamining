The location, at the top of La Ramblas and near to La Boqueria, is very convenient as it's a downhill walk south to the rest of Las Ramblas and Port Vell. It's a 5 minutes walk north to Plaza Catalunya, where there is the El Corte Ingles supermarket, the metro and various bus lines are. To the east, is Barri Gothic, where the Barcelona cathedral (not the Sagrada Familia) is nearby where one can watch the Sardana dance on Saturday and Sunday. So one can eat cheaply at La Boqueria or buy from the supermarket, and there are tons of eateries all around. The fan was a necessity in summer. Even on the fourth floor, one can hear some revellers and cleaning trucks in the wee hours, but it's bearable. The location on the 4th floor (91 steps!) - without a lift- can be a concern with heavy luggage or after a long day or both! The steps have been worn rather smooth and I slipped on a step once, going downstairs with luggage. My only feeling of discontent was the price which as compared with other cities is rather high, given the facilities.

Oh and it was clean, which is important. My friend and I had a twin room with shared toilets/showers and they were always clean. The staff was generally nice, except for one of the night staff. I got in on a flight to Reus just before midnight and had to take the shuttle to Barcelona, putting me in around 1:30am. I called the hostel asking directions from the Sants station to them by night bus. The person who was working the night shift did NOT speak English. I could NOT understand what he was saying, and he was very, VERY rude. So I ended up having to take a cab. I don't care if it's just the night shift, if your hostel advertises to English-speaking travelers, all of their staff, regardless of time of day should speak English. AND all of the staff should know how to get from the main train stations to the hostel at any time of day or night. When I finally arrived at the hostel, the same person was extremely rude to me. And the next night he was rude to my friend when she asked him a question. All the rest of the staff there were fine though. The other thing of note - we could hear street noise in our room. We did keep the window cracked for most of the time though. I suppose the rooms that were not facing the street probably did not hear street noise. Oh, and finally - they charge for internet if you don't have your own computer (I brought mine, but still I don't remember seeing it on their website that they charge for internet).
