It is clean and well maintained. The rooms are small but functional. The bed is comfortable and as in most German hotels the pillows soft and the comforter light. The hotel does not have air conditioning so the room can be quite warm in the summer even if you open the window. The bathroom is functional as is the squeeze soap and shampoo (all-in-one) dispenser in the bath/shower. The high speed wireless internet works well and is included in our company rate. Looking at the rate card it is quite expensive for access. The views from the rooms are splendid with all rooms looking over the park and the Leitzensee (a small lake). The breakfast is very good and the service friendly. There are plenty of restaurants close to the hotel for a pleasant meal in the evening without having to go far.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cAverage hotel, good location if in Berlin for conference alone\u201d", "Author": "SporeTripper", "ReviewID": "UR119637654", "Content": "Stay here as a conference hotel is fine.

Hotel is located in Charlottenburg, a peaceful part of Berlin, just a few minutes away from Berlin's Fair. On the shore of small lake Lietzensee, it is very romantic and perfect for those who want to combine business with pleasure. Relaxing in sauna or in swimming pool is excellent way to spend an evening after a busy work day. Rooms are very clean and most of them with the lake view. For Internet addicts, there is a wireless connection but it is extra charged. On the first flor, there are sauna, solarium and swimming pool which are free of charge for hotel guests. I strongly recommend all of it. :)) Next to the restaurant, there is a small, but a very nice bar.", "Date": "November 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cFantastic!\u201d", "Author": "Kee66", "ReviewID": "UR26573531", "Content": "This was a great hotel near the ICC and about 300 metres from a U-bahn station.

The staff were the friendliest of any place I've ever stayed and it's obvious that they're happy in their work and treated well. I really commend the management on this point. The dining room is lovely with high ceilings, really comfortable seats and massive windows looking out over the terrace and lake. The lake itself is quite pretty with plenty of mature trees surrounding it giving a nice view for a city hotel. Most of the bedrooms look out onto this lake which is another bonus. The dinner is absolutely outstanding with everything cooked from scratch (no nuking goes on here). I believe the single rooms are tiny so beware when booking - I had a double which I was very pleased with. The pool is small but it's not so small that you can't use it for exercise; there's a good sauna in the leisure centre too along with the most amazing power showers that give wonderful massages. It's quite close to the ICC which is convenient for business travellers and there's a supermarket called 'Kaiser's' two blocks away and about 6 or 7 very reasonable and recommended restaurants all within a 5 minute walk. There's a bus that brings you into the action (Number 100) about 60 seconds from the front of the hotel. The S-bahn and the U-Bahn are a little further away - approx 10 min walk. On the downside the wireless connection wasn't great in my room - it was a very weak signal that cut out quite a bit. The bar is a bit pokey and not very nice but they have a pretty good selection of beers, spirits and cocktails. This is a Ring Hotel and when I go back to Germany I will definitely consider staying at a hotel in this chain because I have not felt so comfortable in a hotel in a long time.", "Date": "October 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ystad, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel just outside the centre\u201d", "Author": "Coffe_N", "ReviewID": "UR7417610", "Content": "I stayed at the Seehof Hotel between 19-20 of April 2007 and I paid 99 euro including breakfast. WiFi is about another 12 euro extra a day. As the hotel had a four star ranking outside, I think the price was very, very reasonable. The hotel is located in a residential area and is very quiet and feels very safe. The location within Berlin is so-so as there is about 8-9 stops on the subway (less than 1 km away) until you are in the centre and in the local neighbourhood there isn\u2019t too much to see. The exterior of the hotel gives you a sudden feeling of something that has ran away from east Berlin but don\u2019t let that fool you. The hotel is located just by a small lake (big pond) and has a terrace overlooking the lake. Unfortunately, the weather didn\u2019t offer any terrace sitting opportunities. The check-in was quick and the staff (which goes for all the staff) was polite but efficient. The rooms are medium sized with a large bed (120 cm) which was VERY comfortable, one of the best I have had in a hotel ever. The room was very clean and all supplies hade been well stocked. Personally, I don\u2019t like this kind of room interior as I prefer more modern decoration instead of dark wood and carpeting. But that is just a matter of personal opinion so I don\u2019t take that into consideration when reviewing. There is a TV set with a whole bunch of German TV channels which basically means you won\u2019t watch any TV. The hotel restaurant is fair but slightly overpriced in my opinion and I have had much better meals in Germany for less. Though I would like to point out that the service is good and the kitchen is lightning-fast. Unfortunately we couldn\u2019t try the cocktail bar as the cocktail waitress seemed to have run away but there is a cocktail bar at least. Breakfast was good but nothing extraordinary. Given the price it was a good experience if you not are looking for a central Berlin hotel. My grade is something between a strong three and a weak four but I go for the four as the price was good and I hade a very nice night of sleep in a quiet room and an extremely comfy bed.", "Date": "April 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cOasis of Calm\u201d", "Author": "pablot", "ReviewID": "UR3882470", "Content": "I stayed at The Seehof for 3 nights when on business in Berlin.

One thing I would pick out for special mention was the the staff...they were absolutley superb. Nothing was too much trouble, their English was excellent and every one had a smile on their faces.
