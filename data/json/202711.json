We absolutely loved our room, it had balconies with old Venetian doors, a nice modern bathroom with a tub and was very clean and had all the typical venetian decor. Down the hall from our room was an outdoor patio that felt very private. The staff here is genuine and gave us great recommendations when we asked. They also never seemed bothered by our requests for ice and corkscrews, etc. The location of the hotel couldn't be better as it's close to the Accademia bridge, so all the main sights are only a 15 minute walk. We took the 110 Euro private water taxi as we were splitting it with another couple and because we had a lot of bags with us. It dropped you off right in front of the hotel and was a nice way to arrive. It took about 35 minutes from Marco Polo Airport.

One piece of advice: if you arrive via the airport, do yourself a favor and take a water taxi to your hotel.

Both the hotel and staff thoroughly deserve the repeated praise: I really enjoyed my short stay and having visited Venice previously, I think its my favourite hotel to date. I booked online from London with ease: my amended request (for a non-smoking room) was acknowledged speedily and on arrival check-in was courteous, speedy and very efficient - I was even greeted by name. The hotel itself is very attractive: bright and well-furnished, without being too OTT: a set of framed contemporary monochrome photos (of Venice, naturally) sticks in my memory. It has no elevator but the stairs are wide and shallow, so getting to my room was no real effort (and staff were on hand to assist with luggage) My first floor single room (No. 103) was compact without feeling cramped. It was spotlessly clean and well equipped: tea/coffee making facilities were very welcome after a long day's walking; the bed was very comfortable and the shower room/toilet very modern, with quality fixtures. NB: The window faces the adjacent building (also part of the hotel) so there is only a narrow view of the canal. I caught a glimpse of a double room with canal view, whilst the maid was making it up, and this looked very nice indeed. Maybe next time? Breakfast, which is served in a bright, ground floor lounge, was very good with a wide range of options: juices; fruit; cereal; rolls & pastries; meats & cheeses plus fresh tea, coffee or hot chocolate on request. The three staff there were all very pleasant and attentive, as were all the hotel staff I encountered - even the night porter. Marco on reception speaks excellent English and was very helpful - he even lent me a mouse to get my laptop working! His colleague, a blonde lady, suggested some restaurant options, marking directions/locations on a map.

The location is terrific, within easy walking distance of just about everything, including many excellent restaurants and shops. The room was fine, the bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was small but adequate. We asked for an upgrade to a canal-view room, but no luck. Now, the not so good news. It can be noisy. We awakened nearly every morning way too early to what sounded like someone throwing bricks into a wheelbarrow. But you couldn't close the windows because the room was warm, and the air conditioning was not available. And with the windows were open, the mosquitoes came in. And finally, the breakfast leaves a lot to be desired. There's enough to eat, and they have a multi-choice automatic coffee maker, but jn the end it's a pretty basic cafeteria-style experience. The problem is, a simple breakfast at a nearby cafe will run you close to $40 or so. If we came back to Venice, we'd look for a place with a few more amenities in the same general neighborhood.

We were immediately given great recommendations on resturants, key sites to visit, and they offered to book reservations and water taxis for us.

The Hotel American Dinesen is located just steps from the Accademia bridge and about a fifteen minute walk from either the Rialto or St. Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. It is extremely convenient to reach by either the Number 1 or 2 vaporetto. By vaporetto, the trip is less than a half-hour from the railroad station and much cheaper than a water taxi. There is one bridge, with a dozen steps, to cross from the Accademia stop but if you let the hotel know you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re at the bridge, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d send a bellman down to help with large bags. He helped us over the bridge when we left. We opted for a superior room and found the size of our room to be ample, even by American standards. By European standards it was quite large. The view from our window was spectacular. A canal directly in front and the Grand Canal less than a hundred yards to the right. Even facing a secondary canal, the room was very quiet. The modern windows do an excellent job of reducing noise and with the exterior shutters closed it was virtually silent. The room had a Murano chandelier and exposed beams, although I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure whether the beams were really for support or merely decoration. Although it was early October when we stayed, the temperature was still rather warm but the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s air conditioning was both quiet and effective. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Breakfast was standard for solid, but not luxury, Italian hotels. The only (minor) drawback to the hotel is that there is no elevator. Our room was on the 3rdh floor (by European numbering, which is the 4th floor by American reckoning) and the last flight of stairs was a killer at the end of the day. There are superior rooms on the lower floors and when we return we would ask for a 2nd floor room. This is not the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault. They have requested permission to install an elevator, but in Venice this is difficult to obtain due to historic preservation regulations. Of course, the bellman takes care of carrying your luggage up to your room.

From there you can easily visit the whole city, which we did by foot, not needing to take vaporettos or water taxis. We booked a double superior canal view room for two nights on which we got a very good internet rate. The room was awesome. We got the first floor corner room on the second (white) building with a balcony overlooking the canal and an extra window on the side.

The bathroom was also well equipped and very clean and up to date. Breakfast was included and served in the dining room. It was not lavish but they served everything you need to start your day. I agree with most of the reviews I have read about the staff. They were overtly friendly and helpful. Checking in went perfectly and at check out they stored our bags so that we could visit some more till we had to go.

Okay, if you really want to hear a minus point, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the only one I could think of.

On the other hand, the bellhop, who had to make mulitple trips up the stairs to our third floor rooms carring all of our luggage - there are no elevators - was very courteous and never complained. The guest rooms were very small. After we settled in I went downstairs to ask the concierge for a knife, and some glasses and plates. We had traveled through the Chianti region, and Parma and Prosecco, and we wanted to relax with some wine, cheese and proscuitto we bought during are trip before we went out. I was rudely told that we could not have these items, and he angrily warned me that we better not spill red wine in the room. Shocked at this admonishment, I went outside and found a little shop where I purchased a knife, and some paper plates and plastic cups. My husband, who did not know of my efforts, went into the restaurant or kitched area and spoke with the chef who was accommodating, and provided him with a sharp knife and a platter. We later learned that the concierge was furious the chef did this, and he actually WENT INTO OUR ROOMS AFTER WE WENT OUT TO TAKE BACK THE PLATTER AND THE KNIFE! Which, by the way, we had washed and dried and were going to return in the morning. I doubt that the hotel had a knife and platter shortage of an emergency nature and really needed our one knife and platter back that night. We stayed for two nights, and never got a warm or friendly vibe from anyone on staff except for the bellhop and the woman concierge who was working the front day on the Sunday morning we checked out. She actually smiled asnd engaged in conversation with us. Everyone else made us feel very unwelcome. Everywhere else my family and I travelled through Italy was amazing. The people we met were fantastic - warm, friendly, and accomodating, and the staff at the other hotels we visted were great.

We arrived at the hotel at 11 AM and we were quite happy when the staff advised that we could check into our room early. The staff seemed to anticipate what we needed before we asked. We were provided with maps, suggestions for restaurants, sights to see, access to concert tickets if we wanted, a free taxi ride to Murano, and free wifi Internet access! On our departure day, the hotel stored our luggage after we checked out so we could spend a little more time exploring Venice before we had to leave for the airport. It is not easy to find clean restrooms around the city. When we returned to the hotel to claim our luggage, we were offered restroom access without asking for it. The beds at Hotel American and the other 2 hotels we stayed at were very firm. We are accustomed to a softer bed, so be prepared for a firm bed. The pillows were also very firm.

We found our water bus, found the stop, and made it to the hotel, piece of cake. The hotel is located in a very quiet part of Venice away from the tourist mobs. We all had rooms overlooking the small canal in front. It was very quiet. Breakfasts were the typical breakfasts found in most Italian hotels: rolls, meats, cheeses, some eggs, and cereal. Perfect for us.

The Rialto Bridge and Fish Market are a little further away, but we walked to these landmarks as well. The hotel has no elevator, but that was not a problem for us. A generous breakfast and a tour to the Island of Murano is included with your hotel stay. However, I believe the tour does not include the return trip and you must buy that separately from the vaporetti (waterbus) company. All the staff is very nice and attentive, especially the gentlemen that helpswith the luggage and the breakfast room staff. The rooms are a little pricey and not a good value for the cost. However, we did enjoy our stay. I recommend purchasing unlimited waterbus transportation if you are staying for 3 days or so. The venicelink website charges 60 euros per person ofr the unlimited prestige pass, if you prepay it and this includes your to and from airport transfers, unlimited on and off the various stops, as well as the Islands tour (Murano, Burano and Torcello) and the Civic Museums (Dolce Palace, etc.) and Churches. Note, it does not include entrance to St. Mark's Basilica. Also note that we saw people being turned away from entering the Basilica after making a long line because no sleeveless tops, no shorts and no backpacks are allowed. For a great meal, visit Giudecca Island and have lunch at the Alla Palanca Restaurant. This Island is directly accross the Zattere stop (the stop of for the Hotel).

The outside garden was a fabulous secluded spot to enjoy a chilled glass of prosecco in the evening or an early morning coffee. The free wifi was a great bonus.

The service throughout the hotel both in the dining room and at reception was excellent but not intrusive. We were thrilled with the location of the hotel in Dorsoduro. The canal that the hotel is on is gorgeous but just far enough away from the crowds. The Peggy Guggenheim museum was just around the corner and there were some interesting arty shops nearby. There were also some great book shops and other interesting places a stones throw away in the studenty areas. We had lots of lovely walks around the area in the early evening and found some great places to eat all with lovely views. The hotel's location close to the 'Academia' bridge means that all the major attractions including St Marks Square and the Rialto Markets are only a short walk away.

These were more budget type restaurants but the food was very good especially at the second one. Both cost about 55 Euros for two including drinks.

We had a twin room with a beautiful view of the picturesque San Vio canal. The room was a good size with plenty of storage, flat screen tv, heating/aircon, mini bar and electric shutters. No tea/coffee making facilities though so bring your travel kettle. The bathroom was modern with a bath with overhead shower. Breakfast was available from 7.30 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10am and was plentiful. It was buffet service with a member of staff serving tea/coffee. Food consisted of cereals, fruit, croissants, jams/spreads, eggs, ham, cheese, toast, juices\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.. For 2.50 euro you could have breakfast brought up to you. We found the hotels location to be quiet and very convenient, just a few steps away from a small campo on the Grand Canal and barely 2 minutes from the Accademia bridge and vaparetto stop (1 of only 3 bridges over the Grand Canal) which means you can reach San Marco square in under 10 mins (once you know the route through the maze of alley ways!) and also only a minutes walk in the opposite direction to the Zattere (promenade overlooking Guidecca, which also has a price-busting Billa supermarket at the western end) We walked all over the city for the first 2 days and thought it was absolutely stunning. We got a 12 hour vaparetto pass for our last day as our legs were rather tired! If you are taking young children to Venice, leave the pushchair at home! The countless bridges would make getting around the city very arduous. A cheap way of getting across the Grand Canal if you are not near a bridge is by using a tragetti \u00e2\u20ac\u201c look out for the signs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c these are small gondolas which take you over the canal for 50 cents (you may have to stand up on the small boat so make sure you have good balance!). This is also a great way of getting the gondola experience without the hefty price tag.

The hotel staff were always available to ask questions and were courteous and helpful with offers of umbrellas and wellies if needed. The American is in a brilliant location and I would return to Dorsoduro because it is so well placed. From here we walked all over Venice but it is only a 10 min walk to St Marks Square and about 2 minutes to the Accademia bridge, a minute the other direction takes you to the Peggy Guggenheim museum. Not that we went into any museums, Venice is one big museum and we just walked around for 4 days in wonder - absolutely beautiful. The hotel is less than a minute to walk to the end of the street and you are standing at the edge of the Grand Canal, but it is in a very quiet area so no problems with noisy boats etc. The apartments look out onto the San Vio canal and walking straight out onto the canal each morning was lovely. A couple of minutes took you to either the vaporetto stop by the Accademia, or walk the other way and you are onto the Zattere within a few minutes with more vaporetto stops. It was lovely to walk along the Zattere in the late afternoon and evening where you can catch the last of the sun (further into Venice you don't get this because of the buildings casting so much shade) and go for a walk along the promenade. One of the best icecream bars along the Zattere only minutes away, and a Billa supermarket at the end of the Zattere so easy for picking up shopping. The apartment was pretty basic but suited us as we were out a lot. It was off a central lobby with two other apartments - we found it quiet which was good. The apartment consists of one large room with sofabed and kitchenette; adjoining shower room/toilet and an upstairs mezzanine with double bed, safe and wardrobe. The kitchenette is limited to a hob, sink and fridge. It would have been good to have a microwave or oven and we found that limited its usefulness. The windows of the apartment are quite high so unfortunately you cannot get the view of the canal from the ground floor of the apartment, but you can see it from the mezzanine which has the double bed. Sofabed downstairs was fine and comfortable enough. Good powerful shower. Large clean shower room/toilet. Overall, this apartment suited our budget this time around, but I would upgrade another time to get a room with a view and slightly more luxurious surroundings. I would however consider coming to the hotel again and definitely think Dorsoduro is an ideal location. In the evenings, or by late afternoon, we were tired mostly because of all the walking all day. This location is lovely and with a very short walk to the Zattere, you feel you are at the seaside and can unwind away from the business of the centre of Venice. Tips: buy the vaporetto tickets which you can get to last several days as they are well worth it. After a long walk around Venice, it is good either to get you back to your hotel, or to just sit and sightsee while resting your legs. We also found that if you want to 'picnic' in Venice it isn't easy. They don't seem to believe in benches so you simply cannot find somewhere to sit while you eat. Very tiring too as you are constantly on the go.

I took the Alilaguna waterbus from the airport and it is a straighforward walk from the Zattere stop to the hotel, with a only a ramped bridge to cross. It is a notably pretty hotel from the outside, painted a warm yellow with flower filled window boxes. Inside, the decor is fairly ornate. I had a room on the first floor (ie the one above the entrance floor) - although there is no elevator, there is a porter to carry bags up the not very steep staircase. My room was small but adequate - it was a single, with a single bed, but I saw into the double next door in passing and that looked generally more spacious. It was adequate to my needs, with a sweet little balcony that had a side view onto the canal. The bed was quite firm, which I prefer, but those who like softer beds should enquire about whether they have variations. Although I had neighbours either side, I did not experience any sound from them or from outside the hotel - something that is very important for my sleep! The bathroom was modern and sparklingly clean, with a decent sized, 'proper' shower cubicle. The housekeeping was generally very good (especially the bathroom) but I thought the carpet in the bedroom (although vacuumed throughly) was due for an end of season shampoo - my only slightly negative thought about the whole experience. A very fresh and generous breakfast buffet was served in a room behind the small lounge area - a wide choice of breads, pastries, cereals, meats and cheeses, and juices with a big bowl of fresh (no tins) fruit salad .

The hotel also has it's own jetty so if you want to take a water taxi they can stop outside the door but this will cost around 95 Euros if you take one to or from the airport but if there is a group this may be cost effective way of travelling - the vaporetta is 13 euros each.

There is a restaurant right next door if you don't want to stray far for food although it is a little pricey but many more are within easy reach expecially along the waterfront looking out across Canale della Guidecca.

The area around this hotel and the Academia is much less traveled, much more authentic, and really perfect for your stay. For those that don't know Venice, even if you stay here away from the tourists, you'll be able to walk to St. Marks in 10-15 min easy and perhaps a few moments more to Rialto. And because everything is so beautiful, you won't even know that you are walking. In any case, if you stay amongst the tourists you will be treated like tourists in that your hotel staff will have no patience for you, the food you eat will be standard fare at outrageous prices, and you will get the American experience of Venice as you are overrun by large crowds. It's everything you don't want. This hotel, on the other hand, is everything you do want. Close enough to walk easily to all of the major sites in Venice yet far enough not to be around obnoxious tourists. The area around the hotel is a student area or very close to it so the restaurants are good and much less expensive. And if you want a night life, something Venice mostly lacks, you are much closer to it staying around here. And this says nothing of the property itself. It's clean, the staff is friendly, and the apartments next door (just next door, close enough for the free wi-fi, don't worry) are a fantastic value. They area spacious and for almost the same price as a smaller room inside the hotel you get your own space. Breakfast isn't included in the apartments but if you want it you can pay a bit extra.

This is the real Venice - yet just an enjoyable walk away you can be in the midst of the must-see venues of San Marco. Once the mandatory visits there, try hanging out in the quiet calles and campos of Dorsoduro. Explore beyond Accademia Bridge deep into Dorsoduro to uncover its daily life.

Alexandre is usually tied up by the foot bridge across from the hotel. I highly rcommend that you take a gondola ride with him. He speaks English very well and he does a great tour which takes you across the Grand Canal to smaller interesting quaint canals. Again, he is also apart of the neighbourhood charisma.

We were warmly greeted as returning guests (after 30 years!) and were permitted an early check-in. The room was not large but well appointed and large enough for two tall people and luggage, and the bathroom was a welcome more modern space than our 1980 bathroom.

I'm glad I did. The Hotel American Dinesen is located in the picturesque Dorsoduro area, beside the San Vio canal (which runs off the Grand Canal, just after the Accademia vaporetto stop.) It is very easy to reach. When you arrive at Venice Santa Lucia railway station, walk straight out the front to the Grand Canal, where you will find a booth selling tickets for the Vaporetto (small passenger ferries that carry people up and down the Grand Canal and around the island.) Buy a Vaporetto ticket (it is cheaper to buy a three-day ticket if you're staying that long) and look for a Vaporetto going to the Accademia stop. Each Vaporetto has a destination board, so it's not hard to work out where they stop. Accademia is the third bridge along the Grand Canal (takes about 15 minutes pleasant cruising down the Grand Canal to reach it) and you'll recognise it as you approach because it is the only bridge across the Grand Canal made of wood. Get off the Vaporetto at Accademia, and walk left, right, and left again, and you'll see 100 yards in front of you a small white marble arched bridge crossing the San Vio Canal. Cross this bridge and turn right, and you will see the Hotel American in front of you! Easy! The walk from Vaporetto stop to Hotel takes two minutes, so you are really close to the main transport up and down the Grand Canal and to all the sights, but just a little away from all the crowds. This is good for two reasons. First, the area is quieter ... the million-odd tourists who visit Venice every day don't really venture into Dorsoduro. Second, the rooms in hotels hereabouts tend to be larger and less expensive than hotels closer to the Rialto Bridge or St Mark's Square. So Dorsoduro is a great suburb to stay in, and it has some great restaurants, like the Ristorante San Trovaso which is our favourite. The Hotel American Dinesen is actually two 18th Century buildings linked by an overhead bridge. The rooms are large, and many have baths, and overall they felt fresh and clean and attractive. Each of the front rooms has a small balcony overlooking the San Vio canal (see photos). The hotel serves breakfast in a front room each morning, and has a free internet service. A short walk outside brings you to the Accademia museum and the Peggy Guggenheim foundation and lots of other interesting sights along the Grand Canal. It's great fun exploring the little canals and laneways; bridges, shops, restaurants, palaces, churches and sights from here. You can also reach both the Piazza San Marco and the Rialto Bridge on foot or by Vaporetto (they run from Accademia every few minutes.) We booked a front room with canal view by email and had no problem whatsoever. The staff were friendly, the location was ideal for us, and we will be staying here again whenever we return to Venice.", "Date": "April 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chandler, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cStaff went out of their way.\u201d", "Author": "srhs1961", "ReviewID": "UR61299858", "Content": "We stayed a the Hotel American Dinesen March 30 and 31, 2010.

The location was perfect - especially when arriving, it was only a 5 minute walk from the Alilaguna stop at Zattere and very easy to find. It was near the common tourists spots: San Marco and Accademia - the former was a 20min walk away which was a really pretty walk (although doing in the middle of the day meant battling with the rest of the tourist crowd!) but could also be easily reached via vaporetto from Accademia (5 min walk from the hotel) or Zattere. The rooms were lovely and the one I booked was a standard double room. Although it didn't have a direct view of the canal, you could see if by leaning a bit out of the window - and it was probably quieter at night being off the canal anyway! The room was beautiful, a great size and was well furnished with no signs of wear and tear. It was very clean and the staff cleaned it each day - making it look perfect each time I came back from a busy day of sightseeing. The airconditioning was bliss since the temperatures were 28-30C each day I was there. I didn't have a problem with mosquitos like some others have mentioned, but apparently I was there at the good time (according to others I've spoken with!). The TV in the room (with lots of english channels - or at least channels that could be changed to english) and free WiFi were definitely welcome! The staff were welcoming - the front desk staff weren't as welcoming as I was expecting - however they did answer all of my questions and after a day or so were lovely. The breakfast staff were very efficient and the cleaners did a brilliant job. Breakfast was good - I think it was pretty standard fare but gave you a good start to a busy day of walking around the city! I'd definitely come back - and as an incentive, they give a \"Fidelity Card\" when you check out - with 10-15% savings for your next visit - I'd use it but it wouldn't be the reason I'd come back - the real reason was because it was a great 3 star hotel that couldn't be faulted!", "Date": "September 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful hotel in a perfect location\u201d", "Author": "MBColumbus", "ReviewID": "UR38834712", "Content": "This hotel is perfectly located - it is on the quiet, neighborhood area of Dorsoduro which is across the Grand Canal from the tourist sections, yet is a two minute walk to the Accademia Bridge and Museum, and to the Peggy Guggenheim Museum.

The journey began in Venice and our base there was the Hotel American Dinesen. A caveat: we travel a step above backpackers. Two soft-sided expandable (Steves-type) bags and two shoulder bags for travel guides, cameras, electronics, etc. are all we need. Venice is expensive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even in the off-season \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so we shopped for a good hotel with a reasonable rate and a convenient location. The Dinesen fit the bill. It is in a quiet neighborhood on a small canal very close to Accademia and the Guggenheim. The airport bus docks at Zattere (the last stop) on the Canale della Giudecca, which is just a short walk (the equivalent of 2 U.S. city blocks) to the hotel. From the Stazione (train), a water bus will leave you at the Accademia stop on the Grand Canal. From here it is a longer walk (3-4 U.S. city blocks). If you are burdened with lots of luggage, consider a water taxi to the front door of the hotel. Our room was a typical size for Europe. Not big by U.S. standards, but comfortable and clean. It had a large (king), low, firm bed with enough walk-around room. The bath was new and exceptionally clean. However, some folks will have trouble negotiating the tall-sided bathtub. It requires a high step over to get into the tub for bath or shower. Breakfast was very good. The dining area was bright, clean and nicely decorated. The offering was typical of all the hotels we stayed in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c several cereals, salami, ham, cheese, a basket of rolls, three juices, croissants, yogurt, fresh fruits, hard boiled eggs, and, of course, choice of hot chocolate, tea or coffee. It was all good quality. Service was above average \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it was off-season. The hotel staff was pleasant, helpful and friendly. The hotel offers wi-fi in your room. Just get a logon/password from the front desk and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in business. My IPOD Touch worked just fine and I was able to e-mail the family about our daily adventures. There is a computer available in the lounge area. Venice is a great walking city and the hotel is about a 15-to-20-minute walk to St. Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s across bridges, down narrow streets, plazas and back alleys. Signs on the side of buildings point you in the right direction. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great walk. Of course, you could take a water bus from the nearby Accademia stop on the Grand Canal. I have /will also review hotels in Florence, Sorrento and Rome, and I will comment on personal security in Italy in the near future.

The ambience is totally Venician - Venician mirrors, glass chandeliers and lights. Nothing was too much trouble for the breakfast staff. Although on arrival, the receptionist was rather off-hand and it was initially a struggle to convince him we had booked a twin room, when he noticed it was on the booking form, he grumbled something and didn't apologise. The room was made up as a twin while we were out.

The neighborhood is quiet, especially at night but you are just a few minutes from the bridge which brings you to the area surrounding St. Marks, a place which is nice to leave due to the crush of tourists in the day time.

The room was without doubt the smallest hotel room i have ever stayed in, being L shaped the bed at one end had about 10inches space either side of the bed and wall, when getting into bed you had to walk sideways between the bed and the wall. A pair of doors opened out onto a small balcony looking out over the roof tops, there was a wardrobe,mini bar,sideboard/chest,one chair and a flat screen tv with sky. The bathroom had recently been refurbished and was very nice with the exception on the small bath(i believe one of the venice xperts had the same trouble getting into the bath lol) The breakfast was ample with plenty of variety setting you up for the day. The best part of the hotel was the staff, reception,breakfast,cleaningetc, all staff were very friendly and helpful. Checked a few of the rooms and they all seemed to be of differing sizes,which as the hotel was converted from a residence ,i suppose is the only way it could be done. I discussed the size of the room (206) with the reception staff,who informed me that prior to my next stay,if i e mail them, they will make sure i have a different room.The size of the room did not bother us too much as when we stay in venice the room is for sleeping and baggage storage. The hotel is in a nice area of the dorsoduro a few minutes from the accademia, peggy guttenheims etc. Getting to the hotel from the airport,1) water taxi to the hotel, 2)alilaguna to the zattere, then a few minutes walk 3) bus to the piazzale roma then vaporetto to accademia and few minutes walk. Lots of places to eat in the area, my favourite is the ristorante san trovaso where the food is good and the staff are very friendly.

The bathroom was exquisite, the bed comfortable and the view was amazing! Hotel was extremely clean. We only enjoyed breakfast one morning because of our early morning schedules. It was fabulous compared to other Venice hotels I had just stayed at. We had an early morning flight so we were forced to take a water taxi (be prepared to have sticker shock!!!). It was $150 for a 30 minute ride to the airport. There is virtually no other way to get there that early without taking a taxi. It was pure luxury and very nice but unfortunately my pocketbook doesn't always allow for such splurges on a regular basis. The hotel does have a private dock though which they alway had lit with candles. It was beautiful at night. Now for the not so great things. I agree with the earlier post of the staff not being warm and fuzzy. Never really felt welcome by anyone at the front desk. Never felt they really wanted to help us with our excursions, water taxis, water buses, etc. When we checked out I gave the man my credit card to pay with and he promptly told me they declined it. I knew there was no way that was possible and told him to try it again. Again, seeming miffed, he did and it went through. We generally had some problems with the locals as they really don't seem like they want to welcome Americans. The girl in the breakfast room was quite nice, although she spoke no English. Another thing that I wasn't quite pleased with was that the internet was right in front of the front desk. I felt like I was being watched. Also, on the desk with the internet computer is a sign that asks people to go to tripadvisor to \"upgrade\" their internet status.

We'd booked a double superior room with a canal view and were not disappointed with room 302 on the top floor. It was a lovely large room with great views of the canal and a decent sized bathroom with a modern suite. It really got our visit to Venice off to the best possible start. The location of the hotel is excellent - just off the Grand Canal and only two minutes walk from the Accademia Bridge taxi stop. The hotel was close enough to explore all the main attractions, while still being away from the hustle and bustle around the San Marco district. You really appreciate the tranquil atmosphere the area offers, particularly in the evenings when you want to unwind and relax. All the hotel facilities were good (there's a security safe in the room and an internet facility in the lobby) and we found all the hotel staff friendly and very helpful throughout our stay. The cold buffet breakfast with croissants and plenty of Italian coffee was the perfect way to start the day. We took advantage of the Orange Venice Card on our arrival at Marco Polo Airport, which turned out to be a great investment. It covered the Alilaguna boat transfer to San Zaccaria (next to St Marks), with unlimited use of the vaporetti (water taxis) around Venice and entrance to many of the city's museums and churches. We were able to make good use of the public transport, with visits to the island of Murano (to see the glass factories and shops) and the Lido to take in the Venice Film Festival (unfortunately we didn't spot Keira Knightley or Jude Law, who were both attending their film premiers). The Lido has a very different feel to the other islands of Venice with a long sandy beach and overlooked by grand hotels and private villas. Certainly a resort for the rich & famous, but great to explore or just chill out on the beach. We enjoyed three fantastic days in Venice and would definitely return to the American Dinesen Hotel again.

I'm generally a very positive person and I stay at a lot of hotels in Europe and the US and don't write a lot of reviews but felt compelled to write this one. Trip advisor reviews set expectations very high and they were not met. It was overpriced (2 rooms - 285 and 325 + EU per night) and overrated although I really can't compare it to any other hotel in Venice. The hotel is old and feels dated. Its tacky and very small - dead mosquitos and stains extremely worn rug . Let me also say that the \"free\" internet access had a nice big sign next to it asking for people to post thier comments on Trip Advisor - my compliments to the shrewd management - I think that's cheating though. No wonder there were so many comments ! The charming Canal smelled in room 201 - many Mosquitos at night - I saw rat outside the front door of the hotel ! And another 2 on either side! Where should my family walk - or should we take a gondola? I called the front desk twice from the US to try to arrange tours in advance and they said \"wait until you get here\". Once I got there they had nothing but excuses for a secret tour of Dogges Palace. I finaly got a walking guide with my own contacts. Breakfast was very weak. Service was great though. The bellman was great but what's up with no elevator? The blonde at the front desk was not helpfull the one day she was there. She made me feel we were bothering here.

The Dorsoduro area, where the hotel is, is less crowded and touristy than San Marco and Rialto, ( ergo, a good night's sleep) but no less lovely with lots of shops, bars and restaurants a stroll away. The Zattero waterfront is at the end of the street, again with restaurants and bars and a great view of part of the lagoon. We travelled with two teenage girls who were enchanted with their 'padded' silk walls and the free access to the internet which meant they were able to keep in touch with friends on MSN. Having seen rates for other hotels in the city, The American is superb value for money and we were all agreed that it's three star rating could easily have been higher in any other city. When we return to Venice we will definitely stay at the American again. As a further recommendation, if you are staying for more than a day or so, buy the Venice Card. We had blue ones for E52 (for 7 days) which meant unlimited travel on the vaporettos (E5 for a single trip and a queue to buy them otherwise) which probably paid for themselves in the first two days.

The breakfasts at the hotel were much less interesting than you would get at any Holiday Inn in the USA or U.K. -even leaving out the cooked breakfast which I guess is not popular in Italy! It was very limited and I was disappointed to see individually wrapped processed cheese (no other cheese!) for breakfast every morning. The location of the hotel is great - by a quiet canal, and as everyone else has said, away from the crowds of San Marco. The hotel staff were really helpful and recommended some good restaurants nearby such as the Trattoria San Troveso just round the corner, We found the restaurant with the same name (and similar menu) just as nice. Gelateria Nico, by the Zattere water bus stop, is wonderful and cheap and just a short walk from the hotel. Venice is a lovely place, and this part of Venice particularly so. However, we were a bit disappointed by the hotel itself. I think the rooms are probably rather variable-probably those with a canal view might be particularly nice, but there doesn't seem to be a choice of these when you have a 3 or 4 bedded room.

We travelled from Liverpool on Ryanair and after the 45 minute bus ride from the airport arrived in Venice just before 4pm. On exiting the bus at the Pallaze de Roma you turn left to the vaporetto stop where 6 euros will buy you a ticket to Accademia. Be prepared to change at Rialto too. The hotel was exactly as described and we had picked this hotel after reading reviews on tripadvisor. We had a Superior Canal View room, which was clean, comfortable and a decent size. I have attached photos of the view from the balcony but in essence, we didn't really get any benefit from the view as we were out the whole time there. Marco on reception was helpful with our reservation for a local restaurant which was where many locals ate and although not a romantic spot, was excellent cuisine. Breakfast was excellent, and we had the tourist trap gondola ride from Paulo who was located outside the hotel which was convenient to say the least. The thing that we liked best was the location in the arty district of Accademia/Dorsoduro. We walked to the Campo San Marghrita where the square was full of Venetians drinking and relxaing in the outdoor cafes. We went mask shopping at the two most renowned mask makers in Venice, Mondonovo and Ca'Macana, and loved the fact that the hotel was an easy 15 minute walk to Piazza San Marco and about 20 to Rialto. Our favourite experience was walking into a traditional Venitian restaurant in San Marco and sitting amongst locals for the best meal of our trip. I have attached a photo but as with everyone's trips to Venice, the fun isn't just the gondola, Bellinis at Harry's, and the sights, it is walking and walking finding your own favourite spots, and your own experiences. Even the fog and the 10 hour late return home didn't dampen our trip, just our impression of Ryanair. These are a few of our experiences, but regarding the hotel, we would definitely return but a normal room would suffice for our next trip.

Our plans were getting close to the trip date and she wanted to be sure we had a room before committing a LOT of frequent-flyer miles to get there. We then researched many other hotels in Venice, and decided that we actively wanted to stay at the American-Dinesen (despite the name, which these days is unfortunate, I'm afraid. We hear it will be shortened to its original Hotel Dinesen soon.) The staff were exceptionally helpful. We had to call (speaking no Italian) about some details, and then exchanged e-mails related to the fact that we shipped luggage \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this was immediately after the first no-gel-no-liquid thing, and we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure what we could get with us on the airlines. In all these dealings, the concierge, named Marco, was wonderful, welcoming and informative. Even the night clerk, who claimed his English wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very good, helped us out at one point on the phone. When we arrived, the staff lived up to what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d experienced long-distance. They helped us locate the Venice Architect Bienniale offices and get opening hours that weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t published anywhere, got us tickets to what was probably the best classical music concert I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever been to (without charging us a commission), and referred us to a couple excellent restaurants. The location, in Dorsoduro, was easy to get to and thus encouraged us to venture afar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but was far enough from the center to avoid the throngs. For Venice, the prices were reasonable. The room that we got had a real view of a real (that is, work-a-day) canal, with a balcony big enough for two of us, barely, to stand and watch the traffic. besides being very beautiful, the canal provided a big part of our enjoyment because we got to see the amazing array of activities that Venice carries out by boat. Boats specializing in delivering one very specific thing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c furniture, beer, vegetables, the mail, as well as construction materials and garbage collection went by, as did several gondolas (but not the traffic-jam of them around San Marco) and a racing boat with six standing oarsmen. it was noisy early in the morning, but nothing unusual if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve lived in any big city. The last night, there was a miscommunication \u00e2\u20ac\u201cwe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d stated our last day to stay, but in Europe, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standard to specify the day of departure. So we were one night short, and the hotel was heavily booked. Marco managed to find a cancellation. The room was much smaller and less romantic, with a view of an ordinary side garden. But we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to uproot ourselves and re-orient for the last night there. Had we stayed only in the smaller room, our week would have been less perfect \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but we spent so much time walking and boating around that it would have been alright. (By the way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Venice Card is good for peace of mind about transportation, but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll never break even on it just for vaporettos. If you plan to hustle to a long list of museums, it is unquestionably a great deal.) One reason we picked the hotel was that there were so many positive comments on TripAdvisor and so few negative ones. The only negatives we saw were about the breakfast, and we disagree. The breakfast was generous, with very good coffee (and refills), fresh croissants and other breads, cereal, juice, yogurt, eggs, and salami or ham. It was the same every day, yes. But for those who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t manage on a pastry and a cappuccino, Italian style, it was an important advantage to staying here. Breakfast in a street caf\u00c3\u00a9 is always an option once you get oriented.

The entire staff was friendly and willing to answer any questions we had. I am rather surprise at a recent post regarding a rude employee during the evening shift. Even if he was as rude as described, the hotel as a whole is outstanding. Location- Couldn't be better! It is away from the ridiculous crowds at St. Marks square but only a 10-15 min walk or 1 vapparreto stop away. After spending several days in Rome and Florence, we were sick of crowds and were so happy to be a safe distance away. Staff- Everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful. They even arranged for a water taxi to pick us up at the hotel and take us to a glass factory on Murano island and back for free. Granted, the glass factory is the one who pays the water taxi fare but I would not have thought to get to Murano island this way had the hotel staff not recommended it. Even if you have no desire to buy glass, it is an excellent way to get a free water taxi ride through the back canals on your way yo Murano. You just have to look interested in glass for about 10 minutes while you are at the glass factory. Rooms- We were in room 201 which was the corner room on the second floor. It was small but very clean and has A/C. Room size was not an issue because we were never in the room except to sleep and change. It had three large windows with views of the canal the hotel is on, as well as the Grand Canal about 40 yards away. You can even walk out on the tiny balconies attached to each window and take in the atmosphere. Bathroom was small but very clean and appeared new. Breakfast- Outstanding for Italian standards. All cold items but this was typical for all hotels we stayed at in Italy. Be sure to get a cappaccino which is free and delicious. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Venice. For the price, it cannot be matched in Venice. If you pay in cash at checkout they will give you a 5% discount not to mention you won't have to pay the 3% that American Credit Card companies charge for the international transaction fee. Also, if you show up without a reservation, you can get a room cheaper but you run the risk of there being no rooms available. While I was using the free internet in the lobby I watched a customer walk in without a reservation and get a room for EUR 100 for the night but I it didn't have a canal view.

My husband and I arrived early and spent two days in a beautiful room overlooking the canal. It was wonderful. Then we were moved to another huge, amazing room (suite-sized)where we remained the rest of our stay. We then had 21 American college students arrive. We taught an English class there for two weeks. The staff was exceptionally understanding, never having had a group before. They graciously let us use the breakfast room in the afternoons for our classes (we toured the city, museaums, islands in the mornings). The breakfasts were wonderful and all of the staff members were curteous, friendly, and helpful. The rooms were clean, well furnished, and spacy for a small European hotel.

I must honestly say that the hotel itself was acceptable, had a nice location and was quiet. The room size and quality was also acceptable. But I do not recommend this hotel. Unfortunately, we had a bad experience with the managment and would not stay there again. Due to a change in our cruise ship itinerary, we needed to change our room reservations from two nights to one night. We emailed the hotel 48 hours priorto check-in(from our cruise ship) as per their policy. They claimed that reservation change was not in time (citing that the 48 hours prior to the start of the day of check in, so we were 12 hours late). They then claimed there was a two day stay minimum, which was never stated in their policy or website. I felt they were arrogant and did not value me as a customer. Instead of arguing with their managment and ruining our day, I paid the bill and then received a refund from my credit card company (they agreed with our argument.)
