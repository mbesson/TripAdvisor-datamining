{"Reviews": [{"Content": "I liked it! I booked this hotel for 2 nights through lastminute.com as it was a really cheap deal. I only read the reviews after that and I really thought about changing then hotel, as all the reviews were so bad! I thought the location was great, just beside the main station. It is true that there are lots of sex shops, strip clubs, sex cinemas, etc but it is like anywhere in the world. We were not hassled by the people in the clubs at all. Nice, clean, spacious room. Nice bathroom. My room was on the 3rd floor, facing the inner building and it was really quiet. The only thing I would complain about is that there are no black curtains, so the room gets really light. Good breakfast but nothing major. The guy in the reception could have been a little bit more nicer - he was ok though, and helped with directions.", "Date": "Oct 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR108364487", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Julilique"}, {"Content": "Great hotel - location less desirable, but not unsafe!

Went here for one night, and would certainly have changed to a different hotel if I needed to be in Frankfurt longer. As others have mentioned, the hotel is in the middle of the RLD, and some people in the street try to get you in to their businesses in a very agressive way. I got a single room which was very small, and the bed was very hard. My room was at street side, and although it was located on the hotel's top floor the noise in the street was clearly audible. I will never return to this property, despite the low price of only 50\u9227?", "Date": "Oct 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR543899794", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "stijnec"}, {"Content": "Good Price, Bad Location This hotel is very clean and has a good, complimentary breakfast in the morning. I would give it a two star rating. People are friendly. It is in walking distance of the main train station in Frankfurt. We saved a lot of money by staying here. Be advised, it is in the middle of the red light district and we were aggressively solicited each time we left or entered the hotel. The street is loud and the hotel is not air conditioned so you will need to keep the window open in the summer.

The room was fine and I figured it was safe. I didn't count on not getting to sleep until after 3.00 due to the continual microphone booming and the laughing and shouting in the street.

Went to Frankfurt for the Christmas market. Picked the City Hotel-West for its relative cheapness and proximity to the Railway Station (the bus from Hahn airport takes 2 hours and drops you at the Hauptbahnhof)Unfortunately, I had no idea when I booked that the hotel was slap bang in the middle of the Red Light District - virtually the only place on the street that had no connection to the sex industry! My wife was mortified and didn't like walking around their at night, although I'd say it was harmless enough.Room was basic, nice bathroom, curtains hanging off and very warm. Breakfast was pre-prepared and not really for Irish palates. Not many others in the hotel.The tram though was great for whizzing in and out of the Christmas Market area. Great buzz, great hot wine, great atmosphere, very very busy.", "Date": "Dec 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR469720598", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Shelsfan"}, {"Content": "Better than expected in the middle of red-light district       City Hotel West in its surrounding", "Date": "Oct 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR379550223", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Gernereiserin"}, {"Content": "Comodo ed economico   showReview(22914053, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR620125819", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "sganga"}, {"Content": "Bello ma..   showReview(22244752, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR236486598", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "dream1878"}, {"Content": "\u6e1a\u57ae\u57c4\u9287\u0441\u4eb0\u7039\u5908\u4e9c   showReview(21744284, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR146610702", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u95ae\u3125\u773f\u9287\ue218\u5054\u9289\ue0fe\u5046\u9286\u4f75\u4ef9\u9288\u509a\u726c\u93b5\u20ac\u9287\u5c7b\u5153\u9289\u6c47\u5153   showReview(19915199, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR982895295", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u7039\u5908\u4eb8\u9287\ufe3d\u7afb\u5a3c\u65bb\u4efe\u9287\u5a47\u5134\u705e?#x201d;   showReview(19914691, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR535397934", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Das Hotel liegt zwar direkt im...   showReview(16727027, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 1, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR774517202", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d623066-r21384798-City_Hotel_West-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "623066", "Price": "$196"}}
