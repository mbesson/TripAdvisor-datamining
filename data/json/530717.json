Our expectations were not good due to trip advisor reviews, however the hotel proved us wrong and more importantly we found no evidence of bed bugs!. The students rated the acommodation, even though some rooms were cramped with 4 beds in them. They liked the bathrooms, which were functional and clean, use of the safe and sky sports on the TV in the bedrooms. The Hotel is in a good location, handy for walking to the various sights. Breakfast was adequate and kept the students fuelled for the long days sightseeing. The only issue we had was with other school parties who were less well behaved.

You can take a short walk to the big park ''Villa Borghese'' which is near the river . You are also a few streets away from many cultural sights. The Bedroom: A bit dissapointed with this as the beds are quite small and all the furniture does not match the other things . There are bed lights at each side of the bed which work well , aswell as the main lamp which did not really give out much light.There is a very small television - more than a computer monitor . There is a small desk which the television is on aswell as again two lamps on each side of the desk because the rooom is quite dark where we stayed in . The room is quite small and there is little space you can relax in the evening. There are also weird painting on the wall which we hated. Bathroom: There is a small sink with a mirrow above it , a toilet right next to it . There is a bath with a shower - better watch how you get in if you do not want to fall and hurt yourself. There also is a radiator to dry your towels on if you need to . Again there is not alot of space.They change your towels and rest of the linen and things nearly everyday. Over all if you want a good relaxing and spacious hotel do not stay there but if you go out and enjoy your cultural holiday to see the Colloseum , Spanish Stairs or The Vatican City , go there and enjoy your stay like we did - but I would not really come back to Noto Hotel , but I would love to come again to Rome.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for groups at a convenient location\u201d", "Author": "Albert047", "ReviewID": "UR125096535", "Content": "Every year we organise a cultural trip to Italy with our 6th grade (17 year olds). Through the years I have seen the inside of several hotels that specialize in accommodating groups. I have to say that I was pleasantly suprised when I arrived at Hotel Noto last week. This hotel exceeds most hotels that host large parties. Our group counted over 30 pupils and we all got a room on the 3rd floor of the hotel. The rooms are not very spacy, but very clean and pleasant. The beds are comfortable. The bathrooms are also very clean and comfortable (although some of our students had trouble with the plumbing in their room).The staff is most welcoming and professional. Especially the breakfast buffet is a great asset of this hotel; there is an abundance in choice and the buffet is very well organised by the staff that keeps an eye on everything so that nothing ever runs out. The breakfast area is spacy and can easily cope with groups having breakfast at the same time. At check out the rooms are checked swiftly and correctly. To be brief, we will certainly stay at Hotel Noto again when returning to Rome with a bunch of students. As an private person this hotel would not be my first choice, because hotels of this kind are very often too crowded and noisy to my liking. However, it would not be dramatic to stay here because the hotel is quite sound proof. I also want to stress that the several bad reviews on this site are -according to me- no correct reflection of this hotel's qualities.

The room was absolutely fine - clean linen every day, clean room and bathroom, friendly staff, a good breakfast, an efficiently organised and neatly run hotel. The location is excellent for the main train station in Rome (Termini), which is also the only crossing point of the 2 metro lines crossing the city. It is not badly located either in terms of walking to a lot of the sights - the Colosseum, Circo Massimo, the Forum - and if you are energetic you really don't need public transport from here to almost anywhere. You can also walk to the Trevi fountain, the Piazza Navona and the Spanish steps from here. The Vatican museum is worth taking a cheap metro to (Termini to Cipri) as this is a bit further away. The Hotel is set back from the main road and is pretty quiet. A number of school groups use this and is obviously a good, safe and well organised hotel for them to do this. The decor is relatively new and the TV's in each room are pretty new with SKY as well (which you have to pay for). The lobby is well lit with 24 hour security and the staff were efficient without being brusque. The breakfast room(s) are clean and bright and, again, well organised for getting through a lot of guests. Fare is bread rolls, jams, ham, cheese, sweet croissants, coffee and fruit juice as well as fruit. Fine to set you up for the day. There are 3 lifts, which are a bit slow but functional. The corridors are all marble and the rooms are decorated with prints and mirrors. I couldn't find anything to complain about - some previous reviewers must be used to 5* hotels and their reviews didn't seem to match what the hotel offers at all.

We were a group of 40 senior pupils and 4 teachers. Before going, many of my pupils and indeed myself had been worried by the many negative comments on this website about the Noto. As things turned out we found them to be completely misleading. It seems to me that either the hotel has either had a complete turnaround in standards very recently or the judgement of some of the complainants has to be questioned. All the rooms I saw were very clean, all the sheets and towels were clean too. There was no evidence of bugs of any sort. The staff were friendly and helpful both to staff and pupils. Breakfast was the typical stuff you would expect in a hotel at this price. Juice, coffee (admittedly it was from a machine and wasn't great), cheese, meats, cereal, those chewy, morning rolls that you get throughout Italy, some spreads and a few slices of cake. My pupils, who are more used to cereal, or even, stereotypically for us, porridge, were a little wary on day one but were eating piles of the stuff the following morning. Incidentally there seemed to be plenty of tables - there are several breakfast rooms and, early on, as one is filled the lights go on in the next one and so on. Staff were careful to point us in the right direction. There were several school trips staying as well as ourselves and 'real' people. School trips were asked to book a time for breakfast to make seating easier. Breakfast was served from 7-10. It all worked fine. We did spot a few things about the rooms we needed fixed, such as that a couple of the safes weren't working and a few of the electrical fittings needed to be more securely fastened to the wall. We raised this at the front desk fairly late on the first night and someone came to fix most things the next day. We did have a problem with noise from another school party but I spoke to the hotel staff and then the teachers of the group concerned and it was stopped pretty quickly. Teachers are pretty good at that. We occupied 15 rooms and some were a little full with 4 people, two on smaller, portable beds - but not camp beds or fold out beds. Perhaps other rooms were in the state that others describe but I did walk around most of the building and did not pick up any bad or worrying smells. The rooms were furnished to a good standard, beds comfortable and no one complained of trouble sleeping. Bathrooms were fine too, although be prepared for no shower curtains or fittings for one. The whole room is tiled and there is a drain in the floor. Not what I was used to but it worked well. The Noto is very handy for Termini station (and Republica on Linea A if you go the other way round the Baths of Diocletian and want a simpler station to navigate). Our party of 44, by then very tired, managed to walk from the Trevi fountain back to the Noto in about 30 minutes. Going slowly. If I was in Rome to live like an emperor, away from the hustle and bustle of the city, I would pay more and stay somewhere else. If I was looking for a reasonably priced, comfortable and friendly hotel, handy for the sights, in an area with plenty of restaurants, cafes (a very good one down the road to Termini) and bars I would have no problem with staying at the Noto again.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cSmall room, old furnishings\u201d", "Author": "Samantha T", "ReviewID": "UR119267454", "Content": "This hotel is very near the Roma Termini Station, about 5 mins walk. 20 mins from the city centre if you know how to walk.

It was a HORRIBLE experience! The hotel has not been maintained well (age wise) and is just generally dirty. The bathrooms are full of mold and mildew, which makes them smell terrible and left us ill, literally. The staff is, at best, wholly disinterested and, at worst, outright rude. Particularly the gentleman who works the front desk overnight. He is generally pretty crabby if you dare to wake him from midnight naps on the lobby sofas! The hotel does have free wifi but only in the lobby and it is turned off from 11pm-8 or 9am every night. While staying at this horrible hotel, my mother fell from an unmarked step and we had to take her to the emergency room where she was treated for a sprained knee and a fractured finger (she had to have a pin put in the finger when we returned to the States). Two other women in our traveling party almost tripped over the same step. When the husband of one the women talked to the front desk staff about the step (just as we did when my mother fell) the staff told him that the manager of the hotel knew about the step but simply refused to mark it so that it would be more visible to people walking down the hallway. Only a day later, another older woman who used a cane when walking fell over the same step!!!!!!! The staff still refused to mark it!!!!!!!!! Also, when my mother fell I went to the front desk to ask for ice for her knee and was told that the hotel did not carry ice and I would have to walk around to some of the local corner bars and ask for ice there. I went to three different bars before a restaurant finally agreed to give me less than a cup full of ice. Having walked around the neighborhood looking for ice, I can say with confidence that while centrally located (i.e. near the train station) this hotel is NOT in the best area. It quickly became clear that, as a young woman, I did not need to be walking around the neighborhood by myself whether it was day or night. Finally, the hotel does offer breakfast but this includes old stale pastries, rotten fruit and room temperature milk and water (which makes sense since the hotel doesn't have ice!) and \"fruit\" juice that close to Kool-Aid than Tropicana. This hotel bills itself as centrally located and affordable. And, I know it is tempting to think you won't spend much time in the hotel since you will be out experiencing lovely Rome but the little bit of time you do spend in your dirty and moldy hotel room will be too much.

They did have very nice puddings but the spagetti with quid didnt go down very well with some of us. The only major downfall was that there were other ude students and teachers that went and distrubed others throughout the night as they were running about and knocking on doors. the receptionist said \"im not a baby sitter\" but a bouncer man did come up and see to them though they continued .

First impressions of the hotel were positive. Check in for the large group of students was quick and simple. The location was also ideal for exploring Rome. Rooms were small but adequate for a short stay and on the whole clean. The problems only really began at night. There were several school groups staying in the hotel from various countries. On the first night after a long day travelling we were keen to get to sleep before midnight for a long tour of the Vatican the next day. The noise and behaviour from the Spanish groups was totally unbelievable. They were running up and down corridors, knocking on doors, smoking weed on the corridors, groping eachother, prank calling and generally being abusive to myself and other staff with our party. I asked at reception 3 times for something to be done and was simply told that there was nothing they could do as it was the responsibility of the teachers with the groups. This would be fine if teachers from Spain were prepared to take any responsibility for the behaviour of their groups. I had to find the number rooms of the teachers and knock for them to speak to their groups and not one member of staff answered. The teachers were even more rude than the students, refusing to address the behaviour. One teacher forcing his hand in my face when I dared to tell him that he needed to do something about the chaos his group were causing. At 3am after no sleep I finally rang our NST rep who phoned the hotel simply to be told that there was nothing they could do. The receptionist barely even acknowledged me and continued to smoke his cigar whilst chaos continued all around. This was repeated three nights in a row to the extent that none of us had more than about ten hours sleep in 72 hours. Why would a hotel continue to accept school groups from a country where the teachers are not expected to discipline the children in their care? Simply not good enough when it comes to dealing with groups. On the second and third night a different receptionist did try to address the problem by threatening the groups with the police but still the noise continued. On the whole, good trip but I could never return to this hotel with another group unless they are willing to take some responsibility for what happens under their roof. British kids should be very proud of their behaviour which from all schools staying at the time was immaculate in comparison to the rude and obnoxious manner of both the Spanish teachers and pupils.

The desk clerk shrugged and said, 'The teachers have gone out. What can I do?' It was nearly 1am when they returned and told their students to go to bed. My room was incredibly small. The bed ran along one length of the wall and then a narrow passage along the other. All up, the room could not have been 1.5 metres wide. The walls were paper thin. I found out things I didn't want to know from the teenage girls next door. In other rooms, our group indicated that when you pulled out the plug in the bath, the water gushed up the floor waste and flowed into the room. The desk staff refused to believe it and insisted that it was the fault of the occupants. \"They should have let the water out a little at a time!\" In the end I started to feel sorry for the staff.
