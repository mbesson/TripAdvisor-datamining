Close to shopping and dining areas. About 5-minute walk to train station. Hotel is very basic, it's ideal for someone looking for a place to spend the night. It's clean, but again very basic. No services are offered other than breakfast in the morning and room cleaning service once a day. The hotel has no restaurant or bar. Parking is on the street, but I think this is the case for most of the hotels in this area. It's an old building, so the floors creak when you walk. Oh, and the bed is possibly the hardest bed I have ever slept in.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome", "Title": "\u201cFamily Adams Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Serial_Dealer", "ReviewID": "UR117853068", "Content": "Hotel Astrid is rather a pension than a hotel. It is located in the beautiful area, full of high street shops, elegant restaurants and is extremely well connected to the public transports. However, the beauty of the area vanishes as soon as you cross the threshold of the building. The first impression is entering the Adam's Family house...dark and aged. Wooden stairs are creaking at every step, elevator is the old fashioned one and the pavement is covered by the old and consumed carpets, giving impression to be a container for the dust rather than an element of embellishment. We had a large room on the second floor, with 4 beds. Beds and the furniture were recently renewed, thus they were fine, except that one of my daughters was complaining about the pillow being too soft. TV set was large and worked fine. Pavement was recently renewed too, but funny stuff is that it was renewed partially, just shortly under the beds, thus circa 40 cm below the beds was still covered by the old carpets...It was quite odd, rather then disturbing. My strongest objection regards the bathroom, which was made subsequently and the odd thing is that in the room larger than 36m2 they made a bathroom of 1,2 m2 including shower box, washbowl and wc. There was not space to put the toiletry, clothes taken off. I was leaving my cloths on the WC cover.. Just imagine that it was a room for 4 person with so small bathroom. Outside the bathroom, you could play a football in the room as spacious it was. Breakfast was quite good, with the limited choice of the goods, but the quality was very high. The only objection regards the coffee, as it was distributed from an automatic machine and only black coffee was free of charge. Cappuccino and the other variants were available on pay. However, the owners were extremely helpful and friendly. All in all, if you are travelling on a limited budget and want to stay in the most beautiful part of Berlin, well connected to the rest of the city, Astrid Hotel can be an excellent choice. I have described the room and hotel in finer detail to prevent surprises after the first impact, as later, the position of the hotel, price that you pay and the kindness of the owners make the stay pleasant and acceptable, if you do not have a double money for higher ranked hotels in the neighborhood.", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Maine USA", "Title": "\u201cComfortable, clean hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "brownali", "ReviewID": "UR116962629", "Content": "We stayed at Hotel Astrid for 4 nights this August.

This room was huge and had a nice balcony with view to the Kurf\u00fcrstedamm, one of Berlin top shoppingstreets. This is one of the few rooms with a tube, and since its hardly is rentet i guess it had a funny smell in the beginning. The first day though the toilet was broken, so we got the key to the 4 bed room next door, wich also seemd ok for a niht ore two if you are some friends going to Berlin Every morning theres a nice breakfast, maybe not as big as of the Ritz - but hey, the breakfast alone would cost you the 35 Euros, so I think its pretty need.
