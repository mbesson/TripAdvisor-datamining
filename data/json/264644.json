The location worried me slightly on arrival in the taxi as the sign for the hotel is slighty dated and 'old school' but was pleasantly supprised once inside. The reception staff where most hepfull and as we arrived early our room was not ready so we left our bags and returned later in the afternoon. we were then upgraded to a room with a terrace on the 4th floor which was fab. Room was a little small but lots of cupboard space with hangers etc. The bathroom was extremley clean and there were all the usual little extras like shower gel etc. Only downside was that the walls are 'very' thin so you can hear 'everything'...... Breakfast was AMAZING, make sure you go down with plenty of time so you can go back for more and more!! Yes you will come home a stone heavier than you went! Overall a fab hotel, we didn't use any public transport as we walked into the centre which took no longer than 20 mins to spanish steps. An amazing little italian restaurant 2mins away (out the main doors to the end of the road and take a left, you will see on your right) The hotel also arranged our taxi which was a blacked out chauffer Merc for our return to the airport (50 euro) In general Rome is very expensive so would advise bringing few extra euro's so you can make the most of the great food and wine. would stay again.

We asked for a change of room and it was granted quickly. o We paid about 130 Euros a night for a double room that I think is good value. o There are some very nice places to eat nearby. o The staff spoke good English and some of them Spanish. o No problem with leaving luggage for some hours on the last day of our stay. o The cleaners were friendly! Negatives: o It is a bit of a walk (15 minutes) to the Metro although there is a bus you can take to Tivoli station. o We found the attitide of one of the receptionists quite distant and rude to one of the other staff members who was helping us with our bags.

I stayed here in April for an extended weekend when travelling together with my mum and we shared a room with twin bed. The room was very tidy with modern decor, but was very small. I had read similar comments from other travellers before our trip, so I was prepared for it and since it wasn't our intention to spend much time inside the room anyway, it didn't bother us that much. Although the hotel is rated four*, there were no special amenities in the room (slippers, bathrobes, mineral water), but the price of the room was very decent too, so it makes up for it. Our room was on the first floor and had a street view, but luckily no noise passed through the windows nor from the corridor. The bed, albeit a bit narrow for two, was really comfortable and that's something I highly value after a long day of walking around in Rome. Breakfast was well varied and tasty too, I was happy to notice they even served dark bread. The hotel itself is small (boutique style?) and had an almost etheric ambience, I hardly met any other hotel guests, except during breakfast and really, it was incredibly quiet there. Hotel Fiume is located a bit off the center, but in a tranquil and neat neighbourhood with a couple of nice and cheap Trattorias right behind the hotel corner. Upon our arrival to Rome, we walked to the hotel from Termini (we had very little lugagge), so it's a walkable distance away from the center (or at least from Termini), but it's still best to use public transportation to save your feet. The nearest metro station is actually rather far from the hotel, but busses run nearby, you just need to figure out which one goes where :) In essence, I do recommend Hotel Fiume. Just be prepared to spend some time each day walking to the bus stop or metro station and back + the time spend travelling in a bus or metro. Could I choose again, I might choose a hotel even closer to \"the center\", just to save some time, but on the upside, the local restaurants and cafes were significantly cheaper in this part of Rome and since I like to start my days jogging, the nearby Villa Borghese park offered good running grounds too.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wexford, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Hotel!!!\u201d", "Author": "daniellelouise32", "ReviewID": "UR112966674", "Content": "I stayed here with a friend for 2 nights in January and it was the most enjoyable stay I've ever had in a hotel.

Absolutely loved it. Here is my pro / con list of the hotel, which I find the most useful when evaluating a hotel Pro: most of the stuff speak very good English, and are nice and courteous. very clean room, I got a deluxe room that comes with the comfy robes and slippers. The bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom toiletry was very well stocked at all times. The bed is extremely comfortable, and the decor is very lovely. Breakfast buffet was one of the best I had in Italy. Very well cooked eggs, fresh slices of watermelon was served daily. We also stayed there with a couple other friends, and used the roof top nightly to drink wine. We bought our own bottles from the wine store and supermarkets (both are within one block radius from the hotel), and the hotel provided the glasses every night. There are also many local restaurants nearby, which for the most part are not the typical tourist traps (but Italians eat late, so don't show up at 7pm, no one is going to be there) Cons: If you want to be in the middle of all tourist actions, this is not the place for you. This place seems to be in the middle of the financial district for Rome, and therefore has more restaurants and shops for people living there locally. To get to most of the attractions, it's typically a 15 - 20 minutes walk, which for us was great. We never took the public transportation, even though many buses stop here. The subway station is about 10 minutes walk away from the hotel. but, there is a taxi stand (the only place where you can get a taxi, seems like) and is only 5 minutes away from the hotel. The room lighting overall is a bit dark. so, make sure you see yourself in the light before leaving your room. some of my friends had a room with a strange smell, but after talking to the hotel, they changed it for them the next day. The wi-fi was a bit annoying. It's free, but each card only works for 24 hours. So, you constantly have to ask for new cards. Although the concierge gives you no problem for getting new cards, it's just a bit annoying. I will stay here again if I were to visit Rome.

It is not in a central location, but the beauty of that is that you are in a non-touristy part of town. All the trattoria that we went to were filled with locals; we were the only tourists. It was great. You get a real feel for Rome and its food when you eat in local establishments. Many servers did not speak English at all. The rooms are super-clean and they have an electronic safe. The bathrooms are tiny, but the shower is luxurious. The rooms themselves are tiny. Not as small as some of the ones we stayed at in Paris, but they are expectedly small. We had a balcony, and that was nice. They have TV with digital access and multiple channels. The bed was as comfy as any Westin Heavenly bed I've slept in.

Good English was spoken at the hotel by the front desk staff which we found a relief (as we spoke no Italian apart from the essentials -how to order two glasses of wine :o). Hotel Fiume wasn't centrally located but it was only approx one mile out of the city centre very close to bus stops (2 mins) about 10 mins walk to a metro station and only 10 mins walk to Borghese, a beautiful park with a marvellous museum. We walked into the city from the hotel and got to Republic square and fountains after about a twenty min stroll. Fiume hotel is in a pleasant neighbourhood with plenty of shops, cafes and restaurants on the doorstep and feels like real Italy rather than a tourist trap, which more centrally located hotels might suffer from. There was a nice buffet breakfast every morning from 7-10am with plenty of different types of food available which was very tasty . The only reason this hotel is not getting a full 5 stars is that although the rooms were pleasant and of a decent size, with more than adequate bathrooms, they were a little shabby and worn around the edges. I found that electricity points looked a bit 'dodgy' not all of them worked. We could hear our neighbours coming back to their rooms at night, the doors were old and quite thin. The hotel had been rated as 3 star in my travel agent - 'Thomson's brochure however, like tripadvisor says, it is more like a good 2 star with that level of facilities- our room had air conditioning, telephone, satellite TV, hairdryer, bath and shower, mini bar and safe.

The reason we would not stay at Hotel Fiume ever again lies with one of the employees at the front desk. He was horrible. Our first day there a group of women asked him a question, to which he rudely told them the desk was closed.....even though he was standing there doing nothing. He showed no manners or class. The times we had to ask him something he was rude and showed no interest in the job. Why work in a hotel if you so obviously do not like dealing with people?! Also, prior to arriving I emailed someone at the hotel to have a taxi waiting for us at the airport. He charged us 70 euros to drive us to the hotel. On our last day we decided to take a taxi from the local taxi stand just up the road (as we found 70 euros to be a bit much). That taxi driver charged us 30 euros!

And if you want to walk to the Vatican, which is all the way cross town, it takes about an hour... So it's not \"off\" at all, although it may seem like it on the map.

We got an excellent last minute deal for a standard double room. We particularly liked the look of this hotel, as it is a traditional style Italian building. We booked return transfers to the hotel on line with Rome-Limousine-Airport, and paid 35 euros each way. We found this company to be prompt and reliable, especially as we paid them after they picked us up in a Mercedes! We arrived at the Hotel Fiume just before their check-in time of 2 o\u2019clock and checked into our room on the third floor with no problems for being slightly early. The hotel has a very attractive, spacious lobby area with use of an Internet PC (for a fee) and a small bar. Our room was a reasonable size for a city room and was exceptionally clean. The bathroom complimentary toiletries were replenished daily, and were especially handy, as we\u2019d forgotten to pack some of ours. The room also had a free, small safe that we paid a returnable deposit of 20 euros for. Our bathroom was new and had a powerful shower, hairdryer, and a bidet. Being early February and chilly at night, our room was always warm and fortunately, we always had hot water. Situated at the back of the hotel, our room also had double patio doors and full-length green wooden shutters that opened out onto a long Italian-style private balcony with window boxes and 2 plastic chairs. This would have been ideal to sit out on in the summer, although the view wasn\u2019t the greatest, we felt like we were in Rome. The large breakfast room was very pleasantly decorated and breakfast even included boiled or scrambled eggs and bacon, and was more than adequate. Also lots of different hot and cold drinks to choose from, including squeeze your own fresh orange juice! Although very close to Porta Pia and Villa Borghese, the Hotel Fiume is located slightly outside the main tourist area, but don\u2019t let this put you off, as it\u2019s a very safe area to walk round and has lots of good restaurants. One evening, we walked to Via Veneto and ate at the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9, and felt completely safe walking back in the dark. All of Rome\u2019s major tourist attractions are fairly close to each other, and armed with a good map, (the hotel lobby has a free one); we enjoyed walking to all of them from the hotel, including the Vatican, which took us under an hour walking slowly. (We are middle-aged and stopped to take photos!) Public transport is just around the corner if you don\u2019t like walking. All in all, we had a very enjoyable stay at the Hotel Fiume. It provides a good base for sightseeing and we would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for a great hotel at budget prices.", "Date": "March 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel\u201d", "Author": "ManchesterTourist", "ReviewID": "UR6550348", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Fiume for 7 nights from the 27th of December 2006.

Rooms are very clean and the furniture is in good condition. I would however agree with the other review that the decor is in need of refurbishment (ripped wall paper in places, lots of old bracket fixtures marks etc). But this did not take away from the quality of the hotel much. The hotel is situated in a residential area but is very near to key transport links on the Piazza Fiume. Lots of good local restaurants. We found however that all the sights are within walking distance, the furthest being about 30 minutes walk away (The Vatican). The main area to go at night for restaurants and night life is the Via Veneto, which again can be walked in about 20 minutes but is only a few minutes away in a taxi and cost about 6 euros. Taxis are cheap and the hotel can order them for you but be warned, when we arrived taxi drivers tried to charge 20 euros to get us to our hotel from the Termini. A complete rip off! The Termini is near enough to walk but personally I think a bit too far with a case so expect to take a taxi and pay about 10 euros.

In general the staff we met all spoke excellent English and were happy to do so. They were also very helpfull and informative, the barman escorted us to a local restaurant and showed us in, in addition the \"taxi\" we ordered to go back to the airport turned out to be more of a chauffer driven Mercedes, and only cost 10e more than the original journey. The hotel itself is located slightly away from the city centre and is more of a locals area instead of being full of tourists, making it perfect for a relaxing evening in the restaurants. The Metro system is 10-15 minutes away and easy to find once you get your bearings. This will take you to all the main sites but its best to walk once into the centre as everything is so close. The only down side is that the rooms while being a decent size are tired, everything is spotlessy clean and the maids do an excellent job. However, our room whilst being adequate did need decorating. But don't let this put you off as everything else makes up for it. Nothing to do with the hotel at all. When about the city keep your wits about you as Rome does have a reputation for pick pockets.

If you tend to go in the wrong direction like my mom would have without me, then you should find a hotel closer to a Metro subway stop or in a more touristy area. You will be using the bus frequently. We used the 90 Express bus (takes you to Termini if you want to hop on the subway from there) and the 62 (to Vatican City) from the Porta Pia stop which is near the hotel (not \"next to the hotel\" as one of the reviewers mentioned below) - it is actually a few blocks away. The buses are often crowded in the mornings due to locals going to work. I never saw a pickpocket. I believe because the hotel is in a very untouristy area and the pickpockets tend to hit those that are more tourist-laden. The hotel itself is nice and clean. The lobby is much bigger than the ones in the hotels we stayed at in other cities of Italy. The staff are very nice and helpful. They speak English. They can help you with directions, providing a map and telling you how to get to each location by bus. The taxi drivers went on strike two days before we were to leave and the desk manager arranged for a private driver to take us to the airport. It was 50 euros but worth it (the guy hit 50 mph on short city streets and going 90 on the traffic-packed expressway - didn't bother me, we got to FCO airport under 45 minutes in morning rush hour traffic). The room was quite small (much smaller than the other hotels we stayed at), but the bathroom was bigger. There was a deep tub (not good for those who have a hard time climbing in and out). There is a shower door that is like one foot wide and doesn't keep water out of the tub so often there will be a huge puddle on the floor if you are not careful! Plenty of towels provided. The beds were comfortable (much softer than the other hotels - those were rock hard!). There were extra pillows stored in the wardrobe. Everything is modern, the tv, the fridge, the bathroom. The wardrobe is big enough for two (there are two separate closets within the wardrobe). There is very little space to put your luggage, just one luggage rack, so while that was taken by my mom, I put mine on top of the cabinet that held the refrigerator. The door lock is tricky. When locking yourselves in the room, be sure to turn the knob until the door locks. The food is repetitive at best (same food we had at the other hotels before arriving to Rome). They do bring in fresh warm rolls from a local bakery. The biggest plus was the coffee machine. There are like five different choices of coffee, including cappuccino which I drank the whole time. The coffee was awful at other hotels and this was a nice surprise. The neighborhood is definitely untouristy.
