The fourth-floor rooms have a view of the Bosphorus. But if you aren't booked into one of those, you'll still get panoramic views from the roof, where you can also take your breakfast, included in the room rate. The buffet breakfast was great! A range of dried and fresh fruit, local treats like halva, breads and backed goods made for a filling and satisfying start to our day. WiFi is included in the room rate, but was not easy to connect to - we had numerous disconnections.

The location is relatively quiet, although the street itself is a bit run down. From the 4th floor rooms you can see the Golden Horn / Bosphorus (i.e. the water) and from the terrace on the 5th Floor, the Aghia Sofia and Blue Mosque dominate. Breakfast is good - lots of variety ( but I didn't see anyone trying the olives first thing in the morning). The only drawback is that it's served on the ground floor rather than the rooftop terrace. The bedrooms are not perfect. While our double bed was generous in size and very comfortable, there were no drawers or shelves at all in the room - only hanging space, which meant living partly out of suitcases for 5 nights. The curtains were at least 30% smaller than the windows, there was no plug in the sink basin (this is normal in Istanbul), and although the bath had jacuzzi nozzles, they did not work. Not good enough for a hotel which claims to be a cut above. And beware the so-called free tea/coffee in the bedrooms - the bottled supermarket water that stands invitingly next to the kettle is charged (exhorbitantly) as a minibar item! The staff at reception were laid back, pleasant and helpful. We had an unfortunate experience however that will certainly not (well, hopefully not) affect most visitors. Both my wife and I had food poisoning from a meal - NOT, I hasten to add, a meal at the Tria - and eventually we spent 24 hours in hospital. We needed to stay in Istanbul to recover, but could not remain in the Tria which was fully booked after our 5 nights were up. So we were forced to bed down (feeling pretty sick) in another hotel nearby. The owner of the Tria then refused us the free transfer to the Airport, which we would have had if we had been fit enough to travel at the end of our 5-night booking. This left us with the feeling that at the Tria customer care, praised in other customer reviews, is in fact only skin deep.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel, excellent food, excellent owner\u201d", "Author": "SLoh_11", "ReviewID": "UR118497387", "Content": "Loved the service provided.

The staff were very friendly, helped book tours, and answer all the questions we had. However, do your research before if you have a specific tour in mind, or if you want to use a specific tour operator, as the staff will recommended a shortlist of tour operators, which they advertise for and get a commission from.

After explaining to the manager that we thought the room wasn't all it had been hyped up to be and requested to be moved to the 4th floor delux room (ours was the 2nd floor) we had been promised by the website, he became rude and abrupt and refused to acknowledge the website's misleadings. He refused to compromise or offer us anything in consolation and wouldn't let us cancel our booking. In all honesty, the rooms are fine, clean if a little without charater and the other staff were perfectly friendly and polite.

Also 2 easy chairs with a small table. On the table was a welcome bottle of Turkish red wine and fresh fruit. The bath was a nice size with a big tub/shower combo. Actually the tub as a corner spa tub. There was also a single cup coffee pot and hot water pot with a good selection of coffees and teas. We also left a 2 TLira tip for the maids each day. They made sure had extra fresh towels, water bottles, coffee and tea Also a nice breakfast was included. Because we had been on a tour before our arrival at the Tria, the management treated us to a wonderful 5 course dinner with wine at their restaurant (about 1 block away). We actually when back to the restruant (in side with white table clothes, etc) for dinner our last night .During our stay at the Tria , 2 half day tours were included in our package. The wonderful meal was substituted for the tours. The Tria is in a great location for walking to all of the old city sights. Also you can walk over to take the bus to other locations. There was also a little store at the end of the block. The store was a great place to pick up cold drinks and snacks. There are a lot of places for reasonable priced lunches and dinners 1 block from the hotel. I was worried about the number of hostels in the area, but the bands shut down at 11 PM. I would definitely looking at staying at the Tria for another trip to Istanbul. Our tour had us staying at the Ritz in Istanbul. Although the Ritz was more luxurious the service and location and price of the Tria would be hard to beat.

We were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary and wanted a comfortable and pleasant small hotel experience in the heart of historic Istanbul. The Tria Hotel more than met this requirement. We enjoyed a large deluxe double room on the third floor that provided a glimpse of the Bosphorous. The room had wood parquet floors, simple but attractive furnishings, small TV and a bathroom wtih jacuzzi tub. Most importantly, there were two wing-back chairs with stools were we could relax when planning our next day's activities. The complementary breakfast on the main floor (which was below street level) offered a range of cereals, fruits, nuts, meats, cheese and sweets. In all our dealings with the hotel staff, both before our arrival (when we were making arrangements) and during our stay (when we had questions about local attractions), we were dealt with in a friendly and helpful manner. Within a minute or two walk from the hotel one could enjoy all of the charms of the historic Sultanthament area: the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Hippodrome, Bosphorous, restaurants, shops, etc. What more could one ask for when visiting a country to enjoy its cultural traditions and attractions? Given the hotel's location, with our bedroom windows open, we could hear the river traffic on the Bosphorous and the calls to prayer from the nearby Blue Mosque. While this took a bit of adjustment the first night (the call to prayers began at 05:00 a.m., and the river fog horns could last all night at 10 second intervals when there is fog), we found by the second or third night that we slept to morning undisturbed. Even during the period that we were adjusting to the sounds of our surroundings, we found them charming reminders that we were indeed in an exotic and otherwordly place. As for the food, I enjoyed every morning a bowl of ceral, one hard boiled egg, a sausage, toast, and a wedge of honey comb. The sliced meats and cheese did not appeal to me and so I left them alone.

We had a room that faced the main street and I believe these are the newer rooms which was good. The room itself is typical European size (ie quite small) and it had a small balcony facing the street but not enough room to sit out on. The bathroom was nice, with a spa bath and they also provided robes! Our room was on the top floor and I was a bit worried about the noise as we were facing the street but once we closed the door to the balcony you could hardly hear anything. The only downfall with our room was that it had a connecting door to the room next door and so it meant we could hear them talking and watching tv etc. The door knob was also broken and hanging off (it actually fell off on our last day) however it had another latch lock which made it secure. The only other issue with the hotel was that my brother and sister-in-laws room didn't have a full curtain, it only had the 'decorative' one which didn't cover the whole window so it meant it got bright quite early for them. However, these are just little things and they certainly won't dampen my experience at the hotel. Because we had the room facing the main street we had to walk downstairs, outside and around to the back of the building to get to the breakfast area (and main part of the hotel) but the fact that we had a nicer room than on that side made it ok (I know the rooms on that side weren't as good as my brother and his wife stayed here after they went on a tour when they re-booked into the Tria). The roof terrace is great and they even give you a shawl if you get a bit chilly. They have waiter service up there so you don't have to go down to get your drinks. I have read some reviews that have said the location is bad, however we thought it was fantastic! It's right on one of the main streets of Sultanahmet where all the restaurants are and is within walking distance of most of the old town. The tram (not that we used it) isn't far away either. The staff were great - very helpful. However be careful when making plans with them - make sure you get a confirmation! My brother and sister-in-law wanted to book a third night as they were staying longer and they thought they had arranged it with a staff member on the first day, however when myself and my husband checked out they were told they had to check out too as they were fully booked and didn't have a room for them. The staff were very helpful in finding alternative accommodation and did give them a discount for their next stay (3 days later when they got back from a tour), however they were disappointed that they had to move out of their room into another hotel for one night when they thought they had confirmed it. There is so much to do and see in Istanbul and I would have liked more time there. We spent nearly a whole day at the grand bazaar and once we bought our first item there we asked the man if he knew anyone who was selling the other things we were looking for and then he pretty much took us around to everything we needed (I think that everyone is related or knows everyone in the stalls) and made sure we got the best price from them. One thing to make sure you are aware though is that the cheaper ceramics there contain lead so can't be used for foodstuffs (we learned this after buying some!).

My only complaint it s that the noise of the air conditioning vents outside were loud but I am a light sleeper, it didn't bother my husband. I did not mention it to the staff but wish I had as when we checked out another man asked to change rooms for the same reason. I would suggest the Superior rooms as they are slightly bigger and on the road side, away from the vents! If you are in a Superior room then I would also request a room above the 1st floor as first floor windows open on street level and could be noisy. The staff were really helpful with everything. Sadly they suggested the Istanbul Balik Restaurant for a romantic dinner for two. The food was good but a total rip off and we left with a very bad taste in our mouth after paying the bill.

The room was clean and staff friendly. We had problems with the air conditioner, which they fixed quickly. Breakfast was ample, but directed toward the European taste, understandable as Europeans constitute the largest percentage of their clients. Their computer is located in breakfast room, so is unavailable during those hours. But didn't matter, as the Internet connection almost never worked during our stay. Quite an inconvenience since closest Internet Cafe was 10 minute walk away or more. This hotel is not in the best location. It is on the edge of the Sulthanamet district, and requires a short walk to the tram line or sights. But it is quiet and room was pleasant. We did find that the staff tried to turn any question we had about Istanbul into an opportunity to sell a tour (no doubt they get a good commission).

Also, our ATM card didn't work in Turkey and bank employees couldn't help due to limited English. We also had trouble with our taxi from the airport in that we were told it would cost 30 Euro and the driver (who spoke no English) wanted 60 Euro when we got to the hotel, gesturing that it cost more for the luggage!! We had the hotel front desk person handle the taxi driver. I would recommend arranging for airport transfers in advance. The hotel arranged for an English speaking guide for us for a day and he was great. Walking near the hotel is difficult in that the streets are cobblestone and the sidewalks are full of tables for the restaurants.

In terms of location, it was pretty hard to beat - you definitely want to stay in Sultanamet cause the heat gets too much over at Taksim and we definitely looked forward to returning nightly to our haven. The rooms were absolutely gorgeous. Views were non-existent as we had the wall of another building but that wasn't a big deal for us. The interior of the room was excellent! Bathroom was immaculate. It just felt so polished and yet homey at the same time. The rooftop terrace was truly the icing on the cake. Breathtaking views, super comfy sofas and chairs - they even had a romantic swing up there! The best thing was the staff - friendly, accommodating and very gracious.
