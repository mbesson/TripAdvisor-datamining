We booked the accommodation quite late as it was a bit of a last minute holiday and as a result paid 500 dirum per night, which was completely overpriced for the quality of this hotel. We were expecting an average 3 star budget style hotel from looking at the website, however I would not even class this as 1 star! The hotel is run down, I wouldnt wash my dog in the swimming pool let alone get in it for a nice swim on my holiday. There were hairs in the bed and just a sheet over an old brown blanket, which is obviously not washed between guests. The corridors are lined with matresses and bed blocks which was really stange and a health hazard most importantly. During check in we realised this was a mistake and tried to cancel the booking, the staff were very unhelpful and very defensive, it appeared they were very used to dealing with these sort of complaints. Anyway we decided to give it a go, after returing from a meal and a few drinks in the city we returned to the hotel on our first night to see drunk men falling out of the reception door and scuffling with each other. There was a very seedy feel and I felt very uneasy as we quickly realised this appeared to be some sort of meeting place for men to find a woman for the night... i was shocked this sort of thing happened in a place like dubai but it clearly did after visiting the Karama. Thumping music went on til about 3am which made it impossible to sleep, not the holiday I anticipated. First thing we went to reception to request a refund on the rest of our booking, we managed to get this in the end after a struggle. Another guest was also trying to get out of the hotel at the time, again the staff could not emphasise and did not seem to care. Really enjoyed dubai after leaving the Karama, please do not make the same mistake and book this hotel, unless you are after girls of course. Not a good place for a holiday and I couldnt imagine bringing children into this hotel. I do not normally write reviews but I feel really strongly about this and want others to be more informed about their decisions. I really wish I did my research before booking the Karama!", "Date": "March 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo, Norway", "Title": "\u201cOkay hotell for low budjet\u201d", "Author": "Minlady", "ReviewID": "UR94504506", "Content": "The hotell is near a metro station, and there is also taxies standing outside the hotell all time. its werry cheap to take a taxi here.
