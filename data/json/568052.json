I would suggest to stay at a more value-packed hotel rather than this cheap one if you are particular with the rooms that you's re sleeping on.

This is possibly the worst hotel experience I have ever had, and I have stayed in a lot of budget hotels and hostels. As soon as we got into a cab, the driver was concerned that we were staying in the Red Light District (however, Singapore is a very safe city overall, and we never felt threatened around the hotel). You can tell at once that it is definitely not one of the more desirable neighbourhoods. Service at the front desk is pretty much non-existent. As soon as we stepped off the elevator and into the hallway, all we could smell was smoke - this continued into our hotel room. Very small sized room, however consistent with most Asian budget hotels. Beds are extremely hard because there isn't a real mattress. There is an ensuite bathroom with mold in the tiles. We were prepared to work through all of those problems (again, just two nights, right?) but the absolute worst part of the hotel is that you can't get any sleep. There is no insulation in the walls and every time a door opens/closes, you can hear it from your room like it was your own door opening. There were people coming and going (and screaming) at all hours of the night, for both nights that we were there. Redeeming qualities: 1. you can borrow travel adaptors from the front desk for a refundable deposit; 2. the hotel is a 5-minute walk away from a subway station, or a relatively short cab ride away from the Marina Bay", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "singapore", "Title": "\u201cDirty Room\u201d", "Author": "Angelia L", "ReviewID": "UR125728848", "Content": "My friend from Malaysia, check-in afternoon of 5 mar 2012, Dirty toilet dirty floor and cockroaches around !!!

Anything but Fragrant. I\u2019d like to meet the owners face to face and tell them exactly what I think of their miserable little chain and in particular the Ruby since Tripadvisor protocols would deem my language too offensive to publish. DO NOT bring your family here. I have stayed in worse hotels of the cockroach variety but at least they charge cockroach prices. This hotel with its pretentious lobby and often surly staff, set as it is in the heart. of the red light district, seems reasonably priced at first - think again. Let\u2019s start with wifi. What a joke! It\u2019s 5 SG Dollars (\u00a32.50) for 2 hours. It seldom works so you have to trek back to the lobby to get them to \u2018reset \u2018it - if in fact they do anything at all. \u201cIt\u2019s not our fault, it\u2019s the system\u201d they explain. Next day\u2026apparently I should have logged in immediately even though in theory I could log on anytime in the next 24 hours. If I log out at any time, that\u2019s it - another payment to get back in and on the saga goes. I went overboard with niceness to see if that would help, calling staff by name, greeting pleasantly, \u201chow are you today \u201c all that stuff - still no effective wifi. Forget wifi here, there\u2019s plenty downtown that\u2019s free. My depressing little corner room was a rhapsody in faded peach and scuff marks with the luxury of a light bulb to read by or if I preferred, a centrally placed interrogation light should I feel an urge to confess something. Mercifully they\u2019d been thoughtful enough to spare me their taste in art and left the walls as a blank canvas for me to savour the \u2018open narrative\u2019 as the critics call it. The corridors teem at night, the clanking doors echo and for a moment as the Alpha waves kick in, it\u2019s possible to confuse the sounds with what you imagine death row to be like. The street noise outside is to be expected - I have earplugs - and the view I won\u2019t go into for the sake of decency even though I\u2019m a man of the world and expect to see what I see. The Bed: Assuming you managed to sleep at all, getting up can be a novel experience. You discover who is the dominant partner in your relationship as they will have won the battle for the pitifully small sheet. That leaves you stuck to a vinyl mattress which you have to gingerly peel yourself off like removing some giant bandaid. The bathroom: ha ha ha! There\u2019s a loo shoved up against a corner wall which you have to ride side saddle like Igor or Richard the Third. Once hunched, you have time to consider the grouting that needs doing or perhaps contemplate whether bleach would be a good idea for the grey scum of the floor tiles and to hell with the environment and what line of white washbasin sealant wouldn\u2019t be without its splodges of mould? The shower head points at the junction of wall and ceiling so that getting water down to your level involves vigorous practice of your Mexican wave technique lest you go about Singapore all day in a soapy wax. The TV - forget it. The hair dryer - nice to look at, if only it worked. I found that if I got my wife to stand under the air-con whilst I hummed a buzzy noise and flounced around her ala Warren Beatty in \u2018Shampoo\u2019, it not only made up for the shortcomings of the dryer but entertained in a way the TV could not. Security. The hotel\u2019s notion of security is more a kind of leap of faith, a testament to the clientele and inhabitants honesty. Placing my laptop in the staff\u2019s tender care, I was overjoyed when I returned early evening to see it sat there on the floor behind the desk, not a member of staff insight. At least it was still their, silly me for ever doubting. Here\u2019s the really stupid part - I stayed three nights in the hope things might improve. One night would be too much. I bet the owners don\u2019t live like this. On the plus side\u2026?

Not only was it fairly close to where I had stayed the last time (Geylang area), but what I hadn't realized was that Fragrance Ruby was even closer to the MRT than then previous hotel! In comparison to the last hotel I stayed at, the walk to the MRT was only about 10 minutes and very easy to get to. The hotel is very decent too and really have no complaints other than part of the ceiling looked a little mildewy or perhaps had a small water issue some time back and this was the result of what happened afterward. Anyways, aside from that small discrepancy, I thought the hotel did it's justice and would certainly stay there again should I need to go back to Singapore again in the future! As others have mentioned though, yes it is in the red light area so one will probably see a number of girls hanging around on some of the streets nearby but other than that there's also a 7 Eleven close by for those late night runs to the store to grab a snack. Also, for dinner, there's PLENTY of food stalls all along Geylang Rd. and even up on Sims Rd. (where the MRT is adjacent to). They have lots and lots of selections and very good prices so go enjoy the food near this hotel location as well! All in all, a decent place to stay, nice room, and good restaurants nearby too.

The hotel located at the edge of the red-light district was quiet at the wee-hour in the morning, Taxi driver knew exactly the location just gave him the Lorong (lane) number (even numbers are in red-light district). Taxi fare from Changi SD26 not MRT after 10 p.m.. Make sure you have the print-out of your confirmation, hotel clerk seemed not be able to check you in by name. I was on the 5th floor overlooking low buildings so had a good view. It was quiet and I'd a good sleep. The room is basic, not too clean, and in much need of a new paint job. Air conditioning and shower worked well. There were huge piles of laundry and the end and along the hallway. Well, at least they do their laundry. Make sure you use your key to lock the door. Door doesn't lock by itself. It was different in the morning, raucous cased by a Chinese tour group was heard through the thin doors. I took off around the street corner for a great choice of cheap tasty foods especially noodles. Go local, breakfast at SD5. Because my bus ride via StarMart to Taiping, Malaysia, also booked online, was not till 10 p.m. I extended my stay till 6 p.m. for an additional SD35. They were very strict about exact check-out time. You'll get a warning call. The Aljunied MRT is about 10-15 minutes north and from there Kallang is only SD1 and 15 minutes away. There is a deposit of SD1 on the fare, however, you could reclaim the deposit when you return the card. The Golden Mile Complex bus terminal is another 10-15 walk from the Kallang MRT. They charged SD1 for 15 minutes of internet use and no other amenities are available. All in all a basic and economical (for Singpapore price) place for a layover stay.", "Date": "February 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur", "Title": "\u201cAnnoying Receptionist!!!\u201d", "Author": "Dewi_Andra", "ReviewID": "UR97035030", "Content": "Day 1 - Check in @ around 1600hrs.

The location is far away from all the touristy places like Orchard road but is closer to the airport, depending on what you are looking to do in Singapore should really determine if you would like to stay here, If you are just looking for a cheap and nasty hotel to stay in and then go back to the airport in the morning then you will be fine here, but if you are looking to travel to places like Orchard Road then I would suggest spending a little more and getting a hotel closer, as a few taxi rides around will easily bump the price you have paid.
