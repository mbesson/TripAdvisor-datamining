He provided cheerful greeting when we met personally, and the rest of the staff that we dealt with, Francesco {van driver}, Richard and Dominkka at check-in, Nijel (for fixing the safe & refrigerator expediciously, (sorry about the misspelling), Ms. Moeller, Jeff and Justin (managers, thanks for help with the waffle, Jeff), Waitresses and Chef, in short, everyone, could not be more accomodating. Now, the buffet breakfast (complimentary with our reservation) had cooked-to-order selections included (no rubberry eggs here thanks to Enrique the Cheff ). In addition, the rooms were clean, the whole hotel was clean, and they were QUIET with adjustable sleep number beds...

Service was excellent from the front desk to the restaurant. The room seemed so new and comfortable. Free internet throughout the hotel although a bit slow (0.5Mbps down and 0.1Mbps up). Great selection of TV channels. Comfy bed. Nice bathroom with walk in shower. Business center to print off boarding passes. The restaurant seems to have good dinner selections, but limited vegetarian dishes. That would be my only complaint. I did see the pool which is in an awkward location. Right on the front side of the hotel where people on the street can see into the pool area. I didn't have time to use it, but I doubt I'd be comfortable in the cramped area visible from the parking lot and street. The pool at the Airport South location was way better if you are looking for a nice pool.

The front desk staff did not impress us, nor were they very helpful as they seem to be too busy with other things. Overall, the hotel rooms are contemporary and very clean, they just need to train their staff to smile and be more accommodating.

I missed my flight with AirTran and they advised me to call the Nationwide Vendor Program. Nationwide Vendor Program referred me to this beautiful facility. I have never been in Phoenix before and Mark made me feel at home. I had no luggage with me and Mark went out of his way to provide me with a toothbrush. This is hospitality at its best! I highly suggest this hotel if you are planning a trip to Phoenix or if you have an overnight lay over at the airport.", "Date": "February 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix", "Title": "\u201cAmazing\u201d", "Author": "yogadoug", "ReviewID": "UR23374388", "Content": "Stayed overnight at this new Hilton Garden Inn just minutes from Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. It's an amazing property. Rooms are large and bright and great views of the airport one side and mountains on the other!! Staff are very friendly and the amenities are first class. Can't be beat for the price .... PLUS, it's only a block from the 38th Street Light Rail station that takes you right into downtown or Tempe in just minutes for only $2.50/day unlimited rides!
