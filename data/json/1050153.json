{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Get very good value for your money We booked a package 4 days/3 nights at Matahari Tulamben Resort during our stay in Bali. They picked us up at our Hotel in Kuta and we made a very nice and relaxed trip to Tulamben. The rooms in the Resort are clean and ok. They have a swimming pool and they are located directly at the beach. We made 10 dives with Putu and his staff. They showed us whatever we want to see. Bumpheadparrot fishes at the USAT Liberty Wreck, blacktip sharkes and pygmaeseahorses........ During the dives we enjoyed the very good food in the restaurant at the beach. The staff was really friendly and liked very much to pamper us. After the 4 days they brought us back to Kuta and we are very sad that we booked only 4 days. But we will come back and stay longer.....", "Date": "Nov 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR567250028", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "scubadiver41"}, {"Content": "Kleines, einfaches Tauch-Resort mit allem was man braucht.
