The girl at the front desk told me i had to pay a 100 deposit (which would be refunded) plus the cost of my room, which was cool. I just swiped my card and we went up to our room. Our room was very nice but, when we took our shower the water would barely come out of the shower head. We didn't check out the casino and restaurant because we had been out all day in Ponce. The real reason i rated this hotel poor is because i have yet to receive my deposit money back.

I have given this place 2 chances and I still have some serious issues. I thought I was being an ovelry picky typical 'American', but my sweet Puerto Rican hosts assured me that my needs were not being met and I should NOT stay there again!! First stay: I found a pair of dirty men's boxer shorts (bright blue) on the white tiled floor in the bathroom, there was only 1 hanger in the closet, there was no luggage stand provided, neither of the 2 phones had a dial tone and when I asked about this I was told I needed to give them a credit card to make a call (obviously there was a translation issue). The drawers are so odd to open, they should have a sign explaining it. The worst for me was I complained about these issues several times to the front desk staff and either they didn't understand my english or they just wanted to ignore me, nothing happened until I sent an email to corporate that was routed to the front desk manager. Stay two: Maybe I'm just silly but I really wanted to give them a 2nd chance. There's no question that the location is ideal for the manufacturing facility I visit in Sabana Grande and this newly built hotel is much closer to a business hotel you would find in the states than some of the older properties (ex. Ponce Hilton). BUT, I just can't love it!! This time, things were up to snuff in terms of the room being set up well, but there was NO HOT WATER. The first morning I complained, I called down asking what to do. They said, first of all \"some of our rooms have the hot/cold installed backwards\". They also suggested that I \"open the water and let it run for like 20 minutes\". I tried both of those things and although after about 30 minutes it wasn't as cold, it certainly wouldn't be considered hot. Also, the water pressure is very poor. Again, I asked the front desk to address this and they said I could change rooms. When I returned home from work I asked if my hot water had been checked and I was met with a confused stair and the Erika checked through her book many times. She made a phone call and after the call she suggested that I change rooms. I said that I would try my hot water in my existing room and report back. It seemed almost hot so I went with it. The 2nd morning, I got out of bed, turned on the hot water, and went back to bed for a few minutes. Again, the shower was cold and got less cold by about 30 minutes of running. When I got home the 2nd day, the front desk manager was working and she urged me to change rooms again. I went to the 'new room' which I was told was prepped for me. I let the water run for 15 minutes in the 'new room' it was freezing. So in the end, I simply stuck out the cold water. Knowing that I was very very dissapointed. Also, my 2nd wake up call happened 30 minutes late. Good thing I knew better than to rely on them, I would've been later for work! In general, this place looks great on paper. The property is new and modern. Everything else is thumbs down! Also, Kareoke on Thursday night is way too loud!!", "Date": "December 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNice\u201d", "Author": "rain8949", "ReviewID": "UR85863280", "Content": "I recommend.

We were traveling in Western PR, which doesn't have a Choice hotel, so I researched for a nice place - since I was going to pay cash. The Best Western seemed like the place (and it is nice), but there were a few glitches, which caused me to be disappointed. The first room we were given had a huge area of the carpet wet from the AC. I was immediately given another room, which also had wet carpet by the AC unit at the window, but not as bad as the first. I called the front desk again and got the feeling this was probably in many (if not all) of the rooms - so I should just be happy this wet area was smaller than the first. A staff member brought me extra towels so I could soak up the water. By morning the dry towels I had put down (after soaking up the water that was there when we arrived) were soaked! The building seems new, so I don't know why there have not been able to properly address this problem. Another disappointment was the lack of salsa lessons promoted on the hotel's website for Thursday nights. My daughter was looking forward to these - and I had even called ahead before leaving on the trip to check on this - since it was an added value for the room rate I was paying; granted, there was a bit of a language barrier between me who speaks English and the front desk clerk who spoke Spanish; so I put my daughter (who speaks Spanish) on the phone, and she got a reply that the salsa lessons were offered on Thursday. Needless to say, when we arrived at the hotel, we were told the lesson were seasonal (despite the promo still on the Internet); but there was live music there that evening instead. The service at check-in went well - and the front desk staff truly seemed interested in helping me address the wet floor; but checkout was slow, with a line growing - yet no other staff came forward or were called to assist. The pool looked very good (though we did not use it) and the free breakfast was filling. For the money, I was disappointed.", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tallinn", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel for overnight stay\u201d", "Author": "dante007", "ReviewID": "UR74796288", "Content": "Location - to be honest it was unplanned stay in this hotel. We just arrived from Mayaguez on searched for place to stay and just saw big hotel beside the road. Price was quite high but hotel seemed ok too. If You ask what there is to do I don't know. For me it was \"oh, such a big hotel middle of nowhere and it's almost full...\" Rooms - as I understand it was just renovated and looking for these old pictures I wondered if this is the same hotel where I stayed? Cause what I saw was new, clean hotel. Nothing bad to say. Amenities - I did a quick visit to casino but didn't played. The penny room was very attractive :) Room price included breakfast what was normal. Not like in Europe but I had it enough. Hotel also had a pool but I even didn't try to go there after I saw hordes of kids heading there. I know that there is no place for relaxing, just children screams. Overall - for me it's hotel for overnight stay. Actually it seemed more like business hotel and I didn't find any character there. Suggestion - ask receptionist for local restaurants. We were directed to local area where were 3-4 seafood restaurants and food was really good.

I arrived late at night, called via cell phone for directions from Ponce, and was dreading the usual sleepy, semi-incoherent mumbles from a night clerk.
