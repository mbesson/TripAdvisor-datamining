{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Forget it........ I got it from Airport as an advice for my price range = 30$.in high season !! Is an double bed. If you only need a bed for stay ..maybe you will find cheaper one. No lights on the bed,no curtain nor hooks in the bath-room , bring a basket for the litter !! lol ...If there would be NOT this rules ( no over night guests nor part -timer etc.) i get the idea , this hotel would be only for them clients ! No frigerator in room , TV only local stations ..For the price absolutly overpriced . Breakfast : if you need only cigarette and coffee .so this stay is a good choice one more . One cup of Tea or Coffee/two slices of toast /butter and jam and glas of juice ! Maybe Buffet if you book online /higher category .And you are not alone in night : mosquitos like to bites you..lolA/C was okay. And Bathtub too...Th.Knopf .", "Date": "Aug 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR955902660", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "TomButton"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d676108-r19448206-Simpang_Inn-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "676108", "Price": "$43"}}
