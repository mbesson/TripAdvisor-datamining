To give an idea of what to expect: It is an old apartment building that has turned into a hotel. The rooms are about the size of a deluxe student dorm, and are abit 'snug' because of the two beds - Queen and a single. There is nothing glamorous about this place, but if you need a place to sleep and wash up so you can explore Toronto, and don't want to spend $100+ per night, this is your place. Even better, you can cook your own food! Microwave, stove, fridge and sink! The average meal in TO is about $12-15per person... cooking in your room can be a great way to save money to explore the city with. True to the other reviews, the halls do have a smell and our room did not. We also had an air conditioner, but it couldn't keep up with the heat, so for the most part, we were quite warm. The shower pressure was good, the toilet worked... there is a table for two, a small desk, a television... Bang for the buck, its a good deal. If you're used to turn down service, this may not be your place. Exect friendly front desk service, a free newspaper at the front door of the building, free coffee in the front desk area... and free parking. You don't find this in many places. We had to change hotels and with parking and the change in rates, each night cost us $100 MORE than at the Grange.. The neighbourhood looks abit sketchy, but our BMW didn't get harassed that night. While this place wasn't what we expected, we still had a good nights sleep and if it were not a question of convenience, we would have stayed throughout our entire reservation. That said, there were no hassels about our early check out and our cc was credited the difference without question. You pay for your entire stay upon checkin. Any incidentals are dealt with at check out - like any hotel. The great thing about this place is that they did their best and we had no problems. Parking - Free Coffee (front desk) - Free Newspaper - Free Kitchenette, eating area, desk, television Air Conditioner (not designed for really hot days/nights) Beds - 1 Queen that is comfortable, 1 single that is ideal for children.

Nothing fancy but nice. It was okay. It seemed clean. It was not even close to roomy or spacious - at least not our room. We were on the 4th floor. There was no coffee-pot (or coffee) but I had brought tea bags and there was a kettle and microwave. The double-bed was too soft, the single a brick. It's not the quietest area of town. Not traffic noise but people noise. People yelling at night. They do have their own parking but it's open and not monitored. We didn't have any problems. The management was friendly and helpful. The only problem we had was when we went out for the night, we left the window open. When we came back, it was closed. Nothing was missing but that made me uncomfortable. I'd have to be hard-pressed to stay there again.", "Date": "May 10, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, NY", "Title": "\u201cNot Bad\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1769743", "Content": "I stayed at the Grange hotel this past weekend and I must say I was plesantly surprised.
