However, I can safely say that the poorer reviews were quite frankly rubbish. We had a lovely 4 days stay with my partner at the hotel over new year. Staff were all very friendly, welcoming and helpful, Rooms were clean and spacious and breakfast was also very nice. Mini bar prices were very reasonable. As for location, I read how it was 20 minutes and so on from the metro\u2026 Again, nonsense. Metro station Entance was just a 5-7 minute walk away and the metro was very impressive. So frequent and easy to get around. Would highly recommend a T10 ticket for the metro, which gives you 10 journeys. On the machine it gives you the option of 1 zone for around 8.95. There are options for 2 zones and 3 zones for more money but on the one zone ticket we got around all of town so this is all you will need. On new years eve we visited restaurant Montjuic El Xalet. Breathtaking setting and views. Food was nice but very expensive and extremely small portions. Would still recommend as it was a great experience. A walk down Las Ramblas is essential, we ended up doing it twice and while there visit the food market. You must taste the kinder flavoured ice cream! The fresh fruit juices that you will see everywhere there are tasty at first but far too many pips so be warned! The Cathedral is also a must see and also go in the lift to the roof, great experience. I was slightly disappointed by the Sagrada Familia, they have renovated it so much it is almost not cultural any more, too modern. The Nou Camp was also a brilliant day out as a football fan.

The staff are very friendly, especially the bar man who will happily top your strawberry mojita up with extra rum at no additional charge! :) The rooms were (as mentioned in previous reviews) inpeccably clean! I couldn't find an inch of dust anywhere. They were also spacious. We had specifically asked for a high floor room, which I think in hindsight was a good move as we weren't disturbed by any of the traffic noise from outside. The only drawback was that due to the positioning of the room we didn't have a good view. So I would recommend requesting a high floor room with a view if you want one. It didn't bother us too much anyway as we were out and about most of the time. I have to mention the mini bar. I have been to many hotels where the mini bar prices are extortionate, but the prices in this hotel were very reasonable. I would probably steer clear of the white wine though which wasn't good at all. Unfortunately, I can't comment on the restaurant as my boyfriend and I ate out every night. However, the breakfast was pretty good, with plenty of choice. Location-wise, Barcelona is a pretty big plce, so like any big city, being located near a public transport hub is always a bonus. I would highly recommend the local Metro service for getting around Barcelona. There is a Metro stop about 8 mins walk from the hotel. You can buy a ticket for 8 Euros which provides you with 10 journeys. It's so much easier to use than the London underground too. For a three-star hotel, there's not a lot I can fault about this hotel. My only niggle would be the beds which were a little on the hard side but hotel beds tend to be this way.

I had been here before with my late husband after we had a previous poor experience at the Hilton in Barcelona. This hotel had more amenities than the Hilton provided at our prior stay, and it still provides a hotel experience that more travelers from the USA would be familiar with and accustomed to - Wifi, multilanguage TV, toiletries, large bathrooms. The only downside that could be improved is that the air conditioning and electricity to the room are controlled by the room key card. The air did not cool down sufficiently, so we opened the room window in the evening to allow the room to cool down from breezes off the ocean. That made it a little noisy, but we managed. The breakfast buffet is quite plentiful by European standards. We had just come from a week in Paris where many of the North American and English breakfast items provided here were available at extra cost only. Rebecca, the Desk Clerk, deserves special mention. She is polite, organized, always courteous and helpful even when the desk gets rushed at check-in and check-out. The bar and dining staff are top-notch also. We did have problems with the desk clerk we encountered on July 2, 2010 who was supposed to see that we had a triple instead of a double room. It took 4 calls to the reception desk to get the extra bed and another 4 to get an extra towel set. We never did figure out what her delay was. It seemed she never followed through on requests, yet we saw her talking to other staff and not being particularly busy. Rebecca is a standout for customer service in any language however. One of the best lunches we ordered in Barcelona was at this hotel. It was prepared beautifully and presented well. No one rushes you at this hotel. Before we left, the young male desk clerk even provided us with a wake-up cup of coffee in the lobby. One downside for some: The mattresses in the rooms could be replaced soon. They have gone from firm to hard. I did not mind it as I like a very firm mattress; but my friends sure did. Walk around the neighborhood of this hotel.

Hotel is described as a three star and standards wander between a two & a three. First the good points. It's reasonable value for an expensive city and with bus and train routes nearby every part of the city is accessable. We visited Barcelona for the Nou camp and with teenage boys it was ideal for that. Walk 5-10 mins to Entenca station and four stops later you are at Collblanc for the Nou camp. This is also not a bad metro station to use from the airport as from there to the hotel it's down hill. Worth considering with bags etc!! Reception areas and bar/restaurant were nice enough. The rooms however are looking a little tired. The door frame was showing signs of damp and coming away from the wall (room 101 - triple). Areas of the bath had slight mould growth. The biggest problem with this room however was the fact that the hotel wont put the air con until until end of May and do not have any fans as an alternative. If you open the window expect sleepless nights due to traffic noise below. It was easter weekend and this part of Barcelona was like a ghost town. However the traffic still woke us up!! If you do stay here the greek restaurant a few doors down from the hotel on Avda roma (Dionisus) is very good and reasonably priced. The staff there are also great and it will still be open when you get back from the Nou camp or city centre. Otherwise the area has little to offer, but for seasoned travellers or those who dont mind the buses and metro it wont be an issue. The 10 trip metro ticket can be used by multiple people. Just remember to stamp it for each person on every trip on buses/metro. Bus 46 from terminal two at the airport will take you to Plaza Espanya for about 1.42 euros. Airport bus will cost about 3.50.

Would not complain if they have ever offered us a choice. Especially that it wasn't as cheap as it is now. So, our advice, ask for the window unless of course you are enjoying the perpetual gloom.

The room was quite small, but perfectly ok for us. There is a mini bar which wasn't too over priced, we used it to store water and milk. There are no tea or coffee making facilities in the room, so we took a travel kettle. There is air con and heating in the rooms, but the air con didn't work in our room and blew out hot air.

The road outside is busy and therefore noisy, but the double glazing does keep out most of the noise. Staff were polite and efficient without being over the top.

The Hotel staff here was better than some of the nicer ones in the US. The room was a great size and the tourist attraction book in the room (which we found 2 days in) is a great source of info for prices, transit, and food options in the city. After reading reviews about the breakfast in the hotel we chose a ton of other options on the way to the metro each morning. The only reason I wouldn't recommend this hotel to everyone is the distance from the city center and mass transit options. The walk is certainly a good one (20 min to Las Ramblas area and about 10-15 to the nearest metro stop). Coming from a walking city it was fine for us, but I think next time we return to Barcelona the convenience of a closer hotel is worth a little more of a splurge. Sightseeing: We took the highly recommended open top bus tour, and it was a great way to get an overview of Barcelona. Park Guiell is a great trip. Pack some snacks and drinks and check it out, it is a little bit of a walk from the metro (it is up a hill) but well worth it if you love architecture. The Sagrada Familia is a must see and if only one elevator to the top is operating when you go (like us), wait in that line before touring the lower grounds and the museum. The views from the towers are amazing and if you have a translation headset you can listen to the information while you are in line. You can see most of the interior from the elevator line (directly to the right as you go through the main entrance) We took a day trip to Monserrat, Torres Winery, and Sitges, and if you chose a day trip overview I would pick this excursion.

By taxi, it takes around 20 minutes to get to the Hotel, which costs approximately 20-25 Euros. For those not not used to visiting Spanish cities, it's worth bearing in mind that taxis from the Airport (to any location) charge a supplement of around 5 Euros (in addition to the fare that shows on the meter). Hotel staff appeared very attentive and the double room with which we were provided was very clean and kept to a good standard. The mini bar is also reasonably priced, although the snacks are priced a little excessively. On that note, the price of a breakfast is also rather excessive; the cost for a continental breakfast is 12.50 Euros, whereas the cost for an \"English\" breakfast is \u00a3 15.00 Euros (you can eat breakfast for less than half the price at one of the tapas restaurants in the City Centre). You can either settle the bill following the breakfast or wait until you check-out / leave the hotel. On the first morning, my partner did not have any breakfast and, instead, made do with a coffee. On receiving the bill once we'd finished, the restuarant staff attempted to charge us for two continental breakfasts (a total of 25.00 Euros), despite the fact that my partner had only helped herself to a coffee. Whilst the restuarant staff were happy to adjust the bill to reflect one breakfast and a coffee, I would recommend that you check each and every bill to satisfy yourself of the charge that you're likely to receive when checking-out. As regards the hotel's location, it's approximately a 2.5km walk to the City Centre (i.e. the Cathedral, Gaudi Museum, etc) which, if done on a regular basis, makes for good exercise! If you not one for walking, taxis are always available (the taxis in Barcelona are coloured in black and yellow), although to avoid constant taxi fares, it might make better sense to stay in a more central location. One recommendation would be the open top bus tour, which costs approximately 21 Euros for an adult ticket (lasting for a day). This is a great way to see Barcelona and some of the main sights if you're only visting for a few days and, thus, are limited for time. The Sagrada Familia is a must see, but can get very crowded during peak season. Overall, the AB Vilodomat is a good hotel; clean with no thrills.

I Paid 80\u20ac per night for a double room, which was excellent value! Location The hotel is situated on Avignue de Roma, 3 blocks away from the Metro stations Urgel and Rocafort. This takes about 5/7 mins to walk and is in a residential neighborhood where I felt completely safe. There is a cashpoint across the road and plenty of cafes and restaurants where you can sit outside and have a drink. Taxi's are cheap an plentiful and always run past the hotel anytime of day, we either asked the reception to phone one which was always efficient or hailed them from the street. A taxi will cost around 6\u20ac to plaza catalunya. Rooms We stayed in room 107 on the first floor which had a view about 20ft above street level, the view was interesting as we could watch the action on the street from our room. The bed was a double bed (not two single ones pushed together!) which was a pleasant surprise! The room was quite large by European standards and was incredibly clean. The safe is available for hire for price of 10\u20ac which is well worth it to keep all belongings in. Now for the best feature, the mini bar! The mini bar was extremely good value which is a rare occurrence! Beers and Soft Drinks were around 1.40\u20ac which was a relief as it meant we never had to keep going to supermarkets! The bathroom was clean and had complimentary toiletries. All in all this hotel offered an excellent base for exploring Barcelona. The hotel is not centrally located but this makes it all the more fun! The prices are spot on in my opinion and I would not hesitate in using this hotel when I visit Barcelona again!", "Date": "September 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "LEICESTER, U K", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel For Families And For Pre Cruise\u201d", "Author": "VAKILAT", "ReviewID": "UR19941363", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in August before our cruise.

I recommended the hotel to all my friends who were going on the cruise and in total 5 families ended staying at the hotel pre cruise. Rooms were excellent. Altho interconnecting, both rooms led to a small hallway which had its own door. It became like a little flat of your own. Breakfast was good too. Its very good value for money but only if you book it in advance as its half price otherwise you pay something like 12 euros. Its about 10 mins walk to the metro. Staff helpful but could do with a bit more smiling. if you get there very late at night there isn't much to eat altho you can help yourself to a free cup of strong coffee and free pastries downstairs . There is a supermarket across the road for your water etc; Downside is the road building noise which starts in the morning but otherwise a superb hotel . I think it is better than a 3 star. Beware of the taxi drivers as they charged me an exhorbitant 35 euros to get to the port. It should be no more than about 25 euros for 4 passengers and 4 luggage!!The rate for this hotel compared to other 3* is less yet overall it is better than a 3 star.I would add that all my other friends had nothing bad to say about the hotel.

The hotel reception and our bedroom and bathroom were very clean with extra toiletries each day.. We arrived on 23rd April, and it is a tradition in Catelonia for ladies to be presented with a red rose, so it was a nice surpise to be given a long stemmed red rose when we checked in. The Bus Touristic, at 22 euros each for two days unlimited travel or 18 euros for one day (and this included all three routes) was excellent value as it gives you an insight into the location of the various sights and you can plan where and when you want to get off the bus. A tip for the bus - don't insist on going upstairs or you will be waiting a long time, get on and sit downstairs and as soon as seats become available upstairs, the guides offer you the chance to change seats before they let anyone else on. We will go back to Barcelona, not to this hotel, but purely because of it's location and the lack of air conditioning.", "Date": "May 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dudley WEST MIDLANDS", "Title": "\u201cone word......FANTASTIC.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4975708", "Content": "Me and the wife stayed at the villadomat for 3 nights in march.After reading the reviews on here we decieded to give it a go.And we were not disappointed.The hotel was very nice.Our room was small but ok for just the 2 of us.I couldn't fault the maid service.We even had a welcome with our names on the tv when we first turned the tele on.That was a nice touch. The location was excellent.We didn't want to be in the centre.A taxi ride was about 6/7 minuites away from catalunya.We travelled on the underground tube.The nearest station was about a 15 minuite walk.Which was not a problem with us.Buy a T10 ticket.This will give you 10 passes on the underground for just over 6 euro.Otherwise it will cost you 1 euro 20 for a single ticket. We went to the camp nou to watch barcelona.Which was a great experience.We paid \u00a327 each for our tickets which is even cheaper than watching my beloved wolves. I would recommended the bus tour.For about \u00a315 each you see the whole city.You can get off anytime and see the sights.There is 2 routes the blue line and red line.We done the both in the 1 day. I would recommend the nou camp tour followed by the musuem too. We took extra care in the ramblas as we read about pickpockets and muggings.But we never had any problem.I bought some barcelona football stuff from the shops on the ramblas,i bartered with some of them and i got a cap down from 10 euro to 6 euro so it's worth a go. overall i would give villadomat 10/10 and barcelona 9 and half out of 10.", "Date": "April 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Roma", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel...

We enjoyed the good service at the breakfast buffet and dinner; food was of high quality and all our needs were answered by the brisk and friendly waiters.

Overall we were very happy with every aspect of the hotel. Location: The location is fine. It is just a short 15 min walk from Sants station from where you can catch trains, metro, bus to anywhere in the city. The airport bus which we took stops behind the station. We used Rocafort Metro station when going into town - its a short 10 min walk down Viladomat Street from the hotel and is only 3 stops from Placa Catalunya where your touring of the city should begin. Rooms: The room we had was on the 5th floor and was spotless. The beds are comfortable and the room was reasonably spacious. The shower was excellent too. Service: We didn't eat at the hotel preferring to eat our breakfasts at one of the many nearby caf\u00e9s. The buffet also seemed a bit expensive at \u20ac12.50 per person - when we could get a nice feed for under \u20ac5 just down the street. The staff were extremely friendly and courteous. I would recommend this hotel wholeheartedly for anyone who wants to stay in a nice neighbourhood but not too far from all the action. By the way, I thought the Ramblas was disappointing.

Although away from the main tourist areas, it proved to be right for us. The staff were very helpful and courteous, the hotel exceptionally clean with an excellent restaurant. Catching the tourist bus from the Sants Terminal proved very easy. If you choose to fly into Gerona with a budget airline be warned catching any other mode of transport other than the Barcelona Bus is expensive. Queuing is unheard of and when the flights arrive, it is a bit of a free for all and make sure you buy your ticket before getting on the bus.
