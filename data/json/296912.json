Three main issues, for a hotel considered as a 4 stars, but in my opinion less than 3: 1. Unfortunately was a rainy days period, with temperatures under 9 Celsius, so after a half day trip in rain in Istanbul, a warm room was more than welcome. Unfortunately the policy of the hotel was to give heat into rooms only after 7 pm until 5-6 am, so to have an afternoon nap was a nightmare. Of course in te lobby the heat was working, so the hotel personnel to be warmed as the guests arriving... 2. Another problem: we are smokers, so in the morning we wanted to take the cafe into our smokers room, after breakfast; we were not allowed by the restaurant personnel; the condition to have the cafe in the room was to order to them, even in breakfast time and of course, to pay it accordingly as room-service!!! is the first time is happening, and believe me, these last 10 years I traveled a lot! 3. the last issue is related to the breakfast menu; it consisted only in cheese, olives, some cheap salami, boiled eggs, jam, honey, butter and of course corn-flakes with milk; it works 2-3 days, but then you get sick! at least some diversity and a hot corner, because space is enough, to make some eggs in different ways, pancakes, hot sausages, ham, etc, as almost 3 star restaurants have included in the breakfast.

We stayed in 1st level, and I wouldnt complain about the noise. Its just the sounds of a large city. Small rooms? Well hotelrooms tend to be small. Even the top level best western hotel in Sevastopol in Ukraine has small hotel rooms. I wouldnt complaim. Some comlain about the breakfast. I am glad they serve the same breakfast every day. A huge buffet - it took my 3 days to taste about everything the had for us. And WHAT a view from the restaurant all over the city, the golden horn and bosporus - wonderful.
