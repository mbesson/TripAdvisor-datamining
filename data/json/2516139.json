Firstly, When booking, it mentioned that there was a \u201c$25.00 valet fee,\u201d but nowhere did it state that valet was the ONLY option. I had figured I would just self-park to avoid the fee, but this is not an option, so I find the advertisement to be misleading. So, it seems all guests should be certain to add $25 a day to their hotel stay, if they plan on having a car\u2014this should be explicitly expressed, not hidden. Secondly, once in my room, the wallpaper was peeling off the walls in the bathroom, where black mildew/mold was coated underneath. It was disgusting. The carpet was so stained and dirty I did not want to take off my shoes. I asked for a different room immediately. What I got was better, but still unsatisfactory. The furniture is rickety and outdated. The windows leak air so that you can feel a draft standing next to them, and the lighting is poor. The bathroom is so small that I had to maneuver myself in twists and turns to close the door (I am a small 5'3\u201d 115lb. woman!) The shower gave very little water pressure\u2014and as for toiletries, they only provide shampoo, small bar soap and lotion, no conditioner. The walls are paper thin, so you can hear everything your neighbors are doing, and anyone walking the hallway might as well be having a conversation in your room. I was awoken several times during the night (2:00am and 3:30am) by loud guests returning form a night out. The two women at 3:30am were screaming obscenities at each other for nearly 15 minutes, one of which was clearly drunk. I called the front desk three times with intention to ask for security, but NO ONE answered any of my three calls! Finally, they left, but needless to say, my sleep was already ruined for the night. As for the beds: hard mattress; thin, floppy pillows. Not comfortable. I really have nothing good to say about the hotel other than the people at the front desk, when they were there, were very friendly. I often come to LA for business and pleasure; I will NEVER stay here again, nor would I ever recommend it to a friend.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBad customer service dirty bathrooms!\u201d", "Author": "Misterywer", "ReviewID": "UR128189573", "Content": "Front desk receptionist got into an argument with all guests that he checked in!

If you take public transport, ie train, you will need to change three lines and take about one hour to get there from LAX airport. Don't do it if your plane arrives late at night and if it is your first time in LA. We took the train and bus option, and due to a delayed flight, we arrived at LAX at night. the trip planner I have prepared instructed us to change to a local bus at Vermont train station. Well, shall I say -It was the dirties, most offputting train station I have ever been to. there is no light in the lift and you could smell urine. I didn't feel save at all. Desperate to get onto a bus, at least there will be lights and a nus driver, we boarded the local bus 206, it took us along Normandie road, there were only two female passengers boarded the bus throughout our ride, and that was the only time I felt saver. The hotel is in the middle of the korean town, if you are comfortable to explore the suburb at night, you will find some decent korean restaurants and supermarket, some restaurants open for 24 hours. Now, the hotel. When I heard the good review from a frequent traveller friend of mine, I went onto their website and checke out the rate. It is about 130 aussie a night. With the glamorous photos and intro they had on their website, I thought, I have just found a gem in LA to stay. Well, not so soon..... When I got to the hotel, I thougt the lobby on their website seems grander. I thought I went to the wrong hotel until the front desk assured me that they can find my booking. The room we stayed in is on the 11th floor, the lift took us up is quite old. We can definately smell cigarette odour in our room even though it states as a non smoking room. We can see hollywood sign from our window, that was a small excitment. The furniture are out dated, but the room is clean. Only complain is the aircon. The is very noisy when you turn it on.

I travel for both business and pleasure a bunch each year. I probably spend 75-100 nights a year in hotels. In my opinion, this was one of the worst hotel experiences I have had in several years. The rooms are filthy and severely outdated. The carpet is coming up all over the room. The curtains are heavy, dank, musty and filthy. The housekeeping was basic at best. The towels in the bathroom are barely larger than hand towels and are wafer thin - as are the walls. A upgrade/refresh would be nice. The lobby has been refreshed, now it is time to tackle the rooms.The hotel is in a great location between downtown and West Hollywood, so why not? The staff were, for the most part, pleasant. The valet guys are a bit pushy but they probably earn most of their income on tips, wait, then maybe they could be less pushy and nicer? Oh yeah, the \"Hollywood sign\" view is not exactly that. It is a view of a high-rise apartment and if you look closely, off in the distance you can see the sign. Don't spend the extra $10-15 a night for this like I foolishly did.

However, once you get onto 3rd floors and higher, it's very apparent that the upkeep of hotel has been very poor. The first room I stayed at had the following problems: -AC unit was blowing out cigarette odor despite being a non-smoking room -Tile in bathroom was cracked and degrading -Carpet in room was stained in several areas -Free wi-fi was extremely slow -TV was an CRT unit that had very poor picture quality and limited channel selection. -Considerable street noise. After being requested to be relocated to a second room, the following problems were noticed: -AC unit was not blowing out cigarette odor BUT it was not able to cool the room either. -Tile in bathroom floor was stilling broken in several areas. -Carpet in the room was still stained in several areas with about six 6\" black stains. -Free wi-fi was again very slow...wasn't sure if Google would even load. -TV was again an old CRT unit with same issues. -Considerable street noise. In addition to this, the gym offered on the 11th floor was practically falling apart and was not opened at its posted time. The 5-7PM happy hour selection (both free food and half price menu selection) was very limited. It is right next to a metro stop but being located in LA, there are plenty of metro rail and bus stops all over the city and most only being 5-10 minutes walk away. Had they offered other incentives, such as 3 pieces of free laundry, complementary dinners and/or drinks, or other incentives...this would have made them more competitive against other hotels and motels. So the take-away from this is: Only use this hotel when you can't find any other hotels or even motels to stay at, which should be very tough situation to get into. If I had a chance to do this again, I would have chosen a hotel with loyalty programs like Hilton or Holiday Inn chains.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cRobbed\u201d", "Author": "imnottan", "ReviewID": "UR125427788", "Content": "Seen roach motels with nicer amenities.

The bath towels were ridiculously small, barely bigger than hand towels, and thin material. The bathroom was tiny and very cramped. There was no telephone book for yellow page browsing, and I could not call the front desk because the phone menu paper was missing from the face of the phone which had several buttons, but did not know which one was which due to missing face.

From the outside, the Wilshire Hotel appeared like any typical hotel: located on a busy street, valet parking (not free), bland looking building, etc. The lobby was welcoming. It had a well sized bar area with flat screen TVs which had on different games. There was also another coffee bar that served coffee and tea and breakfast goods. Overall, when you took it all in, it felt as if this was a pretty fancy hotel. However, I was disappointed when I opened the door to room #340. The room completely threw me off! The light in the corridor didn't work. The carpet was incredibly dirty. After fidgeting around with the old fashion circular thermostat, we finally got it to work: on or off. Even though it was set to be 70 degrees, it just kept on getting hotter and hotter. (YIKES!) The restroom was compact, which was fine. But the towels weren't clean very well. In addition, the water pressure for the shower was pretty weak and the water wasn't as hot as I liked it. (I like it hot!) Restroom amenities: Blow dryer, one-cup serving coffee maker, lotion, shampoo, soap All in all, it's OK for a one night stay. Would I stay here again? No. It's convenient if you're dependent on the Metro as your main form of transportation in LA (the Purple Line's Wilshire/Normandie is literally right across the street).

When we checked into the hotel, the front clerk said they had no more King beds and my husband and I would have to sleep in separate beds. I was 7 months pregnant, and it was supposed to be a special time for us to be together before the sleepless nights of baby arrive, so I asked if it was at all possible to get a king bed. Abraham was awesome and gave us the Presidential Suite! How sweet. :) We went up to the room, and found it was lovely, very nice bed. And to my delight there was a huge tub! Yay!!! Exactly what a pregnant woman would want after flying all day long. I tried to fill the tub, but the drain wouldn't close. I called the front desk, a repairman came one hour later (it was now midnight), and confirmed it was broken. We called the front desk and told Yvonne the acting manager that the tub was broken, she said, \"Well, you aren't paying for your room, you are using miles, so you should just be grateful to have the Pres. suite.\" I countered, \"I have never been in a Pres. suite with a broken bathtub before, that kind of disqualifies it as Presidential doesn't it?\" I asked to speak to her supervisor because her tone of voice was so offensive. She said there was no manager on duty, and then she hung up on me! We got dressed and went to the lobby, we asked for the manager, Yvonne came out and saw us. I asked her, \"Are you the manager?\" She said, \"Sometimes'. This place was getting weirder and weirder! As I explained to her that I was shocked by her customer service, she said, \"You were too aggressive, in fact, now you are saying these things in front of other customers.\" I turned to the couple standing beside me at the front desk. They looked at me and smiled and said, \"Oh, don't worry about us, we are checking out of this place at midnight for a reason. This place is seriously shady.\" I turned back to Yvonne and shook my head. Since apparently there was no manager on duty at all, I wrote a letter and left it with the desk to give to the manager when he showed up someday.

So, hotel pickings were slim. My friend found this hotel on one of the travel websites and the pictures of the hotel's lobby and rooms were actually quite nice so we chose to stay there based on the price and the pictures. Well, the hotel is in Korea town, its lobby is quite photogenic and I think they probably photographed one of their remodeled rooms which we obviously didn't get to see. We were situated on the 12th floor and once we walked into our room we realized it was a little warm. We just assumed the high temperature was due to the curtains having been open all day and the ac being shut off. So, we turned it down and waited for it to cool. By the time we realized it wasn't happening we'd already unpacked and had begun getting ready for dinner. So we decided to give it the night and would ask for another room in the morning if the situation didn't improve. While we were on our way out the next morning, we asked that someone be sent to our room to check on the ac. When we returned SEVERAL hours later, we realized it was still quite warm so we called the front desk and no they hadn't come so we waited patiently for the technician to arrive. Once he did and tinkered around the unit for a bit he said \"it's better, but it's still not good\" so he put in a request for another room. They were nice enough to put us in another room just a few doors down so we didn't have to repack all of our belongings to move to another floor. Unfortunately, the AC in room number two really wasn't any better and we spent the remainder of the weekend fanning ourselves as we applied our makeup. I'm not sure if the problem is on the 12th floor or if it's in the entire hotel, but when you can't open the windows in the room the AC really needs to work. The room itself wasn't dirty, but it didn't feel clean and the comforters looked like they'd never been washed, EVER. Of course, we threw all that stuff off the beds anyway. Oh, and did I mention there's no fridge? A warm room without cold water is a bad combination. Just in case you're wondering, no I don't plan on staying here again & you probably shouldn't either.

Most things in the area were full or too expensive, and the Wilshire was having a summer sale so we booked a room there. It was a big mistake - I guess if a hotel's having a sale in a weekend where most other hotels are full of guests, it's a bad sign. Like may other reviewers, we were surprised (but not terribly upset) by the $22 mandatory valet parking. What did upset us was the condition of the rooms and the extremely unattentive staff. The beds linens and carpet seemed like they had not been cleaned in some time, and everything smelled very musty like an old closet. The room did not have enough towels etc. for everyone (even though we did make a reservation for 4 adults) and even after calling the front desk twice and coming down in person to ask for more, we still didn't get any until late the next morning.

The hotel itself is actually pretty nice, located in Koreatown (Downtown LA). VERY easy to get to Chinese Theater/walk of fame area by subway. Didn't rent a car, so this hotel was in a prime location by being across the street from the subway system. $6 for an all day metro pass. Also liked that the hotel offered breakfast and other food so I didn't have to go searching for food. Rooms: Rooms are my only complaint. They were really outdated and needed a major renovation, but paying what I paid, I'm really not complaining. The beds were still comfy and I had no trouble with the A/C or heat, nor any trouble with sleeping. They were also pretty clean. Service: Have no complaints. Easy check-in and out, and the concierge actually will give you a map of the subway system to help you with your travels. The hotel is in a pretty safe location (Los Angeles seemed to have a lot of beggers and people asking for money, etc), but the hotel was safe. Hotel also has a car service you can use if need be. Also, for car service from LAX to Wilshire and back, I used the Super Shuttle which is only $16 per person as opposed to $55 flat rate the private town cars would charge. They're right outside of the departure pick up area at LAX. I also would HIGHLY reccommend Starline tours. They're right in front of the Chinese theater, and I got a 48-hour hop on, hop off tour for $50. So that's TWO days full of touring for $50! I also got the celebrity home 2 hour tour for $30. Both tours were AMAZING! The hop on, hop off is worth it because you can hang out in Beverly Hills by Rodeo Drive, go to Santa Monica Pier (amazing) or hang out in Downtown LA which is sort of where the hotel is near. Also, GO VISIT GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER! THEY'RE CLOSING MAY 20TH!! :( I went on the tour for $12.50 and it was so beautiful inside. It's such a shame that it was sold (supposedly to some man who's a club owner and may change it to a giant club?) The workers have no idea what will become of it. This place has so much history, and I highly suggest you visit it before it's closed and possibly shut down for good. Take the tour with Beverly. She was so informative and had nice stories about all the celebrities she's met over the past 20 years she's worked there. My heart goes out to her! All in all, the Wilshire is a great hotel because of it's location and price. If you're looking for 4 or 5 star, then clearly this isn't for you.

It must be said: our previous hotels were luxuory hotels and awesome. We did expect the worst of Wilshire knowing all reviews of tripadvisor.com Our arrival was ok, a pleasant woman helped us friendly and effective. The room was outdated, but was expected. We did try to contact frontdesk to ask if a renovated room was applicable. A grumpy man told us the hotel did not have any renovated rooms and hung up! 15 mins later we had some trouble with WiFi, called the frontdesk again for some instructions \"WiFi is working ok, probably your settings\" the same grumpy man even more rude.Hardly half an hour later we discovered the toilet wasn't draining it was even flooding and called frontdesk again. Grumpy man sighed, didn't believe me and after another explanation he'd sent an engineer right away. Half hr later engineer didn't show up and called again. I don't mind waiting if I know I have to wait. 20 mins later still no engineer.. it took almost 1,5h for an 'engineer' to show up and fix the toilet. Since it was flooded a cleaninglady would be sent. Went across the street for internet cafe since WiFi still not ok, no stabile connection. Returning after an hour, the bathroom was not cleaned. so I went to look for a cleaning lady myself.. frontdesk seemed not reliable! This was just the 1st day! At night the rooms were very cold, due to a draft: lower windowglass could be moved 1/4\" first 3 nights were cold but ok. Last night was worst: we had to wake up @ 5am to return to the airport. @ midnight I was awaken by heavily dripping on my head! A huge leakage just above my bed.. a broken waterpipe or maybe a broken sewer??? Called frontdesk again: told about leakage and was put in hold! then connection was broken!!! called 'emergency' got same grumpy man explained the situation again and I was really not satisfactory with the service. We did get another room, same floor other wing: key didn't work: lock was broken :-(. We didn't care just wanted to sleep! As a gesture we did get a refund off 50% of parking fee, so finally a small sign of service. Unluckily we could sleep because of many yelling, shouting and knocking Koreamen @ 2am!! After a 3rd call to frontdesk finally security came. And @3:30am the korean next to our room decided to take a noisy bath with hard singing. As a gesture we did get a refund of the remaining valit parking fee. But that couldn't really compensate the lack of sleep and frustration.

The rooms are not nice at all, the TV is small and the sheets dont fit the bed, there was a drop of blood dried up on one of the beds in my room. The view, was not of the Hollywood hills like it said but more of the Carl's Jr. across the street,.... altho it seemed like the general location of this hotel was somewhat safe in Korea town, i wouldn't stay there again, in the wilshire or Korea town, simply because its not a good location for travelers from the US unless you are korean. The elevators jammed up on my girlfriend and I for 15 minutes, the key to my room worked only on the 20th try, I was just incredibly happy to get out of this Hotel. As for the staff, they were extremely nice, giving there working conditions, the valet staff was underpaid and was prompt on mentioning it to acquire tips.

However - the room was booked and there was no changing so I left for LA in the hope that maybe some of the reviews were harsher than needed. Sadly this was not the case. The hotel itself is in good shape but in DESPERATE need of a revamp. Please someone call the Hilton or Mariott chain and get them to invest in the hotel. Its a great hotel in a good location but is trapped in the 70's/80s in its decor - gold, beige and brown. An interior designer would have a field day here!! The reception / lobby area is huge but very dated - with an open plan bar / lounge area with a Starbucks counter in one corner. The seating area has leather sofas of which a few are ripped and need a re-cover. So - on to the rooms. Well - the corridor on the floor I was put on (6th) was in dire need of new carpeting as it had big patches of stains along the entire length of the corridor. So - first impression was heart sinking. The bedroom itself was fine in size, but again, the carpet was stained in several places and the room needed an airing. The bathroom was of ok size but, again, in need of a revamp. The room facilities were basic (TV, Desk and a wardrobe with a fold away ironing board + iron). There was also a small coffee machine in the bathroom which came together with a few packets of ground coffee but plastic cups which looked like they would have melted should you attempt to pour in any hot liquid. All this said though - the bed linen was clean and the bed itself was actually quite comfortable. The aircon was in full working order and silent - and if left on took away the stuff smell the room omitted on first entry. The hotel has a restaurant on the 2nd floor along with a swimming pool and sun terrace. Neither of these are mentioned when you check in - so unless you ask you wouldnt know. Yet AGAIN - the pool area could have some loving attention and it would be a lovely place to hang out - though even though there are sun hairs and seating under a gazebo with Bougainvillea as a sun screen the area still lacked charm. The staff were friendly enough but you could tell they knew that they knew they were working in a shabby hotel and as such there was no real pride in their work. It is such a shame this grey gosling cant have a fairy godmother to come in and turn it in to the swan it deserves to be.

First, the pros: cheap rate for a hotel within 15 minutes of Downtown and USC; impressive entrance and lobby; friendly car valet service; good front desk staff; business center with free printing of airline boarding passes; lots of Asian and other fast food restaurants just outside the hotel; across from Metro subway station; restaurant and coffee kiosk on property, the latter serving Starbucks; no problem accessing 3G from my room; and hairdryer in bathroom and iron in closet. Second, the cons: stains on carpet; window not well sound insulated; old lamp fixtures; no in-room safe; a/c difficult to regulate; and no bowed curtain rod in shower. So, here's my recommendation about the Wilshire Hotel: if you want to save money in Los Angeles, this is an okay deal. I assume that the quality of room I received was related to my using Hotwire. From other posts about this hotel, it does appear there are better, newly renovated rooms. I don't what the rate for those are, but you should probably check and you still might get a pretty good deal. If you're a business traveler on a budget, I'd recommend a Hampton Inn or a Courtyard, but because neither of those are located in Downtown Los Angeles, you'd have to do more driving than you might like. You'd also be paying a lot more than $59.00 for the standard accomodations that business travelers expect. As I checked out, I noticed a lot of international travelers in the lobby, young and old. It almost felt like a hostel. I'm sure that the low rates appeal to these travelers and that they might not worry about some of the room details that a business traveler would. Finally, I went to Hotwire needing an inexpensive property that was close to Little Tokyo and USC. Hotwire described this unnamed hotel as \"near USC.\" So, I thought for sure that I was getting a great rate at the Radisson Midtown-USC, which is right across the street from the University and is normally way overpriced. I was surprised and disapppointed when I clicked \"select\" and discovered that I was paying for a hotel that really is not \"near USC.\" You always take your chances, I guess, with sites like Hotwire and Priceline. Anyway, to sum up, I didn't mind paying only $59.00 for a room for one night at the Wilshire Hotel.

I immediately even before getting our luggage off the cart went to see the manager. I just told him the truth about the room and we were not going to stay 1 night in that room. The managers name was Keith,and very friendly and helpfull guy. He gave us the keys to another room on the 11th floor and asked my wife and I to see this room. Well what a difffence it was like night and day. The room was brand new,,new carpet, new TV set, nice furnishings.It looked like the room I saw on there website. I think they are going under a big renovation project and is going to take sometime to redo all the rooms. Once we got into our new room we found the staff very friendly all the way from the front desk to the restaraunt to the concierge. The Buffet breakfast was standard, and we did not have lunch there. It was only open for breakfast and lunch. The lobby in the bar had a supper menu. The Hotel itself was just on the edge of downtown area the koreatown district. There was a Dennys, and Macs and Subway and a big Pharmacy store within easy walking distance. The LA Metro system was right across the Street. For 5.00 all day pass made it very easy to go downtown, Hollywood, Universal, all wihtin 15 mins to all locations. Also a great busline brought you downtown very easy. The true bottom line was that this hotel was well worth the money compared to the downtown hotels. We saved over 400.00 compared to the Sheraton or downtown Marriott. The bathrooms were a bit small but who is going to hangout in there bathroom all day,lol the only other small problem was they missed 1 wakeup call and I was up anyways so no damage done. They gave us 2 free coup[ons for the Buffet breakfast. That mistake did not happen again. They also have tours you can book right at the hotel for all kinds of places. and the 55.00 Lincoln towncare ride to LAX was worth every penny compared to the 35.00 Super Shuttle from LAX we took to the hotel.

The executive staff of the hotel was very inattentive and did not care about the complaints. The linens, bedding and towels were scary to use. The hotel guest were a very \"seedy\" clientele along with the usual Europeans and Asian airline staffs who obviously do not know quality hotels. This place has a good location but is purely horrible. I cannot understand why anyone in their right mind would even consider staying in this hotel unless the rooms were under $75.00-USD per night. With the USD to Euro conversion I can understand why European tourist stay at this hotel. I also have to expect that the airlines that have a contract with this hotel pay $50-USD or less per night because it cannot be worth more than that.

The customer service provided by the staff at the front desk was average, the concierge forever seems to be on a break, the bar man in the lobby bar give the impression he'd rather be anywhere but there, which is a shame as the lobby itself was a lot cooler to sit in than the room which was hot & stuffy.

I explained how we needed access into the room to get our keycard to take cash out..but after yelling and being extreamly rude to me personally - when it was not me who ran up the bill - a friend covered the cost.

Upon arrival check in was extremely smooth, we were staying on the 8th floor. Got to our room and was pleasantly surprised as it was spacious, bathroom was clean with lots of fresh towels, although a little dated and a refurb wouldn\u2019t go a miss. But for the money we had paid we were happy. Unfortunately I did notice a rather large damp patch near the window in the bedroom which I was rather puzzled about but put this to the back on my mind and we went out for the evening.

She removed the top cover and we went to sleep. They say these things come in 3\u2019s and our room was on the front of the hotel, which I have to say didn\u2019t disturb my sister but I found it difficult to sleep and decided that I should speak with reception in the morning. The following day at reception we were quickly asked whether we wished to change rooms, we did, we had a new room on the rear of the property on the 4th floor. Whilst re-packing of suitcases in the 8th floor room, Pedro, one of the maintenance engineer\u2019s appeared to look at the mysterious leak, this was probably no more than 10 minutes after we had reported the problem. Once settled into our new room we had no further problems, we were very happy and I had no further problems with traffic noise from outside. Try and request a room at the rear is my advice. We found the staff to be pleasant and polite at all times. Breakfast wasn\u2019t included within our room rate but there was plenty of choice and should you not wish to go for the buffet options there were plenty of cheaper options you could choose from. Great snack bar in the hotel lobby which we quite often bought our lunch from also gift shop which sold crisps, sweets and cold drinks. Check out the great juice bar Robek\u2019s across the road, made solely of fruit and they last for ages, really, really good. Swimming Pool was lovely, good size, it was never full although had it have been there may have been a requirement for more sun loungers.

We didn\u2019t hire a car but had no problem with getting about. As someone else mentions in another review, you have both a metro (Wilshire/Normandie) across the road and a bus stop on either side of the road. The 720 bus takes you all the way to Santa Monica, this takes about \u00be of an hour, although there is a 920 which we reckon doesn\u2019t stop and so many places along the way and would probably get you there quicker but these are few and fair between. Bus costs you $1.25 single trip. As for the metro, that doesn\u2019t run all the way to Santa Monica but is really useful for getting to Hollywood, again a single trip would cost you $1.25. As for eats, unless you head downtown I agree with other reviewers apart from fast food places didn\u2019t seem to be much around the hotel although this didn\u2019t bother my sister and I, we generally jumped on the metro or headed off down to Santa Monica on the bus for the evening. Would highly recommend \u201cTime Out \u2013 Los Angeles\u201d as a guide book this gave us lots of tips on places to visit and places to drink/eat etc. Places that you wouldn\u2019t necessarily stumble across. We ate well. This was my first trip to LA although my sister had been once before, we thoroughly enjoyed our 8 day stay at the Wilshire Plaza, we didn\u2019t want to come home and will definitely be visiting LA again and would not hesitate in staying in the Wilshire Plaza again.

We travelled in a group of 4 to LA and found this hotel to be a perfect base for exploring the city, and whilst it was a little far out from the main attractions, there is a subway station over the road from the hotel, offering a day pass for $5 and single tickets for $1.25. In addition there are bus stops on both sides which are very reasonably priced, we got from the hotel to Santa Monica for $1.25! The hotel also offers a taxi service, which split between a group, is relatively inexpensive. As mentioned, the Hotel is a little out of the way on Wilshire Boulevard, especially where dining that isnt fast food is concerned, however, we did find a little japanese restaurant called Wasabi, which we enjoyed eating at, and which was also very resonably priced - A meal for 4 with drinks, Mains and traditional side dishes costs around $40. For greater variety, taking a taxi to another area of Wilshire or downtown would be advisable. The hotel itself is clean and comfortable, and while we have seen some reviews on this site giving bad ratings due to the \"outdated\" decor and such, these should not deter you from staying here. Admittedly, if you want to be picky about the place, a lick of paint here and there in the rooms to touch up the decor might win it favour from these reviewers, but we found the Hotel to be pleasant and well maintained. The room service was done to a high standard every day, and all the staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. We also negotiated a discounted rate for breakfast, $8 per day instead of $13.50, which was deifnately worth doing as it filled us up for the majority of the day! The breakfast buffet was a traditional American Breakfast, but also offered fruits, cereals and fruit juices, so there was certainly something for everyone.

Having read the reviews we were nervous but I honestly cannot see what people have to complain about for the price you pay. Check in was spot on and \"Keith\" was very accomodating in getting us a nice room facing the hollywood sign. (the quieter side too). The rooms are big and YES it does need a refurb but its not as bad as everyone has made out. The beds are comfy, nice big window with a good view. They do need washing tho!!! The pool area is great and at this time of year the sun is on it all day long from 0700 til around 8pm. Very hot too! I read on a review in October that the sun wasnt on the pool! what do you expect in October!!!!! The breakfast is really good and very cheap. Buffet for 14 dollars and plenty of choice. Really nice waiters and great service. My negatives are that the restaurant does not open in the evening which is a shame and could do well and the gym equipment is very old and the air con doesnt work in there, but that was good for me!!!! The underground metro is accross the road so easy to get to Hollywood, Santa Monica etc etc and only 5 dollars all day travel. There arent really many restaurants close by walking distance to the hotel. Avoid HMS Bounty as they tried to add 15% to our food bill even tho it said would only add for parties of 5 or more. They did try it on tho! Nice try but we check our bills thoroughly. Tip if you want to do washing: Turn left out of side entrance to the hotel and walk about 4 blocks you will see a 24 hour launderette very cheap and easy to use. I read that people didnt feel safe in the area. We didnt feel this at all but as always wherever you go, you need to be observant at all times. Free internet is fast and really good. The hotel is clean and tidy rooms are cleaned everyday and fresh towels etc etc. Oh and there was no smell of smoke anywhere in the hotel only air fresheners!!

This was my first trip to California, and I have been wanting to visit since I was 10 years old. Prior to leaving I read reviews for Wilshire Plaza hotel, and some of them were bad, some were good, and some were just downright disgusting. But the rate was great, and I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and give the hotel a try. I have to say that my boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised! The hotel DID look like the pictures on expedia, and the staff was very friendly. We even thought that our air conditioner was broken, but it turned out that we did not turn the knob right, but they sent a repairman up with in 10 minutes of us telling them our problem. The room was very nice, and we had a great view. The pool area was very pretty with terraces with flowers on them, but we did not end up swimming because we went to the beach instead. The hallways were clean and smelt fresh, and not like fish and smoke as someone had remarked in a review. We requested a non-smoking room, and we received one. I did not smell ANY smoke throughout the building, not even outside. When we checked in we were even given the choice of which side of the hotel we would like to stay on, either street view, or at the back which was quiet, but not a good view. We chose the street. The area was very nice. On out first night we walked several blocks to Denny's and felt safe. It was quiet and there were only a few people walking around. There were not rats or homeless people laying around that I saw, as someone posted in their review, and yes it is in the middle of \"Korea town\", but It was still a nice area. If you want to see homeless people check out Hollywood blvd. All in all, I had a fantastic time at this hotel, No it was not 5 star, it was not brand new with plasma screen tvs or any other things like that, but it was a nice older hotel with a lot of character. The only complaint we had was the parking. The first night we did not do valet, because we found somewhere to park on the street. The receptionist even told us where we could park on the street, but your car would have to be moved by 8am. So yes it was possible to avoid the $20 a day valet parking, but we did not want to get up at 7:30am every morning to move the car, so we gave in and did valet, which was very nice and convenient. No worries of tickets or damage. If you are going to Los Angeles, you will find that parking, especially downtown is VERY sparse and hard to find, not to mention expensive. So this is not really a problem of the hotel. If anyone is looking to stay at this hotel and wants more details or has questions feel free to e-mail me at Swe----al----@hotmail.com.

I arrived early AM - not expecting to have my room ready, and sure enough, it wasn't. Left my bags with Concierge and did not return till fairly late in the evening - ~10:30 pm. Arriving that late, I expected to get a room that nobody else wanted, and the front desk did not disappoint. I was given a room next to vending machine, which is next to the elevator bank. Surprisingly, noise was not an issue for me. What was an issue was how filthy and dated the hallway and my room were. There were numerous holes in the carpeting in my room - couldn't tell whether it was from wear & tear over the years or whether it was cigarette burns. Hallway smelled unclean too. The bathroom in the room seemed to be from the 1970s - probably the last time anyone would have wanted to stay at this place. Since I was booked here by my client, I decided to stick with it, but if I were on my own I would have high-tailed it out of there. The elevators were extremely slow and crowded - felt like a clown car with people piling on at every floor with their suitcases. One positive was that the Metro station (Wilshire/Normandie) is right across the street. It seems very few take advantage of the trains in the area, but for $1.25 you can go pretty far. I even was able to make it to LAX for that fee. I believe a taxi would be over $60 from the Wilshire. On the way there, I took Super Shuttle for $16. Not a bad option when you're leaving the Airport, but they recommend calling more than 24 hours ahead when you plan to return to LAX. There are plenty of eating and coffee establishments in the general vicinity. No matter how hungry you are, avoid the Carl's Jr. across the way from the Wilshire. As if the fast food wasn't bad enough, I got even sicker to my stomach when I saw a homeless type reach into the garbage to pull out someone's half eaten meal & take off on his merry way.

The first room I recieved had several things wrong... there were absolutely NO towels, the phone did not work and the air conditioning was completely broken. I have a picture of the thermostat set at 60 degress (top setting), but the setting on the bottom which is the actual room temperature was maxed out at 75-80! We could not sleep as we stayed up all night tossing and turning covered in sweat! I had to walk to the front desk to ask for a room change due to the phone being broken, I was polite but shared my unhappiness with the front desk. I should've known this would be an ongoing problem when I first arrived to complain at the front desk, there was a lady in front of me SCREAMING because her a/c did not work, her roof was leaking and the television did not work. There was also a man behind her that said his roof was also leaking and his a/c also did not work. I was given a room change and 2 comp tickets to the next morning's breakfast buffet. The second room was worse than the first. The a/c also did not work, the ceiling leaked, the phone did not work, the bathroom was infested with mold, there were BULLET HOLES in the window and BLOOD STAINS on the curtains! I again had to walk to the front desk because the phone did not work, and was infuriated when I found the elevators to be out of service! I had to take the STAIRS for SEVEN FLOORS! The manager seemed annoyed and said there's nothing he can do for me... he said it's an \"old building\" and that he had FIFTEEN room changes the night before! He offered me nothing except an attitude and ended the conversation by saying I can pack up and leave if I want and he'd refund the last night! Ontop of that they called that night to ask me to come down and pay the 20 dollar PER NIGHT fee for valet parking... which I absolutley refused to pay. I reset the trip odometer on my rental car and found my suspisions to be true... the mileage went up, gas went down, and I found reciepts for Burger King and Staples stuffed down on the side of my seat for that current day! Of course this was denied up and down and I had to walk away or I would probably be in La County Jail right now. The breakfast buffet was pathetic... free for us with out comp tickets, but it's regularly $13.50! It had average (at best) french toast, watery eggs, bacon, orange juice, and cereal with warm milk. Please do NOT stay at this hotel, I felt bad for every single person walking in the doors while I was there.

After unloading our car we were escorted to our rooms by a bell hop who entered the room before us and unloaded all our things and left. When we entered the room we found out why he was in such a hurry. The bathroom had mold on the caulking all the way around the tub. The carpet was vacuumed from the door to the bed and everything outside of that had about a quarter of an inch of lint and dust on it. The bed shams were torn and the sheets and blankets were nasty. We slept in our cloths!!!! Actually we didn't sleep much because we could hear our neighbors doing the wild thing for about an hour. I asked for a wake for 5:00am and was late because they didn't call until 6:00am. When we went down to the lobby we asked for a map quest to get to CBS and the desk clerk said you don't need one just follow the the crowd and you will get there. My wife actually had to tell him \"now you be a good little boy and go over there and get me a map quest honey\" then he finally did it. Thank god because it was about 10 turns and 12 miles from the hotel we would have never found it. So we went to get our car and the valet said you need $20.00 to get your car back. I asked him why and he showed me a sign about 9\"x9\" hidden behind a podium that read if you only stay for 1 night you have to pay $20.00 to park. Then we knew why the valet had met us at our car so that we had no chance at all to read the stupid sign. When we returned from the studio we had to argue with the valet to be able to park again without having to pay again.
