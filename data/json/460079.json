What a nice small community. Very close to all the action, about 4 miles to Disney but very quiet. A great place to relax and unwind. These units are owned by individuals. Some are rented for vacations others are lived in permanently. The pool is big, heated and real clean. The hot tub is nice and warm. We hardly had company in the pool area. We stayed in unit 3. This unit was just remodeled and offered for rent recently. What a beautiful job. Flat screen TVs with DVD players in both bedrooms and the living room. My wife loved the granite counter tops. I enjoyed the couches and screened in porch. The pond and fountain view really made for a nice evening or morning coffee spot. It was nice to be able to park right in front of the door.

This is not a resort but more like a small townhouse complex. There was only one tv and limited channel selection. The toilet seat was broken, but fixed when reported. Some of the dishes were chipped and utensils not matching, but that's not a big deal unless you are concerned about inventory control. The place really needed a better cleaning .. One frying pan was so yukky that we couldn't use it. and the lamp shades were ancient, dirty and broken. The spa/hot tub was no warmer than bath water. The washer and dryer in the unit was very good. For us the \"resort\" was too far from the centre of touristy stuff, and there was no recreation facility on site. In fact no-one was there after 5pm, the place basically closed down. I did relay my opinion to the office before I left and their response was that they only do what \"the owner's\"? want done as far as furnishings. . On a positive note, the staff was friendly and they did let us into our unit a couple hours early after checking to see if it was \"ready\" Then later told me that particular unit had not been used for some time..duh! The free long distance phone calls & free internet access was very helpful so we were able to keep in touch with our business back home. There was one little gator in the pond behind the pool but the area was well fenced. There was a nice enclosed lanai with table & chairs. All in all we had a good time and managed quite well..

I was a bit concerned before we left because of some of the negative reviews I saw on this website, and I wanted to address some points for travellers who are considering staying at this facility. 1. No, this is not the Hilton. There is no on-site management, but there is a phone number you can call with any problems. The first night we were there our mattress was very lumpy and uncomfortable. We called to tell the management about this in the morning and also requested a DVD player in the unit. When we returned from our day at Disney, there was a DVD player hooked up to the television and the mattress had been REPLACED -- I consider that exceptional service! 2. Our condo was incredibly clean -- from the kitchen and bathrooms to the bedding. No crumbs, bugs, etc. 3. The pool is beautiful and very clean. In fact, we witnessed the pool being cleaned on several occasions during the week. Another nice feature is that they give you the combination to the keypad for the poolside bathrooms so they stay locked yet accessible when needed. 4. The \"locals\" we encountered were very friendly and chatty -- no one made us feel unwelcome, and we never saw or heard about any problems with car break-ins. We felt very safe during our stay. 5. There is an aligator in the pond behind the condo complex. My five-year old daughter named him Al, and I estimate he is about six feet long. We enjoyed looking out to see if he had surfaced or was sunning himself every day. I never felt like we were in any danger. You just stay away from the back pond (duh), and the pool is totally elevated from the pond, so there's no way you're in any harm. We thought \"Al\" was a neat feature of the facility, not a hazard. 6. Although the complex seemed to be full -- most parking spots filled up every night -- the place was incredibly quiet. Very important for families seeking downtime from Disney! We never heard a peep from any other guests and had the pool to ourselves most of the week. We recommend Mango Key and will probably return in a few years. Don't believe the negative reviews like I almost did.

If your expectations are to be pampered by guest services, a bellhop to carry your bags and a bottle of champagne to great you as you enter your villa -- you've come to the wrong place. There is a management company, not onsite, but available 24 hours a day via a simple phone call that is there to help take care of you. Mango Key is a very, small, peaceful resort. It may lack all the fancy onsite amentiies that newer resorts posess, but it still boosts a very nice, well kept, heated onsite pool -- one that allows you to swim freely without being overcrowded and having a million screaming kids. It's perfect for early morning swims. As was claimed in an earlier review, the pond does not require any sort of security as it is nearly 8-10 feet below the pool and resort area. The gators that were seen there by us were 4 feet or smaller and scrambled back into the water at the sight of humans. The rooms are adequte and priced excellent for the location. As said before, it's NOT the Hilton. Don't expect glamourous fixtures, big screen TVs or egyptian cotton sheets on your bed. Many feature new tiling floor, fairly new carpets and nice furniture.
