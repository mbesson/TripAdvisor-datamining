That's THE upside. There are many downsides though. Upon checkin it was discovered that the AC/Heat was not functioning as it was actually like raining that day and a little chilly. The room phone also didn't work, I could hear the front desk but they could not hear me. After about three attempts I called on my cell phone. After the fellow sent up to fix it obviously couldn't, I requested and received another room. Thank gawd we hadn't yet unpacked. These rooms have like one tiny 2 ft long clothes hanging area (not really sufficient for two girls and three nites), 3 drawer TV/wardrobe combo and only 1 of those folding thingies to set your suitcase on, a super small bath counter with no space for anything (think $69.00 Home Depot vanity for your remodeled basement), and I had to set my suitcase on the top shelf of the hanging area unless I wanted to like live on the floor. We were literally using the top of the TV cabinet, the desk, the refrigerator and wutever had a top surface to place stuff. I'm talkin' just basic stuff here folks. Wut a so totally waste of space in a otherwise large room. The whole place is way past it's heyday and sorta tired and needs much TLC. It had a eewww factor of about 5. I noticed the second room had a newer AC/Heat unit as well as a few cosmetic upgrades. I always request the upper floor, it keeps the stomping elephants above, running drains and all other wutever if on lower floors at night at bay lol, so elevators are important. There is a almost empty underground parking area that is only accessible from the far back end of the property, the front entrance is gated and locked. However it did enable us to like park right next to the elevator as the other is handicapped. The only problem is it's on one end of the long building and not in the middle. Go figure? There are ice and soda machines in the center of the building on only the first 2 levels, but not the third one. Instead there are washers and dryers, I don't know why not a ice machine? Again, although in the middle still a long walk to the connecting stairs and down a floor for some ice. Maybe we just hit it wrong but the first nite (of three) there were a bunch of younger guys, like 15 total or wutever, a few who were very loud and partying, might have ended up at one of the strip clubs next door, ok one block away, and returned about 2:15 AM loud enough and shouting to wake us up. We complained the next day and maybe something was like mentioned to the group leader, it was considerably toned down the next night. The morning \"compliments\" consisted of lobby coffee and nothing else, which seemed strange as the Chula Vista property also offers orange juice as well as assorted muffins. It's a hard place to exit from onto Rosecrans St as I-8 dumps cars off the freeway still winding down from wut seems like 65-70 MPH making it hard to pull out in a slim lull and get out of the right turn lane only down the road to the signal light. Got a few horns and fingers, I just nicely waved back as they like cursed my Arizona plate I'm sure lol. The short of this though, if you don't mind the little extra distance like 10 freeway minutes south to Chula Vista, use THAT property. It's like a few bucks cheaper, has a MUCH nicer well kept atmosphere w landscaping, larger and nicer clothes storage and hanging areas, much larger bath counters for makeup and wutever and a pool as well as morning muffins, right off the E street exit and still no freeway noise.

We decided to save money by staying here this summer, and we immediately regretted that decision. First off, the room was never cleaned as there was dried food all over the AC unit and what seemed like dried, orange vomit on the floor next to the bed. The first night, as we pulled into the parking lot, we watched as a man escorted a prostitute into his room. Also, we were awakened at 2 a.m. by someone banging on our door, which thouroughly freaked us out. We also were frightened by the loud yelling and screaming from the room next to us. The next morning, we tried in vain to switch hotels, bu the agency we booked it through would not give us a refund. The second night, before going to bed, we discovered dried BLOOD on the bottom side of the comforter!! Being nursing students, we had seen plenty of blood before,a dn undoubtedly knew it was not a drink or any other liquid other than blood. Not only was it hidden since it was on the bottom side, it was right at the top, and the night before my friend had unknowingly covered her face with it! Since it was midnight, we took the bloody comforter to the front desk where the guy working there said he would hang onto it and told us to come back in the morning when the manager was there. At 7 the next morning, the first thing we did was go to the office to talk with the manager. Not only did she actually say that WE were the ones to bleed on the comforter, she proceeded to lie and say that she sent it to \"Eco Lab\" (which doesn't exist) to have it tested for blood when we asked to see the comforter to show her the stains. We argued with her for an hour, with her finally refusing to talk anymore and demanding us to leave. She was incredibly rude and never offered to do anything for us or even a simple \"I'm sorry\" at all. We then contacted our booking agency who were appalled to hear our story and assured us that they would contact the owner of the hotel about our dispute. We left sad that we had been treated so badly, and appalled at the conditions of the hotel. This is the most disgusting, horrid, and terrible place to stay at in San Diego.

Yes, the hotel is a little older, the carpeting isn't in the best shape, however - our room was kept very clean by the maid service, we received an abundant supply of towels upon request & there was no complaints from any of us about any odd smells or bugs as mentioned in other reviews. Although I must say that if we had seen a bug it wouldn't have surprised or horrified us - it's San Diego people - when you have perfect temps, high humidity, lots of flowers & an ocean close by you're bound to see a bug or two. The front desk help was always happy to answer our questions, give directions, recommend local restaurants, tell us about coupons & discounts to places we were headed & super friendly whenever we asked for more towels (my kids us a lot of towels lol.) I loved having the refrigerator in the room for the kids snacks & drinks & bottled water that we brought with us everywhere because it's a lot cheaper buying that stuff by the case then paying $3 a pop at some of the attractions. There's also a laundry area which we didn't think much of at first, but after 2 days of swimming in the ocean we were glad to have it so we could freshen up our beach wear & towles.

From what I understand, all of the rooms are supposed to be non-smoking rooms. They claim they even charge you a $200 cleaning fee if your room smells like cigarettes. The first room they gave us we rejected because it completely wreaked of cigarettes. Not only is that disgusting in general, but my boyfriend is allergic to cigarette smoke and the mere scent is enough to give him miserable sinus headaches for days. As we were passing down the other rooms back to the front desk, we noticed the entire place smelled like cigarettes. They exchanged our room and we must have lucked out and got what was probably the only room in the motel that didn't stink. However, the next day we saw the maid literally smoking in one of the rooms she was cleaning. We came back that night, and sure enough our room smelled like cigarettes. They also randomly decided to deactivate our key that night. We went to the front desk and complained and they reactivated it, but they didn't bother giving an explanation. There are stains all over the carpet. They supply you with ONE bar of soap for a 4-person room. They never gave me a receipt, so I guess I'll find out the hard way how much they decided to charge my card. They also don't bother giving you \"do not disturb\" signs and we were woken up the first morning we were there at like 7 am by some idiot who wouldn't quit banging on our door. It was not a good morning to deal with crackheads when the previous day we had driven all the way from San Francisco and didn't get there until 2:30 in the morning. You have to pay for WiFi access. They have one computer near the front desk you can use that you also have to pay for, but you can't plug anything into the computer, so if you're working off of a flash drive, forget it. The motel is located in what has to be the sketchiest part of San Diego. It's right next door to a strip club, so it naturally attracts all these sleazy men. A hoard of them were outside one night right near our room having a party in the parking lot smoking and downing whisky.

The bathroom toilet was leaking a little. I called front desk and they were going to send someone, who never showed. But it was a minor leak and I threw towels on the ground anyway. It wasn't a big deal. For the price and location, I was very pleased. I would definitely stay here again and tell others to stay here too. Although I heard about the Adult bar across the street, my family didn't even notice it.", "Date": "December 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cWorst worst worst\u201d", "Author": "JayMaeSanDiego", "ReviewID": "UR10541254", "Content": "My boyfriend's mom came to visit from England and booked the Goodnite Inn Seaworld through a travel agent. I live in San Diego but have never heard of this hotel. And now I know why. We drove to a terrible neighborhood in San Diego. Dirty, bums everywhere, cops patrolling the streets and the best part...a strip club right next door. We walked in to the front desk and it was disgusting. Smoky and low-class. The front desk attendant was covered in tattoos and looked like he was just released from prison. I was adament that we leave and get a refund. I would not let my worst enemy stay at that hotel much less my boyfriend's mother. We left and they are still working out the refund. I hate that this was her first impression of San Diego.

The room was really old, old noisy aircon, old worn-out beds, we spent the 1st night only and refunded the rest...we headed to the Marriott la Jolla for $ 170, which was a paradise in a mich clean and lovelly place.
