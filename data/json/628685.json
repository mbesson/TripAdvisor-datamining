It's true that it is close to public transport links and it's also very cheap, however in a city like Berlin you don't have to pay too much more for a far more central location with shops, cafes, and life well in to the night and then in the morning for a coffee and breakfast. There was not much of this around Aurora. Aside from the location - Aurora was clean and quiet, but very dimly lit. The door from the street and central corridor remained opened and unlocked to the rooms all night and there was no visible staff member on our floor. This was a bit disconcerting when leaving the room to use the separate bathrooms, would have been more so if I'd been travelling alone. The room was very simple, clean and an adequate size with a window to the courtyard.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cDo even think booking this pension\u201d", "Author": "Laurantraveler", "ReviewID": "UR35509878", "Content": "This pension is terrible. I booked online with this pension and when I arrived in Berlin I could not even find there location on the Berlin map. They are so far away from central Berlin and even the surrounding areas they are not even on the map. I tried to call them continuously for hours and NO ONE ANSWERED THE PHONE!!!! I went to an internet cafe and sent them an email and NO ONE RESPONDED FOR HOURS. I booked another hotel and later when I checked my email this pension had sent me an email 3 hours later telling me I could not cancel and they would have to charge me in full. Even after countless email to them explaining the situation they still CHARGED ME IN FULL, even though their actual policy is 80% of the total. I have traveled all over the US and Europe and have never dealt with such unprofessionalism ever. I would highly advise not staying here due to the lack of courtesy and professionalism and they are SO FAR OFF THE MAP YOU ARE NOT EVEN STAYING IN BERLIN!!!", "Date": "July 22, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel-Pension Aurora", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d628685-Reviews-Hotel_Pension_Aurora-Berlin.html", "Price": "$38 - $85*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Rheinstrasse 61</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">12159</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "628685", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/33/08/330808d229a923bc1db155d9e9a665121large.jpg"}}
