Sadly enough, the furniture in the room is of the cheapest, ugliest kind. The beds are comfy, though, and everything is very clean and fresh. The breakfast is excellent and gets refilled up until 10 a.m., when it ends Drawback is the WiFi-connection: we received a card for 6 hours use, which meant you had to log on and off every time you wanted to use it. Not practical at all. Also, it is just for one device at a time. AND the access card was only offered after asking, not automatically. But in general the staff was very friendly and helpful.

The bathroom was spacious and very clean. The hotel was situated in a quiet area near to the boutiques and underground stations. Reception were on hand to give advice on travel and eateries in the area. In terms of what do do in Berlin , the top recommendations would be the Berlin Wall, Holocaust Memoral, Berliner Dom, Reichstag, Tv Tower - a good starting point would be a bus tour to help get your bearings.

Breakfast was also very good, way above average for a 3 star hotel! it is situated in a very convenient and nice area, the metro is just 2 blocks away. The rooms were very clean and spacious. Hot water available at all hours and heating. I must admit, when I first checked in to the building I was a little shocked because of the way the hotel is set up i.e. the reception is on the first floor from the entrance, I had found out that reception is available until 10pm, and on my way to my room which was on the second floor until we got to the room going through some locked doors, and the long hall, well I got a little spooked out. However, that was only because we had arrived late, around 10 30 pm and the reception lady was kind enough to wait for us. The nights/days after that everything seemed and was very safe. Also, the Indian restaurant \u201cSpice India\u201d to the next building was more thank excellent! overall, i would go back to the Seifert Hotel!", "Date": "February 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Odder", "Title": "\u201cSeifert Hotel is great\u201d", "Author": "Gajda", "ReviewID": "UR8403554", "Content": "Hotel Seifert is an old, beautiful and well-maintained hotel.

Despite its central location, it wasn't noisy at night. Our room was spacious and light with a high ceiling and large windows overlooking a courtyard. The decor and bedding was white, with pale wood effect furniture. The standard of cleanliness was excellent and the bathrooms looked newly fitted and were gleaming and fresh. If I could pick any fault, it would be with the quality of the bedding and towels - although they are all white and very clean, they were a bit on the thin side. And the carpet was a bit dated, although again, it was a flat, office-style carpet so it didn't feel unhygienic or anything! Considering this was a modestly priced hotel, I feel a bit mean even mentioning this. What this hotel really stands out for is the friendliness of the staff and for the breakfast buffet which offers everything (and more!) that you could possibly want for breakfast and serves both hot and cold food. Out of all the German hotels I've visited, this one wins hands down on the breakfast front. And no carpet in the dining room! Pale laminate floor and very clean and fresh.

I was there as a Group leader for the travel agency I work for and I can assure you that this hotel is absolutely perfect. the structure it's not super, that's true. The wooden floor sometimes makes too much noise, expecially at night, but all the rest is perfect. Rooms are very clean, pretty cool and very quiet; the staff is absolutely lovely and very kind. Don't be afraid to ask pretty much everything cos they are always disponsable and helpful. They care so much of their customers and they will always do the best to make you feel comfy, so that u can have a place to call home for a bunch of days! I have to admit that I had wonderful chats with them, they're even funny! The breakfast is on buffet and it's way yummy. You'll find everything you need to start the day with a burst of energy. Milk, coffee, orange juice, yogurt, cereals, breads, fruit, cakes, cheese, eggs, ham, jam, honey and all that u can think of for an extraordinary breakfast! There's an internet point in front of the reception, and the elevator as well. What else can I say...oh, the position is perfect. It's 3 minutes from the Kurfurstendamm, a huge street full of shopping centers, shops, restaurants, clubs and so on. It's in the west part of the city, but u can reach the east in a bunch of minutes via metro...it works perfectly, it's easy to use and u got a stop 5 minutes walk from the hotel (on the Kudamm). Nothing else to say, the perfect base to enjoy your wonderful holiday in a special city!
