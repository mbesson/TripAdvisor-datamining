{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Bit of Britain in WA Stayed for 3 nights, and had a great breakfast everyday. David is a pleasant host, and had decent tea which (for this Englishman) was what I needed to pep me up! Despite being close to the student area, especially fraternity/soriety houses, there was no noise and I slept well. With internet access and close to public transport, I would stay again. (I came for business at the university, and its a nice walk there from the guesthouse.)", "Date": "Oct 4, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR700303262", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Great Breakfast Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.
