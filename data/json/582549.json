{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good place for a stay before the airport! We stayed here for a night before an early morning flight out of Frankfurt. The other reviewers are all correct in their assessment of the hotel. It is clean, utilitarian and functional. We did get a good night's sleep. You will have to find some place to eat a meal prior to your stay - this is not easy. We had a car and still were unsuccessful in finding a restaurant. You can get an alarm clock at the desk with a 5 euro deposit. There are no phones. There is internet in the lobby - not inexpensive - but no printer to use so it was impossible to get our boarding passes the evening prior to flight. We found the staff at the desk to be less than friendly and we speak German! But it may have just been a bad day as the weather was awful!The cost for a room for two was 109 euro per night.", "Date": "Oct 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR640830953", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "TNTravelerUsa"}, {"Content": "Nice hotel, but too far away This hotel was booked for me from one of my customers. Price is very cheap (just 55.50 euros per night even during the trade fair periods, which is amazing if you consider that prices in the town centre reach even 250 euros a night).The whole is very nice and wide, and there is also the chance to surn the internet on their PC, unfortunately it's about 1 euro per 5 minutes. However, if you have your own laptop, you can get connected to the wifi system. Some areas are pay-per-use, while some others are free of charge, so you need to wonder around the hall to look for a free hot spot.The hall is also where you have breakfast. It's very rich and typically German style (massive portions).The members of staff are very helpful, kind and smiling; in fact they are brilliant!The whole hotel is very modern style, with fake fire in the room, turquoise blankets and nice lighting systems.The bathroom is small, indeed the wash basin is located within the bedroom and not the bathroom itself.My customer found quite annoying the noise from outside: most rooms indeed face the motorway. That was not a problem for me as I live in a noisy area and noises at night do not bother me at all.It was overall a nice hotel, however, the location is absolutely bad. If you need to go to the fair, you have to walk for about 15 minutes, wait for the tram, catch the tram, stop at the underground station, catch the underground, reach the train station, get off that train and get on another train: it really just takes too long. Furthermore the town centre is even further and at night time you have to go back early as the last train to Niederaad is at about 00.10 and then there are no more trams, so you have to walk for about 35 minutes. Of course, if you are rich enough you can catch a taxi, but the area is quite remote and far from the centre, so I bet it might be quite expensive (I've not checked though)", "Date": "Apr 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR913483287", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "TIME80"}, {"Content": "Budget hotel that's great for one night We stayed at Motel One the night before an early flight from Frankfurt. The hotel was clean and plain, and our parents complained about the sparseness after staying at BBs on the rest of our trip. But it was clean and it had air conditioning - something we hadn't had in any other night of the trip. It's a new hotel, so everything was in great shape - and you can't beat the price.We didn't have breakfast there, since our flight was too early. It was a quick trip to the airport, maybe 10 minutes. We recommend this hotel for anyone who just needs a bed before a flight. It's perfect for that.", "Date": "Jun 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR666155309", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Feelin_Irie"}, {"Content": "Budget hotel minimalism One of a new budget chain of traveller stops in Germany.First it has to be said that the Motel One in Frankfurt-Niederrad (opened in 2005) is incredible value for money. At \u9227?4 including breakfast it it is half the price of other similar Frankfurt hotels during trade fairs. For that you get a clean modern room and a reasonable breakfast. The room has a double bed with optional single bunk bed above at right-angles, small desk, TV and a bathroom with shower and WC. The chic reception area has a bar/cafe and meeting areas with functional modern seating. The white armchairs look comfy until you sit in them and find they are made of hard plastic. That tells you a lot about the design/build theme for the hotel: modern, minimalist, functional, clean, efficient. It could only be in Germany.This is not a bedroom to linger in, even if you don't have the thought that I did about being in a prison cell. The bed has a single pillow, comforter and brown counterpane. The mattress is thin and hard, the carpet is industrial. On the plus side the sound insulation is excellent, no doubt assisted by the the fact the TV has its sound regulated to a maximum of c.40%. The trouble with that is that the English language channels (BBC Worldwide and CNN) broadcast on low power so it is difficult to hear them at all. But hey, use the room for sleeping and, if you have the trade-fair exhaustion, you should be able to get a few hours' rest.I'll mention the breakfast in more detail because it seems to be the one area where the Motel One concept allows some excess. For \u9227? you get cereals, orange juice, excellent coffee, fresh rolls, cheese, cream cheese, salami, hard-boiled eggs and preserves. And you can eat as much as you like. Best however to get avoid the 8.00am rush hour if you can.The hotel's location is as functional as its design. Situated in a commercial park by the side of the autobahn half-way between the airport and the city. There is adequate parking. There is a station at Niederrad (8 minutes into the main Frankfurt Huptbahnoff) but at c.3km from the hotel you need to use the bus to transit between the two. That is fine during the day but at night the last bus is at c. 21:30. However the hotel is a short taxi ride from the City costing c. \u9227?2.50.In summary this hotel is like a good no-frills airline (is there one?). It is cheap and functional; it does what it says on the box but there is precious little joy or comfort about the way it goes about it.", "Date": "Apr 1, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR663081368", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "bonnie02"}, {"Content": "practical and utilitarian Stayed here during the Frankfurt Book Fair. Typically hotel rates are out of the roof for the book fair, but this was newly opened and we got rooms for well under Euro 100. Located in a corporate park area of Frankfurt, there is a bus that takes your to the S-Bahn. You can be in the town center within 20-30 minutes. There is nothing around the hotel, so be sure you take care of your needs before coming back for the night.The hotel is spartan. No alarm or phone in the room. It is clean and comfortable, and since it was brand new it was in top shape.
