We recently stayed, we're still here as this moment, in LV on Tropicana's, west of I15. On our second night, the hotel was beset by 14-17 year-olds who yelled in the hallways, banged doors against the deadbolts they had set to keep them from closing, and ran up and down the halls. The few adults with the ones on our floor had as much effect on their behavior as swatting at flies. Now and then awe would hear attempts to restrain the kids, but within minutes the behavior would continue as before. When I called the desk on Thursday night, the woman taking my call asked what I suggested she do about the situation. The next day I was told there were similar groups in every part of the hotel, and there was no other room likely to be more quiet. I was later told \"we have groups of kids every weekend.\" I don't blame kids for being kids, and my room was nice, but 1) I should have been told, as a Hilton Honor's member, at least, that I would be staying during the stay of such a group, and 2)) some portion of the hotel should have been saved by people who wanted to SLEEP at night.

Our flight was over sold and we took the voluntary bump. The airline provided us with some generous flight vouchers, meals, transportation, and (gasp) a room. We were a little worried since normally the airlines don't spring for a nice hotel. So, before we left, I did a little research on TripAdvisor. The reviews set my mind at ease. We called a number to the hotel and arrange the free shuttle they provided. The driver was there in litterly 10 minutes. Way quicker than I expected. This guy was a riot. He was an ex cop from New York. Very friendly and had some great conversation. Wish I had his name, but I can't recall. The ride to the hotel was quick. I would guess maybe 8 minutes. The hotel is close to the airport. It is located on Tropicana and Dean Martin, appoximately 1/2 mile from the strip. When we arrived, check in was quick and clerk was polite. We requested a non smoking and king bed. We were granted that request. The room was nice, modern, and clean. It was equipped with free wi-fi and a large flat screen tv. Shower was also nice and clean. They also provide a free shuttle to and from the strip. You just let them know and they will take you there. They drop you off at the Tropicana. The shuttle ride is about 2 minutes. You could walk to the strip in about 10 minutes. When you want to be picked up, you just call the hotel and they send the shuttle. They do pickups until 2 am. Service was always quick. We didn't have to wait long at all. Maybe 5-10 minutes. Check out was quick and easy. They had a nice, free, continental breakfast in the moring. We took the shuttle back to the airport. It runs every hour. Our flight left at 8:40 am. We took the 7 am shuttle and arrived with plenty of time. Here is what sets this hotel apart from others. When we arrived at the airport, I noticed my wallet and travel pouch was not in my bag. I started freaking out. There is no way I forgot it or lost it. I called the hotel to see if I dropped it in the morning when I was checking my emails in the lobby. No such luck. My throat was in my stomach. I had lost our newly recieved flight vouchers and wallet were gone. I thought what the heck, it's worth checking the room. They took my number and said they would check and call me back. I am thinking, \"ya, I bet they call me back in an hour and can't find it\". Litterly within five minutes they called and said they found both of them. They were sending the shuttle driver back with them. He was there in about 10 minutes. I couldn't believe it.

There was one younger front desk agent though (Stephanie), who talked down to me and decided that I was just someone she particularly didn't like (for what reason - I still don't know). Sadly, that one person will stay in my mind mainly because this was my Christmas holiday; but does not deter from the fact that everyone else (Arlene, John, Jay, Shonell (Front Desk) as well as John and Lupe (Shuttle drivers)) were fabulous to deal with, chat with and share with. It was like coming back home to family! I thank them for a lovely time.... It's easy enough to walk to the Strip during the daylight hours, but I would highly NOT recommend to walk around during the evening. It's best that John or Lupe take you somewhere in the shuttle and then call them when you need a ride back to the hotel. They are more than ready to accommodate and ensure your safety. This is a family hotel - so be prepared that there are little monsters that run up/down the hallways.

However, my wife made this particular reservation being I was between trips. I usually frequent certain properties usually those I've previously visited or ones recommended. I was surprised at how pleasant my stay was here. listed below are the things that made my trip so pleasant: Location - Conveniently located walking distance from the MGM Grand, New York, Luxor, Excalibur and Tropicana Hotels. You can choose to use the free shuttle to MGM and/or Tropicana Hotels. This is suggested if you are traveling with kids as you will have to walk under a dark overpass when accessing the strip by foot. The shuttle drivers are friendly and will take you just about anywhere. ASK THEM! Breakfast Buffet - This one of the main reasons I frequent certain properties. I enjoyed the fresh fruit, yogurt types, hard and omelette style eggs, and juice station. I'm not big on carbs but there is quite a selection of cereals, waffle station and pastries. *The scrambled eggs remind me of boot camp with a powder taste... not happy about that one* All-in-all still plenty to choose from. Coconut Bar in lobby - The waitress is friendly and will immediately remember once she's met you. They provide a selection of munchies to Chase your beer. There are three large screen TVs that are perfect for Football fanatics like myself. And, the beers are off strip prices which I recommend starting at before the 7 dollar beers at the clubs and casions. Pool / Exercise Area - These are the only two things I could review negatively on. The pool deck is being refurbished which is no problem as they let you know on their website and at the front desk. I like the hot tub versus filling the room tub with water. The exercise room needs to be cleaned and the machines tuned. Both treadmill running pads are sticky and this can be dangerous for faster, heavier runners.

Bus Cross over to the New York New York and goto the bus stop on Tropicana Avenue Stop ID: 2813 Take the 201 Bus towards 201A Tropicana Westbound to the next stop Tropicana @ Dean Martin (W) Stop ID: 2804. Cross the road and then the Hampton inn is just after the gas station. 3) Pool Seemed decent, we did not use. 4) Internet Good connectivity in the rooms, as well as business center on ground floor. 5) Friendly staff 6) Good Laundry facilities for guest ( 2 washers/ dryers on the ground floor) Cons 1) When we got to our room the sink had some black spots, but we thought it was the design of the sink. Next morning the sink was clogged up. Spoke to hotel reception that changed our room and sent some one up to check the clogged sink while we were packing to move. I later went back to the room and checked and the guy had also scrubbed the sink, since most of the black spots were gone.Also the air con in this room was kinda of noisy. 2) We were moved to a second room on the same floor. We also got 1 night stay free. In the shower there are some pinkish lines which are suppose to be design elements (marbling I think), however it doesn\u2019t really do anything for the d\u00e9cor. 3 of us were sharing a room with two double beds, and of 3 hotels we visited on our trip, these double beds seemed the smallest. 3) There was a convention a couple of days we stayed there and the breakfast staff was a bit overwhelmed with the increased numbers.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cOUTSTANDING INN!

The BED is probably the most comfortable bed I ever slept on. The rest of our group which had 9 people all agree as well. Continental Breakfast: Great! It's not gourmet but its great to have in the morning with friends. Food includes cereal, coffee, fruit etc. Pool: Nice, can get a little crowded but still really nice. Distance: You will need a car to get to the strip, but it's not far at all. Price: Awesome! We went on a weekend and everyone was happy with the amount we divided among each other. VERY reasonable. In conclusion, if you're looking to have fun in vegas on a budget, this room for the price is really worth it. The lobby downstairs is NICE and my friends and I had memorable moments here!

Overall, we liked the hotel. The lobby was bright and spacious. A free full breakfast was provided, and though the food was not the tastiest, it was, well, free and abundant. We especially enjoyed the pool and hot tub: they were clean, of a good size and the whole pool area was pleasing to the eyes (better than the pool at Paris, frankly). For whatever reason, at about 9 pm we had the pool and hot tub to ourselves. The room was adequate, which is to say, it was a typical hotel/motel room: two queen beds, desk, desk chair and chair, and television. The room was clean, but showing its age. Our view out of the small window was of a parking garage. We did not have to pay for the room (it was paid for by the airline), but we understood that the cost was $69 a night. If so, you can find deals for bigger, better rooms right on the Strip. For me, the walk from the Inn to the Strip (the closest casino/hotels are the Excalibur and New York New York) was less than ten minutes. However, I would not walk to the Strip at night, and the walk along the unshaded highway during the day when temperatures were over 40 degrees celcius was not pleasant. The Inn has no casino, but the Day's Inn a few minutes' walk away does. Like most \"locals' \" casinos, the slots were looser there than on the Strip or Downtown. The Orleans and its huge casino are about a ten minute walk away also, but my comments about the walk to the Strip apply here too (at least two adult superstores along the route, though, for your shopping pleasure). We noticed that most of the other guests seemed to be Europeans, many with teenagers. I can understand why: the Hampton Inn is a clean hotel with a great pool and no casino, perfect for families with kids. Would I stay there again? Yes, but only if I could not find a much better room deal mid- Strip (which these days is hard to imagine).", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ottawa canada", "Title": "\u201cGood value\u201d", "Author": "canadian-eh777", "ReviewID": "UR78549592", "Content": "Just off the strip but you will need a car or taxi.

The bed was quite enjoyable, with fresh linens and acceptable toiletries in the bathroom. The tub was a bit worn with cracks that had been resealed, but a bit sloppy. The so - so: The location is OK.

I would only recommend staying here if you needed to be closeby the airport. CAUTION. The complimentary shuttle has big restrictions for early morning departures. They really got us on this one. If you have an early morning flight (ie: 6am) the hotel has a shady and cheap way of handling guests transportation to the airport. For this reason, I would not recommend this hotel if you are a business or leisure traveler and have an early morning flight out the next day. The bad: Susan. Just Susan. Front desk. Front the moment a group of us coming in off the shuttle bus walked in, she had a chip on her shoulder. She was called in from the back room by another employee (is this why she was upset?) to help the crowd, and was short, snippy and unprofessional to at least two of us. In contrast, the other employee was sweet, personable and welcoming to guests. It was an alarming contrast hearing the two huge differences in staff personalities. When I had to come back downstairs to ask for some toothpaste, she walked into the backroom and handed it to me - no words exchanged. Overall, I felt she had no business being in the service industry. This left me with an unfavorable impression of the property.

We were greeted reasonably but with a focus on efficiency rather than warmth, and placed in a third floor room. Renovations were done about a year ago and the rooms have a warm, semi-tropical vibe with yellow walls and bright orange accents in curtains and furniture. New lamp fixtures are kind of retro in appearance - I think my mom had some of these triple-glass-globe lamps in our house in 1977, or maybe I just saw them on a Brady Bunch episode. I don't expect they'll hold up fashionably for very long. Carpets are light and show stains - and there were some in both rooms we stayed in. Possibly in keeping with the retro theme, the TVs were NOT renovated with the other hard goods and remain a 25\" boob tube with perhaps 15 available channels - a definite disappointment. HSIA is free but wired-only in rooms; if you can snag a room overlooking the pool, you might be able to use the wireless signal from there. Beds are Hampton standard and can get warm, especially if you have a balky AC unit as we suffered during our first night. The AC units are old-style through-the-wall PTAC units under the smallish window in the room, and during our first night, the compressor was even noisier than these units are known for - plus, it would not cool the room below about 70. We requested service on the unit the next morning and it was swapped out with another unit with digital controls...which promptly performed a compressor on/off cycle that could only be described as 30 seconds of \"chuffing.\" This supposedly new unit was loud and even more unable to hold temperature - after an hour in the room with the digital thermostat set at 60, the room was about 75 degrees. We requested further service and were told that we had received the one and only replacement AC unit available for a 300-room property. However, they did have another room available so we packed everything up and moved down the hall. Luckily, this PTAC unit operated quietly and efficiently. Beware of the poor maintenance budget, however. The poor maintenance extended to hallways, where the year-old \"new\" carpet looked like it hadn't been cleaned in five. Then there was breakfast - never a Hampton Inn highlight, and in this case particularly downmarket. Each day of our stay a large tray of biscuits was presented - with absolutely nothing to cover them with. Someone needs to inform the staff that biscuits are usually half of \"biscuits and gravy\" at a \"free breakfast\" venue. The egg \"circles\" were watery and flavorless; the sausage patties about 70% fat. It appears the management is providing exactly the bare minimum needed to keep the franchise flag with the breakfast offerings. Overall, I still rated the property average because their rates were excellent over the Labor Day holiday - $58 on AAA rate. At anything approaching \"rack\" rate, I wouldn't recommend the property to anyone. If you can find a deal, just beware of the poor maintenance, average-to-cool service, and abysmal breakfast selection.", "Date": "September 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamilton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cYet another great Hampton\u201d", "Author": "cocolinu", "ReviewID": "UR37306738", "Content": "Overall a great, comfy, clean hotel with a great view and a very nice, accommodating staff (they changed our room to get away form noisy neighbors and provided a fridge in our king room at no extra charge (given that king rooms do not have, by default, fridges or microwaves).

A couple of main issues bothered us however: First, one morning we found a huge palmetto bug in our washroom. By the looks of it, it must have came in with the morning newspaper (as they place it outside the door). Second, the pool was not warm at all, which is surprising when there are 103 degrees outside. We did however enjoy it as it was . Third, they forgot to mention that the shuttle will only drop you off on the strip at the New York New York hotel, and not farther, and will also not pick you up, so you either walk back or take a taxi (only reasonable option at 12am). Fourth, the walls are paper thin. On our first night, we dealt with VERY noisy neighbors. A call to the front desk at 4am slightly fixed the problem, but to avoid that from happening again, we asked to change rooms the next day and our wish was granted. Lastly, the maids didn't replace our empty Kleenex box for the last two days of our stay.

The bathroom was nice as well as the free breakfast and the pool was beautiful, however the hotel was older than I expected and the room was small. The beds were comfy but small, they said they were doubles but when I looked at the mattress and the frame they looked more like twins and were different sizes as the frame was larger than the mattress.

Our A/C in our room did not work properly and our room was really hot, when we called the front desk they asked us to wait a few hours for the room to cool down and mentioned that they do not keep the a/c on in the room before a customer arrives....they said they open the windows to let the air in which is really just the heat (which was over 110 that weekend) into the room? Hours later we came back and the room was just as hot but then the front desk mentioned they were sold out and we sweat all night until we were finally able to move to another room the next day.

Added bonuses: even though the hotel is near the airport (the older \"Fabulous Vegas\" sign is close by), my room--facing a rather isolated street--was relatively quiet from street noise. Also - try a drive down Frank Sinatra Dr or Polaris for a good night view of the Strip.", "Date": "March 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNice option to staying on the strip\u201d", "Author": "lovedintexas", "ReviewID": "UR13578810", "Content": "We recently stayed 1 night at the Hampton Inn due to being bumped off our flight out of Vegas.

However, you are responsible for getting home from the strip, and as you know, cabs aren't cheap in Vegas (but what is)! They offered complimentary breakfast and have a nice bar area in the lobby, which stays open until 2 or 3. The rooms are nice, very standard, and the beds are quite comfortable. If you are looking for a less expensive option than staying directly on the strip, this is a hotel I would reccomend.

The shuttle to the strip is a bonus, to get back you'll need to either take a cab or walk ,if your single females I recommend getting a cab back, a little scary walking back especially at night. The cab from Harrahs cost us around $13 + tip. You will not have a problem getting a cab. Go over to any of the major Hotels and you'll see them lined up everywhere. The staff are all pleasant, rooms are CLEAN, beds are super comfy. Only downside if your a smoker, it's tough to get a smoking room, you'll have to suffer and go outside. No big deal!

The walk to the Strip takes 10 minutes tops, and you have to cross traffic, go over overpasses and under overpasses but a free shuttle is provided to the Strip. (No return shuttle though). That is the ONLY negative- the place is awesome! The staff was actually quite fun and always very helpful and friendly. The room was spectacular- the best I've ever seen for a Hampton Inn. The decor was beautiful and we had a nice view overlooking the pool area. The morning hot breakfast had plenty to choose from and varied a little bit each day so whether you want eggs and sausage, or biscuits and gravy and a donut or just want something healthy like yogurt, fresh fruit and wheat toast- you will be taken care of. There is a bar that was open even late at night when we returned from \"touring\" and the pool and outdoor hot tub is beautiful- towels right there for you and big comfortable chaise lounges with big, soft cushions. We went out one evening and had the place to ourselves- it's open til 10:00 pm, I believe, and is very private. (The surrounding area doesn't have the \"manicured development\" of The Strip). There is also an In and Out Burger across the street- which really hit the spot late one night!

There is a business centre with 2 computers internet access and 3 printers and it is free of charge. There is no time limit and there is stationery, Fed-Ex/ UPS forms/envelopes. The only down side is the complimentary breakfast which is not too great. The huge concentration of hotels in Las Vegas on the main road known as 'the strip ' is accessible via the hotel shuttle or via taxi for around USD $9-10.

If you want peace and quiet then don't stay at the front of the hotel, the road out front is very busy. The hotel was under renovation, floor 3 was gutted, and floor 4 wasn't far behind.

Walk into NYNY/MGM was 10-15 minutes, and the shuttle took you to the strip ever 15 minutes for free if you were feeling lazy. Though we were told that is wouldn't bring you back ..... not a problem - taxi only $6-8. Location was not a problem for us ... besides there was an in and out burger across the road.

Although we did not have a choice of hotels, we do happen to like this chain. BUT...this wasn't like other Hampton Inns. It seems to be a fairly new hotel, or recently refurbished, but hasn't been well maintained at all. The staff was great--pleasant, trying to accomodate everyone, and very honest when asked which nearby restaurants were good. (Wild-Wild-West restaurant had good recommendation from the hotel staff as well as other guests who had been on our flight.) In fact, the hotel staff was probably the best thing about this hotel. There were no non-smoking rooms available, so our room was most definitely a \"smoking room.\" The carpet was damp for some reason, and I don't think it was from carpet shampoo. There was food on the floor on the far wall where a table and two chairs sat. Housekeeping probably forgot to vacuum there. And also forgot to bend down and manually pick up the food. But the bedding was clean, and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was fairly clean, hot water, plenty of towels, and a coffee pot. And the hotel was very quiet. There was also a roach in the room, on the wall. One of the other reviewers said he/she was told roaches are normal for Las Vegas. Maybe so, but I've never noticed a roach in any of the 4* and 5* hotels on the strip. Although we didn't use the pool, our room did have a pool view. The pool looked clean from what I could see, and it seemed like an adequate pool area, and was being enjoyed by several kids and teens. If you want something that is not on the Strip, but within walking distance, this is probably adequate, although I would not recommend walking or jogging in this area at night. At 5am, waiting to take the shuttle back to the airport, there was quite a bit of foot-traffic from the Golden Palms Hotel across the street to Tropicana Avenue, all wearing very short skirts, skimpy tops, and very high heels. I'm pretty certain they weren't registered guests of the Golden Palm, either. They appeared to be women who worked at the Golden Palm, but were not employed there. But they only crossed through the Hampton parking lot without approaching the door. Perhaps because there was a security person at the Hampton lobby door. The hotel provides a complimentary shuttle to NYNY, MGM, and TI (to return to the hotel, you'll need to get a cab or walk back.) If you are a female traveling alone, I would not recommend this side of I-15. I would not feel safe here alone. As I said, we were booked here by the airlines, so our room was free.
