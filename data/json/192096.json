The purpose of the visit was to attend an opera in Covent Garden. The hotel was ideally situated for Paddington station where our train arrived, only a five minute walk away. The exterior of the hotel was attractive and the staff very accomodating. There are two lifts, the left one tiny barely enough room for two people plus cases and the right lift considerably larger. We had a room on the fourth floor facing the main road. The room was accessed via the lift and up a small flight of stairs. It had recently been decorated so the furniture and bedding was very acceptable. However, the size of the room was an issue. It was really very small, so it was impossible for two people to move around the room at the same time. We had to take it in turns to get ready and keep our cases on top of the wardrobe and under a table.There is a free safe which is a bonus and tea making facilities. The basin in the bathroom was tiny and shower screen on the bath prone to moving. However, all that said for the price a very convenient place to stay and reasonable for the price. EFs across the road good for breakfast, and we had a good curry around the corner from the station (they offer eat as much as you want 12-4). For getting around, we bought zone 1 all day tickets at \u00c2\u00a37 allowing limitless travel on underground and bus in central London, perfect.

After being given your keys by the staff, you're on your way into a very, very tight elevator. As we reached our rooms, through winding and extremely narrow corridors; we opened the door and were shocked to find our room was extremely small. The bed took up about two-thirds of the room and moving was very awkward. On further inspection; the blanket was dirty, the walls were scratched and messy, the television barely turned on let alone got any form of channel reception. Opening the curtains--well let's just say closing the curtains provided a much better view. As for the bathroom, a small standing shower, a very small toilet and a few soiled towels, to which I wish I was joking about. We decided to give it a night as it was a cheap hotel and perhaps to my naiveness, I thought this was standard for budget hotels in London. The night was terrible. Every hour you'd hear doors slamming, people laughing outside through the paper thin doors with no form of noise isolation at all. In the morning, my Fianc\u00c3\u00a9e and I awoke-- grumpy with barely a few hours of sleep. I was furious and decided to go downstairs to the reception and complain. I approached one of three people at reception and quite angrily said that \"I'd like to make a complaint about my room\". I was told to \"wait please\", which is possibly the worst thing you should say to a complaining visitor. I wouldn't have minded as much if not for the fact that there were two other staff members just standing behind her giggling like jackals and seemingly --albeit unlikely-- surprised that I was complaining. Eventually, after about 5 minutes -- in addition to my fianc\u00c3\u00a9e beginning to cry at the entire situation -- another staff member asked us what was wrong. I described our stay, our room, and indicated that I had taken pictures of the insulting standards. I was told that they would upgrade us free of charge. A ray of light, perhaps. But then you have to ask yourself; should I really be thankful that they're upgrading me to a habitable room when we had paid over \u00c2\u00a3250 for the pleasure? If, like me, you're planning a trip to London with a loved one, and you don't want to have to go through this hassle -- then please steer clear of this god-forsaken hotel. The staff are unenthusiastic, rude and just plain apathetic towards everything. The rooms are terrible and a big middle finger to naive holiday-makers. The only redeeming feature is the amazing proximity to Paddington Station.

There was literally only enough room to walk between the beds and to the wardrobe. The bathroom was worse. Im only 5ft but when I reached to wash my hair in the shower I was elbowing the wall. Paint peeling along the window, and due to the fact there was no extractor fan we had to open the window (which faces the main road) when we wanted to shower. It was also very warm at night, and quite noisy even with the windows closed, so we didn't want to open them (did'nt get any sleep anyway!) The reception area was nice enough, and the 'resturant' was ok, just a bit small. 2 lifts, athough only one of them goes to the top floor. The only reason I've given this 2 stars instead of 1 is that it has a convienient location (5 min walk from paddington station) and it was fairly cheap - we paid \u00c2\u00a367 for 1 night. Overall I would say I'm glad we weren't staying more than one night, and that we didn't spend very much itme in the room.

This was incredibly frustrating but was made even worse by the fact that the Royal Eagle is one of the worst hotels I have EVER stayed in and could in no way be consider to be a 4* hotel (which is what the Shaftesbury Premier London Hyde Park claims to be) and my room was anything but a deluxe double room. On arrival, a couple were complaining about the room they had been given but were told it was all they had. I then checked in and was given a triple room which I think most people would take issue with. It was right by the road and the traffic noise was terrible not helped by it being on the ground floor.

It had a bed with a sheet on it and a cupboard which you could only open if you moved half the furniture around. The bathroom was poorly maintained and the shower blocked causing flooding which meant you had to keep turning it off to allow the water to drain. If it had not been so late I would have found alternative accommodation but given that it was late and I was a woman on my own I did not want to have to do this.

While the Hotel has its location as a big plus, the rest of it is highly variable. My impression is that ALL the rooms are small; figure 10ftx10ft at best. We went thru 3 rooms within the first 2 hrs there. I purposely requested and booked a room with a double bed. Got a room with twins and an extra guest- a mouse. In addition the toilet didn't work. Changed to another room, this one with double bed (we were told initially that none were availabel when we got there ), but a bathroom smaller than the one on my sailboat. No towel racks, non working TV. Our third room, pretty much made it. Still very small and back to the twin beds, but the Bath was a good size, with a full tube and shower, towel racks, a working toilet, and a mostly working TV. Continental Breakfast was in line with my expectations, and the hotel lobby was a comfortable place to work with free internet access on a computer. Wireless is available but costs about 10 pds /day. The Staff is uniformly polite and try to accommodate you. Over the years I've come to have low expectations of hotels in London unless they are part of a large international chain, i.e. Hilton, Raddison, and the like. Unfortunately it is sometimes difficult to get a decent room easily for less than $250/night. My advice for here would be it's reasonable in price, clean ( excepting the the mouse, but I've had that at 5 star resorts as well ) and safe. As long as you realize that your room is only used minimally, you're ok. It's location, a 2 minute walk to Paddington Station, and 10 minute walk to Kensington and Hyde Park is its best recommendation", "Date": "June 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGlad we didnt pay a lot\u201d", "Author": "Chris20Uk", "ReviewID": "UR31105668", "Content": "I booked in haste as two nights for three people at \u00c2\u00a3102 was too good too miss, then I looked at the reviews!

We were not prepared for the shock when we turned the key after eventually finding the room-it was a maze of corridors. The room was very small. It was more like a corridor. The bed was jammed at the bottom of the room and you couldnt move freely around it. The view wasnt too pleasant either. The subway must have been directly below us because every time a train went by the building shook. There was no phone, the walls were cracked and had damp on them. All the furniture was jammed into the room making it feel very closrophobic. Also around the radiators was all mildew. I was very upset as it certainly wasnt the type of accomadation i had in mind when i think of 3 star! So i went to reception and asked for another room. The receptionist told me that the hotel was full and there would be a room available tomorrow. I accepted this as i had no choice. I went back to the room and told my husband, he said that was fine. After our journey my hushband decided to have a quick shower before dinner but the hot water didnt work. He went up to reception to complain but they told him that he wasnt doing it right and the receptionist went down to the room to show him how to work it. When he entered the room he said to my husband \"is this really your room? Its very small!\" he then preceded to tell my husband that you have to fully turn the shower knob to get hot water-which my husband had already done-the receptionist was quite patronizing. We were not alone in these conditions either , when in the reception , i overheard at least 2 other couples with similar complaints . At this point my husband was as furious as me , so we both went to reception to demand our money back . At this point there suddenly were lots of spare rooms available ! We were offered another room , which we accepted after viewing . This room was on the 4th floor . It had a phone , which the other room lacked . Was conciderably larger , but still not up to 3 star accomodation i have ever stayed in before . There were no tea or coffee making facilities ( in first or second room ) .

Also , i have never stayed in a hotel in great britian that did not offer a cooked breakfast of some variety . We found only cereal , toast , croissants , tea , coffee , and juice !

A visit to the bathroom then posed a different problem, one had to limbo under the sink to be able to sit on the toilet and limbo back out to extract yourself. There were no refreshment facilities, nor glasses to get a drink of water from the tap in the bathroom. Feeling cramped I exited the room and took a stroll to the Bar...... only to find it was closed and remained so throughout the day and night, due to the staff saying that they did not have a licence. My relatives had problems with their room also, initially they were given a room that contained a put up bed, a spiral staircase up to nowhere and no wardrobe. They complained and were moved to another room whereby the double bed was pushed against the window wall, therfore no clear access to this side of the bed. They also encountered a problem with a nearby room window being left unlocked and banging against its frame throughout the night. Our visit to London was pleasant but we arrived back at the hotel in the early hours of the morning, only to be woken by room service banging on the door at 9am to service a room which we were not due out of until 11am. The continental breakfast was toast, croissants and cereal all of which was self service, the coffee was disgusting and the tea non-exisitant. As were the manners of the staff who continually glared at us as we tried to digest our food. On check out, no manners was again the tip of the day from the staff, who took the money and seemed eager to get rid of us. The feeling was mutual. I would not stay in this hotel again and feel the staff were rude and ignorant.", "Date": "February 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, B.C.", "Title": "\u201cThe Worst Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4393943", "Content": "First of all I would like to say that I am an experienced traveller. I have travelled all over Europe, Asia, Indonesia etc. I am used to the different level of services in hotels and am not one to complain unless I am pushed to the limit. The Royal Eagle Hotel in London takes the cake! When my husband and I arrived after a long journey we were given a room with shower. We had reserved one with a bath. There was no problem with changing the room but there was with the hot water. It was the middle of the afternoon and there was only cold coming out of both taps. Remember this is the middle of January and you want hot water. When we informed the front desk they said that we probably weren't turning the taps properly. They sent up a maintenance man to look at it. He played around with the taps for a while and then he went to check on the boiler. I suspect they turn the hot water off during the day because ten minutes later I had hot water. But when my husband tried to have a shower after mine the water was cold again. Then there was the problem with the heat. There was none. We froze during the night and again in the morning no hot water. The breakfast that we were promised (fruit, yogurt, pastries etc.) consisted of day old baked goods, and cereal. Guests were lined up waiting for coffee and several of the cups had cracks in them. The breakfast room was freezing! Many people were complaining. When we returned to our room after breakfast there was a huge puddle of water on the floor coming from the light fixture above. My husband went downstairs to tell reception and they just shrugged as if it happens all the time. When we informed reception that we were checking out early and not staying the extra night they wanted to charge us. That is until I stated loudly in the lobby that this hotel does not have hot water, heat and the ceiling is going to fall in our room. Our bill was quickly processed (although I begrudge even paying for one night) and we went on to a lovely hotel a few blocks away.

The staff was friendly and helpful with any of our questions. The room was small, but clean and ok. The room was serviced everyday (I've stayed places where this isn't the case). We stayed on the 3rd floor and could occasionally feel the tube traveling under the hotel, but we might not have noticed if we hadn't read the reviews regarding the hotel shaking. I guess our biggest grip was the bathroom shower. It didn't really work and sprayed water everywhere. We took baths and left the shower alone. Breakfast left something to be desired. The breakfast room was hot and crowded and was mainly toast, cereal, and croissants. We decided to skip it most mornings and get a pastie from a local bakery. The location was excellent. Close to Paddington and several tube stations. Across from Kensington Park. Easy access all over London. Many restaurants and bars near by. We have stayed in much worse hotels and spent more money for them. I would stay here again, but then we are not that picky when it comes to hotel rooms when we are touring.

Lobby is very nice and we were allowed to check in early. Breakfast was not bad ( typical of what we have found in free-breakfast hotels in other European cities)Hotel is close to tube and bus stops. Negatives include the following: really small rooms and narrow halls, the bar was never open (it is supposedly being remodeled....don't beleive it), pay computer in the lobby was often out of service (we like to e mail home). The thing that bothered me most was that there seemed to be a problem with the electrical system. In the lobby you could see where wall-hung light fixtures had been removed leaving sooty spots on the wall caused by wires overheating or catching on fire. One afternoon the fire alarm sounded and another guest asked one of the employees at the desk what those spots were caused by and got no answer. The next morning workmen were busy repainting the lobby to cover the spots And even though the fire alarm went off no fire truck ever came which I guess means that the fire dept. was not called. KIND OF SCARY! The noise from the tube did not bother us because we were on the third floor. One day during our stay it ws 91 degrees in London and it surely would have been nice to have had at least a fan. But I noticed that the people in the aprtments across the street had not only opened their windows from the bottom, but also from the top. I did likewise and it really helped by causing the air to circulate better in and out of the room. Would I go back?

The hotel scores high here. My room was very clean. The bathroom was spotless and my bedclothes, despite what is written elsewhere in some reviews, were clean. The floor of my room was new hardwood and a little slippery, but it, too, was clean. The hotel is a two block jaunt to Paddington, which was excellent for me since I needed the Heathrow Express. Where the hotel scores low for me is size and staff. Despite its cleanliness, the room and the bathroom were the size of a sardine can. I barely had room for me and my suitcase. Like many older places in Europe, there's no air conditioning either. I imagine that 6 days out of 7, you never need it in London, but the three days I was there were really warm. Luckily I was only in my room during the day briefly. At night, with the window open, it was nice and cool, if a little noisy before midnight. The staff is not especially helpful and the hotel has a ridiculous key policy. You have to leave your key at the desk when you go out and use a key pass to get it when you come back. It's a minor inconvience overall, but one that shouldn't exist at all.
