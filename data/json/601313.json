The blankets are soft, warm and cuddly. I loved the little towel animals they made, it made me feel like I was on a cruise. We took full advantage of the kitchen space. We cooked breakfast every morning and even grilled an amazing dinner. We went to the wineries the Manager James suggested and had a blast! I was surprised at how informed the staff was about the Napa area. When we weren't out sightseeing we were lounging at the pool and hot tub. It was a definite plus that the pool was heated.

The resort is very conveniently located to both Highway 29 and the Silverado Trail making visiting literally hundreds of wineries very easy to do. The staff at the resort was exceptional and Marilynn, the activities director is FABULOUS. Her energy and enthusiasm is contagious, not to mention the wonderful orientation breakfast she organized on Monday or the three FREE wine tasting evenings she arranged during the week. In addition, she had contracted with Hector Gomez of American VIP Limo for a 6 hour tour in a stretch limo which included visits to 5 different wineries, plus a stop for lunch, all for $65/pp. What a fantastic day!!

Unfortuantely, she was a little lacking in funds at the time and so we thought we would get a room with a pull out couch so she wouldn't have to spend on a hotel. To our horror, it seemed like everything in Napa that weekend was $400+ a night. And staying for 5 nights meant quite a bit of money on some mediocre hotels. So I began looking for temporary rentals and the sort and happened upon this place. It is a time share and if a person with a week cannot make that week, they are allowed to rent it out. We were lucky enough to get this place for 5 days for what it would have cost for 1 night at the lowest price hotel in town that weekend. We were not sure what to expect when the owner told us that they were \"portable\" units, but once we arrived we were very pleasantly surprized. This is a trailer community, but the community is a absolutely charming. All the units are either yellow, red, or blue and look more like little houses than trailers. All have the same little land scaped path of lawn in the front and parking spot driveway. All units also have a little patio with table and chairs before you walk into the unit itself. The units are very nicely outfitted. We were shocked to see the inside of a trailer could look so nice! high ceilings with windows around, a living room area with TV, radio, pull out couch, a dining table, and a full kitchen. the bathroom was also very nice and the bedroom was very comfortable. Of all the rooms, the bedroom was probably the smallest and the only room that felt a little cramped, but we had 2 dressers. 2 night stands, a tv and a queen bed in there and we tried to put all our luggage in as well. Right behind the trailer, and visible through the living room window is a trail that snakes right along side the Napa River. All in all, we were VERY pleasantly surprized by how nicely they could transform a trailer. In fact, we enjoyed our stay (and the price!) so much that we even asked the front desk if there were any time shares available .

We stayed here for 5 nights. My first impression of River Pointe was that it looks lovely - the 'rooms' are actually little cabins that look a bit like static caravans, but they are all different colours and look very cute! The cabin was spacious with a lounge area that included TV and coffee table, there is a separate area for a dining table, and a kitchenette with all the things you need to cook for yourself if you so wish. Our bedroom was small but had a nice big comfy bed with another TV and a wardrobe for your clothes. When we arrived, the Maid had made 2 little elephants with the towels which were sat on our bed, it was a nice touch which would delight children! The bathroom was very clean, well stocked with towels and little toiletries and the shower was nice and hot! The pool was great - we spent a nice afternoon there, it was plaesant, clean and spacious. There is alos a gym, and a few Barbeque facilities around the property if you fancy cooking! The only thing that could maybe be classed as a downside was that when we opened our Welcome Pack, there was a section in it that explained that River Pointe was obligated to advise us that there is a 'chemical' present in the Napa Valley region that is 'known by the government to cause birth defects and cancer' !! As you can imagine, this was a little off-putting, but of course it isn't the hotel's fault! Another downside is that you have to pay an $8 per day charge for the amenities on site such as washing etc, this is mandatory even if you don't use the amenities. On the plus side, Wi-Fi is free which is good, as many other hotels do charge for this. Overall, I would highly recommend this place to anyone wanting a rejuvenating, relaxing stay. The sleepy downtown area of Napa is only a short drive away and has a host of nice little family-run restaurants and cute shops.

Nice touch Marilyn. All of the staff was really wonderful when we needed help, with directions or just things right before our eyes that we could not see. There were two wonderful gentlemen on the staff who, smiled and greeted us upon our arrival that we had no idea initially how helpful they would be. Our first middle aged women in distress moment was when we could not figure out how to turn on the cable tv. We called the front desk and with in minutes Frank Guevara came to our rescue. He found simply, what we could not after a half an hour of trying, that the cleaning person had pushed the cable box behind the television. Oops. But the big rescue mission that both Frank Guevara and his Manager, Jerome Thomas, participated in was when we had driven 60 miles back from Lake County, to find our oil cap had been mistakenly left off. The car had started having a little trouble a couple of miles before we returned to RiverPointe. As we drove through the grounds, Jerome and Frank notice not only the strange noise coming from our car, but that it seemed to be leaking oil. If not for Frank and Jerome pointing this out to us and Frank going to the hardware store to purchase a new oir cap and oil for us, who knows what might have happened to us. He put the oil in, the cap on and advised us to let the car sit for awhile before departing. Thank you so much to the Riverpointe staff for making our trip so wonderful.

This little gem made accessing the wine region completely simple. Clean, affordable and with full amenities and a great staff, we enjoyed our stay in quiet and peaceful calm. Friendly service and a beautiful setting for these cottages made it feel like a world away from the hustle of the city that's just beyond its borders. No charge for laundry service--it was not inside our cottage--included free soap and dryer sheets. Maid service was exceptionally detailed --she arranged my strewn luggage and tidied the entire place--and staff was more than helpful and friendly. We loved the high ceilings inside the cottage because they gave a feeling of much more room than we had anticipated. The additional picture windows in the room (above standard wall level) gave a feeling of airiness to the inside of the room. This little place was absolutely charming~! We used our small propane bbq on the deck and relaxed outside under the shade of the trees while watching hummingbirds float around the yard. The pool area is peaceful, very clean and offered umbrella covered tables. Meticulous landscaping around every cottage sets off the white lattice and highlights the design and color hues of the different cottages. Downsides: the double doors to the room are a little difficult to lock and the resort asks for a release of responsibility for personal items upon checking in. (Our maid failed to lock ours appropriately after servicing the room; however, nothing was missing and we were relieved.) We reported it for repairs, but found out that it's apparently an issue for all units. We locked our electronics in our vehicle when we left for day trips. (It probably would have been a non-issue for our us had we taken our laptop locking cables.) Another downside: the bed was way too firm for me; I compensated by sleeping on top of the down comforter. One more: internet service was terrible--no speed and couldn't access websites reliably; however, not a main issue for us since we didn't visit Napa to be on the net. An upside was soft water that tasted great~! We'll stay again because we enjoyed making it our cozy private space away from the hub of San Francisco and because all the wineries are a few moments away. Great bargain and very sufficient for our enjoyment. This little place is a great value and jumping point for so many wonderful places to see in the region~!

We have all vacationed in everything from a fancy downtown Chicago suite to a rainy Virginia campsite. We like the finer things life has to offer, and we get picky when stuff doesn't work right. Our stay at the Riverpointe could not have worked out much better than we had hoped. First, it's true that the units are, essentially, mobile homes. Ours had a small living room (double size sleeper sofa), a full kitchen, bathroom and bedroom with a king bed. Central air and ceiling fans. Everything worked well (the Wi-fi had to be rebooted twice, though the staff did that quickly). Attached to the unit was a 10 x 8 patio with table, umbrella and chairs. For a family with up to two young children, this was a clean, well-maintained and comfortable place to sleep and decompress after touring the wine country and northern bay area. Second, the staff went above and beyond the call of duty. They researched and printed out San Francisco ferry schedules, held free wine tastings, organized a free breakfast with raffle (we won a river cruise at 50% off) and no timeshare talk, coordinated wine tours (though we went off on our own), removed a drainpipe to look for a lost baby tooth, and helped fix a broken roll-away case. Third, Riverpointe's location is optimal. It's just about at the southern junction of Route 29 and Silverado trail, the two main arteries through Napa Valley. Need supplies for the kitchen or travel? Wal-Mart is 1/10 mile away. Want fresh and environmentally sound fish, meat, produce, cheese and gourmet items? Ox Bow Market is five minutes away. Restaurants? Fast food, sit-down chains, upscale and delicious holes-in-the-wall are throughout Napa (hint: ask about Rancho Grande, a three-minute drive). It took us about 45 minutes to get to Santa Rosa (Charles Schultz Museum), 50 minutes to drive to Sausalito, 70 to Fisherman's Wharf, and approximately 90 to reach Bodega Bay. We didn't taste Sonoma on this trip, but it's closer than Santa Rosa. Fourth, the common-area amenities include two hot tubs, heated pool, laundry facilities (no coins necessary) gas grills, computer with free Web access, Wii games and a pool table. In conclusion, this is not your place if you: have a large family, and your family don't travel well together, like to hang out for long periods in your room, require pampering and luxurious amenities.

Used the deck to sit around and relax at night and get together in the mornings to plan our day. Ideal location in regards to proximity to Napa and Sonoma as well as San Fran, Oakland and other tourist destinations. One caveat to resort, they advertise the units to accomodate 6 if you get the two units. I think 1 couple per unit is the max. Young kids on the sleeper sofa, maybe, but not two full grown adults. Recommend Red Rock Cafe for ribs and barbeque and ButterCream bakery for breakfast. Both right down the street from resort. Be sure to check in by 11PM or may be no one on duty at resort.

For two people, the one bedroom is slightly cramped when getting ready in the bathroom/bedroom. I can't imagine if you had 4 people in there - way too small.

Probably the unique thing to this unit \"43\" was that it was directly across from the clubhouse. The lights blared through the bedroom windows all night. It felt like we had a 30 watt bulb on in the room. I requested a room change, but it was sold out as half of the units were moved off the properties for the winter. There were only 30 units left to rent. The other thing never written was the indoor/outdoor carpet in the bedroom was pretty gross. Probably cleaned several 100 times. It made your socks black and felt like rubber. The bathroom smelled of mold. There is no heater only a portable radiating heat unit.

It is an excellent location to explore the wine country or to take day trips into San Francisco, Sacramento, or along the coast. Our unit was small, but comfortable and charming. Staff members are friendly and helpful, as were the other guests we met. If staying in a mobile home in close proximity to other guests is not your thing, then I suggest you look elsewhere for accommodations. Our one-bedroom unit, spacious enough for the two of us, would have been crowded for four. Opening our windows for fresh air also let in the voices of other guests and we could hear others when we sat on our deck. It was not a problem for us, but it could be for someone who desires privacy and quiet. Our positive experience with the staff began when I called in advance for information about wine tours. During that conversation as well as subsequent ones at the resort, the staff provided information and suggestions that enhanced our stay. Maintenance handled the one issue we had, a light bulb change, within minutes. Our unit was cleaned midweek and new towels were provided and trash removed two additional times. Our unit had a comfortable bed and living area, a table large enough for the two of us to dine, a microwave with a convection oven, two burners, a large refrigerator, and a deck with an unusually large table with four chairs. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the pool, but did enjoy a conveniently located hot tub. The workout room had only three pieces of equipment, but we exercised by walking on a beautiful 1.2 mile path along the Napa River. The staff includes a two-page list of activities in the registration packet. We recommend attending the resort-hosted orientation, a complete hot breakfast, as well as one or both of the complementary onsite wine tastings. We took the wine tour which includes tasting at four wineries, tours at three of them, and a delicious picnic lunch for $70 per person. Tours of San Francisco and the Napa River also are offered but we passed on them. The marketing person who gave us our parking pass also provided a map of the area wineries, a brochure that includes tasting coupons, and suggestions for interesting wineries to visit. She also suggested that we consider sharing a tasting, rather than pay for two tastings, at each winery. Sharing allowed us to taste safely at more wineries.

Like most places in wine country, the location was fine as long as you have a car. But it is just a short distance to the Silverarado Trail as well as close to the town of Napa. Upon checkin, we initial wondered what we got ourselves in to. These are \"trailers\" that can be moved in case of a flood (this is the only way the property could build on the location which is prone to floading). The last flood was 2005 so we didn't see this as a big problem (and the property makes this point very clear that you may have to vacate within 2 hours). The checkin area looked OK and the front desk staff person was informative. Still, we had a little queazy feeling in our stomachs as we drove to our small \"trailer\". Upon walking in, we quickly surveyed the small space. The \"kitchen\" has a full size refrigerator, 2 burners, a sink, dishwasher and microwave. The trash can didn't quite fit in the cabinet due to the fire extinguisher. Since they had regular trash pickup, they could have used a smaller trash can. But, as long as you look upon the kitchen as a place for breakfast and snacks, you are fine. I wouldn't want to cook dinner here however, with all of the wonderful restaurants--particularly in Yountville and St. Helena--why cook? The kitchen was in one corner of the living room area, which also included a small breakfast table (which has leaves that you can pull up to make it larger, a 3 person sleeper couch and a chair. The couch is firm but very comfortable. The TV area has the normal DVD, CD etc components and worked well. Bathroom was somewhat normal with a tub/shower (not huge, but adequate). The place had some nice closet space. We asked for a king bed and had to take turns walking around the bed. The bedroom also has a desk in it with chairs. However, we had to move the chairs so that we could walk around the bed. For the first day, we kept saying to ourselves that we would be OK in the small space, and if not, we could always go home to San Francisco. However, we grew to like the place and actually looked at dates to return. Why? Everything was very clean and maintained. The towels were nice and fluffy--way above what I would have expected in a place like this. The bed was very comfortable once we asked for (and quickly got) less firm pillows. The concierge had put together some good programs to acquaint people with the area and the resort. There was an orientation breakfast where she spoke to all the different types of travellers in the audience, plus 2 wine tastings...all free). She had printed out coupons for wine tastings and schedules of what was happening in the valley while we were there. The staff was well trained and very responsive. Even the person who came in daily to pick up trash and give us fresh towels was very pleasant. My only negatives are very minor. The resort tacked on a $5/day resort fee which allows you free laundry and some other stuff that few people use but that the properties use to justify extra cost. I personally think these kinds of fees are rarely justified and believe they should be included. in the nightly pricing. Yes, it did include wireless access in the lobby...duhhhhhh..wireless is SOP in many places now. Maybe it was to pay for the nice working area they had set aside in the lobby building..whatever. The wireless was only in the lobby building. Since we were paying $5/day for it, I would have liked it in our trailers too. I suspect this is a logistical problem as the trailers are spread out and...well, they are movable trailers. If you had a dial up (does anyone have those anymore?) connection, you could use it in your trailer. They also rented DVDs for $3 each or $10 for your stay. Why couldn't this be part of the $5/day fee? Can you tell that I bristle at extra fees? The only other negative was that the blanket didn't quite fit the bed. This was a very minor issue however. Once we turned it 45 degrees, we were fine. Bottom line, it turned out to be a pleasant stay in spite of our initial apprehension. While we tend to like something a little more upscale, in pricy Napa, is it a very good compromise and we are likely to return.

It was impossible to get to sleep before that so I left very tired! If you want a quiet relaxing time be sure to ask when you book if they have any \"parties\" planned. That is the only thing that would prevent me from returning.", "Date": "July 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Highland, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cGreat \"base camp\" for your visit to Wine Country\u201d", "Author": "Namgrunt", "ReviewID": "UR8035994", "Content": "We booked our week via Interval International using a trade from our \"home resort\" of Swallowtail (Hilton Head Island.)

If you've read the reviews of River Pointe, you know that the \"units\" are in fact trailers. Don't be alarmed! True, the units are mobile homes, but they are amazing!! We had a one bedroom, one bath (pics uploaded), and it was the perfect size for the 2 of us for a whole week. We want one just like it to stay in when we visit his parents' lake place. There is a bedroom, full bath (larger than any hotel bath i've seen), a kitchen area, a family room with pullout couch, and a porch with a 4-seater table. The kitchen does not have a regular oven, which we found out after we bought a frozen pizza to cook. It only has a convection oven/microwave. But everything else that you need is there! Laundry room in the back of the complex. Only 4 washers and 4 dryers, so do your laundry when you don't expect anyone else to. We went at the end of April, during the first phase of the growing season in the wineries, so it was pretty quiet. The resort does have a \"quiet policy\" from 9pm-9am, so neighbors disturbing you are never a problem. DON'T BRING YOUR PETS ON THE PROPERTY. They clearly tell you this, but our neighbors apparently couldn't read. They brought their little dog, and the people at the resort told them they had to leave. The only time that I was not happy was when one of the guest services people (Marilyn) never called me back after I left 3 messages for her. I was trying to book my husband and I on a special expedition through the wineries through the resort, and due to the fact that she never called back, we were not signed up for the Saturday tour. She had to create a Sunday tour to get us in, but when the other couples who were scheduled for Sunday cancelled, she never even called us to let us know. My husband had gone up to the front desk to ask about something else, and Marilyn said, \"Oh yeah, we can't drive you around today.\" Everything worked out, though....we just drove ourselves and covered two times the wineries the resort would have covered.

The salesperson started off with the typical chit-chat about what kind of work I do, yaddah-yaddah-yaddah. They offered some generic cookies, coffee, and cups of water. I truly went there with an open mind to buy, because I wanted a holiday spot that was somewhat close to home, but this certainly wasn't it. The cabins are very small trailers (the one-bedroom has to be about 300 s.f.) with wood paneling to disguise them, and the whole place is located in a flood plan. Last winter guests had to be evacuated, because the heavy rains flooded the area (and they had to repair their cot-trailers). If you are familiar with No. Cal. you know that just about any winter can have a heavy rain season. The kitchens do not have ovens, just a stovetop and microwave. Although the couch does pull out, if you scoot to the bottom of the sofabed you will be able to open the front door without having to stand up. There is about 18\" walking perimeter around the bed. The studio units are just bedrooms with a bathroom, and mini-fridge. The site does not provide views of any wineries, because it is in downtown Napa (which is not quaint like downtown Sonoma) off of a major street. The only amenities that are on site are a small gym, lap pool, and two jacuzzis. There is no tennis court, spa, restaurant, bar, golf, volleyball, walking trail...not even a pingpong table. When I asked about the lack of amenities, I was told that they would increase the maintenance fee (which is about $570 per year). This was really an unsatifactory answer, because I own another timeshare, and have seen others that charge less and are capable of having these types of amenities onsite for their members. The salesperson kept emphasizing the \"benefit\" of being able to trade your timeshare via Interval and other trading companies, or visiting one of their sister resorts. He didn't go into great detail about having to pay another membership to these companies ($80-90 per year), or how much more you it costs to trade ($50-150). So I got the impression that they know that most locals won't want to stay their, but wish to use the timeshare as a means to have access to other more desirable timeshares. So forget about having a nice getaway place that is only an hour's drive, because you will still have to drive to anything that's worth doing (gas costs $3.25 per gallon for regular unleaded). Another benefit is that a member can use the facilities anytime during the day, and I can tell there was a great demand for this added bonus by the four women I saw by the pool/jacuzzis. Lastly, I was told what an \"asset\" buying a timeshare there would be instead of spending money on hotels. Well, when I buy an asset I expect it to appreciate in value. I asked him to tell me what is the historical re-sale value of the timeshares during the 8 years they've existed. He got his manager to try to answer that question, and he could only tell me that a 2bd/2ba annual visit cost $22,500 in 1998, and the same unit was going for $28,675 today (FYI, an every other year 1 bedroom costs $9500+ now). This is about a 22% increase during a period where real estate values in the area have appreciated between 400-500%. . So the long and short of it is, buy a timeshare at River Pointe if: you don't want to stay there yourself; you want to rent a car (or have to drive) and spend a small fortune in gas, because nothing is close by (except Walmart); you don't mind staying in extremely cramped space that may flood in the winter or catch fire during the summer, and you prefer to spend your money on something that you will probably won't use, and have to spend more to get to a real resort (where you wish you had actually bought). The salesperson wasn't too pushy, but you can't get your gifts without one last pitch from the Trading Places (the other timeshare trading company) salesperson. I received a $25 gift certificate to Macy's, a travel certificate for 3 days/2 nights travel to either Las Vegas, New Orleans, Orlando, Cancun or Jamaica (these last two incur an additional charge of $169), and an invitation for a wine tour (which is dumb, because many wineries give free wine tours daily). By the rules of the travel certificate, the earliest that I can actually travel will January 2007, and the certificate is only good for a year from the date of issue. Spend your money and time at a nice B&B in the Napa Valley. You'll feel much better, and be getting more bang for your buck.", "Date": "August 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cHorrible Timeshare Value!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5438639", "Content": "My husband and I visited the River Pointe Napa Valley Resort to participate in a timeshare presentation. Having visited a couple of other international timeshare presentations and coming very close to actually buying one, we were very excited about the prospect of owning locally while still having access to exotic locations worldwide. Well this \"resort\" was a far cry from the real vacation getaways we've toured before (imagine having a Walmart and the train tracks across the street from your 5-star timeshare). Not only were we subjected to over 1.5 hours of verbal abuse from an obviously disgruntled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153friendly and professional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sales consultant, but we never actually got to see the rooms or the grounds since they apparently weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t important to the value-building portion of the timeshare presentation. We did, however, get a glimpse of the bedroom sized fitness center located behind the bathrooms in the main lobby. In closing, if your idea of a 5-star resort is one that treats their prospective owners on a 90+ degree day to a \u00c2\u00bd cup of tepid water and a stale cookie while being seated on your standard elementary school style chairs, then this might just be the place for you.
