We arrived late in the evening, and was greeted by friendly hotel front desk staff. We were given our room number and key. When we got to the room, my wife went in to take care of personal business, while I got what we needed for the one night from our rental. When I got back to the room, my wife informed me that the toilet would not flush. So we contacted the front desk, and were told that maintenance would not be around till the morning. One good point to this experience was the front desk offered us another room on the other side of the hotel overlooking the lagoon. No problem, not yet at least. We moved and found the new room to be filthy and disgusting. Kitchen was rusted, and falling apart. Front door door handle was falling off, and would not lock properly. Just a little shove, and the door popped open even though it was locked. Bed was slightly damp, I don't even want to know why. Outside the room was two vehicles running, tinted windows, smoke coming our of their windows, as they were talking and passing something back and forth. It appeared to me that this parking lot was a hot spot to do business since this happened several times throughout the night. I know this because I stayed awake the entire night keeping watch since I did not trust the area or the door. My wife slept on the chair with her feet propped up on the footrest. Luggage stayed in the vehicle due to fear of bugs, which happened to reside in the shower. We contacted the front desk, but apparently this was the only other room. We were told we should stay there since it was only for one night anyway. Apparently there was also no regard for hotel guest safety or security since noone came around to check the deals being made in the parking lot, and since maintenance was gone for the night, no chance of getting the door fixed. Needless to say, I got no sleep, my wife had back pains in the morning, it was an overall horrible experience, we will not be staying in a hotel like this or chain of this kind again, but hey, at least the toilet worked in the second room.

Since we live relatively near the beach in FL and December isn't really beach weather, we opted to stay somewhere less expensive than South Beach (and the general vicinity). Many of the places there charge for both parking (we drove) and resort fees. In fact, we booked the Homestead for the price of valet parking ($30/night) at some of the beach hotels. The place is very clean and seems to be located in a safe area. The property is gated, so only guests with keys may enter. There is a Publix (fairly upscale grocery store) right down the street, which was great for stocking the kitchenette. My only complains, if any, were the flat pillows and the fact that the kitchen includes a stove but no oven--we bought a frozen pizza and ended up taking it home b/c we couldn't cook it there. The front desk (Maria at check-in) was more than accommodating and friendly. When we requested more pillows and coffee, they sent someone with two fluffy pillows and coffee (for the maker) right to our door. Yes, you can hear the airplanes taking off and landing, but I wasn't bothered. The room fan/air conditioner drowns out most of the noise. The hotel is about 15-20 minutes from most of the attractions we were interested in--Bass Museum, Miami Museum of Art (downtown), the Wolfsonian (South Beach), the Rubell Family Collection (N. Miami). Costs $1.25 tolls daily--but beats paying for parking, etc., etc. in those areas. The absolute best and pleasantly surprising thing about this hotel was the free pass to Bally's Total Fitness for the duration of our stay. Indoor pool, hot tub, steam room, and sauna. Wonderful!

Also, let it be clear that it is not for the guest who wants to be pampered or to stay at a full service Hotel, but for the self-reliant person who wants functionality above all, even at cost of minimal guest service. You will have a basic room w/ queen bed, bathroom, armchair w/ ottoman, TV, Internet (one time configuration fee of $4.99), fair-sized wardrobe, worktable and kitchen (w/ refrigerator, microwave, toaster, stove, cookware and dinnerware) These preliminaries are necessary because a stay at a Homestead could be perceived as very good or disastrous based solely on the expectation of the guest, having nothing to do with the Hotel itself. In a tourism-bureau kind of classification, which is always based on the amenities the property offer, a Homestead Hotel would be a well kept 2-star or a median 3-star Hotel. In this review, as I think is more useful, instead of doing such an ammenities-list based classification, I will assume that the guest has chosen this kind of Hotel knowing its characteristics and will give a star-rating based not on such classification but instead on how well it works and is operated on its class. About the Homestead Blue Lagoon: This is a location geared for business, not for the usual tourist, as it is very far from Miami Beach or the Port of Miami. It would be a gross error for the casual tourist to book a room at this property: it is very near the airport, but it is also almost as far away as possible from the above tourist areas. Besides, there is no commerce in the immediate vicinity of the Hotel; a car is an absolute necessity here (as in most of Miami - exception made of South Beach) and, while it is usually hard to get lost in a grid-like city as Miami is, this property is a bit difficult to find to someone who doesn't know Miami well. The Blue Lagoon region is an agreeable one, near the Doral area, were you will find all the commerce and restaurants you need, with lots of greenery, quiet (while very near the airport, I don't remember ever hearing a noise) and the property has good security: it is an enclosed area w/ two automatic gates accessible only to the guests and has a guard on duty. Check-In and Check-Out were done very fast. At Check-In, the receptionist, Maria, was ease and pleasant, going the extra step as she called my room a few minutes later to ask if everything was OK! The other employees I have seen on the Hotel were also always with a smile on the face, which is nice to see and (probably) indicate they are satisfied working there. About the Room, Bathroom and Kitchen: First of all, everything was very clean; the mattress was new and firm; lightning was adequate, TV had lots of cable channels (with good image, even being an old-style CRT one, not a LCD); appliances were all clean and working, bathroom had lots of towels (fair ones, not the best, definitely not plush). The cooking utensils offered were chosen for their durability, not for appearance or lightness. Now we have the three main problems with this Hotel's concept, two of them inexcusable (as due to lack of attention to detail) and the third one a constant worry, but also more difficult to solve: 1) The Hotel does not offer detergent nor anything else to clear your dishes. This was not an accident, as other reviewers also complained of it. Having read them, I bringed my own, but I thing this is unexcusable, a direct contradition to this Hotel offer of convenience. 2) The fridge was placed at the right of the kitchen, next to the wall, but its door opened to the left, and the space between the fridge and the worktable was small, making it necessary but difficult to position yourself in front of the fridge, leaning on the wall, to be able to open the fridge's door. In such disposition, a fridge with a right-opening door would be much easier to use 3) The worktable: it is shared between the kitchen and the \"office\". So, much care must be taken not to spill food or liquids onto your computer or papers. Unfortunately, this is both the more annoying point and the more difficult to solve, as the table has a good size and there is no other vacant space in the room to put another good table for the \"office\". All in all, my stay was comfortable, the kitchen very useful, the internet (Wi-Fi) fast; to someone who choose this Hotel knowing its strong points and limitations, I will give four stars to my experience; it loses the fifth one due to the three problems above. And please remember that this star-rating is not saying that this Hotel is a four-star Hotel in the general sense, as explained in the beginning.", "Date": "November 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Porlamar, Venezuela", "Title": "\u201cJust to sleep!!\u201d", "Author": "Hjaspe", "ReviewID": "UR21528922", "Content": "The hotel is clean, but extremely basic, aircraft noise from the airport, day and night, could be a problem.

All I wanted was somewhere to sleep, eat and store my stuff while we shopped and this was just perfect for that. The rooms were large and clean. The website was up front about room and maid services being unavailable. It also indicated that toiletries could be replenished at the front desk along with towels. It also gave a brief overview of places of interest within the area. This was great! The kitchenette had a stove, fridge microwave and utensils. We were able to save on food by going to the grocery on our first day there. It has all these great malls within 10 minutes of driving and the airport is also very close.

We picked it because his choices were limited (we were traveling for his job and being reimbursed). We liked the idea of the mini-kitchen, and the location was good. We booked a non-smoking, king-sized bed room. \"Non-smoking\" is a lie at this place. Our room reeked of stale smoke as soon as we entered it, but we thought a previous visitor had smoked in it. Once the air conditioning kicked in, the smell became much stronger - and continued each time that happened. It seemed like all the rooms were on the same ventilation system, so smoke from another room was entering ours. It was horrible; the stench was so bad that our car smelled of cigarettes when we got home (thanks to us smelling the same), and we had to wash and Febreeze everything in our suitcase (regardless of if it had been worn) to get the smell out. The mini-kitchen was a disappointment - no sponges or dish towels, no soap provided, etc. It was also disgusting - smears and stains on the walls, cabinets, etc. This same problem was in the bathroom as well (along with the stained towels - at least we assumed they were stained and had at least been washed). There were also dead ants in the bed that we discovered the morning we were leaving (they also found their way into our bags, which we found when unpacking at home). We were pretty much afraid to touch most surfaces in the room, and we certainly didn't walk around without shoes on. We understood that housekeeping wasn't going to come in every day, but we also have standards regarding reasonable, basic cleanliness when we first check into a room. It seemed like our room hadn't been cleaned (beyond hopefully fresh sheets, towels, and perhaps a vacuuming) through multiple visitors. From our own research of this hotel, it was indicated that it had recently been upgraded, so we expected a much nicer, newer facility. It was one of the worst hotel experiences we've had. We considered demanding a new room while we were there, but we assumed that anything else we were given would be in similar condition.

I was a little concerned, with that hotel class level, but I was pleasantly surprised! Our room had a kitchen that came fully equipped, including a stove, refrigerator, coffee maker, microwave & dishes! (came in handy when we ordered pizza at midnight) :) The staff was friendly, although we did not have much interaction with them. I will comment that, although we did have a lovely room with a view of lake, it was in the rear of the complex and we didn't have a car, so we had to lug our bags quite a ways. Have your cab driver wait for you to check in if you don't have a car. It is a motel-type layout.

The Homestead met all our expectations: it is incredibly well located, the rooms are nice, new, comfortable and CLEAN, the personnel were all super attentive and helpful, we had free parking, we could cook and save tons of money in feeding a party of 8 (two families with two hungry kids each), and it is so close to the airport it was just perfect. The first score with the Homestead (after reading the reviews that we found here and on Expedia and deciding that this was the hotel for us) was the good rate that we got when we used their guaranteed best rate promotion. We searched on virtually every booking website and we found that the best rate published was on Cheap Tickets and it was cheaper than the rate published on the Homestead home page. So, we made the reservation on their corporate site and then completed the application, informing them about the lower rate we had found. Within 1 hour they wrote us back confirming what we had told them and giving us the Cheap Tickets rate, minus a 10% discount. We ended up paying a little over $51 per queen size room. One of these rooms wasn't available when we checked in so they upgraded us to a suite with a sleeper sofa. In addition we got a $10 discount per room for booking online and subscribing to their newsletter. Sweet. We booked three rooms: 2 queen sizes for the adult couples and one suite with a king size bed and a sleeper sofa for the 4 kids. All rooms had a kitchenette, with a two burner stove, a large fridge, microwave oven, coffee pot, toaster, pots and pans and cutlery. This was perfect to make breakfast for the entire tribe! The rooms are CLEAN, roomy, newly furnished, with large closets, comfortable bathrooms (including a tub), cable TV, a dresser, a night stand, free internet port, free local phone calls and air conditioning that actually worked. Being close to the airport did not bother us; we could hardly hear any planes taking off or landing. The hotel is located in a very nice area. My husband and I have spent a lot of time in Miami and to be honest, Blue Lagoon was a new area and quite a revelation for us. It is very safe, quiet and beautifully landscaped. We were very close to the Dolphin Expressway (836) that connects you to virtually any place in the Miami metro area that you may want. We were a large party with a total of 13 suitcases and 6 carry ons. We were riding on a van and it is imaginable that we all could not fit on the van WITH our luggage, LOL. So, staying near the airport was one of the considerations that made us choose this hotel. Making two trips to the airport to carry passengers, then luggage and then return the car at Dollar in less than 40 minutes total, was only possible due to the Homestead Blue Lagoon's location. Yes -- they don't clean your room or make your bed every day. You need to pick up your own stuff and try to keep some order and tidiness in your room. But you can carry your dirty or wet towels to the front desk and exchange them for fresh ones at any time, as well as your sheets. If you run out of toilet paper or soap, they are happy to replenish them at any time, same as if you need an extra pillow or anything at all... you just need to take a little stroll to the front desk and help yourself. Our cable went off after a thunder storm (apparently some lightning struck on the hotel) the night before. We called the front desk and they sent a maintenance guy to fix it within 10 minutes. They have two washer/dryer rooms, that work with quarters. Washer and dryers are brand new and they are located very conveniently on each wing of the hotel. The access to them is with your door card key as well as the access to the premises of the hotel, with a device that opens up a bar gate to the parking areas. We felt very safe at all times. The nice and friendly front desk personnel are there from 8:30 am until 10:30 pm. After that they only have security guards, so you need to make sure that you have everything you need from them before closing time. They have a little store with all basic necessities, including TV dinners, milk, candy, snacks, toiletries, etc. As a fun detail, they have a \"Special Guest\" announcement at the front desk for the passengers that are checking in every day. My brother in law was the special guest the night that we checked in and got a complimentary product from their little store as a welcome gift. Yeah -- a $2.00 little thingy, but quite a courtesy that we really did not expect and gave us a smile and a Kodak moment. My husband and I go to Miami several times a year. We will definitely be staying at the Homestead Blue Lagoon every time. We found that it was an excellent value for our money. Of course we have stayed in much fancier hotels, but in Miami who stays in a hotel more than to sleep, shower and change clothes? You just want to be out and about either at the beach or the malls. If these are your plans while in Miami and you are looking forward to spending most of your budget in the stores, the Homestead Blue Lagoon is an unbeatable choice.
