I have one more week to go. For the most part, I have been very happy here. There have been some problems, I will admit... e.g. the electricity was down a couple of times, a waterpipe burst on the landing right outside my door (!) and I had to change rooms for one night, my air-conditioner started leaking a couple of weeks ago, and I lost an outside line on my telephone for about a week. Okay, I know these are not minor problems... and they might deter you from staying here. While I'm on the negatives, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll add one more thing. The biggest negative for me is that the apt. was very dirty when I first moved in. I'm on the top floor, and I suspect this apt. had not been used for a long time. (I do notice that it gets dusty quite easily\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but then I do leave the windows open most of the time!) I wanted to stay here despite the dirtiness (for all the GOOD things about it, which are coming!), so I cleaned the apt. myself... and I've been happy with it ever since. (Interestingly, the room I stayed in for one night when the pipe burst was much cleaner than this one. I have a feeling it is occupied by guests more often than mine normally is. Why that would be, I don't know... but probably because most guests don't want to stay on the top floor of a 4-story walkup!) Okay, now the GOOD stuff. The location is fantastic... very central and easy to get everywhere in the city. The staff is great... and they have really bent over backwards to make my stay comfortable. They have responded to every request I have made very favorably. (For example -- just to name one -- I asked for a fan, and it appeared in my apt. a couple of days later. I think it would have been there sooner if I had been more insistent.) In fact, I suspect that if I had asked them to do a thorough cleaning on the apt. before I moved it, they would have done so. (I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother because I was afraid they would just give me a different apt., and I really wanted this one.) They change your towels & sheets as frequently as you ask them to. The cleaning staff people are very accommodating... actually, everyone on staff is. Faruk (the male -- and now apparently only -- housekeeper) is fantastic! You should have seen him leap into action when the waterpipe burst\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I thought he was going to kill himself! Other great things about the place... I can't speak for all the rooms, but my apt. (on the top floor) is as quiet as a tomb. This is very important to me. Also, despite the fact that it was dirty when I first arrived, I have not seen a single insect of any kind anywhere in the apt. since I moved in (except for mosquitoes at night... and that's because I leave my windows open for the cool breezes). One thing you do need to be aware of... right now -- during the renovation of the main bldg. (which has not started yet) -- the reception office is not open at night, as it was during my first month here. I have not been too happy about that for safety reasons. Because of all the problems & inconveniences mentioned above, I asked if they would give me a discount for my second month... and they did! As I said, they really have been very accommodating. BTW\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I probably don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to say this after what I have written above, but this is NOT a luxury hotel/apt. building! As in most cases, you get what you pay for. The furnishings & appliances are old. The place is not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spiffy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd! However, despite it all, I feel that I have definitely gotten my money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth at Galata Residence\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and that is why I am giving them 4 stars despite some real problems. If you are looking for BUDGET accommodations in a nice (but not luxurious), centrally located building, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say this is your place. I really do recommend it! Oops\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 just thought of one more thing. You will NOT be able to stay here if you are mobility-impaired. There are TONS of stairs, both outside & inside the annexes (especially for me\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 on the top floor!).

After 2 days in an other hotel we relocated to the Galata Residence. The apartment was huge but smelled a bit after drainage - but this is pretty much EVERYWHERE the case. The darinage system in the whole city is old. The beds were very comfortable, the furniture a bit worn. The bathroom old, it needs to be re-done soon. The place was spotlessly clean, they changed the sheets and the towels every day. Very friendly reception, also spoke english very well- they also organised private transfer to the airport for a very reasonable price - can fault nothing. In case you would like to go out and eat in the area I highly recommend the Galata Tower restaurant -not for the food but for the owner! He knows Galata very well, and is willing to tell you about how it. :)", "Date": "October 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cFeeling \"At Home\" at the Galata Residence\u201d", "Author": "bethridge", "ReviewID": "UR15920040", "Content": "Like the review before me this hotel is located on a very steep street and is reached by a flight of stairs so it is only best suited for mobile folks. Now...aside from that we loved the Galata Residence. We (mom, dad and teenage daughter) booked a two bedroom apartment. The apartment was spacious and perfect for our needs- good size kitchen with large refrigerator, living room with table for dining and small balcony (we were on the fourth floor facing Sultanehmet and had a partial view of the sea and tops of mosques), and the bathroom was a nice size but the shower is narrow and only good for slim people. If you have little children who need a tub it might be hard to bath them in this shower. Our bedroom had a comfortable bed and was spacious, my daughters room had two single beds, she thought the beds were too hard but she liked having her own space. She had a nice closet in her room but would have benefitted from a dresser. The place is a bit worn but it really is comfortable and charming. They clean daily and provide fresh towels and some beverages in the fridge. However, beside the Galata Tower - is a supermarket along with a few small grocery stores and a wonderful produce store so it is an easy walk to buy food. The staff were so helpful and friendly and our family felt very welcomed and assisted whenever we needed some help. They have wireless access in the lobby so you can hang out there if you have a laptop. The location is close to the Galata Bridge, Jewish history sites, Galata Tower, and Istiklal Caddesi and lots of great stores and restaurants. You can easily walk to Sultanehmet. The hotel will arrange car service to and from airport but it is not included in the price. The cost was very reasonable compared to hotels and we paid cash and received a discount. We loved this place and would easily stay there again when we return to Istanbul. We also LOVED Istanbul", "Date": "May 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West-Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cIstanbul Delight\u201d", "Author": "Good2travel", "ReviewID": "UR7654882", "Content": "Upon Arrival it is immediatly clear that this apartment/hotel is not suitable for elderly and disabled individuals. The hotel is situated in a series of backstreets and is accessed by approx 30-40 steep steps or a very steep walk up those narrow streets. The aparment itself was fine although looked a little dated in the bathroom and kitchen. The living room was nice and spacious and if you can get the top floor you have a nice view of the bosphorous. You get a large bedroom tastfully decorated and another smaller room with twin beds. Contact the hotel direct to get the best rate and if you book for more than a week and pay cash you can recive a discount. If your the active type than location here is great, Right between the new and old part of istanbul, plenty of local shops and money exchange around the corner.
