We stayed there for just one night, and chose this hotel because we were arriving in S'pore in the afternoon and had an early morning flight to catch the next day - so did not want to blow too much money when all we needed was a place to wash up and sleep. (After checking-in, we spent the rest of the day taking a lesiurely walk along various streets, shopping centres, etc, returning at about midnight to crash in the bed. Woke up at 6.30 the next morning, got ready and left by 7.30.) The room we were in was small - just enough space to keep 2-3 luggage pieces, and I agree with some reviewers who found the bathroom to be too small. I mean, if you turn the shower on, everything from the washbasin to the toilet seat are within its \"sphere of influence\"! Yup, the entire bathroom gets a good washing :-) The Rose is not near any MRT (\"subway/\"metro\" rail station) -- but there is a bus stop about 2 mins walk away from where S$1.10 or so will get you to the nearest MRT station Novena. Buses in Singapore, like the rest of everything in the country, are efficient and fun. The hotel is on the Balestier Road, so taxis are easily available. Interestingly, The Fragrance Rose and the Fragrance Balestier are next to each other (perhaps even share a wall)- I wonder why doesn't the management just combine the two! Just one grouse: the hotel reception staff are inadequately trained, and the hotel has a tendency to double-charge your credit card (they will charge the whole amount in advance when you make the booking, and may later charge your card again when you are checking out. After that, you may end up spending hours quarelling with the bank and the hotel!) So be vigilant on that front.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cThe worst hotel in Singapore!\u201d", "Author": "CPRatna", "ReviewID": "UR124470915", "Content": "Arrived in the hotel at 11am, placed our bags, paid for the room and asked for twin room (since there were two females, myself and my sister). Returned to the hotel at 8pm only to be told that there's only 1 double room left in the whole hotel. We were told that the twin room that we asked for has air conditioner problem. I asked to see the room, since both myself and sister are not penguins. The reception then said that the room was occupied. So I asked the reception if the twin room had air conditioner problem or occupied? Unfortunately I was not stupid enough to buy that lie. The receptionist then called the operation executive of the hotel cluster who turned out to be a toad with no manner. Instead of listening to what I had to say, he went on and about telling me that his hotel was fully booked. Enough said, I asked for a refund of payment and wanted to book into another hotel. I was told that there's not gonna be any refund given. In other words, I had to take whatever room that they had, and expected no refund if I didn't take the said room. Relented we went to the room, it was a tiny room with a stained bed sheet, a tiny bathroom with a tiny sink, a toilet bowl, and a shower head between the toilet bowl and the tiny sink (I couldn't figure out how to take shower!). On top of that, the air conditioner was very noisy. We asked for extra pillows and blankets, which didn't help. There's no way we would stay in the hotel that we couldn't take a shower. We decided to stay in other hotel nonetheless. And since we couldn't get any refund, we left our bags in the room. And our father slept in the room for a few hours, he didn't believe in wasting money away. In the morning we took our bags and father who hadn't showered, returned the key to the reception and got the hell out of that hotel.

The hotel was so bad that I'm compelled to write a review for it. The check in time was rather late at 3 PM, no exception. There was a cockroach on the headboard. The sheets were stained w/ (sexual?) fluids. There were no windows in the room. The shower area is shared with the toilet and the sink. (When you take a shower, almost everything but the ceiling gets wet.) The towels was rather small, thin, and worn out that they should use them for wiping/cleaning dirty stuff instead. The room is really tiny; we cannot lay our suitcases on the floor. When we checked in on Sunday, the place was crawling with people--who appeared to be horny men and hookers (I could be wrong). Things got better on weekdays during daytime but at late night the men and hooker scene returned. (From reading other reviews, it seems that many Fragrance hotels are more like cheap motels/rooms/places for people to complete their sexual transactions/trades. I thought by not staying at one of their Geylang locations would avoid this issue. Apparently, I was wrong.) The receptionist at the hotel on the first day was alright, but the receptionist on the day we checked out was rather nasty. She was smoking outside and we had to wait for her. When we asked her to call a cab to the airport for us, she dialed a # then hung up immediately saying the # was busy. She said that we should just wait for a cab to drop off a passenger, then there she went outside again to smoke. If you must visit Singapore and are only willing to pay for cheap motels, you might as well go for the cheaper Fragrance hotels in the Geylang vicinity instead. Paying for more expensive Fragrance hotel branches in other non-Geylang regions do not get you away from the sex trade scene. All in all, I have much better luck at budget hotels in other countries. In Japan where things are considered to be pricey like Singapore, at least the cheap hotels (I've stayed at 3 different cheap hotels in Japan) are not cheap on windows, separation of the toilet and shower sections, cleanliness, and hospitality. Based on the very very poor and pricey accommodation in Singapore alone, for an Asian destination, I rather visit Japan, Hong Kong, or Thailand instead. I do NOT and will not recommend Fragrance Hotel Rose to anyone.", "Date": "June 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Luxembourg City, Luxembourg", "Title": "\u201cso smaller than we expected\u201d", "Author": "vtv.anh", "ReviewID": "UR62753973", "Content": "I read and i know it is small hotel, but i cant image the rooms are so smaller than that.

If you want a normal sized hotel room with a normal sized bathroom you should be looking in a price range 2 - 3 times the rate you will pay here. If however you are looking for a bed and somewhere to wash and you plan to be out enjoying Singapore all day I have no hesitation recommending this place as very good value for money, but, don't be under any illusion about how basic the room is. I had a superior room but its hard to imagine what would be removed to make the room standard, maybe a smaller bed. My room had a good size bed which occupied about 75% of the floor space in the main room. There was a small cupboard high up above the bed, a small bedside cabinet with drawer and a small desk with one drawer. There was no wardrobe but two hooks with hangers on one wall. I packed extra hangers which turned out to be a good move. There was just room to put my suitcase between the end of the bed and the wall. The bathroom is basically a wet room. It has a sink (no surround), toilet and shower head sticking out from the wall. There is no shower bowl or shower curtain. When you use the shower the toilet and sink will get wet as will the whole floor of the room, there is no way to avoid this and you are not meant to avoid it, this is how the bathroom works. This does mean you need to think a bit about how you use the shower or it would be easy to get a lot of water all over both rooms. I would seriously think twice about booking this hotel is you are on the extra large or obese side. I think larger people could have a genuine problem using this size of bathroom. The area is fairly limited but there is one nice friendly bar just along the road and some KTV lounges nearby with flashy looking hostesses but I think you need to be Chinese to get the best from these. There are a few, local style eating places and a couple of convenience stores. You can catch a 124 bus (forget the MRT, too far away) from across the road to the top of Orchard Road to connect with City Centre or transport to other parts of the Island, cost S$1 journey time 10 - 15 minutes. Front desk staff seemed efficient although I did not use their services much. I do not use a computer when travelling so cannot comment on Wi-Fi access. The hotel is quite noisy. Sound seems to travel very easily along the corridors and through the building from floors above.
