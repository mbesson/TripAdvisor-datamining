There were suspicious looking wires hanging out of the walls and dodgy looking electric fittings. The breakfast was just cereal, toast, tea, coffee and fruit juice served by some very miserable looking waitresses. On their website it says it's a 10 minute walk from Wembley Stadium. All I can say is thats the longest 10 minute walk I've ever been on. It was a 45 minute walk and we were walking quite fast. On the plus side it is in a good area for concerts and events at Wembley and a 5 minute walk from Wembley Central tube station. You can hear the conversations of everyone staying in this hotel. Couple that with it being very near train lines, on a flight path and near a main road and the clunking pipes all night don't expect to get any sleep.

On reading the details on the website and looking at the photo's, the hotel seemed a value for money option. The photo's made the hotel rooms to look very much like Premier Inn or Travelodge. The reality was very different, our room was only slightly wider than the double bed and was very cramped. The door was hanging off of the single wardrobe and each curtain was holding on for dear life by about 3 hooks and I'm surprised they didn't come down with the weight of the dust on them. All the walls were badly scuffed and marked and looked in desperate need of a lick of paint. As mentioned in other reviews, there was no remote control for the tv, the walls were very thin and we could hear next doors conversation and no doubt they could hear ours. The carpet was not clean especially around the edges and there was at least 3 cobwebs hanging from the ceiling. The breakfast was very basic, just Cornflakes and toast - which was made with soggy bread which must of been frozen. You could have a cooked breakfast for an extra \u00c2\u00a34.95, but after seeing the state of our room we decided that we'd give it a miss. We appreciate that this is a more budget hotel but I've stayed in this type of rated hotel before and they have never been like this.

Went for our advertised continental breakfast in the morning, this comprised cornflakes, soggy toast and tinned fresh! fruit salad. I'm sure those on the continent would be proud!! the juices are plentiful though not surprising considering the apple juice which i gave to my son tasted like urine?? While talking to the manager in the morning regarding the shower, I mentioned that the bed was completely knackered as we were basically sleeping on the broken divan base. He said straight away don't worry we'll change it, and guess what coming back from a long day visiting sites in London nothing had been done.

We checked into a twin room and the receptionist (who was European - though why other reviewers see this as a negative thing I will never know as she spoke good English and was very friendly and helpful) gave us our keys and gave us a few tips. We went up to our room which was perfectly clean. The room looks a little dated but the beds were comfortable and the room was warm. The bathroom was on the smaller side but wasn't claustrophobic.

The heating wasn't on when we arrived and after checking the raditors to see how to turn them on i discovered that there was no way of turning them on or even turning them down if it got to hot, decided to watch some tv only to discover the tv channels were not tuned in properly so when you thought i'll watch BBC 1 you had to spend 5 minutes working out which channel it was on as they were all muddled up and it did not have a proper arial signal. Never got any sleep as there were a lot of parties going on in the room next to us which they done nothing about, i refused to eat breakfast the next day because all i kept thinking was if the rooms were that bad imagine what was happening in the kitchen.
