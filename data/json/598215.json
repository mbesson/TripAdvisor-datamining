{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Home away from home! Very quiet location, away from centre of Ubud. While this may to some appear to be a negative, for our purposes it was a distinct positive, particulary seeing as transport service allowed for drop off and pick up from Ubud town as required! Staff were fantastic, particularly assistant manager! Almost felt like we were invited guests rather than anything else! Nothing was too much trouble! Accommodation provided in individual cottages, surrounded by high walls to maintain privacy. Outlook from pool/restaurant area fantastic, across rice paddies. Assistant Manager even takes guests for a morning walk though paddies and nearby village to give a feeling for local life. Learned a lot about village living and culture which we would not have experienced had we been staying in central Ubud. If you are after a nice, quiet, relaxing place which is still close to the centre of Ubud, and are keen to experience Bali (rather than just taking advantage of the amenities which have been provided for tourists) then this place is for you! Down side would be that, in comparison to other places we stayed, the price of the accommodation was maybe on the higher end of the scale. Even considering that, I was more sad to leave the Bumi than I was leaving any other resort in which we stayed!", "Date": "Sep 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR927190351", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "TheOracleofOz"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297701-d598215-r19843324-Bumi_Ubud_Resort-Ubud_Bali.html", "HotelID": "598215", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
