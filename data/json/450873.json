{"Reviews": [{"Content": "More than what we expected for $20 AUD a night We stayed here for 10 days, the breakfast was just toast and cereal and eggs, no bacon (halal) but coffe and eggs on toast was suffice...Our room was clean quiet, the staff were so attentive even at 1am when we arrived and our air con didn't work (actually we didn't know how to use it)The tour guy that worked there when we stayed was FANTASTIC!! He got there at 730am each morning to take us out, we asked why he got there so early every day and he said just to take us out, he only charged us $35aud to take us anywhere for the whole day and drop us off at the hotel.He even found out where to take us camel riding as initially he had no idea you could even do that in Kuta. He always looked out for us gave us tips on places we were going and even on a few days arranged an itinery for us..The pool was nice and relaxing, no one was yahooing around the place.It was a bit of a walk from poppies 2 but with all the food you eat on holidays you can do with a walk sometimes", "Date": "Dec 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR534863466", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "sarebear007"}, {"Content": "Worthed PRice And Place ^-^       Helping machine besides the lobby", "Date": "Sep 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR436602993", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "marbellsblue"}, {"Content": "Fantastic Fantastic place i loved it. The rooms are spacious and have a very nice balcony/terrace area for relaxing. The bathroom is below average and the tap water is terrible(very salty). The location is awesome short walk to pantai kuta and same the other way out onto jalan benasari and the shooping districts. The staff were pleasent and theres no one standing out the front of your hotel hassling you everytime you step out for a walk. Heading back in 2 weeks......interesting to see if i have a win with another good room.", "Date": "Sep 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR787417809", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "ColesyOZ"}, {"Content": "Your last resort I had to check in to this place just because I'm having a trip with a group. So, it was chosen for me. Once we arrived, I thought: hm, seems nice. It had a Balinese architecture and a nice layout. The cons start to check in immediately after registering. The tile was a bit slippery, not much lighting provided in the room, the bathroom was old, the tap water was salty, and it was enough for me not to recommend this place to anyone. I was having a tight-scheduled trip. Most of the time I'm outside. Since, I used it only to sleep and bathe, it didn't quite irritate me. The pro was only that this hotel is located not far from the beach, just 5 minutes of walking distance. If you're a beach/surf-freak and this is the only available hotel, then I can't say more to stop you from checking in. But for others, nice-holiday-time seekers, keep out!", "Date": "Jul 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR549157273", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Aji2206"}, {"Content": "Tap Water No Good But...
