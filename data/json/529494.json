Also go to the Tourist office at the Main train station (4 stops away on the S-bahn) and buy a 3-day museum pass (\"Lustschau\"), which gives you free admission to about 60 museums in a three-day period - cost: $27 (20 euros).

The area around Charlottenburg is fabulous, and many shops (including a shopping arcade) are located nearby, particularly near Wilmersdorfer Arcaden which is a 3-4 minute east from the hotel. The hotel can be reached from Tegel airport by bus S-109 for 2.10 euro. The hotel isn't super fancy, and occasionally there is some night time partying noise, but overall it is fine. There is no refrigerator, so you may have to settle for room-temperature beverages you buy elsewhere. Berlin does have clean drinking water from the tap, though. The breakfast is, wonderful. A nice variety, though it will feel like it is the same after a few days. The breakfast room is very clean and the staff is friendly. I also went jogging and found the very pristine Lietzensee Park nearby. A wonderful haven if you just don't like the hotel area. If you like to have a beverage at a table outdoor at night, then there plenty of places around the immediate area. So the bottom line is this: If you expect fresh towels from room service, a mint on the bed, and a bell boy - don't even think about it. If you want a compromise between squeaky clean and a savings in money - this is pretty good, and includes breakfast.

It is located next to the S-bahn station and 2 U-Bahn stations are within a 5 minute walk. A lot of restaurants and snack stands nearby and a pedestrian shopping zone is also within a 5 minute walk. The street where the hotel located is a little questionable. There were several gentlemen clubs and women propositioning on the streets. However, I did not feel unsafe in this area. The halls and reception area are pretty run-down and shabby. Surprisingly, the rooms are very clean and a little small, but OK just for sleeping. There is no phone or Internet connection, but there are a couple of cheap Internet cafe's nearby. The hotel is not directly on the street, however being a light sleeper, I heard a lot of street noise. We parked our car in a lot just outside the hotel and paid a 50 EUR deposit to use the hotel's parking pass. You must keep your receipt in order to get your deposit back. I had misplaced mine and luckily found it. Without it, I think there would have been a little problem getting the deposit back. Finding a parking space was not a problem and we did not use our car during our stay. The S-Bahn is much more convenient and easier to get around from place to place.

Doesn't look like much on the not-so-pretty end of Kaiser-Friedrichstra\u00dfe with some \"interesting\" gentleman's bars just outside. However enter the main doors into the courtyard and it is tranquility itself. Reception looks shoddy and the hallways up to the rooms gives the most awful impression. However - and it is a big however - once you enter each apartment (each with about 5 separate rooms) the rooms themselves are bright, very quiet with no street noise at all and spotlessly clean. Small but functional bathrooms and again scrupulously clean. If you are a clean & neat freak like me, you'll feel right at home. Breakfast included is excellent - goodly amounts of food. You can have a typical German breakfast with cheeses & ham etc or a typical American/British breakfast of cereals, toast, preserves etc. All in plentiful supply. I found that having a good breakfast stopped me eating rubbish all day. The best thing however is that just outside the building is the bus stop for the 109 bus that takes you all the way along the Ku'damm to the Zoo Station. From there the 100 wil take you all the way to the Reichstag, Brandenburg Gate, Unter Den Linden and all the way down to Alexanderplatz - thus including virtually everywhere on the typical tourists itnierary. And also the 109 from the opposite end of the street will take you all the way back to Tegel! Even better is that the Charlottenberg S & U bahn station is only a few moments walk from here - with the trains taking you all the way to Hauptbahnhof - again only minutes walk from the Reichstag & Brandenburg gate. Going the opposite direction on the train is Spandau which is well worth the trip. Anyway, I am digressing. This is the best value - immaculate rooms, right in the middle of Charlottenburg with great public transport links to all the main places. Right around the corner on the corner of Stuttgarter Platz & Leonhard Stra\u00dfe are some great little shops & caf\u00e9s: El Gato Azul is a fabulous German owned tapas bar. The wines and tapas are amazing - and it such a cool friendly atmosphere. There are a whole load of other bars on the way there though - some of which are quite delightful.
