F.E. i got to access my room much earlier that they would usually allow me to. I arrived at around 11 am, and I was given my room well in advance. I enjoyed that they were really frindly and acommodating, and in my books, this counts for a lot. The room was not spectacular, but it was renovated, and the services were quite functional. The furniture was nice, the beds super comfortable, the TV really nice, and the Internet services were free, fast and readily available. I was working a lot for most of my first afternoon, and I was able to remain connected and productive. The pool in this hotel is also great, my friends were quite pleased, and although the dressers were a bit chilly, it was a minor inconvenience. So, this hotel is great if you are using it as your sleep quarters while exploring Toronto. All the members of my party enjoyed the hotel tremendously and the location was unbeatable for the price.

This is a nice clean hotel, in a good section of downtown. Upon check in, I was greeted by a nice front desk agent who I believe was named Steven. I actually spoke to him a few times during the weekend, and he was always very pleasant and helpful. I booked two rooms for 2 nights (919 and 920) and they were both spotlessly clean. The beds were comfortable, and the HVAC worked well. They had told me that they had just spent in the neighbourhood of $20 million on renovations, and it showed. The bathroom, although small, was very well appointed and very modern. The location was also great. It was just steps from the College subway stop, and there were many great restaurants within walking distance. Also, the new Lawblaws in Maple Leaf Gardens was right next door, so I was finally able to see what the fuss was about. (Beautiful grocery store by the way, but that's another story.) My only minor complaints about the hotel were the size of the rooms, and lack of feather pillows. The rooms are very small. Almost European small. If you plan on spending a lot of time in your room, this may not be the best option, but for the average tourist or business person who only plans to sleep there, they are fine. Also, I assume if you have more than one child with you, claustrophobia may set in. That being said, they were perfectly spotless and very comfortable for 2 people. As for the feather pillows, there are none. This particular Holiday Inn does not have them in the hotel at all, and your only option is foam. (Although they offer a 'soft' and 'hard' option.) My issue is that I have a bad neck, and foam pillows always give me a headache no matter the firmness. If you *must* have a feather pillow like myself, remember to bring your own. All in all it was a great stay, and I would go back... unless, as I said, you plan to spend a lot of time in the room. Otherwise it's one of the best options downtown Toronto at this price point. *I never ate in the resaurant so I have no review about that, however there's an awesome little coffee shop attached to the hotel (Privately run) that makes a great latte if you're not into the coffee hotels serve!", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "terrebonne, Qc", "Title": "\u201cwould defenitly go again\u201d", "Author": "doudlie G", "ReviewID": "UR124668329", "Content": "We went on february 3rd 2012 for 2 nights, room 2222 and really enjoyed our stay.

The heat kept on going up and up no matter what I tried to do. What helped was that there were windows that did open which cooled the room down. What I dont understand is why does the heat continue to go up when the fan is off? I went to bed and the room was 75. I woke up and it was 89.

Being 4 small, vulnerable girls, we were a bit nervous walking into the hotel. When I mentioned to security that the men outside were conducting some sort of shady business, he just laughed and brushed it off and said I was overreacting. As a customer to your hotel, my safety should never be at risk, or laughed at. Your own customers are afraid of coming into the hotel because you have hoodlums in front of the doors selling drugs and then we get laughed at? Not appreciated at all. Overall our stay was good for the deal that we got, however if it was up to me, I would not choose this hotel had I known which one it was. Beds were comfy but the heat was unbearable. Cant the hotel do something so that we can fix exactly what temperature our room should be rather than just having it go up and up and up? Waking up to a room at 89 is just ungodly.

Even after I insisted that I did not want to prolong her stay at work, she proceeded to assist us, an act that was far above and beyond the professional call of duty. This was rooted in genuine generosity, attributes which as of late seem lacking not only in the hospitality industry, but the world in general. As if that weren't reason enough to be pleased, the rest of our visit was accompanied by Tanya's vast knowledge of Toronto's hip and young nightllfe, diverse dining options and great suggestions for entertainment and shopping. Tanya is reason enough to revisit this particular hotel. Other highlights, nice and clean rooms.

The location is fantastic, just off Yonge Street with a TTC subway stop on the corner. The hotel's secured parking was priced in line with other options (about the same or less expensive than nearby municipal garages). Rooms are small, but this is typical for a downtown hotel. The room amenities were new and good, making the small room more comfortable than it might have been. If you must have a larger room, book a queen+queen room instead of a king room. I was traveling solo and had plenty of space for myself. Wi-fi access worked perfectly inside the room. The bathroom was excellent, featuring marble, a glass shower stall with a door that didn't leak, and a shower that could peel paint. And there was enough bathroom shelf/counter space that my wife and I could have both been happy, had she accompanied me. My room had a couple of issues -- most seriously, I realized on the second night that my deadbolt wasn't engaging because of some misalignment in the door frame. But the room keys are chip-enabled, which is a much newer and more secure keying technology; and I just didn't want to bother asking for a different room. The in-room safe made me more comfortable with my decision. Also the fancy iPod-docking alarm clock didn't work. I didn't ask for a repair, so the hotel didn't have a chance to respond to that issue. The elevators are a weakness at this hotel. They are big enough to accommodate 8-10 people apiece, and there are 4 elevators, but there seemed to be a long wait almost all the time. I think the management should reprogram the elevators so that two would service only the top 11-12 floors. It would speed up everyone's journey. But the perfect hotel doesn't exist, certainly not at the attractive price point of this hotel. I chose to eat breakfast outside of the hotel. I tried a 24-hour joint across the street (decent enough) the first morning. One block east on Carlton I found an even better option for the second morning (Daybreak) where the service was exceptional and the food was excellent. After returning home, I thought I might have left a pair of cufflinks in the hotel. I called and was promptly connected to the housekeeping department. The person who answered searched the lost and found items without success. Fortunately I later found the cufflinks inside a zippered compartment I rarely use.

Its nice knowing that when I look out my window I can see a girls on the corners. When we checked in it was fast and the guy at the front desk was very nice. I booked the hotel online through hotwire on September 29 and the minute I did so, I called the hotel asking if we could get rooms side by side. They had reassured me that they put them together. When we got to the front desk the man said that there was no note stating that we be side by side. He did his best and we were only one room apart which was fine, however I didnt appreciate the fact that even though I called, I still didnt get what I asked for. No big deal though. When we went to our rooms it was small yes, but it was clean! A problem that we had was one of our lamps wouldnt work and our phone was not working! I called down to the front desk to ask if we could perhaps get someone to fix our phone. They said they would send someone right up but no one came! Again, no big deal. The rooms were cozy, not cold like your typical hotel room... until we noticed on the thermostat that it just kept on getting hotter and hotter! When we went to sleep (4am) the room was at 78. An hour later I woke up in sweats, only to see that the room was at 85! We set the thermostat to AC and set it for 72 but it still kept on getting hotter and hotter. We asked the housekeeping staff how to fix it and even they said that our room always has that problem (our room was 315). Thank god for the windows being able to open because that was the only way we cooled down the room. The next morning we had a scheduled check out at 11am, but I called down and asked for a later check out. Without any hesitation they extended it to 1pm which was fantastic. Checking out was no problem, however on my way home I realized I had forgotten my pillow in the hotel room. I called the hotel and they directed me to the housekeeping. They told me that they have it and that they will keep it until I come and get it. I ended up getting it, and they even gave me a free newspaper LOL I guess they had extras? Parking was easy to find because I know downtown Toronto really well. The hotel is located on Carlton St, and the parking lot is located on Wood St. If you look on a map, its not at all hard to find. There is a public parking lot right beside the hotel parking lot, but my fiance insisted that I used the hotel parking because its \"safer\". It was $25, which is standard.

I came back as the first experience was great. Second was pretty average, showing the difference that good staff make. I booked a deluxe room (which is a couple of categories above standard) and with my Platinum card was hoping they would give me one of their suites. I know these are subject to availability but this was a weekend and you'd suspect that these would not have all been sold. Seems there were lots of other people who had got the upgrades before me. But, that's the deal with the card and I was looking forward to my deluxe room. However, the guy at the front desk told me lots of people were checking out on the Saturday and there should be suites then. So I thought, it's late, I wont unpack and will check tomorrow. Well......I was disappointed with my top floor room. It was dark - even at night time and had the tiniest window going. The following morning, even with it being a nice sunny day, the room still needed the light on. The pigeon netting in front of the window was an additional touch you can look forward to. So, I asked at the front desk about moving as the room was dark. Surprisingly, no suites available. But the room they were offering (plus point for at least trying) was much smaller and not much brighter. So I opted to stay. Also on the plus side, great bed - although don't have two of you sit at the end of it as it will tip up! Shower was fantastic. Bathroom is nice but no place to put anything. For a deluxe room there were only plastic glasses. I know it is a Holiday Inn but you'd hope you'd have glass - especially in a deluxe room.

No \"did you enjoy your stay?\", no \"we appreciate your business\". No eye contact. No smile. So, if you do visit, it will be ok, but don't expect any service from this particular lady at check in (unless you speak Mandarin/Cantonese in which case the service will be top notch.) And avoid any of the rooms in the corner of the hotel as they are probably all as dark as the one I was in.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Campbellford, Canada", "Title": "\u201chot and noisy !!!\u201d", "Author": "guinnessfillier", "ReviewID": "UR119456924", "Content": "My stay at the Holiday Inn on Carlton Street in Toronto was very disappointing.

First and foremost, the staff is AWESOME. Very helpful, respectful and accommodating. Although I made no special requests and only utilized room service once, all the employees I came across on a daily basis were very courteous. As everyone else has already touched upon, the rooms are very small. Being a solo traveler, I found that the room was adequate for me but I could not imagine sharing that space with a companion or worse, a family. I was working long hours, all four days and the quality bed/pillows provided sufficient comfort for a good night's rest. The television is a standard LCD; very nice but a lack of HD programming (perhaps I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m being a tad greedy). Ample desk space to squeeze a laptop and the wireless internet access was very reliable and helpful. Touching upon the size of the room again, the closet was smaller than the one I had in my cramped college dorm room. It was enough space for me, but fitting more bags and clothing in there would be a difficult task. The room safe was handy; the refrigerator and coffeemaker were also great attributes. The bathroom was only large enough for 1 person, so don't expect to share it with a companion if need be. Nice granite countertops and adequate water pressure. An irritating feature was the mirror in the bathroom, which was too low. Nice feature to exam your torso, but how the heck am I supposed to shave, etc? LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION....this place is in a GREAT location. Convenient access to shopping, restaurants and mass transit. Cons: Dirty carpet, hallways were indeed very warm (inadequate ventilation?), food selection was minimal, but satisfactory (delicious steak :), pathetic exercise facilities (maybe I was expecting too much), the pool area smelled over-chlorinated (I didn't swim however), my room toilet was not balanced either. Overall, don't hesitate to stay at the establishment. Yeah, there are a few downfalls but it was a great value and worth the stay. Well done to the GM, who I can see frequently comments on this site.

Their credit cards would not hold enough on them for the deposit, so they offered cash to the night clerk. This was promptly refused. they demanded a credit card to get a room. He then phoned me asking if I could give them my credit card number to get a room, I spoke to the night manager, who told me he could not take the credit card over the phone he needed a copy of the front and back of the card, obviously this was impossible since I was in another city. He then said that he could fax or email me a form or I could go online and reserve a room with my credit card. I asked for the email, he told me that it would be easier if I went online and reserved, I did so immediately. My son in law then phoned to make sure the reservation went through, he was told yes it did but that did not pay for the room, it only reserved the room and he would need a the credit card that was used to pay for the room. Again cash was offered to pay for the room in the morning along with the online credit card holding the room. This was refused again. Another call to Holiday inn from me to sort it out. I asked for the night clerk who refused the room again, to ask why it was refused even though I did exactly as the Night Manager told me to do, he had no answer , and passed me to the night manager again, who told me he was following policy. I asked for an explanation, obviously by this point I was not pleased being given the run around at now 12:30 am and just attempting to get the 2 young men into a room and off the streets. I still was attempting to get an answer from the night manager when I asked for his name and his position, he gave me his name and told me he was the manager of the hotel, I asked again his position and he again said manager. Never mentioning he was night manager till i demanded his position. ( I was attempting to just get these 2 into a room, and hoped I could speak to a general manager) At this point the night manager told me he felt I was rude and he was following policy and would not give them a room. ( at no time was I vulgar or rude-- but definitely loud, as at this point frustration from the run around was wearing thin ) I told him that he was to make a decision on whether he was going to give them a room or put them into the street. He changed his mind and... ACCEPTED CASH AND DEBIT AS A DEPOSIT WITHOUT THE CREDIT CARD AS FIRST WAS OFFERED ! The room was then given to them at 12:45 am --almost an hour of hassles for no reason. I have to ask why ? WHY were these 2 young men put through this? WHY ? was I put through this ? WHY was a verbal credit card number number not accepted over the phone, the same way a phone reservation is taken ? And why would this night manager ever be allowed to put 2 young men out in the street at now 12:45 am ? This is the way I would expect to be treated from a low budget motel, not a world class hotel. So to sum things up BEWARE of how you try to get a room at the Holiday inn, where policy comes before people at all costs, even when that policy means your in the street at 1245 am in downtown Toronto--- NO SOUP FOR YOU!", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, an oasis of calm\u201d", "Author": "Frogletsmum", "ReviewID": "UR118957313", "Content": "Very pleased with my choice.

It rightly deserves to enter the top quartile as quickly as possible. This is one of the best Holiday Inns I've stayed at and as a current Priority Club Platinum member in my tenth anniversary year, I have stayed at many of their properties, so feel well positioned to judge. All the staff were most welcoming and personable. From the front desk team to the restaurant staff, the maintenance crew to housekeeping personnel, you were made to feel very welcome and valued. Twice I ate breakfast with a view of the reception area. Most guests I saw left the reception area with smiles on their faces. The restaurant is worth mentioning. If you're familiar with the North American Holiday Inn brand, this hotel breaks the mould. The restaurant decor is modern and of a much higher quality. The breakfast menu is the same as you would see in US properties, with one or two Canadian additions. The buffet option at CAD17 is very good value and you can eat well from the a la carte menu for around CAD5 more. The buffet selection is very good and all the food was well presented and served piping hot. All the restaurant staff deliver a high level of service. While waiting for my breakfast to arrive on one day, I was offered a newspaper to read and on my fourth morning, I was greeted by a handshake from one waiter. Do eat dinner at least once in the hotel. Forget what you may recall about dinner in other Holiday Inns. The menu is unique to this property, with an excellent chef and a menu that will surprise you with it originality. The food was well presented. One night another guest expressed a wish to have a fish dish, but didn't see anything she liked. The waitress went off and spoke to the chef, who proposed an alternative using many ingredients that weren't on the menu that night. When this arrived, it looked just a good as the dishes that were on the menu that day and was well received. The room I stayed in was very comfortable. I received my Platinum upgrade to a king-size room. My room had one of the bathrooms that just have a large walk-in shower, rather than a bathtub. The water was nice and hot and the pressure strong. The mirror was well lit and there were plenty of new white fluffy towels. There is plenty of desk space in the room and - a first for me in a hotel - a blue recycling box alongside the regular trash can. And the large flat screen TV offered a wealth of channels and other online services. My room was also equipped with a small fridge too. Drinks from the vending machines on the guest floor were just CAD2.25 each. If you need a printer, the business centre, off the very large lobby area, allows you to print a number of complimentary sheets, before a nominal charge kicks in. The hotel is just a few steps from the College/Yonge underground station/street car interchange, so if you don't feel like walking in this very walkable city, you can get to most places very easily. If you take the not-so-express bus from the airport, take this to the Delta Chelsea Hotel stop, which is just a couple of blocks away from the Holiday Inn. To balance my very positive review, there a couple of issues that the new management should address quickly. Firstly, the free high speed Internet service was quite unstable. A few times each day, I would be thrown off and would need to log back in. One night the entire service stopped, confirmed to me as a server crash by the service provider's helpdesk. When it worked, the speeds were acceptable but it was difficult to rely on consistently. Secondly, there was a trend to be disturbed every night by night personnel using their walkie talkies on their hallway patrols and housekeeping staff entering the housekeeping storage rooms, which were opposite the guest rooms on each floor. These interruptions would usually start around 1am and continue to around 3am. The hotel management can easily address this by reminding these staff members that guests are sleeping in the nearby rooms and to avoid talking in the corridors and letting doors slam behind them. Overall though, this is an outstanding new addition to the Holiday Inn family.", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGreat value and comfortable stay\u201d", "Author": "schnugchi", "ReviewID": "UR106419455", "Content": "There is something in a name and the Holiday Inn is a hotel that I could rely on for good value and a decent stay. Our room was very clean and inviting. There was a choice of pillows for those that prefer soft and/or firm. The room was rather small but it was not a hindrance to our comfort. The location is smack in the middle of downtown Toronto and the subway is a three minute walk away.

I look for a range of rooms - but they always have to be clean, comfortable, inviting, and provide value for money. Value for money can mean spending $550 on a south beach hotel that looks over the ocean, or it can mean a $99 airport hotel, or it can mean $150 on an Orlando Staybridge Suites that is short on frills but long on comforts. In this case, I was attracted to the location - it's close to Church and Wellesley and it operates under a banner name I trust - I am a dedicated Priority Club member. Checked into this hotel recently - had stayed at its predecessor which was a dump. There is no doubt that the hotel has cleaned up its act under the HI name. It has a fantastic location if you are downtown Toronto. Right out the door is the entrance to the subway. Movie theatre a couple of doors down. But after this experience, I would pay another $20 to stay at the Delta, just a few blocks away, knowing I would get a better experience. But the hotel does not have suites yet open, contrary to what was written by another reviewer. At least, that's what we were told on check-in when we specifically asked. I am a Platinum member, meaning I have jumped through to their penultimate level of loyalty card holders, so if they said there were no suites, I'll take their word for it. We stayed in an executive room. It had a washroom, a bed, a closet, a fridge (in a closet), and a tiny window. New furniture, new carpeting, new paint job. Shower was always luke warm, never got hot. Free wi-fi and in room internet. I was assured this was one of the best rooms in the hotel. Not sure how it was executive. Repeat problems with the electronic card key. Repeat problems trying to get out of the downstairs parking lot (the ticket didn't validate on either occasion). Most importantly, this was a hotel ROOM that I didn't want to stay in. It just lacked that warm vibe that I look for. Nice to have the impetus to get out, I suppose, but I prefer a place where I actually WANT to relax after my day. Definitely not this room and if this was one of their best rooms then I wouldn't want to get anything less. Check out staff was very friendly. Check-in staff was average. Yes, she explained everything that is on the checklist, but I could have been a piece of cardboard with a credit card in my hand. Anyhow, I don't want to rant. Maybe my expectations are too high. The hotel isn't horrendous. It just isn't very good. And $20 more down the road would have bought me better.", "Date": "April 6, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Holiday Inn Toronto Downtown Centre", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g155019-d188212-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Toronto_Downtown_Centre-Toronto_Ontario.html", "Price": "$117 - $216*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">30 Carlton Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Toronto</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">Ontario</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">M5B 2E9</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "188212", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/f3/1b/3d/arriving-at-the-holiday.jpg"}}
