We wanted to stay overnight in San Pedro so, if something went wrong with anybody's transportation, we had time to recover. The rooms were clean, comfortable and well-appointed. The property seems to be well kept. The lobby area was getting a fresh coat of paint while we were there. The location is almost perfect, being about four blocks off the end of Interstate 110, the Harbor Freeway. There are a dozen fast-food restaurants nearby on Gaffey but the only nearby sit-down place, in a hotel one block to the north, was \"closed for remodeling.\" A five-minute drive to \"Ports o' Call Village\" will get you several nice restaurants. We didn't take the hotel up on their cruise parking offer because they quoted different total prices at different times and that made me a bit uneasy. We opted to park at the cruise terminal. (It isn't cheap at 12 dollars a day, but it's a tiny fraction of the cruise cost and was very convenient.)", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NEWBRUNSWICK", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Place for before cruise stay\u201d", "Author": "WEREALLYLOVETOTRAVEL", "ReviewID": "UR125319438", "Content": "Yes- as some people have said this is an older hotel so a bit outdated.

A power strip extension cord, kindly provided by mgmt., fixed the problem. I also appreciated the bathroom heater lamp and BATHROOM FAN. The flat screen TV was another plus. Initially, I was concerned because of the review which mentioned a glass breakage incident, but I emptied anything visible from the interior of my car and it was untouched. Yes, there is a criminal element in the vicinity, and low-income housing projects are a half-mile east near the port, but--take it or leave it--San Pedro is a microcosm of the incredible diversity of the Greater Los Angeles Area. For me, San Pedro's maritime monuments, authenticity, and historicity renders the risk negligible; moreover, having grown up in LA I find San Pedro to be relatively safe. In fact, I am more worried when in Hollywood or Venice than San Pedro. In any event, the hotel mitigates the security risk with an alert staff, and security cameras around the property.

He was most efficient and showed a good sense of humor. Later we had a little problem with the toilet flush handle and he had a repairman there in minutes to fix it. On request, he recommended to us a sea-food restaurant which turned out to be great experience. The next morning, I could not locate my pass-port and without it we were dead in the water for accessing the cruise. Kazi was so good at assisting us in advising on what to do under the circumstances and made his facilities available to help. Above all, he said he needed me to relax and think out my situation. After about 60 mins of termoil, it occured to me that I had hid my pass-port in my money belt and my crisis was over. In the mean time, he outlined the unthinkable if the pass-port could not be located, i.e. how we would spent the time in San Pedro while our friends went of the trip without us. It included a room special. Next, we were immediately transported to the ship using the Inn's van, and on our return seven days later, we were welcomed by Kazi while we picked up the car. The icing on the cake would have been if the Inn picked us up on the ship return at the wharf. The Inn was clean & comfortable and near restaurants of various categories, just ideal for our purposes.

The shuttle is a van. Instead of waiting for the shuttle we called a cab. I would stay here again, just a place to sleep before a cruise, nothing fancy. There is a Japanese restaurant sitting on the corner of the hotel lot. About a block away was the Hawaiian bbq, and a pizza place.
