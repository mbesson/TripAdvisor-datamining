{"Reviews": [{"Content": "No Air Conditioning !!!! we stayed last month for a wedding, we found accomodation basic but clean, unfortunately there is no air conditioning so at nights was very uncomfortable. It is not child friendly as there are many steps to climb daily. There is no basic shop at the complex which means that you either have to walk to the town of Fiesole and take a taxi back which will cost you sixteen euros to get back with your goods.This is a beautiful location with fabulous scenery, and with a little moderation of facilities could improve your stay.", "Date": "Jul 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR935015497", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "guest36"}, {"Content": "Truly lovely We stayed here for a week in September as I was getting married at Castello di Vincingliata.I booked out the entire place(save El convento) for family and close friends and it was amazing. Each apartment is spacious, clean and fully equipped with iron,hairdryer,fresh towels, welcome basket.The rates are also very reasonable for this area.The views from some of the apartments and as you sunbathe by the pool are spectacular. Also, there is an adjoining restaurant with it's own deli. You really have everything you need and Florence city centre is a 10-15 minute drive away.Perfect accomodation and we hope to return!", "Date": "Sep 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR197025666", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "bifty"}, {"Content": "Love this place We got married in the villa and stayed in the apartments associated with the converted monastery next to it. We tried to rent as many apartments as we could for friends and family coming to the wedding, but couldn't get them all. Each apt. is so gorgeous and amazingly affordable. Some have the most beautiful view of Florence. We got to know and love the staff. They are all very accomodating and welcoming. All in all a magical place. A secret just waiting to be discovered. If you must be in the heart of Florence, this place is not for you. But if you want to combine the beautiful countryside and villa-life with the convenience of being close to the city and train, then this place will NOT disappoint you in the least. My friends are still talking about it years later!", "Date": "Apr 8, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR809190494", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d263603-r17640701-Fattoria_Di_Maiano-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "263603", "Price": "$101"}}
