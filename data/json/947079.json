Although it is not located within Berlin's Central, the major attractions are accessible via U Bahn or S Bahn. The nearest U Bahn station located is about 10 minutes walk and Academy Hotel is nestled within a quiet residential neighborhood. The reception staff is friendly and helpful and within the hotel, you noticed the little details that they have made to make it more cosy for guests, such as free chocolates at the reception. Within the rooms, it's nice and cosy with amenities such as mini fridge, hair dryer, hand soap. Not bad for a budget hotel by European standards. It definitely felt at home instead of a hotel in Academy. If you don't mind the distance and bit of walking from the U Bahn station, I would recommend Academy Hotel to those who are on budget but looking for a nice cosy stay in Berlin. I would give a 8 out of 10 to Academy.", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rethymnon, Greece", "Title": "\u201cBudget hotel.\u201d", "Author": "antonio_reth", "ReviewID": "UR121010975", "Content": "Friendly staff,small clean room,excellent breakfast,not nice area at all.", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cSort of in-between a hotel and hostel.\u201d", "Author": "deathinthehalls", "ReviewID": "UR115851610", "Content": "For the price, this is a pretty good place to stay.

It was a 15 minute walk to Postdamer Platz, or 5 minutes by bus. The room was small, but clean and enough wardrobe space for my clothes for a 6 night stay. Breakfast was an additional cost, but at a total of around 54 euros a night (approx \u00a348) this seemed quite reasonable. The reception is not occupied 24 hours a day, so after 10pm you use a secure entry at the side of the building, which I had no problem with. There is a small elevator for anyone on the higher floors too. I didn't feel threatened or uncomfortable in the area, although there were \"ladies of the night\" plying their trade to motorists near one entrance to the Kurf'strasse U-bahn. I really enjoyed my time in Berlin and the hotel cetainly didn't dampen the experience.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gothenburg, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for money - totally recommended!\u201d", "Author": "Crustlord", "ReviewID": "UR70008958", "Content": "I don't usually write reviews of hotels or accommodation, but I feel that The Academy Hotel deserves one and I hope it will give you, the reader, a better, unbiased, picture of what to expect if you stay there. We travelled from Sweden and stayed for 3 nights. When my wife and I book a hotel, we expect somewhere clean with the basic comforts - and we don't think that friendly staff is too much to ask for either. After that, we don't really care for frills, bell boys or getting our \"rears\" licked by the hotel staff... We're there to see the city not the inside of the hotel. We want somewhere to sleep, shower and to leave our bags for the duration of our stay. The Academy Hotel was perfect for all of the above: The staff were very welcoming and friendly in a down-to-earth way. The room was exactly what we expected - with the added extras of a minibar and snacks. Clean towels and sheets, with complimentary slippers!. Little \"welcome chocolates\" on the bedside tables (nice touch). Tidy and clean bathroom with a powerful shower and hair-drier. The soap/shower gel was supplied in the form of the refillable Dove bottles attached to the wall - convenient and good for the environment. The bedroom was the perfect size inc. TV. Good location with access from 2 U-Bahn stations. Overall, we couldn't have expected anything more for this great price. We'll be back and we'll also be recommending our friends to stay there too. Thank you Academy Hotel Berlin - job well done!", "Date": "July 7, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Academy Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d947079-Reviews-Academy_Hotel-Berlin.html", "Price": "$49 - $142*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Dennewitzstrasse 7</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10785</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> (Formerly the FG Hotel)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "947079", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/97/86/9786209e087b3b056b37225cc64345b04large.jpg"}}
