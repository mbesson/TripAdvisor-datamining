{"Reviews": [{"Content": "across the street from Tokyo Dome! The hotel staff were very polite- they explained to us that in Japan you leave the hotel keys at the front desk when you leave  pick them up when you come back.  Our room was super small, just enough for a double bed and a space barely wide enough to roll our suitcases around the bed. The bathroom was nice and clean, the room was well decorated and had an awesome view of Tokyo dome  the rainbow-colored ferris-wheel at LaQua. The cafe downstairs smells like an ashtray. It was conveniently located just around the corner from 2 different subway stations- one was Ochanomizu. Across the street from Tokyo Dome  LaQua spa/shopping center. We ate breakfast at the Moomin cafe in LaQua every morning- super light and buttery pastries and you get to sit at a table with stuffed animal Moomins :)  Excellent, affordable place to stay when you jet around Tokyo", "Date": "Jun 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR595633848", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mayuchan"}, {"Content": "small single rooms... I came back from trip to Tokyo to watch the Red Sox play in the Tokyo Dome. I was looking for the closest hotel to the Tokyo Dome (short of the actual tokyo dome hotel), and this one is right across the street from the dome. The location is one block away from a metro stop and right behind the JR Rail stop Suidobashi. Pretty convenient to get around. There's also a McDonalds close by, and our stay included free breakfast which was pretty poor. it was essentially bread and juice with some very strange looking scrambled eggs.As for the hotel room itself, it is very small. it's approximately 80 square feet and I had to duck to get into the doorway (I'm about 6'2 but I'm going to guess that the doorway entry is about 5'10). there is a small bed, a tiny desk and a bathroom with a great bidet/japanese toilet in the room. there is also an extremely small fridge in the room. The front desk staff spoke limited english but were very willing to help answer questions or provide directions. It was a good location with a very small room. i'd only recommend it for single travelers looking to go to an event at the tokyo dome.", "Date": "Mar 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR922437230", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "mca311"}, {"Content": "Great location, reasonable rates. Hi,Was staying 3 nights @ the Tokyo Green Hotel Korakuen to catch a concert at Tokyo Dome. I highly recommend the hotel for concert go-ers. Tokyo Dome is just across the street and nearby shopping malls like La Qua is fun to spend time at, La Qua is a shopping mall cum amusement park, including rides like a roller coaster ride that goes around  above the mall.The nearest subway station is the Ochanomizu station which is just behind the hotel, the room amenities are pretty good too,including a mobile plasma tv(has wheels), albeit a small one.Reasonable rates too, an average of SGD 225 per night for twin sharing room.", "Date": "Jul 6, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR483671807", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lizzieL"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066442-d616867-r16549693-Tokyo_Green_Hotel_Korakuen-Bunkyo_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "616867", "Price": "$87"}}
