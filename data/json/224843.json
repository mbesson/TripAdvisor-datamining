We stayed twice (going/returning) and found the LaQuinta virtually flawless. The shuttle to and from the airport, even leaving the hotel at 4 AM on our first stay and returning at 1 AM on our second, was very quick, the drivers consistently courteous and helpful. The check-in was as quick and seamless as that of any other hotel at which we have stayed. The room was large (king bed), very nicely furnished and clean. The beds were very comfortable. Even though it is right next to the (very active) airport, there was no noticeable jet noise in the room. There are several nearby restaurants, within easy walking distance, even in the ever-present Seattle rain. The complimentary breakfast, including a \"make-it-yourself\" waffle, and the normal cereal, baked goods, toast, juice, coffee, etc., was adequate. Since our first stay meant leaving before normal breakfast hours, the staff arranged for a few breakfast items for us before we left. That gesture was typical of the staff, who seemed to go out of their way for us. It takes a lot for us to give a five-star review. La Quinta (Seattle airport) deserves it.

Standard breakfast. The area to let your dog go was covenient and there was bags provided. Come on people pick up after your dogs! I have to say though one reason might be that they put the pags as far away from the doors as possible and you have to walk across the grass to get one. Meanwhile trying to walk through the grass at night and stepping in stuff that others didn't bother to clean up after their dogs. might help to move the bags closer?

The maintenance supervisor told me that the door on the lock was defective and that it wouldn't latch when closed. So while I was asleep in the room, someone came in and robbed me.

She was borderline rude, and acted as though I was attempting to scam the hotel, even asking me if I had been drinking.

Parking spaces are too close and barely allow enough room for a mid-size SUV to pull in, nonetheless have enough room to open your door far enough to be able to get out without hitting the vehicle next to you. The room we stayed in was on the first floor but not really. You have to step up from the lobby to get to the same level and you have to step up from the parking lot as well. This means you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use a luggage cart to wheel your many pieces into your room, you have to do it manually. The outside exit door relocks when you leave so you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reenter through it so you have to walk back to the side entrance to get in, and it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even locked even though there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a card reader to stop unwanted traffic. The bathroom had just a shower, no tub. The refrigerator wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even on a shelf or a table, it was on the floor. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not talking about one of those large refrigerators either; this is a small, RV-sized one. The closet was tiny and for a room with two full beds there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s barely enough room for one person to hang their clothes and a jacket let alone a second person in the room. The dresser has only 4 drawers, one of which had 4 phone books in it. The light by the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdesk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 can only be turned on if the switch on the wall by the main door to the room was on. This also turned on the light next to the television. Luckily it has its own separate switch so you can turn it off if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need it while you work at the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdesk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. I say it that way because the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdesk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is about 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 x 2-1/2\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and is merely a table. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardly large enough for my notebook computer and mouse then they stick the internet connection device and a large plastic pamphlet holder on it too. There is no surge protector for the AC plug where one would normally insert a laptop/notebook plug and the CAT5e cable that is for the internet isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t connected to one either, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just there laying on the floor hoping you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find it instead of thinking the internet in this hotel is wireless \u00e2\u20ac\u201c LIKE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IS. I mean really, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Seattle for Pete\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sake. I would think that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have wireless in the rooms, heck I saw a bus drive by that said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153WI-FI HOTSPOT\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd so if a moving bus can do it, why can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t they. The shower is not small, at least compared to the one I have to deal with at home. The water valve assembly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t firmly attached to the wall studs so it moves around. The trim ring around the shower head pipe doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay against the wall, even though it looks like someone caulked it in an attempt to get it to stay. For a dog-friendly hotel they truly suck. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s virtually no grassy area and for the spots there are, are just mud. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that great for walking your dog either. There are busy streets all around and no walking paths. The only option is to walk your dog around the building a few times and maybe on one pass you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find the tiny spot of grass for them to use but since it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the only one, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect it to be as clean as the toilet in your room. If you smoke don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t plan on finding a place to smoke outside. Apparently there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a law about smoking within 25 feet of any entrance which may explain why there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no ashtray near the doors. There is instead a nice few (thousand) piles of cigarette butts on the ground surrounding the hotel on the parking lot and in the rock gardens and in the bushes. The hotel backs onto the airport so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit noisy at times. Luckily the runway is over a hill and passed a few buildings so when the large planes take off, the noise is somewhat muffled.

I am a budget traveler and usually stay at the Red Roof Inn or the Motel 6, so that gives you an idea of my expectations and standards. We splurged on a Monday night at the La Quinta because we needed internet access and the Red Roof was full. I'm so glad we got to spend the night in comparative luxury. The La Quinta was renovated about two years ago and everything is new and shiny, from the tile in the bathroom to the paint in the hallways. Either it was deserted or the walls are thick, because we didn't hear evidence of another guest the whole time in our room. We heard airplanes in the morning, which is to be expected since the hotel is right next to the airport, but they sounded much quieter than they do from the Red Roof or Motel 6. High-speed internet was furnished via in-room cable and worked great with no passwords or connection fees required. The room was ultra clean. There was a blow dryer, shampoo, and a coffee maker in the room, as well as a desk, but no fridge or microwave--those would have been the icing on the cake. The front desk staff was friendly and solicitous--they even called when we'd been in our room a few minutes to make sure everything was satisfactory. There was plenty of parking and this hotel really is right next to the airport, though a few blocks' drive from the airport entrance. One small problem is that the wheelchair/stroller entrance is only on the airport-facing side of the lobby, so if you need to enter on wheels (or wheel your luggage in) you have to drive around to that side of the hotel, and it's not obvious that this would be necessary from the parking lot. The hotel is situated on the \"hotel strip\" just next to the airport, and there are several restaurants nearby. The closest stores include a Jack-In-The-Box, a Taco Bell, two gas stations, and a 7-Eleven, but I also saw a bunch of sit-down restaurants further down the street toward the airport.

The towels were not as nice as in some other La Quintas I have been to-but still not the flimsy kind that one gets a a budget motel. I paid $60 plus tax for this weekend night, which is quite low compared to other Hotels in the area. The free continental breakfast is really quite extensive with cereal, fruit, Joghurt and fresh waffles. A bit to few tables when I was there, as a tour group from Korea just had breakfast-they were not provided an extra area, although they were more than approx.30 people, who were not familiar with western breakfast it seems.But the staff cleared up all the messes quickly and refilled all supplies within minutes.

What an awful and smelling experience. When it was reported to the desk clerk, she was not concerned about it all, saying she would have the dog's owner clean it up when she came back in. When the dog's owner came back into the lobby which was several minutes later, the clerk asked her to wipe it up and all she did was grab some paper towels and rub it deeper into the carpet. It was the most disguisting experience I've ever witnessed in a hotel. The hotel clerk or guest with the dog did not apologize to any of the guests in the lobby for what happened. We had to take our luggage and our shoes into the restroom to clean them off but they still smelled for hours after that. It was awful!!!!!!!!!! We will never stay there again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "March 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh NC", "Title": "\u201cGreat choice!\u201d", "Author": "Raleigh307", "ReviewID": "UR2482362", "Content": "We stayed here in August 04, at the end of an extended vacation in the Pacific Northwest.
