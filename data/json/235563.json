There housekeeping leaves a lot to be desired. Here are my complaints: The same trash bags were in the breezeway for all 3 days. The whole front side where we were was covered with \"love bugs\" that were never cleaned. The bathroom next to kitchen was never cleaned and there were no paper towels there. I saw the head of housekeeping this morning and reported all this to her. She really did not seem fazed by any of these complaints; moreover, nothing had been done to clean up any of these areas even several hours later. When we talked she told me that she wasn't working this weekend and was just coming on duty. Why does a hotel give the head of housekeeping a busy weekend off and then schedule her to work when everyone has left and the hotel is empty? I asked a woman on the elevator who was on her way out what she thought of the hotel. She said that she paid $50 extra to have an ocean view and couldn't use the balcony because of all the bugs. She said that her mother found a dirty bandaid in her bed.

We checked in after dark, and the walk to our room through the dark, not-very-clean or nice-smelling concrete outdoor corridors was scary! If my husband hadn't been along, we would have left long before ever getting to the room. The room itself was nice and had been completely renovated just as advertised...not upscale but fine. The a/c unit worked very well, but the a/c cover on the balcony was off, and the water was creating rust on the balcony wall and floor. We had an oceanfront room with a beautiful view. There was a hot breakfast, and the staff in charge of it worked very hard. We were aware of the construction, so that was no surprise, and for the price, we were generally satisfied. It's difficult to pinpoint why we were uneasy about this hotel, but I'll try. 1) the corridors and lack of lighting felt very unsafe [tile and lighting would fix that and may very well happen as renovations continue] 2) while we ourselves are pet owners, we don't bring our dog on vacation, and we were uncomfortable with the number of the dogs we saw around the pool and other parts of the hotel 3) there was a general feeling of uncleanliness even though we saw staff working very hard. Perhaps some of these issues are \"beach front hotel\" issues...the sand and water must be a constant battle. We'd check it out again after renovations are complete, but I think our entire vacation would have had a different feel at another hotel. In the end, I'm not sure the savings was worth it. The manager asked me about our stay, and when I gave him a lukewarm response, he questioned me, and sincerely wanted answers. I overheard him talking to front desk staff after our conversation, and he seemed to write me off as someone who just can't be satisfied. (I admit that I took offense to that because I think we are fair in our expectations, but I also admit that I had difficulty giving concrete constructive criticism.)

A bit at the end of our rope, we were pleasantly surprised by both the spacious suite with separate master bedroom and ocean view from the balcony. Check in was smooth, even though we booked online less than 10 minutes before arriving at the front desk (mobile wifi in car). Asked about checkout time the next day and the Front desk agent automatically extended until noon. Obviously in the midst of some renovations, but most appeared to be soft goods and minor exterior facelift issues. Beds were soft, pillows too, a/c worked well but unit in master was a tad noisy. Great beach only steps from the pool area, which was also good but could use a few more tables for drinks, etc. and umbrellas for shade (speaking as a mom). Breakfast was decent, but could use a bit more \"polish\"...serving spoons for eggs instead of teaspoons, etc. but to be fair we had also just come from a week at Hampton Inns in Charleston and Savannah, so there was a certain level of expectations from the kids. They were thrilled, however, to see the waffle makers. Beautiful morning spent at the beach and pool, and as we were getting kids out of the pool to leave, the GM happened to pass by. He noticed how much fun the kids were having - and how they didn't want to leave- and asked if a later checkout would help us enjoy a bit more of the day. I was surprised, since most hotels don't offer this, especially on a Friday leading into the busy weekend. Needless to say, his offer of a 3pm checkout was very kind and we happily took advantage of it! Overall, it was not necessarily \"cheap\", but there was good value for a beachfront property at the height of summer...and the separate room for parents was priceless!!!

The previous reviews were helpful and we had no unexpected surprises. The property is still being renovated, with that our room was fresh and anew. Due to a booking error from the main reservations ( will metion later) we were upgraded to a large suite. The pool area was clean and the manager was seen with a vendor talking about some upgrades to some of the flower beds and pool deck. The exterior is still being painted as well as interior parts as well. Our room which I mentioned above had a kitchen, small pull out sofa and 2 queen sized beds. The kids were elated to each have their own bed. There were 2 bathrooms with shower tub and sink vanity area. The master bedroom was nice sized with a king bed and seperate private bathroom similar to the other. The beds slept great with plenty of pillows.The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast was a mix of hot and cold food which was decent and while a little crowded at times it was less expensive then eating out each morning. Don't expect steak and eggs but you should find something edible to eat. Now on to the reservation snafu. We booked directly by phone with Lexington. My wife asked 4 times and was assured that our room was to be an oceanfront, Well when we got our keys we had an oceanview. We went back down to the lobby and explained the issue. We were told that all of the oceanfronts were booked. We said that we did not get what we were to pay for. the rep was so understanding and after working on the issue for over a half hour she upgraded us to a suite even though it too was an oceanview. We settled for the upgrade with the lesser view because the rep went out of her way to make us happy. In this day and age you don't usually receive that kind of service and we were impressed. Overall for the price we were very pleased with the property and the service and cannot wait to go back in the fall. If you can overlook some astetics it is a great property to stay at.

It was AWFUL!!! The room decor itself, is not bad. You can tell it has been updated, and looks nice. The room we booked looked MUCH bigger online. It is not enough space for 2 adults and 2 kids. We had a room with 2 double beds (which was supposed to be queen size beds), an ocean view, with balcony. No kitchenette. Well, there was NO SPACE to put our luggage anywhere! We had to stack it up on a small table and dig through/ rearrange suitcases anytime we needed anything out of the suitcases! The bathroom was SO TINY, when you were sitting on the toilet, your legs were practically touching the bathtub, AND the bathroom door was so warped, it wouldn't close! Not very private! The shower was gross...you could see mildew. The room was very cramped, maybe would have been better/ more comfortable with just 2 people. The \"ocean view\" (that I paid extra for) was a joke! You could go out on the balcony and crane your neck around while standing in the far corner of the balcony, and get a glimpse of the ocean. What we did have a good view of was the hotel next door, their balconies, and the people on them! Also, from the outside looking up, the exterior near the balconies was crumbling in some areas and did not look safe at all! The corridor/ area outside of our room REEKED like sewage. It was sooo disgusting! You couldn't smell it in the room itself, but as soon as you opened the door, the smell hit you right in the face. The stairs are not lit up whatsoever at night....huge safety issue there! The elevators are old and slow...and look nasty inside! The lobby/ breakfast area is not air conditioned very well...I think they are trying, but eating your breakfast or trying to check in with sweat dripping down your face is not appealing. The manager was very condescending. The breakfast WAS good, and that is the only positive about this place! The parking is a NIGHTMARE!!! Seriously! We left around supper time to get some food and see some sights, when we came back, there weren't ANY spots left on the hotel grounds. The parking is VERY TIGHT to begin with, so when you turn in to park, in the dark, in a poorly lit lot, and you go down the row trying to find a spot and 2 or 3 people turn in right behind you, you are then blocked in until everyone backs out, as there is not any space to turn around. My husband (along with about 6 other angry hotel guests) had to go to the front desk and ask where to park. We were told that overflow parking was across the street at a pizza place. We pulled over there, and I wasn't sure what to do! We then saw a handwritten note posted in the window of the pizza place stating that hotel guests could park there after 11:00pm.....We had been sitting in the parking lot discussing what we should do for about 10min, before seeing that sign. I looked at the clock and it was 11:01....so, before that, if we had wanted to go to our room , we wouldn't have had a place to park our vehicle!! Yes, that place is also next to a strip club....NOT my idea of safe OR family friendly. I was nervous all night about our vehicle being over there, and my husband moved it first thing in the morning, as soon as a space opened up on hotel grounds. There were people (college aged?) blocking the corridor at night, and wouldn't let my husband pass by. They had the door to their room open, packed with people, and appeared to be having a party. The corridors are VERY dimly lit, so we didn't really feel too safe. Needless to say, we were supposed to stay here several nights, but only stayed one night, checked out, and went down the road to the Holiday Inn Express. MUCH, MUCH BETTER!!! I will only stay at the Holiday Inn Express if we go back to Daytona Beach Shores. It was night and day compared to this place!! VERY spacious rooms, PLENTY of space for luggage and spreading out, ALL rooms have a REAL ocean view, balconies are much safer and nicer, the beach in front of their hotel is nicer, free breakfast, EXTREMELY CLEAN, and friendly staff! Definitely pay the extra money to stay there...you WON'T be disappointed.

I honestly can not understand the problems the lady below this review who stayed during the same time frame. Our room was a family suite which is 2 queen beds and a bath in the front room with the kitchenette and balcony and a 2nd private bedroom with a king and a bath. The renovations are very noticeable to those of us that have been coming for over 10 years. The rooms are very nice and the new bedding is amazing. New mattresses makes a hard day of sightseeing a pleasure. We were at the pool and it was not murky, even slightly. Even from our balcony on the 5th floor you could see the bottom of the pool, it was that clean. All the balconies have been redone and the air conditioners don't drain on them any more. Speaking of the air, it was always nice and cold. The water draining onto the steps she is referring to that leads to the beach is water from the shower at the top of the steps thats used to rinse off before going to the pool. As for the dog not being allowed around the pool, they have never allowed it, not any of the previous owners. Folks do bring drinks to the pool but they can not be in glass containers. I would much rather see a can next to the pool than a big pile of dog poo. I have nothing against bringing pets, thats one reason we keep coming to this hotel. We traveled with our dog until 2 years ago when she died. We now travel with our kitty who was with us on this trip. Now the hotel is far from perfect. My 2 biggest complaints is the parking and we had to keep getting our room keys recharged at the front desk because the would stop working every other day. Yes that is an extreme pain in the butt. Parking can be a major headache because if all the spots are taken you do have to park across the street at a pizza place. And yes it is next to a gentlemen's club. We have parked over there several times, and nothing has happened. Our cars were fine. But again, yes its a bit of a pain. But most hotels in Daytona do have lousy parking. Most of it is very tight. That is the biggest complaints I have. This hotel offers a very nice breakfast for free. It has everything from waffles (you make them fresh yourself) to sausage, gravy, cereals, pastries, biscuits and assorted juices. A nice way to start your morning. The pool is very large and warm. There's a lot of lounge chairs and a few umbrellas and tables. The rooms are very clean with new carpet, beds, fridges, flat screen tvs, couches and table and chairs. There is new paint every where. They have renovated the elevators and they actually run smooth and quick now. We were honestly surprised at how much better the hotel is looking since last year. Last year it was falling down around us. We are looking forward to returning next year. I will agree with her on one point, the manager. He can be condescending and at times seem very passive aggressive. He forces you to talk to him but the niceness comes across a bit fake. But if the keys, parking, and not meshing with the manager is the worst thing about this hotel, I'll keep coming back. We had a wonderful vacation and that was in part due to the hotel itself.

First I go back to the front desk where I am told they are queen beds like I was too stupid to know the difference. I go back and talk to my husband who was talking to a housekeeper and he told me the housekeeper let him see the beds next door and the beds were bigger. I went back and talked to the manager, Bill? He kept telling me they were queens and I told him I had a queen at home and that wasn't a queen. I guess he has never had any cust omer relations training because he argued with me til he finally agreed to change our room to the one my husband looked at. The room was o.k. The hotel is suppose to be remodeled but it only the carpet and paint. Our cover on one of the beds had something brown on it so I gave it to the housekeeper and used our own. My daughter brought our dog and after taking him to Potty she came to talk to us at the pool and Bill came up to her and told her the sign said no dogs by the pool but I guess that's the only rule they follow because a guy was drinking beer on the pool side and it clearly states no food or drink on pool deck not to mention the pool hours are 6 to 10 but people swan whenever they wanted, mostly kids whose parents wanted them out of their hair so they send them to the pool to tear things up. The grounds were nasty!!!!! Everywhere you turned there were cigarette butts. Or dirty water and mold. The pool was murky. The beach in front of the hotel was gross with nasty water dropping from the deck as you walk down the stairs, the area in front of our balcony smelled so bad at times it almost made me sick. It looked like the sewer was backing up. The absolute worse part of our stay was the shower! It was disgusting! Black mold, the lower part of the shower must have gotten busted so they just patched it and it was moldy! If you go to the trouble of saying you remodeled then by all means replace all those nasty bath tubs and shower stalls! I also had no storage to put my clothes. We lived out of our suitcase because we let our daughter have the only 3 drawers. The parking is pitiful.

After reading that the hotel's rooms were renovated in June 2012, I decided to give it a shot. I am glad we did! The hotel is old, it's obvious. And the lobby is currently being renovated so that may be a turn off for some people. The room price was right so it didn't bother me. The rooms are gorgeous, a very nice surprise. Modern furnishings, bedding, artwork. New paint on the walls, new carpet on the floors. Brand new, upgraded sheets and towels. Granite countertops in the bathroom. Fantastic water pressure (a huge plus) with a fancy shower head where you can pick your favorite water flow. Comfy beds. An added bonus: microwave, fridge & a nice flat screen tv. Minor detail but I will mention it anyway...I hate hotel toiletries because they usually leave my hair and skin dry but the toiletries here must be of a better quality-the lotion and shampoo are very moisturizing. I didn't even have to pull out my stuff! The pool is pretty nice although a little small. The lounge chairs are nice-very sturdy and the lay all the way down-I love that kind! Easy access to the beach and beautiful views of the ocean can be seen from the pool. Free \"hot\" breakfast buffet! The staff is very nice and polite. Especially the lady at the front desk. Their check-in time is 4pm but she let us check-in at 11. She recommended several restaraunts to us for lunch since we had never been to the area. Final verdict: While I think this place is still a work in progress, based on the new rooms, I think it will be beautiful once they are done with the renovation. If you don't mind that everything is not \"done\" yet, I think you will love the room and very much enjoy your stay here in Daytona :).", "Date": "July 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tallahassee, Florida, United States", "Title": "\u201cAmazing place!!\u201d", "Author": "Chris D", "ReviewID": "UR133941201", "Content": "Me and my family stayed here for the Coke Zero 400, a NASCAR race.

No chairs for beach, but you can rent them and an umbrella for $30 for the day! Beach was awesome. Hallways very dirty, hotel needs painting.

The room was VERY LARGE with 2 Q beds and a kitchen which had been recently remodeled. It was VERY clean with new carpet and bedding. The professional pictures are very accurate to the look of the room in which we stayed. From our room we could walked right out by the pool and down to the ocean without using the elevator. The pool and pool area were well maintained. You could tell they were still renovating the balconies and outside areas (paint and doors) but the pool area was fine.

While I definitely wouldn't suggest that someone not stay here, I would offer a caveat or two. Know that if you stay here in the summer of 2012 or read a review of anything prior to that you're reading about a very different hotel, as massive renovations took place and continue to take place. The parts of the hotel that are finished have been done well: new beds and bedding, new carpet, new bathrooms, new granite in the kitchens, and new balconies. During our week-long stay we saw a good deal of finish work completed, including the facade of the elevators and installation of dining room carpet. Upon completion the grounds will need plenty of attention, as it appears not ignored, but on the back burner due to the construction. The constant mess that is a complete overhaul has taken it's toll on the parking lot and sidewalks. The rooms are nice, but what separates The Lexington is it's staff and it's rates. While the rates will justifiably increase upon completion, the staff makes each guest feel like the only guest, and that was held true from the managing partner all the way through his employees. Everyone was very pleasant, even with some of the trouble we had. Our only mishap was with the door keys - we must have made literally ten trips up and down the stairs when we would return to our room needing a new key because the old locks still needed to be replaced. That did become very annoying by trip's end, but in hindsight it was still well worth the money. If I return to Daytona Beach I will at least check the rates and the renovations purely due to the weirdest, friendliest hotel staff in Daytona Beach.", "Date": "July 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Summerfield, Florida, United States", "Title": "\u201cAwesome!!!\u201d", "Author": "Kristian W", "ReviewID": "UR132621675", "Content": "I knew about the renovations ahead of time so I was worried what we were going to see and it was amazing.

My other little girl was really impressed by her own bed too. The breakfast was the best out of the best!!! Scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, sausage, different breads and pastries, plus much much more.
