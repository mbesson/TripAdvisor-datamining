I went with my boyfriend, and both being university students, we were on a very tight budget. I was a little nervous about bedbugs, the cleanliness, and the neighbourhood because of reviews that I read before going. However, the room was very clean, there were no bedbugs, and I had no problems with the neighbourhood. We got a standard room, which included a bathroom, which was very nice and clean. It came with towels and soap and whatnot. The only thing I was slightly disappointed in was that the hotel room description said there would be an iron, a hairdryer, a mini-fridge, etc. and it had none of those things. I think they were available upon request though. The breakfast cafe on the main floor of the hotel was delightful. The food was amazing, fast service, and inexpensive. The hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating to all of our needs. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is on a tight budget and doesn't mind an older room.

Hooks on the wall were an added bonus as I laid out work clothes in advance on them. My window was huge enough that I spent most nights sitting in the window sill people watching and just enjoying the night. We had a shared bathroom but there was never an issue with that. It was always clean and available (two per floor). Yes, the neighbourhood is a bit sketchy, but I knew that in advance as I research cities that I stay in. I still, as a solo woman traveller, was comfortable coming back from the Metro (SO close!!) every night after dark and leaving before 7am for work. Try the breakfast in the small kitchen area on the main floor - the people are amazing, the prices are good, and the food was a great start to the day.

This hotel left a sour taste in my mouth. It broke my heart to see my partner with a tear in her eye when she realized this was what we would call home for the remainder of our Montreal outing. In summary the room was small, the bathrooms were dirty, the neighborhood was unsafe, and the price was much too high. It is like living in an old University dorm. Location was mostly poor. Although in downtown, it was on a decaying end of Saint Catherine street. There are sex shops around, which doesn't really bother me, but the hookers across the street, and the drug deals taking place absolutely were. A lot of bad business would go on throughout the night, which resulted in little to no sleep. I would frequently have to trudge through screaming individuals to get to the hotel. The pictures of the rooms on hotel villas website seemed decent enough so I opted for the shared bathroom accommodation. I was unaware that there is only one bathroom per floor. I'm unsure as to how many were using this bathroom, but it was frequently dirty and I decided to not shower during the trip once I notice the garbage can was in the tub. The bathrooms weren't nice and needed renovation work. As for the room itself, an exposed copper pipe dressed the ceiling and ended with scorch marks from an inplace weld. Apparently the owners do not have to time to clean a burned wall up, or at least paint over it. Service was good, we didn't ask for anything demanding or out of the ordinary so I just gave the hotel an average rating. The hotel had a policy of 11pm quiet hours, but those were not enforced.

It is affordable and (you need to ask for one) you can have your own bathroom w/ shower. It was $69.00 for one night, which is very affordable. It is in the Red Light District of Monteal (St. Catherine street) so you are going to see your share of various people. Let me tell from first hand experience, no one is waiting outside this hotel with handguns or waving knifes at you. Yes, even at 3am when I returned almost every night. People, listen, there are good parts and bad parts of every city. With nightclubs and strip joints very close to this hotel, what would you expect to find? How ever you answer that is what is probably going to be the case. I will give you younger people some advice, mind your p's and q's (Your own business if you don't get that.) and you will be just fine. If you obnoxious after drinking or like to make comments at people you don't know, then you may just find trouble. So keep your comments to yourself until you are home or safe in yoru hotel room. Seriously, it is a nice hotel, the person working behind the counter (Van) was very nice and we chatted the few days I was there. I would go back in a minute (and Van, I am coming back in the summer.) and it is safe. People, listen up, it is not 1950 and you need to be careful where ever you go. Use your head, stay away from trouble and you will be just fine. However, if you want to be very secure, you can go to a Holiday Inn or Quality Inn (a little further away) and \"Lot\" more expensive, say to the tune of $200 a night. Now, I don't know about you, but for me, I am not going to pay $200 a night for a hotel I will be in mainly to sleep and shower while vacationing! If you are a single person on a trip or a couple looking to save money, this is the hotel for you. If you want a room with a bathroom and shower, make sure you ask for one when you are making a reservation. I hear people complaining about them not getting this or that when they reserve something and usually it's because they weren't paying attention to what was included with the reservation. Hope you find this useful. P.S. I just want to clarify something. Canadians do not hate Americans. They hate obnoxious people, like Americans do as well. Actually, in the stores and places I went, the staff was friendlier to me there than in my own country. Yeah, that would be the United States! Oh, and if you are traveling by bus, prepare to get off of it at the border, be polite and follow instructions (Have the proper documentation, Passport, Passcard or Enhanced Driver's License. (You need to go to Montpelier if you live in Vermont, and get this. The enhanced license that is. As of June 2009 your old driver's license and birth certificate will not do. Do not be stupid and find this out as you get to the border! ) and you will be just fine. Be rude, and you can expect to not get through or go to one of the rooms they have at the border station made for those kind of people. For the record, the Amercan side, coming back in, is where they can be rude. Be ready for it. Way different than if you are just driving through with your own vehicle.

Walking in the room was like going into a slum apartment in NYC, and you are expected to pay upfront-- probably so you feel locked into staying there rather than fight for your money back. Private bathrooms are optional and we chose a room that had one. It looked fairly clean, but the light switch also turns on the fan which sounded like a small plane taking off. The air conditioner that was in the window was 1/2 the size of what it should have been and the open parts of the window were not covered.

We showed up and the place was completely unacceptable and not at all what was presented on their website. After some more fighting, he refunded all but one day (which I'm currently disputing with my credit card company since we did not cancel, but left because it was disgusting).
