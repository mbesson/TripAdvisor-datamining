Tired and in need of a shower we were hoping the front desk would be accommodating and allow us to either pay for an early check in or a room that was already made. No such luck. The guy at the front desk told us none of the rooms were ready and that the hotel was full from the previous night.we were advised we could come back at around 1300 to see if the room would be ready then. So we asked where we could go to freshen up - level 3. Well they were not in the best condition. Overflowing bins, hairs everywhere. We had booked a room with shared facilities..this was now being questioned if this was such a good idea. Back at the hotel, room was still not ready!!!! We then enquired about a room upgrade with an en suite. We paid the extra $55 per night as I really did not want to encounter the mornings shared facilities on a daily basis. Ask for a high floor we were on level 8 and it was quiet, we could not hear anything from neighbouring rooms. The rooms are basic but for a city you really only need the bed! Room was cleaned daily and all towels sheets were clean. Small amenities are supplied such as soap shower gel etc if you have forgotten anything. Dont know if this applies to rooms without en suite. Breakfast is brilliant. Cereal choices are good then toast and croissants. You can pay for a hot breakfast but the cereal was enough. The hotel is a great location. Nearest train stop is museum. However we prefered to walk through Hyde park to the harbour bridge it's about 20mins walk. Then 20mins to darling harbour. The 333 bus route can take you direct to bondi beach (it's ore paid only bus route but you can get the bus tickets from the 7 eleven on the corner) if you need info the front desk is more than helpful if you want no fuss no frills this hotel is perfect.

As this is more of a budget hotel I'm not sure if they are supposed to. I understand that vacuming the floor isn't easy with alot of luggage lying around, but our sink and shower showed no evidence of ever being cleaned the whole week. The staff (except the cleaning lady) was very nice and understanding especially the one night our little one had trouble sleeping and did unfortunately cry for a bit. Scary lady next door was not though. Thankfully she was moved/or moved om voluntarily. Breakfast selection was basic, but good, we chose to upgrade it for 5$ per person most days. Location is superb!! Very close to both Town Hall and Museum station, pluss within short walking distance to William st, where you can find several car rentals. Also short distances to pretty much everything in the CBD area and Darlinghurst, King Cross and Surrey Hills. We would recommend this to pretty much everyone, although the walls are a bit thin so bring ear plugs if you're a light sleeper. Most would probably not bring a baby, but we could hear our neighbours pretty well, as they unfortunately could hear us. Studio room did not feel cramped as a lot of other people say about the other rooms. Great budget choice, with superb location.

There were complimentary newspapers every day. Internet access could be purchased for $10 for 24 hours or $3 for 15 minutes.

I did much research for our trip so I can hopefully provide some insight to assist others. PROS It is a very close uphill walk from the Museum subway station. Free breakfast is included each morning. They offer cereal, juice, assorted breads and coffee for free. Anything else must be purchased. We got a shared facility room. Offered a different room (end unit) when the first room had a sliding door that did not lock. We lucked out because the new room was much bigger with a table and two chairs. Flat screen TV, with assorted Australian channels. Fridge was included (even though it was in bad shape) and served to keep water and other things cold. Internet use is not included, must pay a by minute fee. I believe it was 1 dollar for 15 minutes of time. Offers airport shuttle for $28 AU dollars for two people. Using the subway from the international terminal will run you about $31.40 AU dollars for two people. So a bit of savings. Many places to eat of all variety to eat around the hotel. CONS The first room we got was tiny and a few others we saw were tiny. The bathrooms are not clean. On my floor (8th) the same dirty toilets were the same each day....dirty. The sinks were dirty. The showers were dirty. The male facility had two toilets and one shower. I had to wait for the shower for about 45 minutes. The staff was fine, but a few were rude when we asked questions. The sheets on the bed were dirty with hair on the sheets and comforter. The room keys often would stop working so we had to go to the office to get them working again. TIPS: The FREE shuttle is Bus 555. Runs until 3:30pm except on Thursdays where it runs to 9:30pm. This bus stop is just left down Liverpool St. near the subway station and will take you in a loop and up to Circular Quay (Sydney Harbor, Sydney Opera House) for free. The 380 or 333 bus will take you to Bondi Beach. You can buy bus tickets from the stores near the bus stops. Overall, I will recommend, but only if you get a room with your own restroom.

The bed was comfortable and we had some good nights sleep there, however the service from the front desk was appalling at times. It seemed that we had problem after problem. My cousin called the hotel and said that she left a message with reception for us, but we never got it, despite checking regularly with them. We then made use of the laundry and were told the wrong price and also the wrong length of time that the dryer takes so we ended up setting it off shortly before the laundry closed. Luckily no one came to close it! The third problem we had with them was that they didn't have a clue how much the calls cost from the room and we had to wait ages while they called the phone company to ask. The fourth problem was that my husband's pyjamas went missing! He left them on the bed and when we came back in the evening they were missing. We asked about it and nothing had been handed in. Lastly the hotel itself does not provide free wifi and the basic breakfast is very basic. You have to pay $5 extra for a cooked one.

They stayed 19-26 August 2010, winter was finishing (no bed bugs yet, if any), in a double ensuite with third bed, wheelchair accessible (wasn't our need) They stayed as well for one other night on 1st Septemper always in a double ensuite, this time with no third bed. FIRST ROOM: very big, it is a double ensuite but hosts as well a third bed (which takes out some more room that could be needed to access the wardrobe but it's perfectly fine). Clean and tidy at arrival, on the second day the bed wasn't done properly (just pulled the blankets back up, without even replacing the quilt in the right position - it was almost only on one side when we left and we found it so) We noticed as well that the upper shelf inside the wardrobe wasn't clean at all, we just placed our luggage there so no problems but you could notice the black shadows after putting the suitcase on the white linen. Bed is confortable, electric plugs are right behind it (just follow the cable from the bedside lamp), one is inside the bathroom and there was another inside the wardrobe right next to the drawers. Maybe the curtains do not shade enough the light, the room doesn't face the sun directly but it is likely that you are woken up by the light coming in (if sensible to light like me at least, mum told me she woke up at 6.30am and thought the light was on). As well, since the room was above the road, they heard traffic noises, especially from ambulances who passed quite often. BATHROOM clean, the room is wheelchair accessible so no separation between shower and rest of the bathroom but good pavement system that prevented ponds to stay there :). Both shower, mirror and sink were at lower heights, still for the wheelchair access (unconfortable mostly for the shower which couldn't move up the structure). A bit unconfortable having the horizontal bar at the back of the WC, but the most inconvenient thing (and craziest I've seen so far) is the mirror placed on another wall then above the sink: how am I supposed to make up (if woman) or shave (if man) or wear contacts (either sex)?? You know, I usually wash my face right before (and in case of shaving, even after)... SECOND ROOM: much smaller than the first one, obviously, but still very wide to live in. Not being wheelchair accessible, bathroom was again much smaller but with things set higher (mirror, sink, toilet) and shower separated by a glass door. Mirror this time was above the sink ;) This one was facing the inside courtyard of the building, and was much quieter. I recommend trying to get one of these if you're very sensible to traffic sounds or you live in a very quiet place. ALL ROOMS are provided with fridge, safe and a kettle to make your own tea (teabags are also there). On the booklet it says you can have a hairdryer by leaving a refundable deposit at the reception but we found one in the drawers (some previous guests left it). Anyway, if you don't want to carry your hairdryer this migth help. BREAKFAST: continental breakfast provided consists in cereals, milk (cold), hot tea and hot coffee, jams, bread (to be toasted on a sort of open-oven which is veeeery slow to heat up things, much slower than a toaster anyway). There is an upgrade to a \"full breakfast\" available for 4.50$, I guess that includes bacon&eggs and alike 'cause we've seen people eating them; but we didn't feel the need to upgrade. KITCHEN: no real cooking facilities: you can heat up something already made, but do not expect to cook from scratch ;). It's on the 3rd floor and there is only a few cutleries, a microwave and tea/coffee/sugar to replace that in your room. Haven't seen the kettle, but might as well be there. The microwave can be used to enjoy the lunch available at the reception (6$ presenting your room key, in winter it's a soup and sandwich). CHECK-IN/OUT INFO: check in is usually after 1pm/2pm, especially if the rooms are still to be cleaned. Check-out must be done by 11am. In both cases the hotel has a locked room (opened by the receptionist on request) and some safe lockers to keep your luggage for the half day you may need, without any extra charge. NOTES: Environmentally-friendly contradiction: customers have the possibilities to not have the bed sheets changed (they would do it every 3rd day of your stay) by placing a certain card on the bed in the morning when they leave the room (card do be found next to the hotel textbook of instructions) and as well they can choose the towels not to be changed (don't know how often they would do it) by hanging them on the bathroom racks (otherwise, just leave them on the floor). As a contradiction, hand soap is changed each and every day even though it's just slightly used.", "Date": "September 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Schweiz", "Title": "\u201cLarge & Central\u201d", "Author": "sildenaviel", "ReviewID": "UR68991248", "Content": "Very large former hostel with small, quite basic rooms.

We solved that problem by requesting an additional blanket to cover it. Staff at the reception was very helpful in this regard (as they were with other requests we had, e.g. plates and cutlery for self catering). We had one single bathroom (shower, toilet) for disabled directly on our door step and other shared facilities reasonably close by. Overall very clean. Towels were changed daily. We were happy with the continental breakfast. Everything that one would expect from a continental breakfast with a really good choice of cereals, toast and jam, coffee/tea and even pain au chocolat. We had read mixed reviews on this hotel/hostel before and had kept our expectations low. With that as a starting point we were happy and we would stay again at this place.

It was very easy to access and not far at all from the airport. It was easy access to get to the Opera House and Sydney harbour, an only 15 minute walk. As well a free bus service was offered with the stop just outside of the door of the hotel. Very easy access to Hyde Park, as well several food stores and eating places within easy walking distance of the hotel. The hotel itself was quite basic but good. It had a good check in process. As I was early, they did offer a luggage storage area. Then later in the afternoon, I had quick check in and good run down of the area. Easy access to get to my room and the elevator worked very well. Room was very basic, but the price was right for what one would be getting. It was funny how the TV was located in the closet and I had to watch it sideways from the bed, otherwise ok. Had a good selection of coffee and tea with a nice water kettle. Bathroom was good size and provided a good hot shower on demand and very good. Plenty of clean white towels were provided as well on the stay. Not much of a view from outside of the window, but that was ok. As well, the hotel provided a decent included breakfast every morning. From toast and cereal, as well plenty of coffee and juices, very nice. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for anyone on a budget who wants to be near downtown Sydney and have easy access to the Harbour, but are not afraid to walk there.

The shared bathroom was very clean and we rarely saw anyone else in it so felt very comfortable in there. The location on Hyde Park is great, a few restaurants and a 7/11 are close by. Darling Harbour is just 10 mins walk and the Opera House about 15-20 mins. The included breakfast was decent with a large bowl of cereal, toast and juice/ coffee, setting us up well enough for the day. The reception staff were helpful and we had no problems leaving our luggage in the store room on the final day, then coming back and using the bathrooms before heading off to the airport. Based on price alone, I would recommend here anyway - but additionally it is certainly a comfortable, well-located base from which to explore Sydney.", "Date": "January 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sheffield, UK", "Title": "\u201cGood location, value for money and clean.\u201d", "Author": "KennyM83", "ReviewID": "UR20362177", "Content": "When we planned our backpacking trip of Australia in 2006 we expected that some of the places we would turn out to be actually not very nice, however, almost without exception, the places we ended up staying were extremely pleasing.

The 'free' breakfast was adequate and we just bought extras from the very nearby supermarket to make it more interesting. Cooked is available at very reasonable extra cost. The hotel is so well located, it would be had to imagine a better location, especially if, like us, you want to walk everywhere! All the main sites were within a 15 minute walk.

My girlfriend and I stayed at the Y on the Park in October during an extended holiday where economising with accomodation was important and chose the Y after extensively researching hotel options in Sydney. Located on the southeastern corner of Hyde Park, the place is ideally located for exploring Sydney and the surrounding area - a nice 10-15 minute walk to the opera house and harbour via the park, 5 minutes to George Street and shopping district, 10 minutes to Darling Harbour, and 2 minutes to an underground station (15 minutes to airport). The Y offers various rooms to suit any budget and need, though, with that said, it probably is not worth staying in anything more than a Traditional Room (communal bathrooms) - we found the AU$90 a night to be the value-line between the Y and a normal hotel. The Y has a nice feel to it, but it is a budget hotel. Our Traditional Room was well outfitted (TV in the closet, safe, iron, tea kettle), but very dusty and unclean - we had to request cleaning service twice during our 4 night stay. Likewise, the duvet and sheets had seen there day. The staff were relatively helpful, though seemed put-out by our request for a clean room.
