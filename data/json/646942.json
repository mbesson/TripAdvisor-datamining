{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Las Brisas not so tranquil Although you can't expect much from an $88. a night hotel, this was a disappointment. There was not even any linen available for the second bed. The hostess was rude. The water was cold. There is no breakfast or any ammenities. You get a roof over your head and little else. Staying here could ruin an otherwise beautiful stay. Also the location is terrible, right on a busy street where you can sit out on the balcony and observe heavy traffic. This is a motel, not a hotel.", "Date": "Nov 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR898370696", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Amelia333"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g147320-d646942-r10863232-Hotel_Las_Brisas_Del_Condado-San_Juan_Puerto_Rico.html", "HotelID": "646942", "Price": "$81"}}
