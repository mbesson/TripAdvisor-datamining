We upgraded our stay to an Executive Suite. I have to say, for the extra money it cost I wouldn't bother. Basically all it does is get you a living room area and a continental breakfast. The bathroom was still small just like the regular rooms (I think when your check out bill for one night is $350 the bathroom for a suite should be a little more impressive). Also, I can't believe that a suite didn't have a refrigerator??? Our only other complaint, other than the size of the bathroom, was the \"Starwood Breakfast\" experience. We walked in and only about half the tables were occupied. But the remaining tables that were open were all dirty. And, basically remained dirty with other people's dishes, etc. for the entire time we dined as well. I will say the young man that was working the room was extremely well mannered and well spoken---a great employee. However, he was obviously frazzled trying to keep all the breakfast items stocked as well as trying to keep tables turned over. It really needs two people working it. One to keep the tables clean and turned over quickly as it really is a small room for the amount of people that come through there every day, and one person to keep all the food/beverage items stocked. It's definitely too much to expect one person to manage everything. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay here and obviously the management takes pride in trying to keep their guests accommodated and coming back for future visits...", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milton, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cWonderful people WORKING in the hotel!

I was so happy with the experience I had before that I was confident enough to bring my best friend along to stay who had sadly lost his mother recently as a break away trip. We arrived at the hotel and firstly delighted that the hotel has no issue or snobbery about people paying in cash for the duration of their stay provided we either pay for incidentals in advance or guarantee them with a credit card, it was quite a funny moment when with the front desk we were sure we were only staying 9 nights and the concierge said our stay was 10 nights a thrilling game of 3 people counting nights and days on our fingers began (It was our jet lag in the end and we had booked 10 nights). We were given a lovely room on the second floor which at first I was apprehensive about, usually higher the better for me, but my friend LOVED, I mean LOVED the room, centrally overlooked the pool, a wonderful little balcony and easy access to the lobby, pool and dining area. I was actually active this time in wondering how good the room would be on my second trip and to give credit where it is due, the room was SPOTLESS, I ran my hand on lamps, top of frames, furniture, it really is clean. We had two huge beds, which were fresh as a spring meadow.....(after an 11 hour flight ........ just what you want). I did suddenly realise that the bracing bar and internal lock on the outside balcony window was broken, went to reception and an engineer with his trolley was there almost immediately and fixed it within 10 minutes and apologised for the lock not working. With our room deal we were allowed in the club lounge that serves breakfast and hors d'oeuvres, and is served in the club lounge on the 9th floor, the breakfast is continental but we were kindly informed that we could eat in the california restaurant downstairs for breakfast and if we wanted the hot items (scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, hot porridge) we just pay an upgrade of $8, which we found worked great for us as some days you feel like a whole big breakfast, some days not. The hors d'oeuvres served upstairs have a hot dish of some breadcrumbed vegetables or chicken wings but with complimetary soft drinks and nice snacky food (celery, carrots, dips) my healthy eating for the trip! :) Housekeeping was great every day, and made the room up delightfully even though we were quite messy with food and clothes. The reason I like this hotel is the flow and layout, its very nice and bright inside and even though there were 3 conferences there, it was a nice busy not a chaotic busy, I never saw anyone ever complaining at the front desk and generally everyone seemed happy, I think \"THE VOICE\" contestants or some people related to the show are staying there, and on several nights the hotel is sold out, as 3 people were turned away whilst I was drinking at the bar. The location is wonderful for Universal CityWalk and if you want to kill the walk, its best to walk over to the lifts across the courtyard and go over to the Hilton as that also takes you through a Koi Pond and a beautiful landscaped and lit up area outside their Sierra Ballroom, walk past that and its then just a hop across the street to CityWalk. I had one important meeting at the hotel which soon descended into laughs and informal drinks, which is a big plus here, you can have a formal dinner to a drink by the pool and the hotel lends itself well to its different areas of dining and socialising. The pool area is lovely, I was nicely surprised that the water uses as little chlorine as possible so you dont get that \"pool\" smell, there isnt a pool service as someone waiting on you hand and foot, but the restaurant is right next to it and would bring you out whatever you ordered. Another major plus is that it is open 24 hours a day so a late night swim or jacuzzi is always an option which is very nice as both are lit up. Its a strange thing to rave about but their computer centre, is a lovely warm and bright workspace right round the corner and a great place where people are meeting as well as doing work, unlike other hotels, it is not held behind bulletproof glass and 70 combination locks in some dreary corner of the hotel, instead its big open desks that produce a lovely working enviroment at any time of day or night and there is a big TV adjacent to watch the news and sports. One lady was moaning there was no scanner but had just printed (FOR FREE) all her papers, yes FREE printing!!! Yes they dont have a scanner, but in this lady eyes the hotel also fails on points for not having a direct link to the International Space Station or having Shamu the Whale in the outdoor pool. As long as the rates stay the same and I get the same level of service, I would go to this hotel again, cant fault.

Evening drinks in the lounge (just mom and dad of course) was terrific and the staff again was very social and fun. Business center was state of the art and even the hotel wifi worked well. The rooms were clean, beds very comfortable, and I loved the shower head so much I am changing mine at home. A special shout out to one of the front desk managers, Sam. She took great care of us and made us feel like we were more important than anyone else. I found it impressive because in a property that boasts high turnover day to day it takes a dedicated team member to make people feel that way in such a short time frame.

We had a lot to celebrate and wanted our vacation to be as memorable and perfect as possible. My husband and I were celebrating our up and coming 32 year anniversary and our children's excellent achievement in school. We knew nothing about Los Angeles and spent weeks looking over trip advisor reviews, location, convenience, and cost; a very daunting task. We finally chose the Sheraton Universal Hotel for the location, which was walking distance from Universal Studios. The photos of the hotel were very appealing. The hotel had all of the amenities that we were looking for and the price was very reasonable. When we arrived at the hotel, we were overwhelmed with the beauty of the front lobby. Everything from the gorgeous orchids, the comfortable and beautifully decorated lounge/bar to the wonderful scent, too beautiful not to notice, that filled the lobby. Check in was a breeze and after mentioning that we had been travelling for 12 hours, the gentleman at the front desk did not hesitate to provide us with complimentary beverages. The rooms were perfectly sized and the queen beds were the most comfortable hotel beds that we have ever encountered. The linens were divine, especially the duvet. We really appreciated the complimentary toiletries in the bathroom, especially the bath sponges, Q-tips, nail file and cotton balls. Our family took full advantage of the exercise room, with all of its toning and cardio machines and the beautiful outdoor pool and hot tub. The one area of hospitality that this hotel offered over any other is their housekeeping option. For every day that you chose not to have your room cleaned, you were given a $5.00 voucher that could be used for food/drinks (non alcoholic) anywhere in the hotel, including room service. We saved up our vouchers and ordered room service one evening. The pancakes and cheesecake were excellent and all free with our vouchers!! Honestly, I cannot say enough about this hotel; I could go on and on. The hotel and the staff were AMAZING and SECOND TO NONE. The staff, every single one of them from concierge to housekeeping were simply the best. The employees were so friendly and helpful. We were actually overwhelmed at how friendly and helpful they were and the attention that they applied to every detail of our trip. THE SERVICE IS SIMPLY INCOMPARABLE!!! My advice..... stay at the Sheraton Universal. Don't look anywhere else because there is nothing better. Whether you have small children or teenagers, this hotel and its staff will ensure that your stay is the very best.

On arrival at the room the main thing we noticed was the noise from the freeway outside the balcony (not sure why you would ever want to sit on it and overlook the traffic). The problem was that the glass patio window was not airtight and not at all soundproofed so the noise from the freeway was loud at all times. We phoned back to reception and asked if there was an alternative room availiable. We were told that no, the whole hotel was fully booked out. We were also told that we should be grateful for having the balcony as people who were higher up were always complaining it was too hot and the air conditioning did not work - at least we were able to cool the room down via the badly fitting windows.

Firstly, to get to the room, one has to go up some 4-5 steps or so- there are no elevators to go to this part of the hotel- not good if you have some heavy luggages. Upon entering the room, we noted the carpet was stained in several areas (see pic). We then realized the wood panel on the door frame to the toilet was almost falling off (see pic). We went back to reception to ask for a different room but was told there were no other rooms available that were equivalent to the price of the room we paid. We were offered a room without a balcony but there will be no refund or upgrades. The receptionist went to speak with his supervisor and came back with nothing except the reassurance that his supervisor will follow up with us; of course no one followed up during our 2 night stay! The parking is shabby not attached to the hotel, you have to walk across a lane to the hotel for $15/night and the parking elevator smelt of urine. Room comes with 3 towels- there were 4 of us (2 kids) and so we asked housekeeping for more towels- they were prompt and brought us 4 extra towels but unfortunately 3 out of 4 towels were heavily stained (see pics).

We took the 217 bus from there to Farmers Market, The Forum, and CBS studios for a taping of a late night TV show. The hotel room itself was average with a small bathroom. I also noticed the fan in the closet another guest mentioned. We stayed during the winter and were looking for another blanket. We called guest services who called maintenance to get the heat turned on. After that all was fine. We did the old trick of filling up the ice bucket with water to keep the room comfortable. There was several children next door and we heard them through the walls. We just turned up the TV to drown them out. We skipped room cleaning one day to earn a 500 points credit. We cashed in our points to pay for the room so all in all I can't complain. Other rooms in the chain had a high school across the street or a noisy night club.

It is walking distance from Universal Studios - LA and City walk. There is a free shuttle service through out the day if you don't want to walk. Standard rooms are very basic, but the bed was comfortable. If you want to spend much time in your hotel room , I advice you to go for an upgrade, as the rooms are small in size. We were one couple so the size of the room was acceptable and we didn't spend anytime in the room except when we wanted to shower or sleep. There is no minibar or fridge for standard room so if you are planning to buy stuff that needs a fridge think twice. We bought chips and biscuits for snacks. The parking is 18 US$ per day but you can go in and out as much as you like. So include that in your budget if you are renting a car. I would advice you to rent a car in LA as the taxis are bit pricey. Hotel lobby is very nice and clean, staff are friendly. The 45 minutes free internet at the lobby for guests are very useful and you can use printers to print boarding passes or tickets for free. We used to check tripadvisor for local attractions nearby and plan our day. There is internet in the room with a fee. Breakfast was around 22 US$ open buffet but limited, however you don't need more than scrambled eggs, bacon, pastries , french toast, fruit salad, hash browns to start your day. I suggest you walk to city walk mall for breakfast if you are an early riser since shuttles start at around 9 am. In conclusion, if you are planning a trip to LA and your main goal is to visit Universal studios and spend most of your time there I highly recommend the hotel. .", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cCrowded and a bit noisy, but clean,fun and a great value!\u201d", "Author": "cynthia555", "ReviewID": "UR118934377", "Content": "Nothing can beat this location if one is headed to Universal Studios and the whole tourist thing in LA.

We ordered room service which was 15 minutes late, and we were in a hurry that morning (the whole reason we ordered room service) . Very overpriced.. Which I know room service is pricey, but when ordering a bagel I expected better quality, maybe costco sized bagel for $6. Not a tiny stail thomas bagel.. not even garnish on the plate, kind of shocking. And a side of hashbrowns for $6 that was smaller then the palm of my hand.. Also, it says on their website rooms have refridgerators, They do NOT! we didnt use the pool or hot tub, but the main reason we didnt is because the hot tub looked somewhat green from our room view. We also had a view of Vivid Entertainment studios (porn production company) LOL.. I must mention the positive points of our stay also! It was the PERFECT location for the reason we came to the area. If you are going to attend tapings to any tv shows its very close to all of the studios, LOVE that! I wish I knew the name of the guy sho checked us in .

You couldn't open the door if someone was sitting down. I could hear the sounds of other guests through the walls at times, but I think that is somewhat normal when you're in a hotel. Overall, the room was clean and perfectly fine for my trip. I would stay here again.

We loved every second of it. The entire staff was excellent and really went out of their way to make us feel welcome. The maid said hello to us every morning and made small conversations. The concierge was great. He worked efficiently, but also provided each guest with the attention that they deserved. The people at the front desk were super friendly and helpful upon our arrival. The waiter during happy hour kept our snacks full and our drinks replenished. Our room was very comfortable and had everything that I would expect in a hotel room. Yeah, the bathroom was a little small, but I'd rather have space in the room than have the bathroom take up space. The view was also wonderful. We were on the 16th floor, so we got a nice view of the pool and of the surrounding scenery. I'm not sure what they do, but when you enter the lobby, it smells amazing. I loved breathing in when I walked in each time, as weird as that may sound. The location of the hotel was the best part. It is so close to Universal Studios and they offer a discount of 2 days for the price of 1. We took advantage of buying the tickets from the concierge, but didn't end up going the second day because we saw everything at the park (except for the Shrek 4D--we weren't interested in that) in just 8 hours. I suppose we could have gone back and done some things twice, but 8 hours was enough when you're in the sun and crowds, and we had other things we wanted to do while on vacation. We didn't take the free shuttle from the hotel because we were so close that we just walked. (Avoid doing this if you do not do well with hills.) This brought us to many entertainment options from movie theaters, a bowling alley, restaurants, shops, bars, etc. Anyone can find something to do and something they will like to eat at the City Walk area. We were also a super close drive to NBC Studios and Warner Bros. Studios. We went and saw the Tonight Show with Jay Leno and took a Warner Bros Studio Tour while we were there. Both were great experiences and extremely close to the hotel. The only complaint that we had was that the elevators were very slow. They were often over crowded because people didn't want to wait anymore. I think it was pretty normal to wait at least 5 minutes for an elevator. Being on the 16th floor, I wasn't about to take the stairs. The ride up was very uncomfortable when people overstuffed themselves into the small space. In the hotel's defense, there was some pageant going on during our stay as well as the Teen Choice Awards, so perhaps they were busier than normal and their elevators don't normally experience these types of delays? The parking also was a bit pricey. I mean come on, $18 a day for a piece of concrete? That was a little bit annoying, but I guess that's life.

I have experienced a wide range of service and issues during all 4 ownership changes and management at the hotel. Prior to the renovation was probably the best time period for this hotel. Management was great at that time. Presently over the past 12 month period I have stayed at the hotel about 6-8 different times. Current management is not what I would consider to be responsive or care about their customers. They offer comment cards but NEVER respond to issues. This is not a hotel for business travelers as the hotel does not cater to them. If you are on vacation then you are the perfect victim to the hotel as there is no timliness in their vocabulary. I met with the operations manager On one of my past trips and he assured me everything would be corrected. That was a lie. The hotel has no quality control - some examples arriving in the room and TV doesn't work or no shower curtain in bathroom or telephone never charged and not operating or light bulbs burned out and non operating. This is hotel management 101 and this hotel doesn't care. Other negatives include untimely delivery of room service breakfast when ordered the night before, not reading breakfast card to not include certain items because they cause extreme allergy and could cause medical emergency, high speed wireless is a joke, some rooms have air conditioning while others don't, gift shop hours vary depending on when they decide they want to close despite hours posted in hotel guide. Forget about enjoying the view frOm your room as it would appear windows have never been washed on the outside - only when it rains. The value charged for nightly accommodations increases during summer months when there are more tourists. The prices do not meet the value at this hotel.

Problem #1: Prior to our trip, I made several phone calls to this hotel to inquire about it's location and services in relation to our planned activities. I was told that this hotel was in walking distance and also had a shuttle available to where my son's daily workshop was held (Oakwood Complex--NYFA). This information was completely inaccurate. Upon arrival, I had to figure out transporation which was an added expense and an enormous concern/hassle beings the transporation was for a minor. We had to take cabs daily back and forth to his location which often times the location within the complex would change making it tricky for my son to accurately give the information to the cab service. One evening he had to wait 55 minutes for a pickup and it was 10:00 p.m. and remember he is a minor. Next HUGE problem, on the first day that we needed the cab service, the Sheraton had a cab pull up to their lobby for us. The cab was one which had a permit for the Sheraton location. We got into the cab and as the cab pulled around the fountain in the Sheraton drive, another cab driver stopped our driver and they started fighting, cursing and threatening to kill each other. This didn't stop. I tried to open the cab door on my side but the handle was broken. Then our cab driver screamed at us to get out and go with the other mother [...] cab driver. We jumped out of the cab and turned around to look at the valet employees of the Sheraton. They just shrugged. They did not help us out and we were in their driveway. I inquired prior to our trip about car rental services. I could have gotten a car prior to our trip for $450 for the week. During my several phone conversations with the Sheraton Hotel, the hotel information employee insisted that we wouldn't need a rental car to get my son to and from his daily workshop, I had given him the address and he insisted that he knew the location well. So, I did not arrange a rental car prior to our trip. Then, once we were at the hotel and discovered that a car would be needed, the hotel said we could get one for $55 a day. This was incorrect because all the rental company had available at that point was for $99 a day or a weekly charge of over $800. I did check online as well and the same held true. I also made several phone calls on my own and was given similar expensive quotes. This clearly was not in my budget. So, we were stuck with a cab and only rented a car for one day of travel. Problem #2: Our first night we arrived approximately at 10:00 p.m. The room we were given we were told was on the 2nd floor. We stopped to ask FOUR employees for assistance in finding our room. None of them knew how to get there!!!!! Our 2nd floor room when finally found was downstairs to what appeared to be a basement level. Very confusing!!! Since it's clearly after 10:30 p.m. now, we are tired and frustrated by the lack of knowledge by employees. The room was creepy because the lights kept flickering, The worst part of our first night was at 2:30 a.m., the alarm went off and told us to evacuate the building. We hurridly got dressed, went out in the hall, and only saw one other family on our floor. Our two families were not able to locate an exit to lead us directly out of the building. We finally found our way to the inside of the pool. At this point, we found a housekeeping person. We asked what to do and they casually said it was a false alarm and we could go back to the room. At no time, was there an announcement that all was clear for people in the hotel. Problem # 3: On our second day, I requested to be moved to a different room. We moved to the 15th floor. At 1:45 a.m. that night, an alarm went off again to tell us to evacuate the building for an emergency. This alarm went off for 10 or more minutes. We got dressed and headed down the 15 flights of stairs. We finally arrived to the lobby ONLY to have to ask again what to do and then being told that it was again a false alarm. How come the hotel didn't get employees out or use an intercom to rely this information to people????? Problem # 4: I got stuck in the elevator twice and one of the times I had to wait 10 minutes before the elevator started up again. When I used the help button in the elevator, a person came on who kept asking me not to hang up and where was I calling from. Problem #5: We had the world's worst dinner one evening at the hotel and it was too late to order anything else from the hotel at that time. We ordered two dinners of penne pasta with broc. We could squeeze the water out of the bowl--so soggy and yucky neither one of us could eat it. It was an expensive meal. Bright side: Cesar from the restaurant was the most friendly employee of this Sheraton. When he asked how our dinner was, I shared wtih him that it was not something we could eat. He immediately gave us a coupon to order again at another time. Very thoughtful gentlemen who has excellent customer service! He by far was the shining part of this hotel experience! Thank you Cesar! Maybe Cesar should run the entire hotel. Just a suggestion.... Problem #6: There were a few employees of the Sheraton that showed us good customer service--the housekeeping people were very helpful and our room was kept very clean, the people who were outside the lobby at the desk were friendly and helpful, and the people at the front desk were as helpful as well, except for when I shared our hotel dissatisfaction. The information desk employees were always overbooked and often times made guests feel llike an inconveinience although they were informative. Some of the employees in the restaurant (except for Cesar and two male waiters) were often rude and did not go out of their way to help. They also seemed to sneer at us when we would ask a question. My son noticed it on several occasions and he's just a kid. Where's the customer service??? Problem #7: I had shared this experience of our stay on day 7 with an employee at the front desk. I told the front desk that I had prepaid for an 11 day stay at this hotel and was extremely unhappy with the experience. I asked about getting some days comped since we still had four more days left or about getting money taken off our bill. The employee, although very friendly and courteous, said that was not possible. She told me we could have four free breakfasts and free internet for the next four days. I told her that free internet is already available in the lobby so that's not any help and although the breakfast idea was okay, I had already clearly spent a few hundred dollars on meals at the hotel anyway so the breakfast was not much of a break. The employee told me that I couldn't get any type of a refund because I prepaid. I discussed with her that this is inaccurate because I have the statement showing that I could get reinbursed or money taken off since I wasn't asking for a full refund. I asked about visiting with someone who could talk more with me about this situation and no one was available. Our family has stayed in many Sheratons throughout the U.S. and has never been disappointed before. This hotel stay was a nightmare!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am desperately trying to reach someone who can help me with this situation and each time I've called the Sheraton, I only get the front desk who is unable to answer my questions or send me to someone who can. I spent $2,613.00 for the hotel room alone, over $650 on services offered through the hotel--food, gift shop, room service, and $275 in cab service to and from my son's workshop (as mentioned above the hotel insisted we could walk it-no way it was at Oakwood Complex and this amount of course does not include the rest of our cab fares). I am desperately trying to reach management for this Sheraton and would LOVE to speak with the CEO of this hotel chain. I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone for any type of stay--either vacation or business (for business people, most Sheratons offer complimentary Starbucks coffee in the lobbby for a bit in the a.m., not this one--Starbucks coffee only for sale). This stay may affect if our family ever stays at a Sheraton again. The stay was that disappointing and expensive.

I had read that the food was over priced and the elevators were an issue. We stayed here from July 3 to July 8th. We did not have any issues checking in. A bellman took our luggage and let me keep my car in front of the hotel until I got our bags out and checked in. We chose to self park. The parking is extremely close. From the reviews I had read, it sounded like it was farther away but it is very close and very convenient and I don't see why you would need a valet. We were on the 4th floor and our room faced the pool. I thought the room was clean and well serviced and never had any issues at all. The main floor/ lobby of the hotel is renovated and very nice and they have a concierge who, when they are there, is very helpful. You can purchase Universal park tickets on site and they are knowledgeable about any deals or savings. We wanted to purchase tickets with cash but could only use credit card and the man was willing to put on his credit card and we would pay him the cash. We used our credit card but that was going out of his way I thought. There is a lounge right across from check in. Down farther on the main floor are computers for anyone's use. I think there are at least 6 computers available and I used them at different times during the day and never had to wait. The gift store has various items, from gifts to books to items you may need such as nail clippers (which we did). We had club service, so it was very nice to be able to go up in the morning and have some breakfast and h'ors doevres from 5 to 9 pm. Yes there is a charge for alcohol but soft drinks are free. The only problem with this hotel and it is a HUGE problem are the elevators. They are truly awful and I was so thankful to be on the fourth floor because you could walk down two flights of stair and be at the lobby. Lobby is 3rd floor. Just like everyone writes... they take FOREVER and A DAY. We checked in on a Sunday night and after we were settled, we wanted to go to the club level, floor 9 and check it out. The elevator was full of people. It was elevator #2... we were trying to get to 9 and it was like it was trying to understand the message of the floors but couldn't quite get there. It went to 9, stopped but didn't open, then went to 7, then back to 9 (not opening but acting like it may be thinking about it) went up to 10, down to 5 and then to 9 and finally opened. It was AWFUL. I have never been so close to thinking I was going to be stuck in an elevator. We got out right away. We chose to take the stairs down to the lobby to check it out more. When we went to go back to our room... there was a maintenance man talk to the elevator door saying, \"OK sir, I have called the repair people and they will be here shortly\" According to hotel staff, he was stuck in there for 45 minutes. They reassured my family member that it was all fixed. The next morning I was back in there and lucky for me, #2. I was trying to go to one of the top floors and the same thing happened. I never stepped foot in #2 again. The elevators never once took 90 seconds. I waited up to 15 minutes most times. They have seats outside the elevator, for a reason I believe. You really need to use them because the elevators take so long. We did have lunch one day in the restaurant and it was fine. There is a grocery store very close and we purchased some beverages and snacks. It costs $22 for two beer delivered room service which is crazy when you can go to the store and purchase more than two for cheaper then that. Loved the pool, loved the shuttle to Universal. Really easy to access and very friendly drivers. Does get quite full as it services more then just that hotel, so I had to stand once but all in all, it was easy and free! One day I was trying to rush and catch the shuttle and I could see it start to drive away and so I stopped running and my body language showed I was disappointed. The driver saw me and stopped and waited for us. So that was very nice. The worst part about the hotel is the elevators and I would not stay here again because of the elevators. Very scary. There are several comments about the elevators, so Sheraton needs to pay attention to that because it is a deal breaker in my opinion. Otherwise this is a fine place to stay. Just need to fix the elevators. Pillows and beds very comfy!", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, California, USA", "Title": "\u201cIf your thinking of staying here, please read this first (awful experience) ...............\u201d", "Author": "JasonLT", "ReviewID": "UR115366749", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Sheraton Universal hotel on 07/02/2011 \u2013 07/04/2001. The hotel stay was absolutely terrible. Please read on to see what you are in store for should you decide to stay at the Sheraton Universal. First of all, while checking in, the front desk clerk (Jason) failed to tell us about the evening hors d\u2019oeuvres service (not a big deal initially, but it set the precedence for this hotel stay). I knew about the Club Level because I reserved a Club Level room. However, this hotel has Club Level floors and Preferred Guest Level floors. Although the floors look identical, they are labeled differently when getting off of the elevator which leaves a guest who reserves a room on the Club Level floor to believe they are getting less value of a room by having to stay on the Preferred Guest Level floor. The hotel put us on the Preferred Level floor so it was confusing to the front desk clerk (looking at his computer) as to what amenities were available to us. I asked him 3 times after checking in and he kept telling me that if I wanted evening hors d\u2019oeuvres or breakfast, I\u2019d have to go to the hotel restaurant (he kept looking at me as if I were trying to get a hotel service for free). This got me very confused and second guessed myself as to what level of room I had reserved. Next, most hotels offer complimentary beer and wine on the Club Level during the evening hors d\u2019oeuvres service. Not this hotel. And that is hotel, in the club reception room, there are bottles of 5 beers and 2 wines on display on the appetizer table. There are sodas and bottled water right next to the alcoholic beverages display. However, there is no mention of those alcoholic beverages costing anything. No sign, no announcement, nothing at all. Even when the hostess came by to take a drink order, there was no verbal mention that there would be a fee for the alcoholic beverages. Once the hostess brings you the beverage, she brings you a check with the alcoholic beverages on it (and expects a tip on top of that). Now, what is the point of paying extra for a club level room if they are even going to expect a tip? Although most hotels offer complimentary beverages, beer, and wine at the evening hors d\u2019oeuvres time, it is fine that this hotel does not. But at least inform the guest of such. Ok, so next problem. The elevator service is terrible. Before staying that this particular hotel, I read a review on this hotel that stated that the elevators took a guest 8 minutes to get from the ground floor to her room. After reading that, I thought to myself, \u201cthat cannot possibly be true. What an exaggeration\u201d. However, on that particular review, the manager responded that he tested the elevator service and it should never take more than 90 seconds to hail an elevator. I thought, \u201cthat\u2019s true\u201d. However, believe it or not, that guest was correct! The first elevator trip to our floor after checking in took 13 minutes to arrive at the lobby level, not to mention a few additional minutes to get to our floor. The elevators could not handle the capacity of the guests, and once to capacity, seemed to bypass the lobby floor where the majority of guests were waiting to go to their rooms. If an elevator stopped at the lobby level, it was a miracle (and so crowded that only 1 or 2 guests could get into the elevator). I think the manager who responded to the previous guest\u2019s review about the elevators was testing the elevators out at 3:00am in the morning. Next, we arrived in our room and it was facing the freeway (obviously noisy as heck). I called to request a room change (mind you, this is at 6:00pm) and I was told that the hotel was sold out and there was nothing they could do. I was told that maybe there would be rooms available tomorrow (Saturday) so I politely said to let me know in the morning. The front desk clerk said I would have to call back in the morning and inquire. Ok, so one more thing for me to do? I asked if they could simply call me and they said I\u2019d have to call them and re-inquire. A few minutes later, I called back and said I definitely needed a room change. I was told someone would call back in 5 minutes. 20 minutes later, I called back since no once had called me. I was told that they were still searching for rooms (mind you, there were still tons of guests checking into the hotel so what the big deal was about a room swap was beyond me). They finally called back and said the only room they could fit me into was a standard room on the third floor (not a Club Level room) that faced the hotel parking structure. And when I say faced it, I mean you look out the window and you literally see a concrete wall in front of you with a little cement entrance road below. How disgusting and certainly a slap in the face. Was it intentional, I\u2019ll let you decide? Read on and you\u2019ll somehow agree that the culture of employees at this hotel are rude and not customer service oriented. So, we kept the room and moved on. We left for Universal City Walk at 8:00pm and stopped by the front desk on our way out. We spoke to the clerk who initially checked us in (Jason) and asked for a room refresh of towels and an evening turn down service. Jason looked up our room and stated he would take care of it. My wife even double confirmed the correct room number and Jason repeated our names back from the computer. So we thought we were set. Not so. We returned at midnight to find the room untouched. I called downstairs and was told there was no housekeeping staff on duty at midnight. Now come one, you\u2019d think a hotel this size would at least one housekeeper on duty. I asked for a manager and was told there was not a manager on duty until 9:00am the following morning. Are you serious? No manager. Who is in charge if the hotel was on fire? I was told that there absolutely was no manager on duty and there was absolutely nothing they could do. They sent a maintenance type employee up to our room with a stack of towels. Period. They stated that they would email a manager and he would contact us at 9:00am sharp the following morning. I simply got a voice mail message on our phone (which I did not get until we returned from Universal Studios the following day at 5:00pm). The message simply stated along the lines of said \u201cHi, this is Chris Moraca, Front Desk Manager, I heard we had some issues last night. Please feel free to call me with any questions\u201d. The next evening of our hotel stay (night 2), we left for the City Walk at about 6:30pm and called the front desk to request a room refreshing and turn down service again. They stated that there would be no problem with such a request. We returned at midnight to find the room untouched again. I called the front desk and was again told there was no housekeeping at that hour and no manager on duty. This is a Saturday night. What do you mean no manager on duty? It was the same front desk person I spoke to the previous evening (Leanne) and she could not believe what was happening. She apologized and stated that this was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d for this hotel to treat a guest in this manner. She promised to have a manager call my cell phone the following morning (of which I received no call from a manager or supervisor). Furthermore, Leanne stated that the manager that she was emailing that evening was Holly and that Holly would be the person contacting me in the morning. I told her we had no shampoo or soap left and had to get up very early the next morning for a flight. She said she would have the items brought right up to our room. Ten minutes later, my wife called and asked where the items were. It was 1:00am and we could not be hanging out waiting for the items because we needed to get to sleep for an early morning flight the next day. We were then told that the items were not on their way because there were other guests that needed attention first and we would have to \u201cwait our turn\u201d in a line of requests. Finally, a hotel employee arrived again with a stack of towels and an entire bag for soap and shampoo. I mean, there had to be 20 bottles of mini shampoos and about 30 bars of soap. What point were they now trying to make? Finally, upon check out on Sunday morning (at 9:00am), there was one luggage valet available for approximately 7 \u2013 10 parties waiting for his services downstairs. Thank goodness we did not have to have a luggage valet come to our room. It would have never happened. We were getting a bit anxious that no one was able to assist us with calling for a taxi so we went back into the hotel and visited the concierge desk. We asked him to help us get a taxi. Although he was helping no one, he said only the bell desk could help us. Come to find out, all the bell desk needed to do is push a doorbell style button once which signaled a taxi to come to the lobby entrance to pick us up. Are you telling me that the concierge could not walk over a few steps and push said button (or at least tell us how to push the button)? It would have saved so much waiting time and energy. All in all, this hotel is poorly managed, lacks proper training, and a disgrace to the Sheraton name. I have never wrote a review on anything in my life as they are very time consuming. However, in this instance, I felt compelled to because I have never been treated this way. And to wrap it up, to this date, there has been no call from management to address the happenings during this stay.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cReally great staff!

The room had a flat screen tv, coffeemaker, safe, iron and 2 phones (wireless phone doesn't work-battery light was blinking). Major stain on the carpet very close to the window- gross. Another problem was the A/C didn't function so well. It didn't feel cold, it just felt like a strong fan all night.

They joked around with us when we were coming in and leaving and helped us with walking directions (and we didn't valet, we just parked in the garage, but they were nice and helpful anyway and always smiling). - The people who worked the desk were friendly and helpful - Room service was speedy and our order was right. :) - The hotel is right across the street from Universal Studios and down the block from the subway station (which we walked to so we could catch the train to downtown and go shopping, see the walk of fame etc. etc and the Hollywood sign is visible from the Mall if you go to the top floor). -Housekeeping was great (we left them $5 a day - you should always tip everyday because you might get a different housekeeper at the end of your stay so if you tip only when you check out, you may have stiffed the person that cleaned your room most of your stay!) -There is a bar in the lobby which was great after a day walking around and also a convenience store in case you forgot anything -There is an outdoor pool, which we didn't use, but it looked nice clean (our friend had a view of the pool and the hills) -The overall hotel was clean and well maintained. We would definitely stay here again. Not only are you close to Universal and the Subway, but you are a short drive or cab ride to lots of other attractions. The ONLY bad thing we encountered in the hotel, and this only applies to my husband and I, not our friend, who had no issues whatsoever.... was that in the middle of the night our air-conditioner stopped working! The fan was going but warm air was blowing out... we both woke up very hot and the room was very very stuffy. It was the last day of our stay and it was the middle of the night - it wan't that big of a deal (although it was a little hard to sleep) so we didn't bother calling the front desk. The room was back to normal when we woke up and then we were checking out anyway. No biggie. I'm sure if we would have called someone, it would have been fixed in no time. But that's it... just one little tiny issue that did not ruin my vacation. :) We had a great time and we will be back! Oh and for those out there that complain about having to pay to park - good luck finding a decent hotel in California where you don't have to pay. We didn't mind having to pay to park - your car is in a nice garage, guard gated and it's right next to the hotel - no problems getting in or out, and once you pay, you can come and go all day long if you want.", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cthe best concierge in LA\u201d", "Author": "trishnick", "ReviewID": "UR108013248", "Content": "Staff were very helpful.

Questions were answered knowledgably and courteously. The lobby was as attractive as I always remembered it, but with no real sitting area unless you went into the bar section. The decor in soft beige tints was pleasant both upstairs and down. Self-parking was good value at $18 per 24 hours, as was the internet. Yet, there was also a motor hotel feel feel which was new and unwelcome. The room maintenance was bizarre in my case. It was no more than perfunctory, if that. After my first night I returned to the room after several hours away and found that the bed covers had simply been pulled up \u2014 and not much more. Dust balls on the carpet evident when I checked in were still there 24 hours later. In the bathroom, I had left one towel in the tub because it needed replacing. When I returned it was now on the bathroom floor, along with the bath mat which I had carefully folded and draped over the tub in the morning. There was soap scum in the wash basin. Also. I suspect that easy access to restaurants up the hill on City Walk has had a negative effect on food services at the Sheraton Universal. Again, the staff in the sole remaining restaurant was pleasant and attentive, although not especially professional. But it was essentially a coffee-shop menu and coffee-shop quality food.

Pros: - Received really nice service from the bell boy (man, actually) who showed genuine friendliness that made us feel that he really wanted us to have a pleasant stay from his heart. When he found that we were staying for 10 days, he offered to bring us a mini-fridge just in case. It's complementary anyway, but his service was really superb. Too bad I am not good at remembering names that I could have given him credits here. - 70% of the hotel had been renovated. E.g. wall papers, bedside cabinets, etc. - Couldn't request for a King bed room before arrival and hence we could only use a room in the same floor of the front desk. But since the hotel's big and the room was located furthest from the front desk, we did not find this much of a concern at all. - Computers in the business center were all new models (new at least to a computer idiot like me) with speedy internet. Before we arrived, we read the earlier review saying that the computers in the business center were not working properly. But during the 10 days of our stay, we did not see any of this happened and made good use of them. So it was still fine without free in-room wi-fi. - They offered $5 voucher each day we declined housekeeping service. Hence we'd collected vouchers worth a total of $30. We used them all at one go and enjoyed a breakfast in the hotel on the last day. (Though don't expect too much on the food...) Cons: - The only 2 mirrors in the room were located inconveniently. The biggest one was in the bathroom but there was no way I could lean closer to look at my face clearly as the bathroom was really small. Another mirror was located inside the closet. Since we have 4 big luggages, one of them was put inside the side right in front of the mirror ('cause no where else in the room could we have put it instead). And with the dim lighting next to the closet, it was still hard for me to try to put some make-up on. And we had been wondering why the mirror was not placed behind the working desk where there was a really big empty wall. - While every thing seemed to be pretty new, spider's web was found in the ceiling corner in the bedroom. Mold was also found at the ceiling corner at the bath tub. And the door lock was obviously not replaced after renovation and looked quite dirty and old. - Is it how the blankets are arranged in hotels now? We have a thick bed cover over a down blanket over a thin bed sheet. All these 3 items are just loosely covering in layers without any thing holding them together. Every morning the 3 blankets went different paths and it was really not comfortable to find yourself directly covered by the down blanket when you woke up in the morning. - With a flat screen TV already in place, the hotel at a level like Sheraton should really consider incorporating the HD features. - Traveling to Universal Studio/ City Walk from the hotel was not meant to be done by walk. Either you catch the shuttle or drive there yourself. We wanted to watch a movie past 8pm at one night but the shuttle was already off. We had to pay $10 for parking in the City Walk while we were supposed to be staying in the hotel at Universal Studio.", "Date": "February 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cBad experience\u201d", "Author": "peteleedds", "ReviewID": "UR96873183", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel for 4 evenings.

When I finally mentioned it at the Front Desk, they were nice but completely unconcerned and it was never fixed for the rest of my stay.

The bar area is nice, the staff are great, but I thought the food was awful. - Conceirge gave me incorrect information (I was told a shuttle to the airport is $20.00...ah, I wish). - Bill was incorrect at check out and I had to get manager's assistance to straighten it out (completely their error - they were apologetic but the mistake was so unncessary).
