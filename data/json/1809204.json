We also have our dinner at the Kimpinski Hotel at Mall of Emirate. Their daily special is well worth the money. Taking taxi to Burj al Arab or the Madinat is cheap and only takes 10 min. WiFi is only available in the sitting room of 2 bedroom apartment which is quite inconvenient. Breakfast has very limited choices and taste not good. The toilet at the ground floor is not clean.

Lots of cockroaches in the upper floors maybe because it's empty and no body went there for a long time, but still this is not an excuse. I informed the reception and more than one time we changed the rooms nearly 4 times until we found one (cockroach free) room. To come to the truth this is annoying and I really hate insects. Still the rooms are really big and enough for the whole family and the hotel apartment has a great location, but there are no activities for the kids but only a small swimming pool Anyway I hope they take care of that cockroaches problem, but I don't believe that I would ever go there again regardless if they solved that issue or didn't.

When we checked in staff lead us to a room that, to put it bluntly, smelled like dead fish. The smell was awful and very strong - but the staff didn't seem to think this was a problem - they merely opened the window and told us that it would be gone in 5 minutes. After 15 minutes the smell did not go away - as expected and I called the reception to ask to be moved rooms. I was told that there were no other rooms available and that the smell was actually paint fumes. I have never smelled paint like this before and the staff must have thought I was stupid. After insisting to be moved - the smell was outrageous - a room suddenly became available. It was much smaller and very loud as it was beside the lifts - but at least it didn't make me want to vomit. We had to fight with staff to be moved room - and were told it woudl happen in 5 minutes - 40 minutes later we were moved. Ontop of this we did not get room service or fresh towels during the next 2 nights of our stay, and when we asked for some tea bags staff reacted like I had asked them to chop off an arm. Teabags were not included in the room price and we were not allowed two more teabags. I asked to speak to the manager to voice my complaints and overall disapointment - and when I did I had an aggressive man shouting at me down the phone. Not exactly what you want from your hotel on your holiday! After checking out we realised a couple of days later that my husband had left a jacket in our room. We called them straight away and were told by the receptionist that the jacket had been found and it would be kept in a cupboard at reception, awaiting collection - with no time limit on collection. We recently went to collect (less than a month later) the jacket and it was no where to be found! After waiting for 45 minutes - staff told us it could not be found, and there was no explanation as to what had happened to it, not even an apology from the staff. The rooms were clean and basic. We chose this hotel because of its location to Mall of the Emirates and relatively closeness toJumeirah Beach.
