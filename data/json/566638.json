Step in the lobby, and any doubts are eliminated. Very tasteful mostly 60s style yet fresh looking furnishings are abound in the common areas and the rooms. Each of the nine rooms in this hotel located in the Meguru Tokyo neighborhood seems different. While none are designated as non-smoking, you will note even notice\u9225\u6501nd we are extra sensitive about that nasty smell. Perhaps it\u9225\u6a9a because the windows in the room actually open. Yes, you are in a Tokyo hotel room and can actually get fresh air\u9225\u6502eing there in August though, this feature was not particularly handy though we did take advantage of it nevertheless. Another shocking aspect of the room we stayed in is its size including a huge bathroom. The room is at least twice the size of a typical Tokyo hotel standard room, perhaps better measured in square inches, at pretty much the same rate! And, the views of the Tokyo expansive landscape are quite nice even though you are not looking out from one of the few high-rises in town.The neighborhood is hip, busy (OK, what\u9225\u6a9a new for Tokyo), and unique with a good dose of design oriented boutique stores not taken over by big brand names\u9225\u6501t least not yet. The walk along the canal is a must. While not located in \u9225\u6e03entral\u9225?Tokyo, if there is such a thing, the hotel is a 20-minute walk or a 7-minute 10-yen cab ride to the Meguru JR Yamanote line station with subway access to pretty much anywhere in the city. And, the staff is young, extra helpful, and politely friendly. If this is not your first visit to Tokyo and you have some interest in attention to design detail, Claska is the place to stay. You will do very well on a first visit too, perhaps with only a few more subway trips than you would need to take if you are to stay in Ginza, for example.", "Date": "Nov 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR483235601", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Infiniti"}, {"Content": "Boutique Hotel, off the beaten path We stayed at the Hotel Claska for 2 nights in June 2007. My interest was to stay in a small, boutique hotel, after staying in both a large, modern skyscraper hotel (Park Hotel) and a chain hotel (Hyatt Regency). The Claska is inconveniently located from the nearest train station but one can easily take a taxi to the station for about $8 USD. Having said that, the Claska IS NOT a tourist hotel and is catering to businessmen, designers and hipsters who want something different and out of the way. The stores in the area offer chic furniture and accesories for the home. The hotel restaurant serves up spicy Asian food, the reading area in the lobby sells beautiful art books, there are bikes available to cruise the neighborhood. Our room had hardwood floors and a private terrace. Everything was clean and minimalistic in design. The concierge desk was friendly and helpful. The day we left, the room next door was being used for a photo shoot ---that's the kind of place it is. Really, if you need to be across the street from a train station to visit the attractions of Tokyo, the Claska would not suit your needs. If you like the idea of staying in a place that's small (10 rooms!) quiet, private, different, arty, put this one on your list.", "Date": "Jul 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR105785771", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "cousinM"}, {"Content": "Private, quiet, clean Stayed in the weekly residence room for 8 days, for about 8600yen (US $80?).

The rooms are modern, the staff helpful and friendly and the guests generally hip. If you're interested in design or fashion or music or are interested in Japanese people who might be interested in the same, this is definitely a place worth checking out.The rooms are fairly difficult to book, as there is only a handful. Book months in advance, especially if you plan on being in Tokyo during holidays or other major events.Some might be put off by its distance from the city center, but I haven't found this to be an issue. The train and subway systems in Tokyo are very easy to navigate and the Claska is only a 10 minute walk or so from the nearest station.Finally, I found the Claska to be a real bargain in Tokyo, or any major city really. Both my girlfriend and I were impressed with the size and quality of the room and will definitely stay again whenever we next make it out to Japan.", "Date": "Nov 16, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR451665741", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "smurfk1"}, {"Content": "Stylish interiors Stylish and spacious. For $160/night we were very happy with 35 square meters of subdued, modern design. We made full use of their free electric assist bikes and DVD rental and spent three nights in two different rooms. The staff were helpful and friendly - allowing us to use the front desk computers for internet access. The rooms are nicely equiped with flat screen tv and Nakamichi stereo equipment and with a double window system - we didn't hear any street noise. The lobby and rooms are not brightly lit so it's not ideal for work but are for relaxing after a busy day in a crowded city. The Claska complex is a combination of nightclub, creative offices, retail (including dog grooming), event spaces - even long-term monthly room rentals. It's ideal if your searching for modernist furniture - the hotel even has a map and guide for local vintage, used and new furniture and accessories.

Also, I think as a hip hotel it attracts a lot of hard partying types who tend to trash the rooms... Kind of like the Mondrian, or Delano etc.There are so many trendy places to go out in Tokyo, for my money I would prefer one of the many excellent hotels that are better located in the city with far nicer rooms and amenities.", "Date": "Sep 21, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR173262746", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "washdctrav7"}, {"Content": "\u9288\u5e7f\u506a\u9288\u3083\u5136\u9289\u51a6\u5061\u9289?#x201d;   showReview(23006157, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR190460621", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "\u9287\u88e4\u4eef\u9287\u00b0\u5017\u9288?> \u9287\u88e4\u4eef\u9287\u00b0\u5017\u9288?</a> </div>"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066450-d566638-r21992840-Claska-Meguro_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "566638", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
