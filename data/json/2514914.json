Our last trip, which took place in early October, was organized at the last minute when a client asked my husband to attend a trade fair. (Like he was going to say no... Paris?? Free???) The hotel in which we usually stay was booked - probably because of all the stellar TA reviews - but they kindly provided us with a few other recommendations, one of which was Hotel Apollon. Pros: - Reasonably priced (for Paris, as I already mentioned) - Extra-clean, especially the bathroom - Bathroom recently renovated and, for its size, offers a remarkable amount of space on which to put your stuff. - Plentiful - and HOT - water in shower - Friendly and helpful front desk personnel - Great neighborhood with some absolutely outstanding restaurants. (We actually prefer this neighborhood to the one in which we usually stay. It's a real place, with real cafes that actual Parisians visit - not just tourists or traveling businesspeople.) - Metro exactly one block away - Free Wi/Fi that works exceptionally well. (Note: I had no problem whatsoever with getting a new code every day. Heck and it's just an elevator ride downstairs, something that can be accomplished in less than 5 minutes.) - The room has a small frig. Cons: - The rooms are small, which is absolutely typical for this type of Parisian hotel. To me, it's not really a con, but for many it might be --- so fair warning. - Because the rooms are small, the walls get a bit of abuse from luggage. Consequently, the wall paper in both the halls and the rooms is beginning to get pretty dinged up. - The carpeting thruout really needs to be replaced. It's not totally disgusting, but is showing its age and the wear and tear that it receives. - Clothes storage is pretty much non-existent. There's a tiny (and I might add, very dusty) closet in the room. It holds four shirts, two business suits, one raincoat -- and bursts at the seams. - Storage for luggage in also non-existent. The only saving grace is that the beds are on legs, not on a platform. We were able to shove my husband's suitcase under a bed. I had to keep mine out because that's where my clothes lived during our stay. I might add that I must have stubbed my doggone toe on the doggone suitcase about 35 times. - The beds were not at all comfortable. By day two we were both complaining of aching backs and we're both pretty fit people. - The sheets were quite clean and crisp, but the blanket really could have used a good wash. - Our beds didn't get a bedspread put on them until the third day. When we arrived, it was just sheets and a blanket. Bottom Line: Would I stay there again? Yes, if there were no other options.

We've been to 4-5 other hotels in Paris over the past few years and by far, in this price range, this was the best (we have stayed in better hotels but the price was quite a bit higher), The location of the hotel is great too; only 2-3 minutes walking distance to many supermarkets, bakeries, and eateries, as well as Metro Pernety station. If you walk a little longer and venture to Blvd Montparnasse, Rue d\u2019Odessa, etc, you will find great places to eat at very reasonable prices.

He told us all of the great places to go, and even went through great lengths to book a reservation for us to a Cabaret show on our last night. I can't say enough about how much he helped make our trip one of the best ever. If you ever go to Paris you have to stay at this hotel. You absolutely will not regret it. A couple of points to know. Plan on arriving after 2PM as it was the case for us that our rooom was not available when we arrived in the morning. That wasn't a big deal for us but you might want to make note of that.

Hotel Apollo is located in the Montparnasse neighborhood of Paris which is a little off of the beaten path. By staying here and shopping and eating in the neighborhood visitors will get a taste of what \"real Paris\" is like. Within a block or two are cafes, brasseries, and stores of all types. The people are less likely to speak English as they are in the more touristy neighborhoods but that's okay. They were all good sports with our limited French skills. This being said, if you are out at any of the Parisian hot spots our eating in the trendy neighborhoods, when you're done, you have to trek back to the hotel. There is not a thriving social scene in this section of Montparnasse. We stayed in room 3 which was an average size European hotel room. The bathroom looked to have been recently renovated and the shower had great water pressure and temperature. The bathroom door didn't really latch completely and the deadbolt on the room door did't function but we decided these were not enough of an issue to switch rooms.

All are true, and we loved this hotel. We made our reservations and arrived late on a Sunday night. When you come out of the metro stop Pernaty, look left and the hotel is a short block away, you can see the sign. We booked a room for 3 twin beds, instead we got an upgrade for the same price, ajacent rooms, a single with a double bed and a double with twin beds. The cool thing was that they were in the corner of the building and we could close and lock a hallway door just outside our rooms, thus giving us basically one big room. At night, we could lock both doors, (the hallway door and the room doors) giving us double security. When booking the reservation, we received a discount and free breakfast. This might be due to the renovations that are taking place. However, we didn't really care. The rooms are the charmingly smallish size of a French hotel, which is what I was looking for, clean, quiet, and nicely decorated as shown in the photos. The beds and pillows were comfortable. The bathrooms were attached and had been recently renovated, and clean. There was a hairdryer in each bathroom. The TV had CNN so we could watch news and weather. THere was a place to hang clothes and a small refrigerator. During the day, we saw some workers in the hallways, but they were also very nice. The staff speaks very good English. Johann was particularly helpful, but everyone was nice. When we had trouble with our airline going home, Johann made some phone calls for us and gave us good advice on what to do to change flights. There is a computer in the lobby that guests are allowed to use for free internet access. The free breakfast was sufficient, and filling with several options. Plenty of places to eat in the neighborhood and we felt safe. Even coming in at 1:00 AM. There is a BNP ATM, just outside the hotel which was very convenient.

The spicy shrimp and the \"sugar\" pork fed a family of 4 for 29 euros!) For a more parisian taste, the Cafe Metro was very good. Traveling with 4 it's impossible to find rooms in Paris in June, but they put us up in two adjoining rooms. Desk clerk was ALWAYS friendly, owner drew us a map to the bus stop to the airport (5 minute walk) saving us $100 on a taxi ride. Free Wi-Fi (pronounced wee-fee) in all rooms. The free breakfast is wonderful - baguette, croissant, cheese, ham, milk, juice, coffee, cereal, and lots of it. Save you probably 8 euros a day per person, compared to prices down the street. They ARE doing rennovations in the hallway - plaster dust and plastic on the floor - through August - but the rooms are immaculately clean, air conditioned, with private bathrooms.

We arrived at the hotel at the start of June and found that parts of the walls were ripped out and all floors were covered in plastic. It turned out the hotel was having major construction work but the website never mentioned anything before booking. On our first morning we were woken up at 08:30 by banging and workmen on our floor. We mentioned it to the receptionist (he said the work would continue for months) who moved us to another floor that day. He neglected to tell us that the work would spread to all floors the very next day. So the same thing happened again the next day, workmen starting at 8:30 with hammers and drills. We spoke with the manager who said work would not take place until we left the hotel during the day and there would be no work no the weekend. Fri Morning and the banging and drilling starting at 09:30 and the hotel now resembled a bombsite. We rang reception and told them the work was in full swing. The workman stopped for about 15 mins and then it kicked off again. We ran out of the hotel that day. Saturday arrived and we looked forward to a quiet weekend without building work. But we returned to the hotel just after lunch and the construction work was fully under way. Banging , Drilling , workmen smoking , walls pulled apart , door frames lying in the hall way with exposed nails , dust and dirt everywhere. Finally on the monday with the hotel like a bombsite and the noise from the work being unbearable we requested to see the manager as we had enough and we were leaving. When he finally arrived after having his lunch we proceeded to detail the terrible stay we were having and how DANGEROUS the hotel was with exposed nails, masonary and electrical wires hanging from the ceiling. We told him we were leaving and we were not prepared to pay full price for our stay. The Hotel Manager insisted again again he could discount the stay 10% and that he needed to make a PROFIT. He stated again again \"I NEED TO MAKE A PROFIT\" . We told him again again this discount was unacceptable and customers should be treated better than this. The work had got worse and worse over the week and that his hotel was DANGEROUS as well as horrible to stay in. He didn't seem to understand that exposed nails and electrical wires were a danger to children, adults, everyone! Eventually we accepted the paltry 1 night free on offer, paid the bill as we were getting no where with the Manager.

All sights are superclose by and quickly accessible by the very good metro system of even by walking - no problems at all. Also important the safety of the quarter - never had any problems also when walking home very late at night. The hotel itself is also great - the people very very friendly.

My wife and myself were in this Hotel for 3 nights in the month of May, Booking was done directly with the Hotel and I must admit that despite being a typical Parisian Hotel the response was super fast!!! The front desk team especially Emmanual and Yohannan are excellent communicator and speak reasonably good English. They would even go an extra mile to help you out. We have had heard a lot about typical Parisian attitude, but mercifully this Hotel does not show them any. We got a special internate rate of 110 Euro per night with breakfast for a double,not bad at all looking at other Hotel's rate this was a steal!!! They send me a clear direction,how to reach to the Hotel beforehand and till that time I was overawed by their efficiency. The location is good,but it is subjective! If you are familiar with Paris Metro then Line 13 is not a problem at all. Though it was my first time in Paris but I did a fair amount of homework to familiarize myself with the complexity of Paris metro. Thank God!! It turned out to be gold! We could explore Paris to the tee in the shortest possible time due to Metro.We came back with a very high opinion about Paris Metro,and would strongly suggest people to use it to avoid the traffic and it is quite cheap too. A box of 10 tickets (Carnet) costs us 11.40 Euro,each ticket can be used as long as you are with in the Metro network,that means any number of changes can be covered by a single ticket only. But a word of caution! If you have some luggages with you then be prepared for a good weight lifting workout!!! Quite a few of the Metro stations do not have any escalators or elevators! so the good old stairs have to be negotiated.(Pernety is one of them!) The location of this Hotel is 50meters away from the Pernety station in Metro line 13,which is definitely a big advantage. The Hotel is at least not a pretender! It is a 2star and it declares that,I liked that. Check- in procedure was smooth and fast. The Elevator of the Hotel is an antique, probably from the time of French Revolution!!! If you get in to it with your luggage, then the other person has to wait!!! They definitely need to change the lift as soon as possible. The room was small to say the least!!!. There was hardly any space to move with out banging each other! The toilet was even smaller. if anybody is over 6ft and around 90+kg,then please avoid this Hotel as you will not be able to enter the shower cubicle!!! In the positive side there is an Aircon and it works! Good water pressure and hot water. A lot of reviewer had complained about the low energy lamps,but we did not find them as an irritation! Sound proofing is bad and you can listen to all the conversation of the adjacent rooms. The noise from the road was audiable till mid night!!! But I guess in Paris one need not complain about small room and bath!!! Had I been there for my work I would take it but probably not when you are on a vacation with your family. Breakfast was served in the cellar. It was just OK. Nothing great about it,but the coffee was plentiful and good so was the fresh croissant. There are a lots of good restaurants in the vicinity. Couple of Bristos near the Metro station,and one excellent Chinese small food joint nearby. On the other side of the Hotel there is a very good Lebanese Restaurant. Prices are very reasonable in all the places. We really do not know in Paris how small are the other Hotel rooms but if they are as small as this place then this Hotel would score over a lot of places because of their location and helpful attitude.
