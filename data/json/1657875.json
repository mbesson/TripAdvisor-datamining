Finding the hotel was not hard, since almost all the taxi driver knew this area and hotel well. The lobby was so tiny, that makes the early check-in guest quite hard to put the luggage first before the official check in time. The room was small, it's okay, since we don't expect more than that. But the bathroom was so tiny, that we would make the whole bathroom (wash basin, toilet bowl,mirror and our hung personal toileteries soaked well when we took shower. Hot/Warm water was very unstable, sometimes boiling hot, frozen cold in the same time. Couldn't maintain the hot water more than 5 minutes. The TV simply just like decoration on the wall. It's LCD ok, but hardly found any watchable channel, first only very few channels available, secondly the channel available were only raining and marching ants only. The staffs were different issue, they were all so unfriendly, hardly ever smiled, hardly ever communicate. Only few words spoken. Unfortunately, since the location was very strategic and very close to the MRT Station, we could forget those kinds of dissapointment.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood location for getting around the city\u201d", "Author": "BelleLSW", "ReviewID": "UR121541286", "Content": "Within walking distance to the MRT station, bus stop and food court/eateries.

In my mind it was on par with a private room in a hostel. Staff: fantastic! They were always friendly and helpful whenever we needed them and let us borrow a multi-plug so we could plug a lot of things in. Location: really close to both Outram Park and China Town subway stations. The neighborhood is safe and has a few little stores near by. Rooms: Fairly small. A wet room bathroom and a small desk. Only one accessible power socket. The bed was made from leather which while practical was annoying to sleep on. Honestly? I wouldn't have had a quibble with the room as they give you black out curtains, big tv, good wifi Internet and although the rooms are small it was big enough for the two of us considering we only wanted to sleep there. The only thing that let the hotel down was the noise. Anyone walking past our room talking sounded like they were shouting. The worst was a small child one morning playing in the hallway. Overall I did enjoy my stay here and if coming back to Singapore on the same budget I probably would stay here again for the location and price alone.", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cI will not come again\u201d", "Author": "Dickylcw", "ReviewID": "UR118819123", "Content": "Services was very poor at all, the towels was dirtied, one time teeth brush, (powder on teeth brush) Reception kept room key, no mini bar, very poor Internet signal, needed login I'd and password, 2persons but 1login only, stayed 2days but only 1day Internet pass, Receptions attitudes extremely poor.

TV remote control didn`t work and staff didn`t seem bothered about it. Maybe it`s a common issue with other rooms also. The other negative is WIFI only in the lobby.
