I was staying in a single, basic room. Negatives: - No \"Satelite TV\", or certainly none that I got. It has a TV with the 5 terrestrial channels, but no more. - Tiny en-suite. Literally the smallest room I've ever seen. But technically, it has a shower, toilet and sink, so it counts. - Fire Alarms, went off twice during the early hours - both faults in the system. Safe to say I wasn't happy. - Breakfast, awful, just awful. After two days I stopped having it. Bread or Cornflakes with milk that had been left out for ages and was quite warm. Positives - Value, \u00a350 a night for the centre of London is amazing value. Sure its not 5 star, but as I said in the title, if you want more - you're going to have to pay for it. - Staff were very friendly, were always happy to help whenever I had a problem. - Free WiFi ! - does what it says on tin. No fuss, just an internet that worked, and didn't cost Some stray things - Train noise. It's right next to the railway station, but the noise for me wasn't that bad. I was on the otherside of the hotel so maybe anyone who's room backed on to it had it worse, but I did have the window wide open. If you're a light sleeper then ear plugs might be a good shout, I'm a pretty good sleeper so I didn't notice it. - The room wasn't bad. Sure it was simple, and it was small, but it served its purpose. Not a 5 star hotel by any means, but given its location, it's perfect for anyone who wants a cheap stay in London. And a perfectly reasonable hotel by all accounts. And if you need food (as I did eventually all day around), you're 200 yards from Victoria shopping centre - plenty of places to get food in there.", "Date": "August 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "DUblin", "Title": "\u201cStay away from here\u201d", "Author": "DublinJaney", "ReviewID": "UR64156019", "Content": "I have just returned from a nights stay in this place with my husband and 2 children and will never return to it.
