Unlisted means you book through a site like hotwire and don't actually know which hotel it is until you complete the booking, you just know the price, general location and rating. Benefit of taking this risk = better price. When I booked and saw it was Envoy Club I came here to read reviews and was a little concerned. They were hardly universally positive. But after a week staying there I can say I was pleasantly surprised, and we thought it was perfect for what we were looking for. Our room was big, very big by Manhattan standards. The neighbourhood was safe and reasonably convenient (Murray Hill is NOT in the absolute middle of Manhattan, so if this is what you want, choose another place), and the apartment style worked well for us. A doorman plus a staff member (most of the time) was enough to handle all of our requests. The bed was comfortable, with nice clean sheets, and the room was dark, cool and quiet at night. The two airconditioning units handled the NY heatwave perfectly. The kitchen wasn't new but it was clean and very usable. The bathroom was big and clean. As for the carpet - I'm not sure if we had new carpet or if previous reviews saw things that we didn't, but our carpet was 100% fine. Internet wasn't free, but it worked very well (a lot better than many hotels I've stayed in) so I was happy. My conclusion about Envoy Club is that it certainly wasn't as bad as some of these reviews make it sound. Whether you like it or not will all depend on what you are looking for - if you want something brand new, gives you the feeling of being right in the heart of Manhattan, has great views, and a really cool vibe, Envoy Club probably isn't the best bet. However, if you want great space, very practical pleasant apartment style and excellent value, Envoy Club could be a great option. My fiance and I had both been to Manhattan before, so we didn't need a rockstar place, we just needed a place that was a decent size, good quality, reasonably located (we actually liked getting some extra walking by staying in Murray Hill) and good value. Envoy Club was all of that and we would have no hesitation in going there again.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "sydney", "Title": "\u201ca disappointment\u201d", "Author": "KOSSYDNEY", "ReviewID": "UR115167737", "Content": "the envoy club suites was recommended to us by friends . on arriving, it was a terrible disappointment!! our one bedroom self contained suite, was rather old. the carpet stained, windows dirty. bath plug broken.thankfully, however, to their credit, they fixed us a plug when requested on the second day. the springs in the sofa bed, stuck into my daughter's back, giving a very uncomfortable first night. the cleaning maid was very accommodating and put an extra comfort on top to improve things a little. the bathroom and kitchen, though old, was clean. i had booked a few months early, and specially requested a rollaway to be added for when my 23 year old son arrived, and confirmed this several times with reservations., and also on arrival. to which, no-one ever said, they were subject to the day!! so, we found, that the night my son was to arrive, there was no rollaway available!! i definitely would not recommend this hotel, unless you desperately need to be next door to the hospital. this part of town is not as pleasant as staying on the west side, especially upper west. true, you are not far from centre of town and the 15 bus is close by to catch to and from lower manhattan. however, if you are looking for somewhere with a nicer view and surroundings or pleasant area to walk, don't book here.", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greeley, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cQuiet comfort in a safe neighborhood\u201d", "Author": "Glenmere7", "ReviewID": "UR115049245", "Content": "The Good: Given prices in Manhattan, I think the rates at Envoy Club are competitive and worth it for what you get. The location at 1st Ave. requires a 4-block aerobic ascent up E. 33rd St. to the No. 6 subway line at Lexington Ave. (downhill on the way home, though!), which gives it reasonably good access to the rest of Manhattan. It\u2019s easily reachable from LaGuardia. I have stayed at Envoy Club on four occasions, mainly when in town to see Broadway shows. I like being away from the Times Square commotion but only 2 stops away from the theaters by changing from the 6 line to the shuttle at Grand Central. The suites are roomy and tastefully decorated in muted grays, blues and earth tones. In the suite I rented most recently, the bedroom was a generous 19x13 ft. and the living room was 19x12 ft. The living room includes a glass dining table with seating for four. There\u2019s also an 8x9 ft. kitchen with marble countertops and clean, new, full-size major appliances, microwave and coffeemaker. The bed was comfortable, and linens and towels were of good quality. I found the furniture to be clean and in good condition. There are TVs in both the living room and in the bedroom and a stereo and fax machine (yes, a fax machine) in the living room. The windowless bath is decorated in classic white and black tile with attractive ceramic molding. Fixtures are modern and clean, including a tub/shower combination, and hot water was prompt and plentiful. There is substantial closet and cabinet space, including closets in the bedroom and in the entry vestibule. Service at the front desk is a mixed bag. Some staff are friendly and helpful, others are non-communicative and uninterested. There is a doorman who actually works for the apartments in the building that are not part of Envoy Club, but the added security presence is nice. The maid service was good. A fitness center is available for use, but I have never seemed to find the time to use it, so I can\u2019t report on its quality. The location is close to the NYU Hospital on 1st Ave., so depending on which side of the building you\u2019re on, it\u2019s possible to hear emergency vehicle sirens (ubiquitous in New York, anyway). However, the Envoy Club occupies floors of the building that are high enough from street level to keep noise fairly minimal (ca. 5th-7th floors I believe). I heard no sounds at all from neighbors and always slept well. The Bad: As has been noted, the carpets are worn and due for replacement. However, I personally don\u2019t find them bad enough to keep me from staying there. Unfortunately the place has cut corners in equipping the kitchen. I like to cook for myself at least part of the time and also invite a local friend to join me for dinner in, so the kitchen is one of the attractions of the Envoy Club for me. Basic flatware, dinnerware, cooking utensils, and pots and pans are provided, though in sparse quantities. However, unlike many vacation apartments, absolutely no additional amenities or conveniences are provided in the kitchen. There was not even a dish cloth or dish towel. I had to go to one of the nearby Gristede\u2019s supermarkets to buy paper towels to put in the empty paper towel holder. I suppose when I checked out the paper towels I provided were removed rather than left in place for the next guest. Salt and pepper shakers are provided, but they\u2019re likewise empty. The maid will leave a couple of little filter packs of coffee for the coffeemaker, but you might want to plan to buy some while there or bring coffee with you. Another thing to be aware of is that internet connection in your suite will be an optional extra that is separately billed. It was worth the extra charge for me to be online, and the internet connection available at a desk/work station in the bedroom was very functional. However, I would have preferred having internet connectivity included in the price of the room, and it wouldn\u2019t bother me at all if the fax machine in the living room were dispensed with. The Ugly: Not that the management has any control over the views, but I\u2019ll just note that the various suites I\u2019ve rented over time have had very different views, from the Empire State Building splendidly framed in the living room window, to, most recently, a full-on view of a hideous nondescript building located across E. 33rd St. to the south, probably dating from the late 1960s. The windows in that monstrosity are cluttered with desperate and very tacky window shades and what appear to be stacks of manila folders. Shades of Novosibirsk. Other notes: There are at least two Gristede\u2019s supermarkets in easy walking distance from the Envoy Club, for example just south on 3rd Ave., as well as numerous small groceries, delis and shops. I enjoy the Eastside Midtown / Murray Hill scene, including some interesting restaurants and taverns close by on 2nd Ave. It\u2019s worth a walk in the neighborhood to discover some of the local opportunities. For example, I stumbled across a wonderful concert of Bach harpsichord music at the historic Moravian Church on Lexington Ave. near E. 30th St. There is also a multi-screen cinema around the corner on 2nd Ave. Macy\u2019s is walkable from here as well. For me the positives outweigh the negatives, especially the location and the spacious interiors, and I\u2019m likely to return to Envoy Club in the future.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cA bit odd...\u201d", "Author": "UkTim2008", "ReviewID": "UR113089661", "Content": "This seems like a serviced appartment that doubles up as a hotel.

Unfortunately, the sofa bed was such poor quality that my son had to sleep on it at a strange angle (his feet a good six inches below his head). What was more disappointing, was the fact that as it was a corner suite, there were approximately 8 sets of roman blinds to adjust to cover the windows. Half of these did not close properly, and the brass ropes were very dirty (as were the curtains themselves). Furthermore, the noise form the traffic (why does everyone hoot 24/7 in NYC?) was very audible.

I always use Tripadvisor before planning a trip, and had read many reviews about the Envoy Club before I booked. That said, most of the reviews about this hotel are accurate. I chose the Envoy for its proximity to our daughter in the Murray Hill area of the city, and cost. Having spent many weekends visiting the city, I am always looking for good, clean, and reasonably priced accomodations. I am always amazed at the prices that hotels charge in this city! For the most part, The Envoy Club Suites met my needs. First, the good part: At $199 per night, this place is a bargain in New York City. The suite was large and had a full kitchenette. The appliances were clean, the bathroom was large (although a bit outdated), the bed was comfortable, and the linens were clean. Except for the occasional ambulance noise (the hotel is located accross the street from NYU Medical center), the neighborhood is extremely quiet and safe. Now the bad: The Envoy Suites Hotel isn't really a hotel at all. Rather, I got the feeling that an individual/group purchased a number of studio apartments within an apartment building and run their \"hotel\" out of the building. Except for its close proximity to the hospital, it really is not in a convenient location at all. The lobby is quite nice and there is a doorman at the front desk for the apartment building. There was a small desk around the corner for the Envoy Suites, but I never saw anyone at the desk. It was always unattended. So concierge service is non-existent. The doorman is useless. So basically, check-in consists of picking up your key at the front desk from someone unaffiliated with the \"hotel\". Once you get past the nice foyer, this hotel goes downhill fast. Exiting the elevator reminds one of an old college dorm, in desperate need of an overhaul. The lighting is dark and the carpeting is stained. Really a horrible first inmpression. Our suite (#411) was at the end of this dark hall, around the corner. My initial impression was that we had to leave...fast. But after a day of travelling, we were too tired to think about that option. Entering the suite was a pleasant surprise. It was quite large by NY standards and well appointed. One of the curtain sheers was quite stained from water, and there was a glass stain on the table, but other than that, the room was pretty nice. Again, the carpet was in need of replacement. There were two safes in the closet. They were not operational, and were not bolted down...kind of odd. One of the two air-conditioners worked. I didn't bother to tell anyone because I knew from previous reviews that noone was around to help me anyway. Given, that the weather was 90-plus degrees and humid, this was a bit of a nuisance. So for $199/night in NYC, this traveller got a lot of space, in an inconvenient location, with no guest services, in accomodations equivalent to your typical roadside hotel/motel. A little rough around the edges and in need of an upgrade. Would not stay here again as some of the larger hotel chains have rooms with comparable prices in town. The difference being that at least there is someone around in case you need something.", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNo Luxury at all!\u201d", "Author": "stay99", "ReviewID": "UR65170034", "Content": "I have to start out by saying this is my first review I decided to write because I am started to rely on the reviews of Trip Advisor.

Mattress is 'firm', not my personal choice, but quite comfy. Fold-out is basic but K is very happy, especially after she commandeered my down comforter, leaving me a blanket. Wi-fi is $10. kitchen is well equipped, bath is superb, both are squeaky clean. Linens are Frette, crisp and new. Carpet and floors easily pass the Barefoot Test. Staff are very professional and helpful - good advice on local eateries, and when i told them about the toilet running and the smoke alarm beeping, both were repaired pronto. Envoy would be a 5 except for the location in Kip's Bay or Murray hill, i cant figure which. it is off the beaten track in lower midtown. We're walkers, but some might like to be closer to the action. on the other hand, it is very close to two of our new faves, 2nd Street Deli, with the best pastrami on the planet, between 3rd and Lex on E33rd, and LaSalle Ice Cream at 489 Third, where all is house-made by hand, and just superb - better than Italy.

I am actually in the business or I probably never would've found this place, since I never heard of it before. All in all it suited my needs. I just needed the studio room but it was actually larger than I expected for NY and I was surprised that the kitchen was a full working kitchen, oven included not just the stovetop and microwave I'd expected, so that was a nice plus. Location was very good to anyone who wanted to be near midtown Manhattan-it's right off the FDR near NYC Medical Center and within walking distance to the everything. The main complaint, if I would call it that, was although I was only there for 2 nights and they do have housekeeping available, this was the only hotel I have ever stayed in that didn't leave an extra roll or two of toilet paper in the bathrooms and I literally ran out just as I was getting ready to check out. Maybe it was an oversight or maybe they have a rash of guests stealing toilet paper, but it was weird. And the other thing I would point out to anyone staying is this isn't an actual \"hotel\", it's part of a condo unit and they only have the front desk available during the day until 8:30pm. I found out the next day that a family member had tried to call me at 9PM in the evening but there is no one to transfer the call and you only get a recording saying someone will contact you ASAP. I know most people these days have cell phones but I do not and had that been an emergency I would never have been reached at night. Just something to keep in mind if you don't have a cell.

About a 10 minute walk to Macy's makes it reasonably accessable however bear in mind when you want to get around to see everything New York seems huge when you've only few days in which to do it. The reviews here vary a lot & personally I think people may be a little disillusioned by the pictures and descriptions of the apartments. Yes, they are fitted with the best of everything however it's all gone just a little shabby ... do not let this put you off if it's an apartment you're looking for as they are spottlessly clean and we actually found the staff to be very friendly. The kitchen is well equiped; beds comfortable; bathrooms large with great shower pressure and if its freezing cold, as it was during our visit, the heating system is fantastic. If you're in New York to shop you MUST visit Jersey Gardens www.jerseygardens.com. Take the 111 bus from the Port Authority building - approx 40 minute ride; fare approx $4.50 single (much better value than may $38 to get to Woodbury Common!). This mall is completly indoors with comfy couches so you sit and rest between shopping bursts. Remember as well that there is no extra tax added on to clothes prices in New Jersey as there is in Manhatten.

There were 5 of us in a 2 bed 2 bath apartment on the 4th floor for 5 nights, which I'm sure is bigger than most New York apartments. Plenty of closet space and a large safe, not those pokey toy ones. I wanted to move in permanently. It was great to have somewhere where all 5 of us could spend time together rather than being in separate hotel rooms. The full kitchen was well appointed and well worth having. The furnishings were of a good standard and fairly up to date, the beds were very comfortable as was the sofa bed according to the designated sleeper. The bathrooms were clean and the showers had decent power. Location wise the hotel is well located only a few blocks from the Empire State Building and not to far from Macys. Being on 33rd, cabs were rarely more than $ 10.00 up or downtown. If you're getting a cab back get them to drop you on 33 and 2nd Ave, then walk to the Envoy Club, saves going round the block to the hotel door. Bedding is normally already made up in the sofa bed, you may have to ask for pillows though. There are loads of convenience stores, delis and a cinema near the Envoy Club.
