We opted for Ca' Nigra for the second stop on our honeymoon in September, and we'd thoroughly encourage anyone to follow our footsteps. The room was stunning, hotel standards excellent, the place itself has real history and charm, and the staff made us very welcome indeed. Breakfasting in the garden is a real pleasure in Venice. Anyone who's been there will recognise the paucity of green spaces, so to start the day with espresso, pastries and fruit in the sunshine is stunning - as real treat. Mind you, since Ca' Nigra offers drinks at sunset it's an absolute pleasure to start the evening with something nice watching the boats and gondolas cruise past before heading into the town. The hotel is superhumanly easy to locate whether you arrive by train or plane - not even five minutes walking from the main station. And it's easy to spot from the bridges or the other side of the Grand Canal too, given the lush garden. Location-wise it's a ten/fifteen minute wiggle through the Venetian alleyways to San Marco, but within easy immediate striking distance of a few pleasant (and more \"local\") campi; the staff recommended some great spots to us, not necessarily on the beaten track, but getting out isn't an issue if you're happy to wander and explore. Get a room with a canalside view - opening the doors to your balcony over the water (spectacular Gran Canal or the smaller/quieter Rio Marin) never gets dull, and be sure to get a boat taxi. The hotel has it's own speedboat undeground picking up spot, which doesn't exactly make for a bad start to the evening.

While the rate of around 200 euro a night was steep, I think I got what I paid for. I can recommend my room, #11, located on the first floor just past the reception desk. It was large with antique appointments and a modern sleek bathroom designed with Italian sensibilities. It was a pleasure to swing open the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s windows and gaze out upon the little narrow canal that runs alongside the building, watching the gondolas and work boats gliding by just a few yards away. Best of all, the room has a private door that opens directly onto one of the resort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two gardens. As other reviewers have mentioned, this first floor room was noisy and I could hear voices from the reception desk area\u00e2\u20ac\u201da particular problem when one is trying to sleep. I think the management could solve this problem by installing a second set of soundproof doors in the room, or perhaps just a sliding acoustic curtain. There is certainly sufficient room for such an accommodation in the door\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s large frame. My own solution was a traveler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expedient: I pretended the people outside were my relatives chatting away in the kitchen. I did a little investigation of the other rooms on the first floor: #10, adjacent to mine, is a little smaller and also has a direct door to the same private garden. #12 is directly across the reception area; #13, #14 and #15 are down a short hallway adjacent to the breakfast area; none have direct access to a garden. #15 seemed the best of the last lot and is adjacent to an exterior door that takes you out to yet another garden on the Grand Canal. Breakfast consisted of high quality biscuits and croissants, and great coffee (I asked for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153long\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or American coffee) in the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s charmingly designed breakfast area. Request their menu of additional paid-for choices (I had prunes and muesli) if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not on the table. After breakfast I wandered out onto the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s front garden and watched the busy boat traffic on the Grand Canal. Negotiating Venice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s narrow, maze-like streets can be challenging for the first-time traveler, so I was fortunate to reserve rooms within a 10-minute walk of the train station (Stazione Santa Lucia). When I left the station I turned left and walked a short distance through a busy area packed with small hotels and restaurants to a pedestrian bridge (Ponted. Scalzi) over the Grand Canal. (Be prepared to climb 40 modestly graduated steps to the top, then the same number down). Once off the bridge I walked straight ahead, taking the second left (the first is a dead end, as I discovered) and continued a short distance over a smaller bridge, then past an ancient church (S. Simeone Grande). I turned left at the first opportunity and found myself on an open square, or campo. The entrance to the hotel was just ahead to the left. It occurred to me that travelers with heavy luggage might want to avoid the large bridge near the train station and take the vaporetto, or water bus, instead. So I also traced out that route, taking the #1 line at the Ferrovia stop, located in front of the train station. (Take the boat marked \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lido,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rather than \u00e2\u20ac\u0153P. Le Roma,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which goes the other direction). I traveled one stop to the Riva Di Biasio station. Leaving the boat I turned right, walked to the second left and walked a few yards to the first right, which took me down a narrow street to the open square. Ca Nigra was straight ahead. As the above remarks suggest, it would be prudent to obtain a good quality street map prior to arrival in Venice, which presents the traveler with a confusing maze of walkways. Be prepared for some backtracking, though: I did not find a single map that was really accurate. Even Google maps is confounded by the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s idiosyncratic medieval sensibilities.

Cons: Internet connection (wifi) in room was spotty at best, and is not free. 5 Euros for 3 hours = 3 hours total useage, and not 3 contiguous hours. Wifi signal very strong in the public areas of the hotel. AC was too cold, we couldnt figure out how to reduce the cooling the temp and staff could not help with this either.

Only other annoyance, we wanted a \"nightcap\" and coincidentally, another couple from the hotel did as well at the same time. Since the kitchen and food service were closed at the time (23:00), we had to wait for the front desk person to get some whiskies and grappas for us.

The visit confirmed us in the belief that it is an outstanding place to stay when visiting Venice; we shall certainly seek to go back. Its location is ideal, both when arriving in Venice and when going from the hotel to explore the city - by foot or by vaparetto. It stands actually on the Grand Canal, albeit at the \"unfashionable\" end of the canal. It has a parterre garden overlooking the canal and a green garden on the other side of the building - an extraordinary bonus for this crowded city. The building is attractive and the overal effect provides a real oasis away from the crowded streets. The interior is immaculate, cool and quiet - very modern, but with old features and furnishings cleverly blended in. The bedrooms and the beds are very comfortable indeed, with immaculate linen; it is certainly worth paying the (fairly modest) extra cost for a superior room, rather than a standard room. Perhaps it is even worth paying for a suite - we would not know! But in any event, the room rates are extremely good value. We booked on the hotel's own website. The breakfast is \"light\"/continental, but of high quality and beautifully presented in a very quiet breakfast area. Two small reservations: - The desk staff could show slightly more warmth. - The very modern designer bathrooms might not be to everyone's taste! For example, the concept of a shower door was evolved for a very good reason; showers should continue to have doors! But these are very small points.

We're in our low 30's. Service was fine, the breakfast was nice, and the front rose garden was beautiful - we could eat breakfast there (right on the Grand Canal!) and when we got back in the evening, we could relax at a table and hear live music coming from restaurants right across the Grand Canal, before we went to bed. We also loved getting back from a day of sightseeing --- we knew when we were close to home, because you could literally smell the jasmine that covers various walls in the beautiful courtyard. The A/C worked well (as well as any, in our experience in Europe in general, and Venice had a heat wave when we were there, with temps in the high 80s/low 90s). Our room was very nice -- it didn't blow us away, but we had no complaints, the bed was comfortable, etc. As for those who have an issue with the distance from St. Mark's Square, Doge's Palace, etc. --- for us, we had absolutely no issue with this. We bought a 3-day pass for the Vaporetto (the water \"bus\"), and very much enjoyed taking it to anywhere we wanted to go. When we got to the main sights and walked around, we realized we wouldn't have *wanted* to stay anywhere near that area anyway, because it was quite crowded and certainly more noisy. We highly recommend Ca' Nigra - their response to our e-mails prior to our trip were very courteous and timely. It's also very convenient to the bus/train station from which many people may arrive...a five minute walk to the hotel from there (if you don't get lost! just follow the *Grand Canal*), or a 60 second water taxi, I suppose.
