Check in & Check out went smoothly and the reception personnel were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were very large since they're suites, bathrooms were nice and beds very comfortable. The hotel overall is updated and clean. We ate dinner in the bar area and thought the prices were reasonable for a hotel in Chicago and the food was really good. The shuttle was prompt (every half hour for both pickup at the hotel and pickup at the airport, no reservation or phone calls required). We had a very early flight in the a.m. and our return flight got in very late, so it was important that the shuttle run 24 hours. Not all the hotels in the Park Sleep Fly program offer 24 hour service. Parking was covered and secure, which was also another perk other hotels did not all offer. The biggest thing for us was probably the fact when we arrived back at the hotel at about 1:00 a.m., we just wanted to get home after a long vacation and found the car battery dead. At that hour, there wasn't anyone around to ask for a jump and it would have taken 3-4 hours for Roadside Assistance to get there. I had resigned to the idea of just paying for another night at the hotel, but we asked the reception staff if anyone might be able to help us, and within minutes their hotel maintenance engineer was there with a portable jump starter and she stayed with us until we were sure the car battery was not going to die again. I wish I were better at remembering names, because we would love to give her a special thanks. They were so helpful and no one was cranky that we were asking for help in the middle of the night (which was on a whim, I never thought they would have someone around who would help us and for FREE). I would definitely stay here again.

I found the service to be excellent and they handled requests courteously and promptly. My room was a true suite, with a bedroom door that closes and a bathroom that had two doors--one to the bedroom and another to the living room. There was a small fridge along with a coffee maker and a room safe. Internet was around $10 a night but free for Platinum and above. There is a 24 hour pantry next to reception. I had no issues with lines at reception, thin walls, or other common problems, so maybe it was my lucky day. The workout facilities are better than I have seen in many other airport hotels, with a good workout room, an indoor pool where you can actually swim laps, a good sized hot tub next to the pool, and a sauna in the bathroom. The hotel is located next to the highway and I got some traffic noise from the bedroom but not the living room, so I guess it depends on the windows in your room. The way the hotel is situated it's hard to avoid the noise but it wasn't too bad unless you're sensitive. It's a 5-10 minute walk to the train that takes you to O'Hare (two stops) or downtown Chicago (40 minutes). It would be a tough walk in bad weather but fine in pleasant weather.

The Blue line is just about a block from the hotel - even my 82 yr old mother could handle that. Once on the blue line, it is a straight shot to the center of downtown and takes 30 - 40 minutes. Everything about the Renaissance was great with one exception. The sofa bed mattress was horrible. I really REALLY mean horrible. Perhaps if you had two small kids sleeping on it, it wouldn't be an issue but for an adult, it was very uncomfortable. The other two beds were very comfortable. The room was clean, the bathroom was roomy and the decorations were attractive. The hotel bar, which is the 'restuarant' at night, offered a limited menu and the music was too loud. Since the hotel is pretty much isolated and on an expressway, it was nice to have a place to grab a bite in the late evening. There is a Starbucks in the lobby serving pastry and coffee until about 5 pm. Internet is available in the room (wired) for about $10 and wireless is free in the hotel lobby. This was my third time staying at the Renaissance and while I don't really like having to take the train downtown each day, I don't like paying 'downtown prices' even more. The hotel seemed to be filled with guests yet it was very quiet, which we loved. I was afraid, with so many guests in the common areas, that it would be noisy at night but we didn't hear a peep.

The check-in process was very smooth, and though the hotel restaurant is very pricey, the bar has some great food as well at lower prices. The pizza there was really good (though my standards are likely lower than Chicagoans). I was worried about the fact that the hotel is directly under the airport flight path and next to a busy freeway, but it was completely silent in the room -- it is a well-constructed building. The room itself was spacious, bright and very comfortable. There were two HD flat-screen TVs, and an enormous bathroom and shower. There is a good fitness center and an indoor pool/spa. We were never able to use the pool or spa because of its limited hours, and every time we went to the area, there were many kids there -- our stay was during school holidays.

This is more than a lot of places inside the city charge for parking, however, this hotel is not in the city. It's in the middle of nowhere.

The service was great, the hotel was very nice, and it was a short walk to the blue line which will get you anywhere you need to go. The only downside was, there is no fast food joints around (mcdonalds or hardees for example) we drove around blindly for almost an hour before just deciding to go to the Dominicks grocery store down the road, which was a great place with a huge variety of food and drink.

We originally made a reservation at the Marriott O' hare directly across from this hotel on the other side of the highway. We changed our reservation and stayed at the Renaissance instead since the Marriott had some construction going on within the pool/ whirlpool areas.The check in time was speedy and the front desk employees were all pleaseant and quite upbeat. The hotel has a very spacious, modern and inviting lobby area. Lots of leg room and some really comfortable sitting spots. Our room was unusually large in comparison to most hotels that I have stayed at within the same general area. The room was in very good and clean condition. The bed was very comfortable and the refrigerator in the room was a great addition to the ammenities and sure kept our beverages cold. The hotel has a really spacious swimming pool and a pretty nice whirlpool as well. My only complaint was the water temperature of the whirlpool was luke warm at best. I contacted the front desk and the temperature was much better later that day. It is nice to know that complaints and feedback do actually get taken care of quickly. Well anyways, this hotel is extremely convenient for travel to see a Cubs game. Wrigley Field is no more than 35 minutes away. The train station is less than a block away. It cost us $5 each for a pass to get us to and from the ballgame. The Bell Captain at the hotel gave us accurate diections by train and it turned out to be a great ballgame. Go Cubs!! I Make sure that you check out Ginos East for some super tasty Chicago style pizza. It is across the highway and maybe a 5 minute drive. My only complaints about this hotel would be as follows. The hotel is off a main road and there is no sign at the roadway itself. We drove right past it. There is a dark colored hotel sign at the actual entry. However, It is somewhat challenging to read and did not appear to be well lit. Unlike the other reviews, I expect and anticipate being charged to park my car at a hotel in the Chicago area. However, the parking structure is incredibly busy at times at the spaces are unusually narrow. Make sure that you are careful opening your doors. You don't want to hit the car next to you. I think that flat screen tv's would be a welcoming touch. Thats it, overall beutiful hotel and really nice time to be had.

It was a bit shortstaffed, but that may have been due to the July 4 holiday. -Rooms are quite spacious and reasonably well appointed (although they are starting to look a bit worn in places), and remarkably quiet considering the stream of jets passing overhead en route to O'Hare. Negatives -Parking is very expensive ($20/night) - I paid almost that much to park overnight downtown. -Still a long way into downtown Chicago if that's what you intend to do.

Nice mini-fridge, no microwave, and a great coffee maker.

Nice large bathroom had large walk-in shower, but a very high countertop means you have to wheel the desk chair in so the kids can reach the sink to brush teeth.

But beware, they will hit your credit card with charges you will know little to nothing about until you get your credit card bill. We were at a function downtown and pre-paid for a room at this hotel. The hotel is nice as was the room. However, if you drive there and expect to park your car there please think twice. When we arrived it was raining, the valet service had cars parked in every conceivable spot, include more than a dozen cars with only two wheels still on the pavement and the rest of the car up over the curb. As a result, we were greated near the street by the value and handed our claim ticket. We walked into the front entrance and directly to the front desk to check in. No where did we see a sign advising of the parking charge for guests that park there. There is a sign, but it is way over on the side of the building next to the garage exit - not someplace we came anywhere close to. We were not informed by any staff of any charges for parking. I know some hotels do charge their guests for parking, but others do not. We stayed the night and when we left I checked out at the front desk and they said everything was taken care of. So I dropped off the room keys and went to get our car. We were not offered nor given a receipt. I assumed there was no need since there was no reason to have additional charges other than what I already paid for when I booked the room. Handing the car claim ticket to the valet service we then waited for the car to be brought out. And waited, and waited - we waited over 30 minutes. Again the drive was completely packed with parked cars they had yet to relocate into the parking garage. So when our car finally came out they had only one place they could put it and that was out near the street again - at least this time it was not raining. Having to check my credit card account for other reasons today I noticed several charges from the hotel. One was 25.01, and the other was 19.99. So I called, they had no idea what those charges were for - supposedly my card was to be charged $45 for parking and $5.99 for a bottle of water from the mini-bar that we never even opened. Parking in downtown Chicago on a weekend for any overnight rarely costs more than $25 at any parking garage. Thus this charge, which they neither got my consent for nor did they inform me of it at any time while at the hotel, is very excessive. After speaking with a manager at the hotel they agreed to remove the mini-bar charge, but refused to remove the parking charge. I have a great deal of problem with any business that takes free license to charge your credit cards without first informing you of those charges and obtaining your consent for those charges. Because they seem to be able to do this and have no problem doing it I would strongly advise that you avoid this hotel.", "Date": "May 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cSuperior Location to Airport, Nice Rooms\u201d", "Author": "jayseae", "ReviewID": "UR29380120", "Content": "We stayed two nights in this hotel, just a short distance from Chicago's O'Hare airport. The hotel offers a free shuttle service to and from the airport that runs about every 20 minutes, you can take the CTA blue line, which is just a 5-minute walk from the front door of the hotel, or I'm sure you can call a cab too (we didn't use a cab at all). The rooms of the hotel are nice, if a bit modern. The noise of the airport isn't bad, though there is an airplane headed overhead from time to time that you can hear. For being so close to one of the world's busiest airports, it's surprisingly quiet. Our room had no bathtub in it, which wasn't a big deal, but if for some reason you like a tub, this might be an issue for you. Check to see if they have one. While the hotel offers a unique 'dive in' movie every Friday and Saturday night at their indoor pool, where you can pull up a float or a lounge chair and watch a family movie by the pool, in practice it doesn't work very well. First, you can't listen to it because, well, kids are loud and pool enclosures tend to echo. Second, you can't see it very well because pools need a certain amount of lighting and the hotel didn't choose to use a very powerful projector. So if you want to choose this place solely for this purpose, it might not be the best choice. As you might surmise, the hotel isn't really family-friendly. This isn't to say it's a bad hotel, as it's not. It appears to be quite new, and everything is rather nice. But it is nestled among several office buildings, meaning there are really no choices for anything to do outside 'working hours', and very few things to do even inside those hours. The buildings themselves are alongside a rather large freeway. A somewhat residential area is available across the freeway, and there is a footpath across the freeway - but it's a bit of a hike. Because of that, the lack of a tub, and the design of the hotel's eating facilities, it is somewhat surprising that they even have a family night such as this one, as the two don't really fit together. But for us, the hotel served the purpose well, and we could easily catch the train into town when we needed to do so.

The clock radio is the most complicated I have ever seen. A card placed on it helpfully suggests arranging for a wake-up call instead. No breakfast is included and anything you buy will be expensive.

Very easy to enjoy the hotel and its ammenities. As other reviewers have noted, there is a 30-40 min ride into town on the blue line. The stop is adjacent to the hotel which makes it very convenient. Since this was a very leisurely trip for us, the ride to/from downtown Chicago wasn't a problem. We did purchase the 2-day visitor passes for $9 which worked well. (Note: our room was on the end closest to the train tracks/freeway and I heard the train all through the night. It didn't keep me awake, but I woke up several times each night). The room is well equipped, but not very large. We did use the sleeper sofa in the \"living room\" and when out, the bed took up about all of the floor space. The rooms have a coffee service area which is nice (to hold you over until you make it down to Starbuck's in the lobby!). The fridge is also handy. Most notable about our room was the \"olympic size\" shower! It was so huge it seemed you could run laps within it... My husband used the fitness room and said it was excellent.

It is a garage that is right next to the hotel but it seems like a bit of a scam to be that expensive.

This was my first encounter at the hotel and this certainly did not paint a good picture in my mind. However, after speaking with the hotel manager that was on for the night, I was very satisfied. The manager apologized for that employee's behavior and waived the parking fees for the weekend. I think that the specific girl at the front counter was an employee that was either having a bad day or just had a bad attitude in general. Either way, every other employee that I encountered was extremely nice and helpful. I did not use room service or the in house restaurant /bar...so I'm unable to comment about that. I unfortunately had the bad experience with the receptionist but I think that was truly an isolated incident.

It's a good thing we had another room because the second room was not ready until well after 6PM. This is my pet peeve -- waiting for my room! And from a Marriott? Shame shame. To the defense of the reception staff, they were embarrassed. I just told them to relax because I was going to dinner and would use the other room for now. And they did try to get the two rooms near one another -- just around the corner. The hotel is large and well-placed off the interstate, only blocks from the \"L.\" It's not far from a great forest preserve that we used for our morning walk/run. We came back for breakfast -- not include -- and very expensive for what you get on the buffet. The staff was very pleasant this morning, with a quick \"good morning\" and \"have a good day.\" And there wasn't anything really bad but I just didn't get a good feeling about the hotel. Our second room smelled soooo bad. The blinds were hanging off. Our shower head was a hair away from exploding. Still, the room was clean. The baths were marble. The price was right ($119).

In a city like Chicago, all hotels are going to be expensive, so we chose to stay close to O'Hare, where the rates are cheaper and we think we had great value for money. There didn't seem a lot to do in the immediate area, but the hotel served meals (which we didn't try, except for the breakfast) and if you are using the hotel as an overnight before a flight or a base to explore the city the lack of surrounding restaurants or entertainment wouldn't be a problem.

I travel significantly for business and write a review after almost every stay. I stayed at this hotel with my family (5 rooms total) and this, by far, was my worst experience all year. Here is the text of an e-mail I wrote to their business sales manager and director of operations. It sums up my experience. Molly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c You have a tough job. I booked 5 rooms for a family get together this past weekend at your property and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t plan on ever coming back. While you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re e-mail is addressed to my father-in-law because he came in on Thursday, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m the GOLD Marriott member. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be platinum later this year, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m platinum with Holiday Inn, and Silver with Hilton. I can tell you for a FACT, your hotel is the WORST property I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at all year. On Saturday, I spoke with the manager twice about all of the hotel problems and nothing of substance was done. The manager even told me he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have the Front Desk Manager contact me when they came in because they had more seniority. No contact was ever made. If you care to improve your property, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some pointers. 1)Train the front desk to acknowledge the reward members. All the survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s I get from Marriott ask this question, your hotel didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say a word. 2)I had two rooms in my name and you placed us on the 4th and 12th floors. I thought maybe the property was so booked that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all that was left but my brother-in-law checked in after I did and was placed on the 12th floor. He had the same room type as our room on the 4th. 3)When my teenage son was making his bed up he found only a blanket in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extra\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bedding packet. A call to your service line resolved it but we never should have needed to make the call. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in numerous properties where he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s used the extra bedding and this is the first time sheets were missing. 4)Whoever decided \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cool\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153warm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are good choices for HVAC obviously never stays in a hotel. Not having a digital HVAC system is a disgrace! 5)I did not have a morning paper. 6)You charge for the internet, another disgrace. Charging for the internet is similar to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153energy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd charges hotels tried several years ago. This may look like a money maker now, but travelers remember when properties take advantage of them via fees. This is an unjustified fee and will come back to haunt you in the long run. 7)Our room had a wet spot on the floor between the beds when we checked in. 8)Saturday morning there were no towels for the pool. I had to wait more than 20 minutes after asking the front desk. 9)The hot tub in your pool area didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. 10)After returning to our room from the pool Saturday morning, we found over a half dozen insects of some sort on the walls and ceiling of our room. The on duty manager captured them in a cup for your maintenance staff. 11)When we started to shower up on Saturday morning the tub handle fell off. I showed this to your manager on duty and maintenance staff when they were removing the bugs from our room and they promised to fix it. A simple screw is all that was needed. The job was never completed. The manager on duty suggested I e-mail john Harper with my concerns, which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done because this property is an embarrassment to the Marriott name. However, your staff, through their inattention to my issued, has created a significant amount of ill will. When I check into a Marriott property, I have a set of expectations. Those expectations are based on my pervious experiences at Marriott properties. All that I can conclude from my experience is that Mr. Harper doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 know how to manage a hotel or you have serious staffing issues. Either way something needs to change if you plan on succeeding.

LONG review!\u201d", "Author": "cruisermeg", "ReviewID": "UR7716551", "Content": "Recently stayed in this hotel for 3 nights over Memorial Day. The hotel is 16 stories and is located next to I-90, the El train, and about 1 mile from O'Hare-directly in the flight path depending on wind. When I arrived, I was greeted by the nice staff at the front desk and given a room on the Club Floor, Room 1625. Upon entering, you are in the living area of the room. There was an arm chair, 2 little square tables, a sofa (sofa bed), desk, chair, TV and a mini-armoire that contained a little refrigerator and an in-room safe. The Club Lounge would be closed for the weekend, so I was given coupons for a free \"full service\" breakfast. This room faced west toward O'Hare. Something bugged me about the living room, but it took a while to figure it out. The bedroom featured a king-sized bed, another TV and a closet containing an iron/board , clothes steamer/refresher and a robe. The bathroom was fairly large, with a stall shower (no tub) that was at least 3.5 feet x 5.5 feet, with a hand-held shower. The problems with the shower are that 1) the door opens out so the water gets all over the floor. 2) there is no handle on the inside of the door 3) no place to sit to shave your legs ladies! and 4) it is kind of dark! Plus, unless you are about a size 6, the robe won't fit! And, as the day went on, I noticed several other things wrong with the room. Honestly, I had higher expectations of the Renaissance, based partly on the other reviews here, and I was let down. The carpet had 3 very large stains on it just inside the door. The door itself was difficult to open and close. In the corner of the shower, there was a lot of mold on the grout between the tiles near the floor. Water pressure was minimal water pressure at best, the toilet seat was very loose and the A/C smelled of mildew all the time. Wound up keeping it off most of the day. There were crumbs on the floor between the tables and the furniture was really beaten up. The table was cracking and the desk had big gouges on it, and on the legs. For a Club Level room,. the place was really not up to Marriott standards. At this point, I finally realized what I disliked about the living area. The way it was set up made me feel like I was sitting in someone's office! Hard to explain, but I was really not comfortable. The bed, part of Marriott's new bedding package, was fairly comfortable, but neither the feather bed on top of the mattress nor the comforter were very fluffy and full. These both need to be washed and fluffed. Honestly, I have had regular blankets that are thicker. Yes, it is getting warm out, but I like to have a cold room and then a nice, fluffy down quilt! I gave the front desk the list of problems with the room. I really hate moving rooms, but the gal insisted that I go eat breakfast and stop back for a new room. Breakfast was another story. The coupon said \"full service\" meaning I should be able to order off the menu. Well, I was told I had to get the buffet. It wasn't bad. Actually, my omelet was cooked in real, melted butter and it was very good. But, my server did not ask me if I wanted toast or an English muffin (there was no toaster as is standard for Marriotts), nor did he get me Orange juice. I did get a little shot of strawberry smoothie which was good. The buffet had eggs, bacon (cold and soggy), sausage, fruit, cereals, oatmeal and cream of wheat, breakfast potatoes (with peppers and onions of course-yuck) and some muffins and coffee cake. The coffee cakes really looked to be of the Entenmann's or Sara Lee variety like you get in a grocery store. Why? They had those tell-tale aluminum foil cake pan marks on the side. Eh. The chef was very nice, the server was just OK. Returned to the desk and was moved to room 1630 which is one of the corner suites. Looks just like the photos on the Marriott website except there are no drapes, just 2 types of shades-a sheer and a black-out shade. The sheer shade in the bedroom would not go up! This room was very large. The living area was the size of a large hotel room itself! Closet, TV, dining-room table with 6 chairs, a stereo and lots of speakers (I guess you could use it for some sort of surround sound but I am not so inclined), desk, couch and arm chair. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s funny though, there is no lamp close to the sofa for reading! There is a big, ceiling lamp over the dining table, and a desk lamp but nothing close enough to sit and read at night. Hmm. At the risk of sounding mean, Marriott needs some women designing their hotels. Or at least people with common sense who actually USE their hotels! The bedroom had a king bed, TV, another closet and some drawers. The alarm clock even has directions! The bathroom here had an actual tub, with the hand held shower. And, on the inside of one of the doors, a lovely dirty kids' handprint! Great! This is supposed to be an even better room and the housekeeper doesn't check the inside of the doors! Details people!!! The robe in this room was thick, fluffy and of a size that would fit most normal-sized humans! At least this room didn't have that mildew smell from the A/C. The view was nice. You can see the Chicago skyline in the distance. And, you get to see the highway and the El! The hotel is very noisy. Not so much from other guests, but the trains, cars and planes can get on your nerves. I can live with airplane noise, but if you are a light sleeper, ear plugs are a MUST! The \"wired for business\" package for internet and local and long distance (domestic) calls is $9.95 per day which isn't bad. Parking is $20 per day. Food prices were a bit high for dinner. Some of the drink prices in the bar were reasonable. They had some featured drinks that were $7.00 and considering the amount and types of liquor in them, this was a reasonable price. (One had Patron tequila for which another Marriott charged $10 a shot! This stuff is super expensive!!) There is a Bennigans across the parking lot and the hotel is a very short walk to the Blue Line trains. (Cumberland station). You can purchase visitor's passes at the Cumberland station. They are in a different machine than the regular train/bus tickets. For $5, you can get unlimited rides on the El, CTA and PACE buses. Also, you can get either a 2, 3 or 7 day pass for $9, $12, and $20 respectively. These passes are a great deal considering it is $4 round trip to Chicago. And, if you ride the bus a couple times in a day, your pass will more than pay for itself. You can also get these passes at O'Hare, Union Station and a couple other places. The hotel does have a free shuttle to the airport. Never had to wait longer than about 10 minutes. Overall, the hotel staff was very nice, and it is a lovely property. However, it needs to be cleaner with respect to both rooms and public areas. For instance, there was \"stuff\" on the rug outside the elevator on the 16th floor for over 48 hours. This should have been vacuumed up! Breakfast on subsequent days was better; although it took until the final day for the server to ask if I wanted toast! I met the restaurant manager and spoke with him at length about my issues. He actually gave me a coupon for a complimentary appetizer in the bar since the Club Lounge was closed. I had steak quesadillas that were very good. The bar was empty, save for one other couple. Service was friendly but less than attentive. Wound up leaving due to the foul language being used by both the woman and man sitting down the bar. I will skip the lecture about not using filthy language in public. Please, show some class! There was a billing error at checkout. I was charged for too many nights (I had a coupon for a free night) and I was charged for internet service for two days, which was only used once. The person at the desk seemed a bit annoyed that she had to fix it for me. Perhaps it was just too early? I would say that 98% of the staff was wonderful. There are just a couple people who need some extra training in customer service. With a good rate, I may consider returning, but there are other hotels that I think are in better shape than this Renaissance. This is supposed to be a more upscale brand than a regular, full service Marriott. In my opinion, the rooms are a little too \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cold\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and stark. I guess this is the new trend, but it makes this place seem too much like an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153office\" and less like a hotel. Yes, it is geared to business travelers, but there is a fine line between office, and a hotel room with space to work. To me this place is an office that happens to have a bed. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t horrible, just not the best. Again, this is just my opinion. Different strokes for different folks.

I never heard much noise from the hallway or outside. The bed was comfy and I slept well. The train station into the city is a very short walk away (just across the parking lot), which was perfect! There is also a Starbucks in the lobby for that morning coffee fix. I ordered room service for breakfast on my last morning, and the food was quite good. Also, the shuttle service to the airport was a great perk.

Their shuttle is supposed to pick up every 20 mins., starting at 6am. Well, 15 mins. passed and there was no shuttle. I also found out another person who was standing at the same door had also been waiting for the shuttle...since before 6am. I called the hotel again, and was told the shuttle had come by twice already, but we'd never seen it. Finally, at 6:40, the shuttle arrived. So, don't count on this service to be on-time. -I left my hotel room at 10am and was gone until 10pm. Of course, I expected maid service to come by in my absence. When I got back, I found the room exactly as I'd left it! When I complained about this to the front desk on my way out, the receptionist told me that I have to call and request maid service because sometimes they don't clean the rooms! I've been in much cheaper hotels that had maid service every day.", "Date": "May 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Iowan", "Title": "\u201cWhat a great hotel!\u201d", "Author": "iowakrb", "ReviewID": "UR7365946", "Content": "My mother, son, and I stayed at this hotel for a weekend getaway. What a really wonderful hotel! Our suite was very nice, and I loved the bathroom. There is no tub, however, which was a disappointment for my mother. The shower is huge though, and there's plenty of space in the bathroom. The bed was quite comfortable, and had 7 pillows on it. There was a television in both rooms, which was handy. We booked the breakfast package, which I highly recommend. The buffet breakfast in the restaurant, \"Fresh\", was delicious. Along with fruit, breads, meats, and cereal, there was a made to order breakfast station where a chef would make you an omelet, pancake, waffle, eggs, whatever. Along with the breakfast you get a free strawberry banana smoothie in a shot glass, which was a fun idea. The stay for breakfast package was only an additional $15, so for the 3 of us was a great deal. The hotel also has a great pool area, including a hot tub and sauna in each locker room. The pool itself is huge. On Friday nights they have swim up movies, where they show a movie on one wall of the pool area to watch while swimming. My son loved it, and it really kept him occupied! By far my favorite thing about this hotel, though, was the staff. I have never seen a hotel staff so seriously oriented toward customer service. Everyone we came in contact with was so helpful and cheerful! The front desk people were great, and the restaurant workers were amazing with my son. I would absolutely stay at this hotel again, in a heartbeat. It's a great deal, and not too far from downtown Chicago. It's near a subway station, so no need to worry about driving! No airport noise, in fact no noise of any kind in our room.

What a treat! Amazing room, it was like a mini suite with seperate sleeping area off from the sitting area. It had two tv's (which for me was a big deal), the most comfortable bed ever, prompt service, lovely people, gorgeous bathroom. Really one of the best hotels i've stayed at. We had a rental car but it looks like the metro would be an easy way to get to downtown Chicago. The only thing was we had a bit of a hard time finding the place at first. It's in one of those locations where you can see the hotel, but have to figure out how to get to it. We called the hotel 4 times and they sort of walked us through finding them. Once we were there, it was easy to get to...otherwise - fantastic hotel!!!", "Date": "March 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "Arkansas2Traveler", "ReviewID": "UR7012369", "Content": "I was stuck in Chicago overnight when my flight got canceled out from Ohare due to the weather.

The only problem I encountered when here was that I had to wait a good amount of time for the shuttle to the airport to come. I probably waited 30 minutes or so.
