The hotel is small sand seems a budget hotel, no fancy decoration, no resaurant, it is only provide accomodation. My friend search a hotel not expensive with me and we walk there, one single room with bathroom only US$100 !!! Do you know it is so hard to found a room in the central of NYC middle town which is so near everything eating and buy and sightseeing. subway is not far away, plus tax it only charge me US$110. Room is small just have a regular bathroom which including shower, sink, toilet bowl, the water seems not really hot and a bit mal-function cause I turn the hot water for 1 mins but it seems not hot and I didn't get help. The toilet seat have cigarette burning mark, the sink for face washing is so narrow. But it still provide tower , shower gel, shampoo, conditioner. On the wall side there have a heater, at the beginning there have some sound and I worry will it explose ??? it won't. After soon it getting quite. I live in 1 floor, the view is facing the street, nice and wide, full of sunshine and tree, facing a building ( I think it is a school or smiliar) by a widing road, like you living in a quarter, with nice view, building, tree, square, ....despite the window is narrow and long. Inside the room not much facilities, but the essential item it will have like heate, TV, bathroom. But there have NO safety box, wrobeboard with door, mp3 speaker, Everything is simply and basic. Want do you expect for a room just cost u US$100 in NYC so bustling and expensive place. Everything eat, shop, sightseeing is so nearby, and that place I think is the cheaper place for eat and shop and drink (lot of bar around), and lot of trendy and modern ppl there, handsome guy and beautiful girl walk around. Nearby have University, so this area is fully of energy. If you have not must expect for a hotel or a room and you got not much money, this hotel is really suit for you. At least you got your own bathroom in the room.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Absecon, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cSimple and inexpensive\u201d", "Author": "madammermaid", "ReviewID": "UR126157462", "Content": "Stayed here for 1 night.

Even Saint Marks Hotel quoted their regular rates but added $50 for New Year's Eve night. But even so, the total cost for the week was way under any other hotel I researched ($1250). By the way, THEY DO NOT TAKE CREDIT CARDS!! So bring Traveller's Cheques or a large amount of Cash (which I do not suggest you do while traveling!) I booked the largest (and most expensive) room: \"Suite: 2 Full-size beds Deluxe\". It was nothing fancy and was only a step up from a hostel. The room was actually two rooms with a partial wall between. We each had our own small bathroom (very small shower stall), flatscreen tv with remote, one chair and an open cabinet (with two top shelves) which had three hangers for our clothes. The full- (or double-) sized beds were comfortable with four pillows of varying softnesses. Daily maid service was good--except that they got a bit stingy on the hand towels as the week went on. Noise from the street was typical of anywhere in Manhattan. We just turned on the individual A/C units and let them run all night. (Even though it was an A/C unit, we could adjust the temperature to make them blow hot air.) The BIG NEGATIVE of this hotel is that there is a LARGE FLIGHT OF STEEP STAIRS to get to the hotel office. We asked for a room on the lowest floor and we were placed on the second floor. Guess what? There is ANOTHER LARGE FLIGHT OF STEEP STAIRS to get to the second floor!!! I didn't venture up to the upper floors, but I assume there are more stairways... Thankfully, the hotel staff was kind enough to help us with our large suitcases upon check-in and check-out. My daughter & I are of average fitness and it was rough for us to climb those stairways at the end of every day after going to museums, sightseeing & shopping! The best part of the stay was Ray's Pizza Bagel Cafe that is located below the hotel. They had a huge selection of food--open morning 'til late at night--with reasonable prices! I have a very restricted diet (for medical reasons) and even I could find something yummy to eat! Another great place is \"The Smith\" Restaurant on 3rd Avenue. It is a great bistro-style eatery. We ate a delicious Saturday brunch there. The area where Saint Marks Hotel is located is ok. My nephew (who is in finance) lives a couple of blocks away, so I figured it was safe for a mom & daughter. The hotel entrance is surrounded by tattoo shops so the atmosphere is a bit rough. Access to subway is a couple of blocks away. Also, K-mart is close if you've forgotten to pack any necessities. We stopped in there to buy cheap knit hats due to the temperature dropping to 25F!", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cI don't want anyone to know about this place!\u201d", "Author": "Canadian09876", "ReviewID": "UR120465199", "Content": "But here goes anyway: This is the only place I like to stay in NYC. I \"discovered\" it the very first time I went to New York and didn't realize what a steal it was. I went back a few months later and it was booked up and only then did I realize how much I love the location and the price. You get a safe, clean, air conditioned room with an LCD TV and DVD player and full cable, your own bathroom and fresh towels and a made-up room ever day, right in the East Village, for like, half the price of any other comparable room in the city. One trip, a bunch of my friends all booked rooms here (about 14 of us) and no one had any complaints, so it's not just that I'm easy to please. I stayed with 3 girlfriends once and we got 2 double beds for $160. Try to do New York for $40 a night -- try to do ANYWHERE for $40 a night -- and you won't come close to this place. Staff are pretty nice, never had a problem. If you need directions someplace, they will print you up a google map or whatever. I guess this place is not for everybody. I once heard an older lady complain that it was \"too noisy\" and the guy at the desk said, \"Lady, it's New York!\" (ha ha. I just turn on the air conditioner or fan if it gets noisy on the streets below). Yes it's cash only and there's no elevator, but if that's important to you, go stay somewhere else because I don't want this place getting too popular! One thing that's a drag is that WiFi is really expensive, but it's free without a password at the Film Academy Cafe across the street.

It was close to family and inexpensive but knew it wasn't top notch. Offered credit card to confirm reservation but told they don't take credit cards? Thought that was odd but... Called 2 weeks before my reservation and was told everything was set. Called the afternoon of August 3rd and told same... they were ready for us and looking forward to our stay. On the 4th we were dropped off by our airport car, baggage unloaded on sidewalk and car drove away. Turned and found the hotel doors were locked! After several minutes a man who said he was the manager invited us into the foyer and told us there was a problem... the Fire Department had closed the hotel due to fire code violations. I asked why I hadn't been advised of this when I called the day before and he pointed to a letter posted on the wall from FDNY that was dated August 3rd and cited the closure. The manager proceeded to tell us that he had taken the liberty of reserving a room for us at their sister hotel which was on 56th (?) and something, several miles from our son's apartment. I declined their offer and expressed my frustration that they had not bothered to phone me about the closure. I had previously given them my office and cell phone numbers but no call. Again, he pointed to the FD letter dated August 3rd and said they had just received the order from the FD and didn't have time to contact me. I was fortunate to find better and more reliable hotel nearby. While searching for the new hotel, I noted a review in Tripadvisor in which the reviewer spoke about the closure of St. Marks in May, 2011 due to fire code violations. This suggests to me the hotel has been closed at least since May, 2011 but they continue to take reservations and probably change the date on the Fire Department letter everyday to claim that the closure was so recent, that they were unable to contact their guests to advise of the closure and to give them time to make reservations elsewhere rather than at their 'sister' flophouse up town.

You don't need any credit card to book and once there u can pay everyday or the whole stay if u want to.There's an ATM in the hotel.The hotel is great for young people who spend most of their time out, if you're looking for a quite hotel where u can rest and hang out in the room then forget it, I would not recomend it for couples but if u're traveling with friends like I did then it's totally fine and pretty cheap for a great location. If the room's not ready when u get there u can leave ur luggage to the front desk while u're out.Same on the check out day, when we got back they had a room opened for us so we could put away our last minute shopping and be confortable carrying our suitcases.

It's located in a great area of New York (close to where my sister used to live, so I might be a little biased)...every other step is an interesting restaurant or bar, there's so much life, off the beaten path for tourists, etc. BUT... this hotel is extremely basic, even by NY standards. I booked a room for one night, and then 4 rooms for the following night because my fiance's family would be arriving. Our room was the $140 room with one full size bed. The bed was pushed into the corner and there was literally about 2 feet of space to walk on the other two sides of the bed...not very comfortable with 2 people and their suitcases. The bathroom is also extremely small....but on a positive note the water pressure was fabulous! There was no closet, but instead a basic shelving unit built into the wall with a pole about 8 inches long on which to hang clothing. Noise wasn't an issue for us, but we were on the 2nd floor, so I'm not sure if it's bad on the first floor. Be warned...this hotel only takes cash! I realized this the day I left for NY (I guess I should've read these reviews more carefully!), but if I had known before, I might have changed to a different hotel because \"cash only\" just sounds shady to me. In the end, it was a positive for me...my fiance and I decided to cancel our reservations for the 2nd night (we were able to find rooms at the much nicer Wellington Hotel for the same price through priceline.com-- we named our own price), and when I informed the front desk that we would be cancelling our reservation for all 4 rooms, the woman told me that there was a 48 hour cancellation policy. I quickly responded that I didn't pay anything (they had given me the option to pay one night at a time, so that's what I did), and she very angrily informed me that they would make a note of this and make sure I never made a reservation there again. I felt a little bad about possibly [----]them out of getting paid for 4 rooms, since they might not be able to book those rooms on such short notice, but then again, they choose not to take credit cards...if they had, they would have been able to charge me a fee or something for cancelling. They probably do the cash only thing so that they'll save money on taxes by not having to report all their profits, but the downside is that they have nothing on guests who decide to bail out on reservations. So now I'm blacklisted from the St. Marks Hotel. Can't say I'm heartbroken about it...To be honest, if it hadn't been for the fact that my future in-laws were traveling from across the country and I would have been embarassed to show them this place, I might have actually stayed my 2 nights at the St. Marks Hotel. It wouldn't have been the most comfortable nights of my life, but they would've been tolerable, and possibly worth it if I were able to enjoy the area. Still, I don't know that I would choose to stay there again (assuming I weren't blacklisted). I think I'm getting too old for shady hotels like this.

The guys on reception were always friendly. We were told you could pay the whole lot up front or pay day by day before 12pm. There is a cash machine down the hall. We went for the standard room ($140). It was the cheapest hotel I could find without a shared bathroom. The room was small but very clean and tidy. If I had the money I think it would be worth paying for a 2 x double room ($170) for the extra space if you were staying for a week or more. The bathroom was small but immaculate with clean towels (replaced every day) and a few toiletries. The shower was very temperamental, there was no cold water (sound like a strange complaint?) but probably just a one off. Room had a tv, wardrobe and air con. The air con was pretty noisy but we needed it, and it disguised the noise from the street. Would definitely recommend asking for a room away from the road as it was noisy all through the night at the weekend (although it died off during the week). You'll get a lot of traffic noise wherever you stay in New York though! As for the prostitutes, we did encounter one trying to check into the hotel, accompanying an elderly gentleman ;) Still, we're open minded and it wasn't like some sort of brothel or anything like some of the reviews would have you believe!! I'm sure things like that could happen in any hotel under your nose and you'd never know! As for the area, the hotel sits on top of a bar and a pizza parlour of which you could not hear or smell in the room. The pizza place was great for a quick bite or to grab some beers for the room. There's a couple of supermarkets nearby should you need anything more, and plenty more bars and restaurants in St Marks Place. St Mark's has a lot of alternative and retro clothing shops (right up my street!) and is very similar to Camden in London (should you have ever been). I loved it. It's a very cool place, however I can imagine that some types of people aren't comfortable, but more fool them if they haven't researched where they are staying! The \"Colourful characters\" that one person described are just students, a few punks and alternative people (tattoos, dyed hair and piercings) which is nothing compared to the gangs and prostitutes that I was imagining!

For us, the St. Mark\u2019s is our home away from home when we visit NYC. I would like to respond to some of the concerns raised by other reviewers. They do not rent rooms by the hour. There is no greater concentration of prostitutes in this hotel than in any other NYC hotel. The locals, while colorful, are (mostly) not drug addled criminals. Your fellow guests are (mostly) not \u201cweirdoes\u201d but adventurous, young-at-heart, budget minded travelers not unlike yourself. Legitimate concerns about the hotel are few, but may be significant to some travelers. The hotel accepts cash only. There is no elevator, and some of the staircases are steep and narrow. The street life on St. Mark\u2019s place is vibrant, sometimes noisy, and goes on into the early morning hours. This is not a business class hotel and provides few amenities beyond safety, cleanliness, and affordability.

I'll start with the highlights: a very reasonable price for well maintained (even beautiful) rooms with pristine clean lining changed every day. Room service was excellent, beds comfortable, and an excellent location, especially if you're looking for inexpensive and good quality food and nightlife. And the most important: and excellent pub, located right outside the hotel's door, with the nicest bartenders I've ever met (thank you Dan and Anna!). Even though you have to take a Metro to go to NYC's main attractions, there's a Metro station less than a block away from the hotel. The neighborhood is very trendy and interesting, but a little bit too freak for my taste. Now the low points: First of all, it's very, very noisy (mainly due to the street), so I really recommend you to ask for an interior room. With the exception of the couple that worked in the morning, service was incredibly impolite and rude, so don't expect any useful information or help from them. Even try not to ask them anything, because they can mislead you terribly! To close my comments some tips: make a reservation by phone in advance; they only accept cash, but there's an ATM inside the hotel, and, finally, look for the hidden adult channel on the TV by manually browsing channel numbers!

You are just off Broadway in Greenwich Village. While the hotel is technically in the East Village it is central enough to let you be in the West Village in less than 5 minutes and you are a 3 minute walk from the lovely Washington Square Park. The hotel is 2 minutes walk to the 4,5,6, subway and 3 minutes to the NRW which takes you up Broadway to Times Square and Central Park. The rumours about the transient rooms are absolutely true, however we didn't see a single 'transient' guest in the 5 days we were there. There are two 24 hour free porn channels on the television, BUT you need to know what channels they are on as scrolling through the channels will not let you access them. you have to type the numbers in. The hotel is bright and airy with a lovely hand painted flower mural at the top oif the 4th floor stairs. Sadly there are no lifts and the stairs are quite steep and narrow (between 2nd and 3rd floor especially) but this was in no way a detriment to the place. We had room 36 on the third floor and facing St Marks road. Yes there was some street noise, but it was not overly loud with the windows closed. I am a very light sleeper and was only woken once when they were doing roadworks right outside our window! The rooms are small - in the double room there was about 3 feet of space around each side of the bed, a small entrance section and a small bathroom with tiny sink and shower. There was plenty of hot water - and if you position the tap correctly the temperature stays constant too. The room was immaculately clean, the furniture is old fashioned dark wood, and the closet space is tiny, but there was plenty of room for two medium sized suitcases open on the floor all week. The bed was a little hard, but the mattress was brand new with mattress protectors and the sheets were extremely clean and replaced every day as were the towels. All the staff were fantastic, very helpful and quick to fix any problems or provide extra blankets. The reception is on the first floor as you enter the building and everyone has to walk past them to enter the building (contrary to a previous report that said staff couldn't see who was coming and going).

I stayed at the Hotel for a week, stuck between the dorm I was leaving, and the shared apartment I was moving into. The staff was cool with the boxes I had to bring with me temporarily, the room was clean, and, despite the frequent circulation of transient boarders, I never felt unsafe during my stay. Oh, and the bathroom was SPOTLESS. If anything, I spent a week in one of the most interesting parts of town, and then, at only $80 a night. Best of all? They took me in without a problem, after nearly every other place in town turned me down via phone. As far as the other level goes, I'll just say it. Yeah, I have been one of those transient boarders that rents the Hotel's rooms by the hour. Basically, when you're in a hidden relationship, with no other place to go... yeah, you remember places like this one. And I'll say it - the staff is cool with it, hires out by the hour, and gives you a clean, spartan room for the purposes you have in mind. It's nothing fancy, but it does the job well.

This was our first visit to New York and we needed a place to stay for 5 nights, and St Mark's seems to be one of the most affordable ones, yet in a great central location in Manhattan. The hotel is in a buzzling little area St Marks Place, which has a selection of affordable restaurants, a great bagel/pizza place downstairs and authentic bars. We stayed in a double room with own bathroom. To get to our room we had to walk up several flights of steps... We are young so it didn't bother us too much! As other reviews on this site will say the rooms are small, but they are kept tidy on a daily basis and soon you'll be fine with the simplicity. Especially we came for a quick five-day city break to NYC so we didn't plan to spend all our time in the room anyway. Negatives of the room was that ours was facing the inner court yard and the vents + airconditioning pipes made a hell of a racket when the window was open, and the antiquated radiator in the room was on a full heat, and air was leaking from it, so it hissed the first night. The ear plugs we got on the plane came to good use! If we tapped the radiator cap, the hissing would stop for a while but it started again.. However we finally - after turning the nozzle in all directions - managed to turn the radiator off, so the temperature in the room was less of a sauna and no hissing. So, a tip: request a room to the street (although bear in mind the traffic noices) so you'll avoid the vent motor noices. Also the rooms at the front have higher ceilings, which help in otherwise small room. Also the shower in our room was very bad. Firstly it took ages to get warm and then it would get hotter, hotter, hotter... Turn cold tap a little bit and the temperature would even out, only to turn freezing cold witih a few seconds from that. It was a real hit and miss every time and we had to have quick showers to optimise the consistency in the water temperature.. Certainly wakes you up in the morning! And finally, our toilet got blocked twice, which they took care of straight away... But nevertheless it is always a hassle. Staff were mostly very friendly, only the night shift person wasn't so, but all our questions and requests were dealt with upmost professionalism and quickly, so all in all very pleasant. Do stay in this hotel, if you don't mind simplicity, like affordable accommodation and do not mind lack of breakfast / room service. Don't stay in this hotel, if you don't want simplicity (i.e. no frills) and want breakfast served - or are planning to spend a lot of time in the room.
