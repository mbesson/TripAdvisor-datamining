The hotel has a terrific location being on Ontario Street just steps east of Michigan Ave (or the Magnificent Mile). It is conveniently located nearby the Hancock Tower, many deep dish pizza establishments (GIno's East, Uno, Due, Lou Malnati's), upscale shopping, the Chicago River and for popcorn lover's, Garrett's is located at the base of the building (always a line-up). There are numerous other restaurants in the immediate vicinity that will satisfy every taste. Also within walking distance is the southern business district with much of the great architecture, Millennium Park (where you'll find Cloud Gate - a mesmerizing mirror bean-shaped sculpture). The hotel is very close to beaches and the Navy Pier as well. The lobby is rather underwhelming and small. Perhaps I tend to think of city hotels as all having great lobbies, but this Marriott hardly felt like a hotel at all when I entered. Nevertheless, the service was very good and I all was taken care of in a timely manner. There were no problems. Our room was located on the 21st floor. Now, the elevators at ground level always seem to be easy to catch, but going down there could be upwards of a 5 minute wait. The room itself was clean, beds comfortable, mini-fridge, $6 Evian bottled water (bring your own!), TV, view of the city etc. Certainly sufficient. However it does look like every other hotel room of its kind and is hardly original. But really, with so much to do during the day and night, time spent in the hotel room should be a minimum. Our hotel room was cleaned regularly. Any questions we had were answered and therefore, I certainly had no issues with service in the hotel. Parking is within the building and is a public parking lot. It is pricey at more than $40 per day. But the parking garage does not have a creepy vibe and feels quite safe. The area where the hotel is located is very safe - hardly a dangerous area of Chicago. There is no continental breakfast here, so visitors must venture out for their breakfast. The hotel has a pool and an above average gym on the 10th floor. I must add that we did deal with a concierge named Lauren who was absolutely wonderful in helping us out. She definitely went out of her way to ensure we got to where we were going and provided some terrific insight. The hotel room was more than $200 a night, but I was in downtown Chicago and did not need to drive anywhere once I arrived. Plus all the major sights are very close. The hotel does lack any architectural appeal, so for those who need to feel like they're in 1920s Chicago, for instance, should look elsewhere. It is generally a great place for those who want to crash in a comfortable place and like to get out an explore the city with all major attractions at your fingertips.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Western NC", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly surprised....\u201d", "Author": "sophiegirl04", "ReviewID": "UR126435880", "Content": "Courtyard is not my favorite Marriott brand, so was not looking forward to staying here - but glad that I did. A reasonably priced option 1 block off of the Miracle Mile, Starbucks in lobby, Dunkin Donuts across the street, and Capital Grill and Lux Cafe up the block. Of course shopping is just a few steps away - within one block is Forever 21, Nordstroms, and Home Goods - all price ranges for all pocketbooks. Oh, and don't forget Garretts next door! Check in staff was pleasant, also all front end personnel. Room was a normal size, somewhat surprising for the price and in the city - was expecting a cubicle! Marriott clean, nice marble bath, with sink outside of toilet area...so much easier than when it is all in one. AC was not working correctly when I arrived, and was corrected within 15 minutes. (and when is AC even needed in March in Chicago!) Internet speed was good, elevators were fast (I was on 18), and keys consistently worked. I would be surprised to find a better value in this area, and will definitely return. Why not a 5 star? - I hate paper cups and that horrible in room coffee service...along with cheapo toiletries. Other than that - this is a decent hotel, and when you factor in the price - well above average.

Last year, it was a great experience overall. Last week was a DISASTER. The bellman, concierge and front desk staff are all very polite. That has not changed. A few of the waitstaff in the restaurant are exceptional as well. BUT, that is where it all ends. The bed is like sleeping on a brick. The pillows are uncomfortable. I had requested a mini refrigerator and foam pillows when making the reservation (verbal confirmation to my written request), but had to call down to the desk, as they had not been provided. TWO days, the room was NEVER touched. No cleaning, no replenishment of towels, toiletries, coffee, etc. I was out of the room from 7am until 10pm! NO excuses. I complained and the first night I was given 3,000 points in my account, an apology and offer to come clean the room (at that point 10:30pm) and a free cocktail in the bar if I waited downstairs for my room to be cleaned. I just asked for some towels and toiletries and went to bed. The second night they gave me a certificate for a free night, as it was already 11pm! I ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant one morning....what a mistake. My omlette and toast were burned. They took a while to be served as well. When I complained, they offered to make it again, but I had to leave for the trade show (I worked a booth). They still charged me! They took off 20%. I complained later to the front desk. They did not remove the charge. They gave me a coupon for a free breakfast that I never got to use :( Not enough? The elevators were quirky for 3 days and actually got stuck a few times for 5 minutes. next year, I think I am going to try a new location. There are plenty in the area in the same price range, some are better hotels.

I was regretting not staying another night until I came down to a lobby full of young adults (I assumed college kids) carrying cases of beer. They had just unloaded from a bus and had obviously been drinking all day. I overheard that they were from Columbia Missouri, in town for a golf banquet. One girl actually had to be carried into the hotel. She apparently had a few to many on the bus. I felt bad for the hotel staff having to deal with that ridiculousness and was glad to be on our way. I did turn to the concierge and ask how they handled situations like this and he said, \"No worries. We have a zero tolerance policy and if they cause any trouble they will lose their rooms.\".

There is, however, one vexing idiosyncrasy about Marriotts of a certain vintage: the bathroom configuration. Many of their older hotels have separated fixtures, such as the shower/tub and toilet separate from the sink and vanity; the latter usually located outside of the closed door. I assume the idea was to allow for more than one guest to execute his/her bathroom functions at the same time. However, this arrangement is not always suitable for every combination of humans traveling together. Many travelers, women especially, prefer NOT to perform their ablutions in plain view of their traveling companion. This was the case when my friend and I arrived at the Courtyard Chicago Downtown and viewed our room featuring sink and vanity without the possibility of privacy. The hotel clerk at the reception desk was quick to offer a solution to our complaint. He suggested an \"accessible\" room with all toileting fixtures in the same room behind a single door. While we were loath to occupy such a room should there be a guest in true need of its handicap features, he assured us that there were other such rooms available in that case. With that dilemma resolved, my friend and I enjoyed a spectacular time in the Windy (and Cold!) City: dining, shopping, visiting museums, and catching up with one another after a long separation. The location is ideal, the lobby bar and restaurant are cozy and inviting and the staff are friendly and accommodating.

The staff was very flexible, helpful, and friendly. Hotel rooms were clean, and the lobby was surprising large. We received an excellent group price for our reunion. In fact, we checked about 20 hotels and this location's pricing was far more competitive than other locations. WHAT'S GOOD: First, it is an excellent location. Starbucks is located in the lobby (expensive for continental breakfast). Corner Bakery is not too far away; shopping on Mag Mile, Wendella Boat tours, and even Navy Pier are within walking distance. Great restaurants, like Gino's East or Ed Debevics, are a short cab ride away. The hotel was clean and comfortable enough. There is an indoor pool, a workout center, a spacious enough lobby, wifi, and a community laundry room with a microwave. The staff was great. We had many requests where they really needed to go beyond the simple \"hello\" or giving directions in order to accommodate the many needs we had with family members. They rose to the challenge and did well. WHAT'S OK: The pool isn't as large as it appears on the website. Not a big deal, at all...rather it's just a little deceiving. It is a saline pool, so the water seemed to bother the kids' eyes more than a regular chlorinated pool (several kids were bothered by this). The King bedrooms are modest in size, not spacious. This is fine for two adults but for a family of 5 trying to stay together in the same room, it is a tighter squeeze than what we like. I have heard of two complaints from family members about loud guests late at night. Perhaps the reasonable price brings a younger, rowdier crowd that likes to burn the midnight oil. Overall, we were extremely pleased with this hotel. They worked with us to meet all of our families' needs.

The horrible sleep experience we had was driven by two problems: (1) the MOST uncomfortable, cheap mattress I've encountered at a hotel in a LONG time (and I stay in hotels 200+ nights a year), and (2) cheap, threadbare linens. Honestly, I could not believe the mattress. It was a brick with NO give and was of the quality you'd expect in an old Motel 6. It actually squeaked when you sat on it or moved in the night -- I haven't had a hotel bed squeak and creak in years. I felt like I was at a Travelodge. The linens did not help. Although they were the standard Courtyard bedding (disclosure: I think the Courtyard bedding is an awful bedding package, baseline), it was threadbare and in serious need of replacement. The pillows were similarly cheap -- small, synthetic-feeling, no support, etc. Although the linens appeared to be clean, when a pillowcase slipped off a pillow, we noticed the pillow itself was covered in yellow stains. Towels in the bathroom were similarly thin and threadbare. So, overall, the sleep experience was cheap and terrible. The rest of the hotel was decent. The room was large. It was very much the standard Courtyard room; it had the newer decor with the patterned wallpaper behind the beds. Very corporate-feeling, but clean and perfectly functional. The lobby was small -- pretty much the check-in desk, a couple of chairs, and the elevators -- but, again, perfectly functional. Service was good; check-in was speedy and welcoming, check-out was easy. Overall, however, the poor sleep experience made for an unenjoyable stay.

You can walk to all sorts of restaurants, shops, and other attractions.

Many of the other rooms have dingy views. On this trip, the windows were unbelievably dirty. On both of my most recent visits, the hotel has been overcrowded and didn't handle the crowds well. You had to fight your way through the lobby at times, and there were long, long waits both at the front desk and for elevators, especially on the way down. Many people who wanted to go down were getting in the elevator on the way up, knowing that it was likely to be full by the time it came back to them. We waited over 5 minutes while trying to check out. There are some very welcoming staff, especially some of the doormen and waitresses. But on this trip, the front desk was totally on auto-pilot. The words would come out with a smile, but there was no corresponding action. I had a billing error, for example. \"We'll look into that for you and get right back to you,\" the desk clerk said. Never heard from him again, and the error is still there as I write this review.

The a/c only just managed to keep the room cool enough to sleep if we left it on full all day & night and the TV was ancient with a terrible picture.

I really like the Blackstone, but decided to stay at the Courtyard for this stay for one reason - I was very impressed that the marketing director took the time to comment on each TripAdvisor review. Once I got to the hotel, I found the service to be exceptional in all areas. I brought my ten year-old daughter with me and we had a very nice time. There were only two things that could have gone better: (1) Reservations gave me the wrong information about parking prices and I wish that I had paid for the package that had parking included, and (2) Marriott doesn't seem to give platinum members quite the same level of service that they once did. Still, the service was very good. The location was perfect, with shopping and food within walking distance. We were there to go to the American Girl store and it would have been nice if this hotel had the American Girl package to select. My daughter would have really liked that! The Capital Grill is right across the street, and there are many other places within a few blocks. Parking was convenient and there was no real reason for us to valet. The lounge was very cool in the evening. The fitness area had new fitness equipment and everything you needed. The pool was a fair size, but my daughter said it was way too cold! Brrrr! Our room was clean, updated, and comfortable. Good water pressure in the shower. Not sure I am quite diggin' Courtyard's new furniture - I like the look, but the quality is questionable. Still, I'll take this updated look over the old Courtyards any day! If you are looking for a great downtown hotel at a good price, this one is unique with exceptional service, good location, and has everything you need. There is even a Starbucks on the main level.

There were 3 big groups checking in the same time as us and 1 person manning the check in counter. After 15 minutes they eventually pulled someone else over. Finally after nearly 30 minutes they gave us our key. They conveniently forgot about the $25 gift card we selected on their website. Forget about that. Its not a gift card. Its a promise to pay reabate that you must mail in when you return home. Thanks! Room: We were put on the top floor orignally in a terrible room with no view. We called down to the front desk to see if we could be switched. After 20 rings, and no answer, I headed downstairs. I asked for a corner room, as I requested on the internet. They finally gave use one, saying it only had a queen beed. I didnt care about that. This room was awesome with an extra long window facing the lake (partially obstructed by taller buildings). New LG LCD tv and another window facing North (John Hancock partially visable). Pool: Forget about it. Its a glorified hot tub, except the water is freezing. If your looking for a nice relaxing swim - dont stay here. Staff: Most of the staff were helpful, nothing execptional though. I had a run in with the restaurant bartender the Saturday night they were there. He was running his mouth and shooting down all of his customers opinions on the upcoming NFL season. I blurted out \"your an idiot\" and he totally freaked out. Took my drink from me, told me I'm cutoff , and asked me to leave the bar. Needless to say this really irritated my wife and I and we complained the next day to the barley 30 year old manager. He was useless and didnt offer us anything in compensation. Restaurant - Good for drinks, didnt try the food, avoid sitting at the bar when there is a tall skinny black haired kid with long sideburns.

My wife and I experienced tremendous customer service during the length of our stay at the hotel.

The great service continued every step of the way during our stay -- from the front desk to the bellhop to the housekeepers. Everyone we interacted with was happy to help and treated us very well. The location was incredible as well. We were in walking distance to major shopping on the Magnificent Mile (1/2 block from the entrance to the hotel) and hundreds of fine restaurants. We were also very close to public transportation and used it to access the different neighborhoods that make Chicago such a great weekend destination. The only complaint I have in terms of amenities would be the Starbucks located within the hotel. It was a very small location and was always jam packed. We attempted to grab coffee on two separate occasions, only to be 'turned away' from the long line. Instead, we opted to get our caffeine fix at the Dunkin' Donuts located 100 yards from the hotel. On a more positive note, the free wireless internet was fast and easy to access (a huge perk in our book!). The room we stayed in was very large and included a king size bed and full sofa. It was very clean and had a very nice layout. The bathroom was also very large and clean. The room, however, is in need of updating/renovation.

I'd stayed at the same location last year, and was quite happy with the hotel - I was just as glad to be there this time. First of all, the staff are some of the best staff I've ever encountered at a moderately-priced hotel (our room was $229 on one of the busiest Chicago weekends of the summer). Always friendly and efficient, everyone was quite nice and quick to answer questions or make sure we had the little \"extras\" we needed during our stay. The lobby is Art Deco in style, with a fireplace, a restaurant (Viand, which has great burgers) and a Starbucks, if you can put up with chain coffee in the event of a coffee emergency ;) Our room was extremely clean, and a super balance between luxury and budget, with comfortable furnishings, good lighting, and slightly swanky bath toiletries. Our particular (very quiet) room on the 23rd floor looked out on the Chicago skyline over Ontario Street, and was the perfect base, being only a block from Michigan Avenue and a short walk to Grant Park and the music fest we attended. We also liked being just a block or so from a wide variety of inexpensive but good food options (Indian Garden, Chinese, Potbelly Sandwich Works, an awesome independent tea cafe, coffee, the Grand Lux, etc.) Another nice plus to this hotel is that the staff will gladly and safely accommodate your luggage should you arrive early (which we did) or depart late (which we also did); this enabled us to change quickly after our train trip in their lobby restroom and spend several hours walking around the city instead of just sitting somewhere having to monitor our luggage until our room opened up. Not sure what the other guests were so disappointed about, as our only \"complaint,\" if you want to call it that, is that the hotel seems to need more elevators, as there was often a wait - but first of all, there probably isn't much they can do about that, and secondly, that's most definitely not enough to void all of the other positives that make up this hotel, with its terrific location, helpful staff, and pleasant rooms.

I was looking for the Brown Line and they told me it was about 6 blocks to Clark (which is close) then take a left and it is about 2 blocks away. This was wrong, it was about another 6 blocks. It doesn't seem like a big deal except when you are walking and start to wonder if they meant for us to take a right instead of a left. My only suggestion for the room would be to dramatically improve the lighting in the shower and sink areas. It was like taking a shower in a cave. Some of the other rooms suggested that the rooms needed to be updated. Ours looked updated. Yeah it didn't have a flat screen TV but I'm on vacation not there to watch TV.

We were able to have a refrigerator delivered to the room and it came immediatley which was great. The room we stayed in was pretty small or at least not layed out well given the furniture that was in it. The TV was located to the side of the bed versus at the foot of the bed so it was very uncomfortable to try and lay in bed and watch a movie and the basketball game. The pool was very small and it did not appear there was a hot tub so we ended up not using the facilities even though we had brought our suits. We generally always use the pool. We stopped in the restaurant to ask for a fork to go with a dessert we had brought back to the room and it literally took her 10 minutes to come back with a fork and then she ended up taking it off a table right next to the hostess station. We wanted to make dinner reservations and the concierge said it was too early and to come back at 1. So at 1 we came back and again she said it was too early (because we forgot to change our clocks to accomodate the time change). I have never had that experience. Generally they would take the information and when the time came would make the reservation and then either leave a message on the room phone or send up a card which indicated the reservation time & confirmation. To have to keep stopping back at the desk was an inconvienence that we should have been able to entrust to the concierge to handle. The benefit was the location. If you are interested in being on Michigan Ave for shopping this is only 1/2 blk off the mile. The JW was on the mile and we did go in but the lobby was under construction. We have stayed at the Renaissance at 1 W. Wacker and I would highly recommend that hotel...it's not on the Mile but is still near lots of great restaurants and shopping.

We checked in with no problems a bit early at 2 . When we got to our room we realized that the two queen beds would be small for both my adult daughter, my sister and I so we called down to the front desk to request a roll away bed. The front desk informed us that extra beds in the rooms were against code in Chicago and that someone would be up shortly with keys to another room. . About ten minutes later the bell captain came up with our keys and offered to take our luggage to the new room but was gracious when we said we really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need help since we each only had a carry on. The new room had a sofa bed and two queen beds in it on the 22nd floor. It was perfect, large and spacious with a sink outside of the bathroom which is always a plus with three women in one room. We did have to bother the desk twice more for extra towels and to find out the location of the hair dryer and they were quick and courteous. (The hair dryer is in the top shelf of the closet behind the iron.) The only drawbacks I could see is that wireless internet was only in the lobby where I saw numerous travelers huddled over their laptops. The pool was also shallow and only about two strokes long. The bar offers Tapas which members of my party did not care for so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t report on the food there but breakfast was decent at 13.00 but the 9% tax brings lots of things higher than advertised in this city. The doormen were terrific. No matter what time of day, someone was on duty to get us cabs or tell us how to get to different sites. They were always cheerful and upbeat. One was also very helpful to my daughter. When her prepaid Express van (booked through Expedia.com with her air fare) to the airport took off without her; he snagged her a ride with a great private driver who got her to the airport in time even though there was a massive backup on the main roads. In all this is a nice hotel located near lots of shops and about a mile from the Navy Pier. In the summer, there is a free trolley that will take you to almost any location in the city.

This was perfect for printing a boarding pass and printing a document I neeeded for a meeting the next morning - Clean rooms CONS - The bed was one of the worst I've had at a Marriott. No cushy matress cover. Very uninviting. - Because I had very little time in the morning and because the Starbucks downstairs had been closed the day before \"due to problems with air conditioning,\" I decided to order room service for breakfast. I decided the healthy choice of yogurt, granola and fruit would be good. I would have felt like I got more for my money if I had chosen something else. I literally received a small yogurt (from a multi pack), a 1/4 cup of granola and a small plate of fruit.

Concierge staff were SO helpful with advice on buses to take and where to get off, as well as offering us free tickets to a play. The only negative was that they advertise on the Marriott site there is free internet on the tv. They have limited access that is free, mostly weather, stocks and news sites. We went ahead and paid the 9.99 access fee, but none of the sites we wanted would load for us. (Sites like google, yahoo, etc.) Not even Trip Advisor would load!

However the next time we would like to stay at the Renaissance because we were very impressed with the river view, rooms, the staff and the wonderful lounge area. The Courtyard welcome was very business like without the usual friendly smile. I noticed that most Courtyard welcomes are like this. They could adapt to visitors who are leisure travellers and not running for the next meeting. The lady kept on insisting that the room she was giving us was the one she would choose herself. I appreciated her concerns and she did put us on a higher floor away from a large group of school kids. The room was clean. The bed was comfortable and the view was acceptable. The Breakfast was great. The one aspect of Courtyard I hate is the infernal airconditioner which is a separate unit in the room. We always find it very loud and intrusive, and at times non-functioning. Why the Marriott group keeps on building hotels with the outdated air conditioners beats me. We found a wonderful restaurant in Illinois St. called NAHA. The food is out of this world. It was a dining experience. One the the most pleasant we have had in years. World class cuisine.
