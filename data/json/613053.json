A big disadvantage is that there is no internet access in the rooms (it is available only in the reception area). My room was on the fifth floor and was clean and spacious; however, the elevator takes you half storey before the level of the rooms and you should climb 9-10 stares with the suitcase before you reach your room. Pelows were very uncomfortable. The breakfast was good. The stuff (mostly Russians) was not really polite and helpful. It is overprised, even in the periods of big events (f.e. ITB, Messe Berlin).", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Key Biscayne, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, decent value\u201d", "Author": "Magnus W", "ReviewID": "UR125848491", "Content": "Had a two night stay in connection with a trade show recently and decided to try this hotel due to its location. This is in Charlottenburg, not far from Kurfurstendamm with lots of restaurants, bars and shops within walking distance. It is also very well connected with a subway station only 500 m away. Perhaps a little shady neighborhood late at night but still very close to more prestigious areas. The hotel itself is in a rather old building, rooms are furnished with old somewhat worn down furniture but I found it very well cleaned and it served its purpose. Breakfast was included and was not bad, lots of choices and a nice little area where you could also buy beer or wine at reasonable prices. They had complimentary wifi down here too. There is no internet connection in the rooms but TV was OK with some non German channels too. All in all, decent value for a good price.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome, Italy", "Title": "\u201cbest location / price\u201d", "Author": "ElenaBrini", "ReviewID": "UR122561708", "Content": "The best advantage of the Spreewitz is its location in Charlottenburg. i stayed here for 8 nights and the hotel is situated in a perfect conjunction of metro/underground U Bahn and S Bahn. -train (U7 very close, U2nd 10 min walk, SBhan around the corner). coming from Tegel airport s extremely easy to reach the Hotel. The building is old, rooms are acceptable, nothing special but with everything you need. Bathroom very small. Suggested to young couple or to who use the hotel just like a base to sleep and take a shower. Continental breakfast is very nice and with a good selection of cold meats. The staff at reception were very friendly and helpful and gave us lots of local tips. Close to the Hotel in Savigny Platz there are different restaurants and just 30 mt from the hotel there is a very convenient supermarket open 24 hour.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fribourg, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cDirty and not friendly\u201d", "Author": "unautrenom", "ReviewID": "UR115010577", "Content": "I stayed here one night - Actually I did not stay, as I left after I was offered a room with crap left in the toilet, dust all over the furniture, in a bedroom which had old furniture, a very thin curtain with not other way to darken it, a noisy street outside. Not to mention the elevator which takes you to a half storey (convenient when you are pregnant with a luggage - nobody offered a help). I advise, if staying in this hotel, that some of your Berlin friends finally offer their couch !! I left after ten minutes of seeing this and was charged by the hotel, for more tha 100 euros, which is expensive for Berlin....", "Date": "July 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gent, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cgreat typical citytrip hotel: type b&b\u201d", "Author": "spurtbom", "ReviewID": "UR38513603", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel for 6 nights during the world championships of athletics and i also spent a lot of time visiting the city of berlin so i only was in the hotel to sleep and have breakfast my single bedroom had all the comfort i needed (good bed, spacy closet, tv which had sometimes problems finding the channels though, desk and bathroom with good shower but a sometimes refusing to do the job toilet) a bit ennoying was the ventilation system that was on, and making some noise, between 6 in the morning and 11 o'clock in the evening (so bring earplugs) the walls aren't very thick either so sometimes you could here your neighbours there isn't, as far as i'm concerned, an internet connection possible but i don't have a laptop so couldn't try either there are plenty of other (cheap or even free) possibilities to go on the net in berlin so don't worry location is superb, just about 200m away from a bus stop (from airport tegel) and the s-bahn, same for the u-bahn, so taking public transportation is no problem at all hotel staff was friendly, breakfast was also satisfiyng and enough this hotel is good to discover berlin", "Date": "August 23, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Spreewitz", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d613053-Reviews-Hotel_Spreewitz-Berlin.html", "Price": "$59 - $151*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Kantstrasse 104</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10627</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "613053", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/b7/b0/b7b084d0d2ab380e4e8b80f5c8a41b9f4large.jpg"}}
