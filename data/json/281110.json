Half a block behind the Prado Museum and half a block to Retiro Park in the other direction, yet QUIET. Who knew that such a peaceful oasis could exist in the hustle bustle of Madrid? We have stayed here several times over the years, since discovering it in 1999. We just returned for the first time in awhile, and were astonished to see how it has changed. It used to be called an apartment/hotel, but now it is just apartments. Some of the individual apartments have been sold to private parties (lucky ones!) with the \"hotel\" retaining the rest. So instead of a 24 hour receptionist, you need to arrive during the hours when it is staffed and now get a key to the front door to let yourself in after hours. That is the main change - everything else is as delightful as ever, although the prices may be a little lower. We had a spacious one bedroom apartment (including kitchen, large living room, and terrace) for a family of 3 for 100 euros. There is still a delightful cafe/bar right in the building on the first floor, there is still a fabulous fruit store around the corner, also a panaderia and basic groceries on the same block. And of course, most importantly, the Prado and Retiro Park. It is a short walk to plenty of restaurants and bars, and about a 20 minute walk to the busy Plaza Mayor. (It is located just half a block from the Ritz Hotel, and across the Paseo del Prado from the Westin Palace Hotel, and directly across the street from the beautiful Los Jeronimos church) It will be sad indeed for travelers to Madrid if the building shifts completely to individual apartment owners rather than being available by the night to travelers like us, so I encourage everyone to stay there while you can!", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hohenschwangau", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "pesi88", "ReviewID": "UR102593754", "Content": "We enjoyed our 5 nights stay at the Los Jeronimos very much.

Walking distance to absolutely everything - even Atocha train station, main boulevards, museums, several parks. We paid $165 a night with all taxes for a corner unit on the 4th floor.

She was right. It is in a perfect location right behind the prado and within walking distance to all major museums and neighborhoods. We are a family of 5 (2 adults/3 children) and the hotel was perfect for us. We had an apartment with 2 bedrooms and 2 full bathrooms a living room and a small kitchen perfect for making breakfast. The apartment was spotless and serviced everyday. The staff were very helpful and accomodating ( we arrived early after flying overnight and our room was not ready but they took all our luggage and we walked around - when we returned all of our luggage was safely in our room which was ready). I would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a safe, clean reasonable place to stay in madrid. The other reviews got it correct in terms of describing the facilities - not luxury by any sense, but clean and functional.

The hotel is right next to the Prado and a very short walk to the Retiro Park, but the walk from the metro station was a bit longer than I expected (its true that it is walking distance, and I probably would have felt ridiculous taking a cab but it was not easy to walk with our big bags). The staff was friendly enough and even knew some English, which was unfortunately not true for most of the hotels we stayed at in Spain...

We had one huge patio with a small pool (not filled at this time of year) and a smaller one on the other side of the living room.
