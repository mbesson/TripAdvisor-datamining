Originally, we had been looking to spend the week on Vieques, but while researching places to stay there, we decided to open up our search to Puerto Rico, and found this resort. We had never been to the western part of Puerto Rico and weren't quite sure what to expect. We flew into San Juan, rented a car, and drove ourselves to the resort. The drive was at night, but mostly highway, and took us just over 1 1/2 hours. Finding the resort was a little tricky once we got off the main roads. Signage was quite poor at night and we drove by the entrance on our first attempt. We arrived just before 11pm, and were able to catch the front-desk person to check in (otherwise, you check in with security). Much to our disappointment, there were no options at the resort for a drink or food at that hour. The only restaurant open while we were there, Eclipse, stopped serving around 10pm. Apparently, there is another restaurant on site, but it was not open during our stay. Our single room was cliffside, which was a short distance from the beach, pools, etc. The room itself was nicely decorated, clean, and had a small refrigerator. The room was on the third floor of a townhouse, which consisted of one larger unit comprising the first two floors, and another single room adjacent to ours. We had a small balcony from which we could hear the ocean (and even glimpse a part of it through the trees). What we didn't realize about the resort until we arrived, was that the townhouse, much like most of the villas on the property, were privately owned. The resort is essentially run like a time-share property, where units are owned by individuals, then rented to vacationers. Knowing this is important, I think, because it will help set your expectations for service (see below). After our first night, we decided to upgrade to a one-room villa, and were happy that we did. Again, we were cliffside, which does sacrifice proximity to the beach/restaurant/pools, for more space. Our room was very nice, with a full kitchen, washer/dryer, huge living/dining space, separate bedroom with adjoining bath, and a very large patio. We decided to enjoy coffee and breakfast on our own each morning on the patio while listening to the birds and the ocean. It was a perfect way to start our day. And while we were a short walk to the beach, we came to enjoy our strolls through the grounds each morning on our way to the beach. The service overall was fine. Front desk staff were friendly, and as helpful as they could be, but unlike a true \"resort\", you won't find a concierge here with lists of area restaurant recommendations or things to do in the area. There is no room service, but if you choose to stay in one of the villas with a kitchen, you can drive yourself to the local supermarket (a short drive), stock up, and prepare a meal or two on your own. My partner was celebrating his birthday during our stay, so prior to our arriving, I had spoken with one of the front desk staff about the possibility of arranging for a bottle of champagne and cake to be delivered to our room on his birthday. I was assured that this could easily be done by emailing a certain person at the resort with my request. She was to get back to me with a list of options, and then I could make my decision. This never happened. I never heard from this person, and when we arrived,much to my chagrin, I learned that it was not possible to have anything like that delivered to our room. Luckily, I was able to arrange this through the restaurant, however, I had to order the champagne and dessert, then carry the champagne, ice bucket, glasses, and dessert back to our room, and set it up myself. Any other resort/hotel I've ever stayed at has been able to accommodate this sort of request. Time share properties simply don't do it, and that's what this place is. That being said, the property itself is stunning! The grounds are lush and pristine and filled with birds and iguanas. When you arrive to the beach, you're immediately struck with how pristine and primitive it is. The waters are notoriously rough on this part of the island, but not so rough that you can't enjoy getting in for a swim, and we did that repeatedly every day. Located on a part of the island that seems to be surprisingly under-developed, we were able to take a stroll for several miles one day along the beach and passed exactly two other people! I don't think you can still find many places like this in the Caribbean today. We spent every day in two of the chaises set up on the grass, at the edge of the beach just reading and dozing, with surprisingly few other vacationers around. It was exactly the kind of quiet, private retreat we had been hoping for. Most evenings, we had dinner at Eclipse, the resort's main restaurant. The menu does not offer a huge selection, but what it does offer is delicious. I had fresh fish every single day, with the variety dependent upon what was caught and brought in that morning. How great is that?! We had many of the same waitstaff for the week, and they were all truly wonderful--friendly, attentive and eager to chat without being intrusive. One small incident at Eclipse on our last night there, did leave us feeling a bit irritated. We arrived for an early dinner and were told to take any seat we desired. We immediately went to one of two available tables at the edge of the restaurant, closest to the beach. When we sat down, one of the wait staff approached us and asked us to choose another table, as the one we were at was reserved. No big deal. We immediately got up, and sat ourselves at the other available beach-front table. Within thirty seconds, another of the wait staff approached us and told us that we would have to move again, because that table was also reserved. Earlier in the week, we had tried to make a reservation for dinner and were told that reservations were not accepted for parties that had less than six people. Fair enough. After moving to our new (third!) table, a party of two were seated at the first beach-front table we had been asked to vacate. Minutes later, a party of four were seated at the second table we had been asked to move from. From bits of conversation, we gathered that the party closest to us were some of the villa owners, so I'm assuming they were given priority seating over other guests (us). This, again, would likely not have happened at a true resort. Customer service is typically a high priority at such places. We felt a bit slighted and mildly insulted by it. In spite of a few shortcomings, we did have a wonderful vacation at the Villa Montana. Now that we know what to expect, we would definitely consider going back and have already recommended it to friends.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cExcellent for a 4-5 day get-away!\u201d", "Author": "Emilia001", "ReviewID": "UR127746951", "Content": "My husband and I spent a little less than a week at this very nice resort, located in the northwestern part of the island. It is a gated community, with a fantastic beach, excellent restaurant and very friendly, helpful, hospitable staff. We stayed in the hotel part of the resort (not in one of the villas) and although it was not as luxurious, it was still very nice. We had our own private balcony overlooking the grounds. The room was spacious enough, although we would more likely to take a suit if we ever go back. There is just not enough room to dry wet clothes, store food etc. the room does come with a small refrigerator, which was good to have to store some cold drinks. I used the pool only once, the water was clean but on the cold side, so I swam in the ocean instead. I also did some snorkeling for which the hotel provides you with the equipment, and it is very good snorkeling indeed. My husband did his jogging along the beach, which goes on for Ike's on end. The food at the restaurant was outstanding and reasonably priced. For breakfast we had the oatmeal and also the cornmeal which were definitely our favorites for Tate and health! The staff was uniformly very attentive, friendly, helpfull and deserves a 10! The only drawback about the resort is that it is 90 miles wet of San Juan and the drive from SJ is horrendous. It took us 2 1/2 hours and the latter part is like a very ugly Rt. 1 with more stoplights than you can shake a stick at. Fortunately, the resort is quite a ways from that road, so once you get there it is wonderful. I would suggest to fly in to the airport that is just a few miles from Isabela, it would be worth the extra cost. Make sure you do th horseback rides which is located right next door to the resort, and also visit the caves only 45 minutes away...

There is a good deal of old coral reefs in the adjacent water, so swimming is limited and you can definitely *not* let the kids go by themselves. One benefit of the reefs is that there is some surfing further out, and kite surfers abound, but this is not for beginners.

This is truly a charming place on a beautiful beach. But, it's not really a \"resort\" as it doesn't offer resort like service. If you are accustomed to a certain level of resort then VM falls short but it's still very beautiful, charming in a low key way. I would imagine that anyone traveling to the west coast of Puerto Rico should know that this is probably the most upscale as it would get. The grounds are very lush, and tropical. The beach is beautiful and the overall feeling is very laid back and relaxed. They have a parrot by the entrance to the reception desk that greets you with a \"hola\" That was adorable. The service at the front desk was below average. They got the job done, but there was almost no signs of hospitality. It was more like an experience at the post office and not the start of a beautiful vacation. It's not a deal breaker but a smile doesn't hurt anyone. I'm a little confused over the rooms at this place. The first room we were given was in terrible condition. The sofa had a massive stain on the cushion and a ton of little stains all over. The closet doors were falling apart, over all it looked like this room had been neglected for a while. And it was full of mosquitoes, I was attacked within the first 3 minutes in the room. After calling the front desk to inform them of the room condition, in just a few short minutes, a very nice man came to escort us to view another room. This room was in much, MUCH better condition. We happily moved here. I'm guessing the villa's vary but the one we ended with had an old Spanish decor, full kitchen with everything you could possibly need. The room had a laundry room with a washer dryer. Housekeeping did a very good job. Eclipse bar and restaurant was excellent. The place was beautiful. The attention to detail in decore was truly amazing. The place is right on the beach.. It's breathtaking. The staff was AMAZING to us. This isn't a stuffy white glove type of place but more of a low key, chill on the beach with staff who become your friends in a matter of minutes. These guys were truly good people and provided great service. The drinks and food were EXCELLENT. Every menu item we tried was delicious. The beach was lovely, they had comfy loungers on the beach and lawn. While we were there is was never crowded and we got to sit anywhere we wanted and enjoy the peace and beautiful sunset. Areas in need of improvement: The towel set up was bad. You had to get towel from the front desk. It's not very convenient if you want them for the beach or pool. I can overlook this fact but the towels were in very pool condition. The room had some items that didn't function. The tv in the bedroom wasn't hooked up to the cable and we just never bothered calling anyone to correct this. The stereo was outdated. I think it was a cassette player. One of the speakers was stained. Not sure what's up with this.. but it was odd. There is no safe in the room (at least not one I was able to find) The walls in the hall way of the villa had a lot of scuff marks in them. For the price we paid for 4 days I think the place should be superb condition. Didn't look like the pool was cleaned daily, it was full of little leafs. Close to the airport. We now know the schedules for the evening flights in Aguadilla because every single night were heard the airplanes fly right over us at the same times. They sound VERY close and loud. I gave this resort a 4 rating because my overall trip was excellent. I am being generous with this rating if they had a 3.5 I would have given a solid 3.5. I stayed in other areas in PR in the past and I feel Villa Montana was much better than some of the higher rated hotels in SJ.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cTerrible service in the Eclipse Restaurant\u201d", "Author": "mxalpert", "ReviewID": "UR124580234", "Content": "We were told that the Eclipse Restaurant in the hotel was the best in the Isabela area, but the service was so slow that it didn't matter.

Below is my detailed feedback. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 DJ \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ricky\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd : No complaint, will definitely recommend him. He provided the sound and music for the event. Everything was set, no equipment malfunction. He got the song selection we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve asked and even could download whatever on the spot. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Hair and Makeup \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Jenny\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: Definitely recommend her. She was professional, responsible and very serious about her work. And ON TIME (yes it is a serious issue when you are in Island time) she made me feel like a queen. Will suggest looking at her page. If you like what you see she is your girl. She did a messy updo with orchids and I LOVED IT. The makeup I thought it was too much for my taste but I followed her advice and the pictures came out great. I can only point out the eyeliner wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t apply straight and the hair kind of fall out thru the event\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.but it was a messy updo anyways and the makeup lasted all night! \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Cake: Based on reviews, went with by my own. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Flowers: Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much, the view is gorgeous and it just doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need much. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Resort: Based on reviews, stayed at another place. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Photographer: Based on reviews went with my own\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Gio Camacho, enjoi photo\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 you will not find a better price for the quality of work. He did natural pictures and I LOVED IT. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve included some. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Reverend \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Francisco\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: Yes, will recommend him. Super difficult to get hold of him to the point of being concern. Once we got in touch it was simple, he knows what is doing exactly. He even asked about dress code\u00ef\ufffd\u0160. Wedding event The event went well, Diana even made sure there were no guests in the area for the time of the ceremony (that I think was beyond her duties). The event started behind schedule, not sure why but would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve loved that it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. It made a difference to take advantage of the day light for the pictures and also how the sun was on our faces while the ceremony at the gazebo was taking place. I will say I was in a room with ac and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind but can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say the same about my guests. At the end wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a big deal and it work out fine. The setup was gorgeous, the weather to die for ..just perfect. The setting discussed was very nice; they know what they are doing. Diana is excellent. Only thing was the table I rather not have because it obstruct the stunning view, and I actually mentioned it in the contact. By the time I realize it was there I was walking down. When dinner time came it also took a long time, part of it because they will not take the order unless everybody is sitting down and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m ok with that, it took us longer to get everybody. But salad and soup was a given, we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wait that long for it\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it think. Anyways the food was excellent, taste and presentation\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6only catch there was no appetizer for the kids. The waiters were awesome, need to give them all the credit. The drinks phenomenal, they know their stuff! When cake time came everything was ready and everyone enjoyed it. But when the event was about to finished I asked directly to Mara (the other wedding planner) for takealong and my guests left without it. Only when I directly asked a waiter something happen. The fire pit was nice, since it gets very dark and there is little light and also because it give some warmth (not that you need it in PR \u00ef\ufffd\u0160 ) but it only lasted a couple of minutes and it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t brought back (almost a waste of money). Finally the only two things I will add is the lack of guidance for guests on where the event was taking place, especially because none of us were staying at the Resort and the ants, yes the ants\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6sting like hell and were all over the lawn. Hope this review can help you make a decision. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a very detailed person and wished some of the reviews where as detailed, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get mistaken, I would definitely recommend it especially if you are working with Diana, if it is with Mara\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6good luck, the girl is a little bit lost.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sevilla", "Title": "\u201cTake me back tomorrow!

The accommodations are very nice, but the experience is very different than one would experience at a large resort hotel. The setting is serene....no bright lights / late night activites....but rather a peaceful co-existence of you with nature. There is a long stretch of beach, most of which is very rocky and not suitable for swimming. The lounge chairs on the beach are very nice, and the atmosphere is very quiet. There are 2 pools on the grounds....one close to the restaurant/bar, and a larger one centrally located on the grounds. There is also a tennis court and rock climbing wall. The facilities are extremely clean and the grounds well kept. Each individual unit is decorated as per the individual owner's preferences....but maid service and maintenance needs are attended to by the management company....and any needs / requests are quickly responded to. Robin, the General Manager, can oftentimes be seen walking the grounds, talking to visitors (and owners). It is quite apparent that he has a great feel for the pulse of VM and really goes the extra mile to get to know everyone. The Eclipse restaurant has an excellent chef, and he has trained his staff well. The food is extremely well prepared. None in our party experienced long wait times, and most were at VM for 4-5 days. As we had many individual meals at the restaurant (in addition to the wedding), everyone had praise for the quality of food, selection and presentation. As mentioned in other reviews, VM is not for everyone, but if you are looking for a peaceful experience with nature, and an excellent restaurant, this facility in western Puerto Rico would be an excellent choice. The resort is about 10 minutes from Aguadilla airport....and 2 hours from San Juan airport.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tamworth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWhere i want to live....\u201d", "Author": "David_T_1970", "ReviewID": "UR119175548", "Content": "This is the first place I stayed in Puerto Rico, and rather than being like a hotel it's like living on an exclusive gated estate.

But looks are very deceiving at this place (something the Lonely Planet review clearly missed regarding this hotel). As others have painfully noted, this appears to be some kind of time share as well, and the hotel customers seem to be treated like second class citizens -- a stunning indiference from management given the price of this place. For example, the first room we were offered (a single) was dirty and despressing with water and burn marks on the furniture and a bathroom straight out of a roadside motor lodge. The two bedroom we upgraded to (at our expense) was fun for the family, but also had strange obvious signs of neglect. Incredibly, each morning we were there starting at 9am for two hours or so, there were people with ear piercing leaf blowers all over the property (at times blowing a few wet blades of grass over a mind numbing period of time when it could have been done with a broom in a few minutes). Forget about eating or sitting outside each morning -- or enjoying the pool for that matter during these times. Once there was even a staff member leaf blowing wet seaweed on the beach after a strorm! Then throughout the day the staff would buzz around on incredibly loud 4 wheelers with apparently no mufflers -- simply incredible for a high priced resort. Finally, one night (a Wednesday) we took our lilttle kids to the ocean front restaraunt at 6pm or so only to be overwhelmed by a loud DJ -- and again indifference to guests who might want to have a reasonably quiet meal with others (who knows how people in rooms dealt with the noise blasting from there for hours). Management seemed indifferent and or oblivious to the distirubances for guests (or long terms time share owners one would think as well) that all of the above created to the otherwise secluded property.

The restaurant and two or three small villas are the only places with sea views. We were staying in Unit C5. We drove around the complex for five plus minutes trying to find the buidling as the sign with the unity number was missing. A housekeeper lead us there. There of course was not a bellman or anyone to take you or your luggage to your villa. We were also given four bath towels to use as beach towels and were told we would be chanrged if they were not returned. The beach is very rocky and dangerous for swimming. the views are beautiful on the beach and they had very nice beach and pool furniture. The staff was not very friendly and extrememly slow at the restaurant. The main restaurant was closed for a wedding on one night of our stay. We also asked to use the bicycles they list on their brochiure and on line and were told they did not have any. We then asked about kayaks and were told they don;t have any. We finally asked for the snorkel equipment and they only had three sets for our family of four. Although the unit was very nice and quite large, it was not worth the money . Our room was not cleaned until 6:30pm one of the days and I was told to be patient they did not get to it yet! When I spoke to the manager about my concerns , she put together a list of thinkgs to do in the area (a few free), most that were additional charges that we could drive to. When I asked for local restaurant menus they also did not have that! Oh yes, and our final day, we went in the early am to get towels for the day and they did not have them yet.

If you are looking for a party this is not the place for you - you will be bored. VM is a small resort made up of a series of 1, 2, and 3 storey buildings that house studio through 2-bedroom suites and villas - all are individually owned with many that are rented out as lodging through the VM office. The quality/amenities of your unit will depend on the individual owner's desires and tastes. Check in is at 4pm and it didn't seem like exceptions were being made for early arrivals. Some of the buildings have a top floor (2nd or 3rd) containing 'hotel rooms' that have basic amenities such as queen bed, closet, bathroom, mini fridge and coffee maker. The hotel unit we stayed in was simple, but nicely furinished with hand-carved furniture and was very clean. The bed was surprisingly comfortable and the towels were softer than one would expect. Our unit was in the back of the resort against the limestone cliffs and we didn't mind the extra 3 minutes it took us to walk to the beach. We did not see the inside of the suites or villas. There are two restaurants, Eclipse and 'O'. Eclipse is the beachside restaurant and bar and has a serene, spa-like feeling to it with billowing white cotton curtains and warm carved wood tables and chairs. We ate a variety of meals there and they were all very good. We did not eat at O as it was only open on Saturday of our visit, but it looked fantastic and served North African cuisine. Eclipse food prices are on par with NYC/Chicago/SF prices so that might be a bit higher than some would want. If you have a suite with a kitchen, we recommend hitting the Econo grocery store in Aguidilla just after you leave the airport and stock up there. Pros: Gorgeous, serene resort with beautiful, well manicured grounds. Igaunas, herons, and parrots outnumber the people. The two on-site pools were mostly empty except for a couple of families with small children. The resort's beach goes on for miles in each direction with literally no other beachside development either way. We walked for an hour in each direction each day and barely saw a soul but did see quite a few folks on horseback on the beach Cons: Staff was friendly but didn't go out of their way to be helpful unless asked and even then it wasn't Ritz-like service. The wait time for food at Eclipse was exceptionally long - 30 mins at a minimum but it wasn't unusual to wait 45-60 mins. Not sure why, as Eclipse only seats about 30 people. The beach, while beautiful and deserted, is not great for swimming, especially for small children. It is somewhat rocky and being on the Atlantic has a strong current and heavy wave action (which the surfers seemed to enjoy). There was a protective reef at Shacks beach about 100 yards away that looked more calm and we saw families going there. As one other reviewed mentioned, they do a lot of weddings there - both Friday and Saturday night during our visit. What this means is that Eclipse will be closed and you will hear music until about 10pm if you are in one of the oceanfront units. We didn't mind it, but if you think that will be a problem, call ahead and ask if there are any weddings scheduled during your stay. If you do need to eat out, just up the entrance road is a wonderfully simple restaurant shack called Ola Lala's where the owners cook up excellent local food in their carport and garden. They draw a crowd of locals and visitors but are only open on Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon. There are a few restaurants in Jobos but neither the Happy Belly or Oceanside were remarkable other than for their breathtaking beachside location. The food at both was mediocre at best - go for drink at sunset. There is a small fitness center with 1 treadmill and 6 cybex weight machines and a set of Bowflex SelectTech dumbells. We never say anybody using it during out stay. To reiterate, this is not a party resort and your party options in the area are limited.

The resort's business is divided into villas which are purchased or rented and then the hotel side, which at points seems like an afterthought. The effect is that their hoteling is not up to snuff at times. You have to ask around about which restaurants are recommended rather than their offering this to you.

Luckily it is warm outside, so it is not so bad. Don't count on ever getting a scalding hot shower. 2) the shower and sink drains were a little slow. 3) the mixed drinks were a little weak.

They were ok with this though, as they just strolled around the grounds, enjoying the scenery, until the room was done. 5) one group was getting ready immediately prior to the wedding ceremony when the maids came by to clean. They asked the maids to come back in 30 minutes when they would be at the ceremony. Instead, the maids never came back and never cleaned the room or provided towels. (We didn't even know about this until we came back home). Otherwise, this was the perfect location for our wedding. The backdrop is so gorgeous - the sunset, the lush greenery (as opposed to ugly highrise hotels in your wedding photos), and the beach! If you are also looking for a beach wedding location, I highly recommend this place. We are already planning on going back next year for our anniversary.

Villla Montana sits on the northwest corner of Puerto Rico.and is a short 31/2 hour flight from New York into Aguadilla on either Continental or Jet Blue. The resort is only a 15 minute drive from the airport. That said, Villa Montana feels cozy and secluded. The resort sits on a lovely beach on the Atlantic side of Puerto Rico that offers larger waves than the Caribbean. Walking west on the beach for about 20 minutes there are huge, beautiful rock formations and along the way tidepools of marine life. Walking east the white sand beach stretches for miles and there are many areas for snorkeling. Next door there is a stable that offers horsebackriding on the beach. We stayed in a one bedroom bungalow steps away from the beach, but staying anywhere on the resort grounds is a short walk to the beach. Villa Montana is under new management and it shows. There are new lawn chairs, the employees are still friendly and accommodating and refurbishment of the grounds and the rooms is in progress. We used the bungalow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mini kitchen for breakfast and lunch but dined at the resort restaurant every night. The food was great, the service excellent and the location, right on the beach, was lovely. Listening to the surf break while dining by candlelight was peaceful and romantic. There are many local restaurants and while we did not try it, we were told that the local Thai restaurant was outstanding. The resort provides a small gym and a spa although the spa was not operating while we were there due to renovation. . There was a wedding during our stay but it did not inconvenience us in the least.

The chef is top-notch and was recognized as the top chef in the Caribbean in 2009. The highlight of the resort is a stunning beach, which is very picturesque and not crowded at all. Also, they had an adorable parrot who tells guests \"hello!\" and climbs right over to meet you in his cage:) The resort is in the NW of Puerto Rico, which is known as a prime area for both regular and wind-surfing (Isabela hosted the 2010 World Surfing Championships), but is also supposed to be nice for snorkeling and scuba diving when waters are calmer (the waves were quite strong when we were there in December). It is in a fairly remote area, so it is best for visitors looking for a quiet, romantic experience. If you want a lively night scene, you're better off staying in San Juan or a larger resort.

The villa was clean, beautiful and had everything we needed. My daughters slept in the pull out couch. The kitchen had everything we needed although we needed to buy simple things such as condiments, salt and pepper, etc since their were no stock food items, which is understandable. The place is supplied with two snorkel sets in good condition, a beach cooler, clean sheets and towels. The washer and dryer was convenient. The only drawback was I could not hook up to the wireless internet, hey who needs to be connected when you should be relaxing, right? Villa Montana itself was beautiful, easy-paced, and friendly. The kid's playground was nice. The two pools are beautiful and the restaurant, The Eclipse, had delicious food as we ate there two nights. The service is a bit relaxed, island pace, but attentive. The location to the beach was an easy walk from our villa. The surf was up a bit and made snorkeling a bit difficult with a bit of wavy water and a slight current. Late spring and summer are best when the water is calmer. The beach is rocky in spots and was difficult for swimming for the kids with the waves and rocks. Down the beach to the east, right, had more protected swimming and snorkeling areas past Villa Tropical. The beach has extremely comfortable beach chairs with umbrellas, great for lounging. I used my stand up paddle (SUP) board to paddle around and surf about 100 yards off at Shack's Beach. We walked the deserted beaches both ways for a mile or two to explore and just to be at ease. We did two stints with the family at Tropical Trail Rides, which is right next door. The guides were friendly and the horse are well taken care of. Our daughters, who have only had a few riding lessons, had no problems with their horses. Everyone was so helpful and friendly. We had quick and easy access to the grocery store and restaurants a few minutes up the road. We took excursions to Crash Boat beach. I also did two excursions to Wilderness to surf with Jose from Aquatica Dive and Surf. He was more than accommodating and helpful with my SUP rentals.

We live in the U.S. and though it seemed like a lot to plan in 7 months after talking with the wedding planners over the phone we felt more comfortable that all would work out. We flew to Puerto Rico in March to hash out all of the minor details. After spending two days at the resort, again with the wedding planner we thought everything was great. We discussed the ceremony private table for myself and my spouse (sweetheart table), discussed that though a wedding was planned the day after ours that during our weddding - their rehearsal dinner would be on the other side of the beach so that our events wouldn't disturb one another, we discussed a pig roast, we discusseed the rooms for my entire family of 30, discussed the flavor of our cake and the design, etc. However, as we were getting closer to the event we realized that though everything appeared to be going great - IT WASN'T!!! The more downpayments we paid and the closer we got to the date the more unorganized the wedding planners were. The wedding planner we THOUGHT was handling our wedding ended up giving all of her responsibilities to another wedding planner which ended up in numerous phone calls to myself having to reiterate and explain EVERYTHING we flew to Puerto Rico to organize. But that was just the beginning! Once arriving in Puerto Rico, 5 days before the wedding, everything just went crazy!! Most of the rooms that were booked for my family were double booked. Meaning, I was charged the deposits for many rooms twice. Do the math for 30 guests! In addition, many of my family when checking out were over charged - the most was over $1,000.00 and they had to file a dispute with their bank! The day of the wedding things that were promised to me when organizing our wedding were all of a sudden forgotten. The rehearsal dinner was RIGHT next door to our ceremony, the cake flavors were completely wrong. Oh, and where were we sitting for dinner AT OUR OWN WEDDING!! They forgot our table! The flowers were completely different than what we ordered.... You get the picture. Luckily, we had a great photographer and though the nice wedding planners we had at the begininning ended up being the most unorganized, unprofessional people I HAVE EVER MET, at least the new General Manager would take care of us after our departure. We were overcharged for our wedding by almost $1500.00. We ae still watiing for almost $500.00 of our money which is still in dispute! Great location for a wedding. My family is from Puerto Rico and was excited to get married in a country where so many of family is from. To get married there was wonderful.

The beach is relatively small and rocky in some areas. VM does provide some comfortable beach chairs, and the beach is never overcrowded with people since it is only for guests. The villas are all a little diferent. Some are multi-level villas. They are all decorated differently, depending on the owner of the villa. The older villas are closer to the beach and the newer/nicer villas are the furthest. The only con about the villas and hotel rooms is that they are dusty and some have bug (cockroaches & ants) problems. After living in PR for a year, I can understand how hard it is to get rid of those bugs though. VM just needs to have the friendly pest control visit more often.

The wedding was decorated wonderfully, the food was amazing, and the VM staff gave us five star service for the most part.

The only one that really bothered me was the fact that the wait staff was too eager to take our half finished drinks and to clear off the party favors from the tables. Some of my guest had to hide their fans in their purses so that they could keep it. Overall, my wedding weekend was a great. I had a few guests mention that it was the funnest wedding they have ever attended. no joke!

Mara was that second reassuring hand. If Diana was busy taking care of wedding details, Mara was there to attend whatever we needed. She was an absolute pleasure - very professional and on the same caliber as Diana. They were just an amazing tag team. Our wedding was a small intimate wedding of 25 and DJ Ricky made it seem like we had a wedding party of 50. Everyone danced that night even my mother who was in a wheelchair. My boss and his wife that are american danced all night long. Everyone -- absolutely everyone danced all night. Chef Jeremy's food was delicious. What's great is that it wasn't the typical wedding banquet food you get in the U.S., it was a new fresh modern take of latin food. Just amazing. You have to go down and taste it yourself. Rosita.... We can't forget about Rosita. Rosita took care of our rehearsal dinner. She was our head waitress at the rehearsal dinner. She was a gem. Very personable and attentive. You just love talking to her. She makes you feel right at home. Before, during and after the wedding Rosita was always a friendly smile. She took care of you as if you were her own family. My in-laws were enjoying themselves at the beach and she took it upon herself to wait on them. She knew our children and made them feel comfortable. She pretty much knew everyone by name. Once we checked out, we headed out to San Juan to the Caribe Hilton for a couple of days for our honeymoon. It was just not the same. The moment we arrived, we wanted to head back to Villa Montana. Although Caribe Hilton is a nice a glitz hotel, it does not give you the personal attention, nor warmth. I regretted leaving Villa Montana. In arriving back home to New York City, all the feedback we receive from our guests were all positive. Everyone had a great time and have all said and I quote..... \"It was the best wedding they have ever attended.\" Thank you Villa Montana for our memorable wedding. Can't wait to go back.

The owners/ coordinators/ servers all took amazing care of us during our stay. If you fly into San Juan, it is a bit of a drive in traffic (3 hours or so w traffic), and you see some rougher areas as you drive. But don't get too nervous, bc once you pull up to the gates, you've entered a lush paradise! Our rooms were great. The grounds and beach were impeccably kept. It is so beautiful, it almost looks fake! You arrive there, walk out to the beach and wonder how this place is such a secret?! They decor in the Eclipse restaurant and the 24hr pool have been updated since the pics on the villamontana.com website. It is gorgeous! Even the stray dogs were friendly! The Eclipse restaurant is casually enough that you can head in for lunch from the pool, but the food is still an amazing presentation (even the salads are beautiful)! The wedding festivities were all handled for us, all we had to do was show up! if you are looking for a wedding where someone else will take care of all the details so you can enjoy time w your friends and family, this is a winner! If you are easy going and ready to enjoy your stay, i think you'll find that their wedding offerings exceed all levels of expectations. The presentation of everything was 110%- the BBQ rehearsal dinner on the beach (great sangria), the bonfire, the ceremony, the reception decor/ table settings, the food and cake were outstanding!! we were even greeted to a decorated wedding suite w flowers and candles at the end of the evening. Absolutely wonderful!! The resort is happy to recommend a photographer for the wedding services. We partnered w Orlando Negron, a local professional in PR, and were beyond pleased w the resulting photographs! If you are looking for a great, trustworthy, and easy to work with professional, we would recommend Orlando and his crew. The only disappointment we had was very minimal. on their website, it said that they have bikes and sea kayaks that are free to use. unfortunately, due to upkeep and maintenance costs, they have discontinued offering these. We did not know this until we got there, and were looking forward to using these. Thanks again to all that were an integral part in making this a memorable occasion for both us and our friends that joined us! A huge thank you to Jessica, Mara, Diana and William, each of whom put in 110% to make this an unforgettable vacation!

It has been one year since my wedding and I have no album, crappy photos and the resort has not helped me at all and I know they are still recommending him to brides even though I have since found out he has done the same thing to other brides at the resort in previous years. This photographer has made me miserable in the last year and I now forget all of the good things at my wedding and can only focus on them lying to me about what a great photographer and how trustworthy this person is. If you go to get married there just DO NOT select Rafael Sotomayor as your photographer. The staff was friendly, the food fantastic, but service is slow so if you are coming from the US do not expect to be served speedily.

The sorroundings are extremelly well preserved and maintained. The room was OK, it requires some TLC in minor maintenance. I pointed it out when leaving and they were honest in acknowledging it. They are going to start a renovation program. They have two pools, but only used one. There are some details that were missing, but were not significant for us. They don't have a formal booklet in the rooms with services and amenities (web site counter balances this). Apparently they don't have a 24 hours desk service. Their opportunity for improvement is definetively the restaurant facility \"Ecilpse\". I don't want to have this a restaurant review, but is fair to mention that food is good, but service is slow, and personnel is not well trained. I only had dinner and lunch once and then decided to go elsewhere. There are a lot of places to go around. I want to give it another try next year, but want to be sure that I pick a nicer room, probably wiyth two rooms and laundry.

Two tennis clay tennis courts (need some upkeep). Guests were predominantly families with kids. Many of them are unit owners from San Juan. Not the place to find wild nightlife. Beautiful open air restaurant and bar on the oceanfront. Our room did have some minor issues. The toilet valve stuck constantly. Function was OK but it was noisy and wasted a lot of water.

The Villa Montana is not a five star Ritz (and it doesn't pretend to be) but then you are not paying Ritz prices. Nor do you have the pretentious attitude. The Villa Montana is a small, quiet, unpretentious resort. If you are looking for a highly active vacation, this is probably not the place to go--stay in San Juan. But there are certainly things to do. A car is a necessity. You can drive to Rincon, about an hour away or explore the local area. There is snorkeling off the beach of the resort or the resort can arrange snorkeling and scuba trips. Next door there is horseback riding on the beach. The grounds are beautifully designed and well maintained. As for a lack of service reported in other reviews, we had no problems at all, although when we stayed, the last week of January, the resort was not full. We booked a flight/accommodation package through Expedia and got a great deal. Fly into Aguadilla and it's a ten minute drive to the resort. We stayed in a one bedroom ocean view villa that was clean and well appointed with a comfortable bed and thick towels. Housekeeping was friendly and efficient. The kitchen was only efficiency size with a half fridge and two burners but it was adequate. There was only one restaurant open during our stay; the Eclipse. It serves breakfast lunch and dinner and all the food we ordered was very good. Yes, the prices are high for Puerto Rico (but about average by New York standards) but you can go to local restaurants like Luna Marina which serves great snapper or go to Happy Belly's or any of the places along the main road in Isabela. The service at the restaurant can be slow, but who cares? You're on vacation so a two hour dinner is great, especially when you're right on the beach and the sound of the surf is all you hear. The resort staff is very friendly and eager to please. If you are polite and patient, they will do their best to help you. The beach is beautiful. Yes, the surf can be rough at times (although we swam regularly) and the beach has some rocky areas, but if you walk a short distance in either direction there are calmer beaches. The resort pool is small but who would use a pool when you have that great beach? My recommendation to the resort is to replace the older lounge chairs at the beach and add beach umbrellas.

For the 6 of us, we reserved the 3 bedroom villa which consists of a one bedroom villa on the bottom and then a seperate 2 bedroom villa upstairs. We got there about an hour before check-in time, and were told that the upstairs unit was ready but the downstairs unit was \"still being cleaned\" and that they'd let us know when it was ready. While heading to the ready unit with my friends, we wanted to peek inside the one bedroom unit and no one was in there and it looked cleaned so we went to the front desk to get our key. The one bedroom unit was horrible! It was like a dungeon because it was so dark and there were mosquitoes EVERYWHERE! They were literally congregated right outside our front door and the moment the front door is open, you could see them all flying right in! We tried to turn on the light but we soon discovered we had no power in the living room! That meant no TV, no stereo, no ceiling fan and no lights! I called the front desk two different times that evening and it never got fixed! Another ridiculous problem was that we had NO hot or warm water to take a shower with! We seriously took cold showers the three days we were there and there was NO water pressure! My friends in the unit upstairs all had to share one bathroom even though they had two bathrooms in their unit. That was because one of the showers was broken and had no water pressure either. Thank goodness we were so busy with wedding activities all weekend that we weren't in our room much but when we were in our room, I spent my entire time trying to kill all the mosquitoes that totally infested our room. I'm allergic to mosquitoes so I made it my mission! You would think they'd provide mosquito nets over the beds or something. So we went to checkout and I complained about the lack of power our first night and they gave us half off our bill for that first night. Another thing is the food. We went to the breakfast buffet our first morning there and it was good. Unfortunately on our last day there, the wedding couple hosted a brunch and it was the same exact food as the buffet. Too bad they couldn't mix up the food a little bit. The only good thing about this place is the nice private beach. It was beautiful. I guess this is a good place to stay if you're an outdoor person who's used to camping and you like to experience the elements. I'm not one of them!

Although we are local residents in Puerto Rico, we had never stayed here. We decided to book our stay at Villa Monta\u00c3\u00b1a because it is right next door to our favorite place to ride horses and we had seen the resort many times during the rides. You have to see this place to believe it. It is absolutely beautiful! Imagine waking up every morning to take your breakfast on your back porch, with the greenest grass all around you, the brightest sun shining in the bluest sky above, and the ocean waves a mere 40 steps away ( I counted them!). And wait until you see the sunsets! It is truly breathtaking. The grounds are very well kept and it is a very relaxing, romantic, secluded, laid back and out of the way resort. However, I must advise you to bring your own food and a car. The beach is secluded and there are no crowds, In fact, there is hardly anyone on it because the coast is rocky and the surf is sometimes too strong. If you want the beach only for sunbathing then you will be fine, but if you plan on entering the water you better be a good swimmer. For snorkeling it is okay although there is not much to see. If you want a better beach, you will have to drive somewhere else. Isabela to the east and Aguadilla to the west have excellent beaches. Or you could drive to Aguadilla and go to the water park there, which is excellent. The food in the restaurant is excellent but pricey. It is very well prepared and presented, and the taste and quality were very good, but for the price, you would expect far better service. There was only one person in charge for seating us, taking our orders, bringing the food, and finally the check. For breakfast they have complimentary Continental breakfast of toast with a small cup of fruit, and a small cup of yogurt, with juice and coffee, or one pastry with fruit, yogurt, juice and coffee. Good thing it was complimentary because it costs about 12 dollars each. Again, if the service were better you could understand the price. But we had to wait about 35 to 45 minutes for this breakfast. For dinner it was worse. We had to leave without ordering dessert because we had already been there for almost two hours, and there was only one other family in the restaurant that night. The Villas have a kitchenette, so we prepared our own food and breakfasts the rest of our stay and we were fine. So, bring your own food. The small freezer in our small refrigerator had not been defrosted and we had to smash away the ice from it. The pools were plain, and small. The rooms were clean, the AC were functioning, the TV was great for the kids, and the bathroom was clean and adequate. All in all, we had a great time.

We were told check-in was not until 4pm. So we waited, and waited. We got to our room at around 4:30pm. The room was great, although a little bit small. I loved the decor. The A/C barely worked. The bathroom was average. There was a locked door at the end of the hallway. We would hear noise coming from the other side of the door at night. We weren't quite happy about that. There is no internet in the rooms, so if you want internet you have to go to the lobby. The flat screen tv was the best thing in the room, and I don't think that's a good thing. I've got to admit that the resort is beautiful and well kept. The pools were small, and quite ordinary. The children's pool by the restaurant was always crowded. You'd think the pools would have a little waterfall, or a waterslide, but no. Next time, I'm staying at the Hyatt.

We wanted a vacation where we could relax with our college age children in a warm, beautiful place....and that is what we got! We stayed in a very nice 2 bedroom, ocean view villa. The view from our front porch was gorgeous, and we spent lots of time sitting there, relaxing and enjoying the scenery. The ground are beautiful, and the trees are full of birds, including wild parrots. The ocean directly in front of the resort is gorgeous, but pretty rough. If you want to swim in the ocean, you would probably need to walk down the beach to a calmer spot (about 5 minutes away). The staff was extremely nice and helpful, but very unobtrusive. We ate one night at Eclipse, the on-site restaurant, and had a really good meal. We went to the grocery store (5 minutes away) for lunch and breakfast food (our villa had a kitchen). We ate off-site at Happy Bellys and Luna Marina, and also had good meals. Happy Bellys hangs right over the ocean, and is a very fun place. We did the 3 hour \"Discover Scuba\" with Aquatica, a dive shop which is only 5 minutes away. They do a great job! We also did the horseback riding with Tropical Trail rides, which is right next door. It was also a great experience! I would recommend both activities. The rest of the time, we relaxed and enjoyed the beauty of the area. This is NOT a good place if you enjoy tons of people, shopping or night life. It IS the place to go for natural beauty, quiet and lovely weather. Also, this is not the place for you if you expect Ritz-Carlton-like perfection. Our water didn't get very hot, and the twin beds in the second bedroom weren't very comfortable. We didn't care....we were too busy enjoying the rest of it. We also enjoyed the neighborhood dogs that wandered through, the lizards and the sweet cat in the open-air restaurant. I would definitely recommend having a rental car for going to the grocery store, etc. Our college age kids enjoyed hanging out on the beach and recovering from final exams...don't bring teens or older kids who are expecting clubs or nightlife. We really, really liked this place and want to come back. Next time, we are going to try to fly into the Aquadilla airport, which is only 10 minutes or so away from the resort, although the drive from the San Juan airport wasn't too bad (2 or 2 1/2 hours because of road construction).", "Date": "December 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "denver", "Title": "\u201cGreat Spot\u201d", "Author": "craig2", "ReviewID": "UR22593626", "Content": "We were really surpised with this hotel.

We were a little nervous when booking the hotel, and there seemed to be two types of travelers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c those that had a wedding there and loved it, and those that stayed there not during a wedding and thought it was so so. QUICK SUMMARY. Great location, Amazing grounds, good rooms, Restaurant not worth the cost. Definitely would stay there again. Had a great vacation- came back totally relaxed. PRE-VACATION I was extremely worried before our trip. I emailed to ask about a couple of their services and never heard back from them. How hard is it to answer an email?? I wanted to request a couple of the more expensive services and just never heard back\u00e2\u20ac\u201dweird and not a good start. GETTING THERE We flew into San Juan. The drive to the hotel was about 2 hours but it was an easy drive--- pretty much a straight shot. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this one point, when you first see the ocean in front of you (going down a hill near Isabella) and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re entering another world. Note if you have a gps, it will get you to the villa but it thinks the road is unpaved but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s paved. THE GROUNDS We need to start out by saying that this was one of the most beautiful places I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever stayed at. The grounds were amazing. The pictures do not do it justice. The resort is small so everything is within easy walking distance. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say it enough, this is one gorgeous place. Wild birds (including a family of parrots) are right on site. ***Pools*** There are breathtaking two pools, one by Eclipse with bar & rest rooms and one a short walk away. Both pools were breath-taking with the best lounge chairs I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever used. The pools were quite, had plenty of shade and sunny spots. We ended up spending most of our time at the pool not near the Eclipse. The shaded area had two double lounge chairs and a hammock! Hubby spent most of his time there. So relaxing!!!!! ***Beach*** This is a surfers beach so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to swim here. However we did have a number of long walks along the beach. Slightly to the right of Eclipse restaurant you can walk over some rocks and find the Blue Hole snorkeling area\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard. However, we were never able to find it, however it was April and the ocean was rough\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot the resorts fault. The Beach resort area had about 20-25 lounge chairs (NOTE TO MANGEMENT: you should get more). The grounds staff do a great job keeping the beach clean and free of debris (I totally don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand a few of the reviews). THE ROOM We stayed in one of the garden view rooms, #3062. It was about 11x13 (maybe) with a queen bed, coffee maker, small dorm refrigerator, tv & vcr, iron & ironing board and closet organizer system (note no in room safe). The bed was extremely comfortable and covered in white linen\u00e2\u20ac\u201dso comfortable we had no problem sleeping at all. The room was nicely decorated with terracotta tiles and dark wood furniture. There was a ceiling fan, personal room air conditioner and two side tables with lamps. Even with the three lights, the room was dark (think more mood lighting than regular lighting) The room had the ability to open up to a larger room (think of adjoining room hotel rooms). So the room had a funky \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcextra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 door on the way to the bathroom. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think of any additional way to state it. The bathroom was a good size (larger than some NYC apartment bathrooms). The bathroom was dark too\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI think the bulb wattage was too low. There was a large French door that overlooked a small slate patio that had two chairs and a small table. There were a few minor issues with the room. When we first got to the room, the A/C sounded like a wind tunnel. The bell hop said he would send maintenance. After an hour, we called the front desk and was told maintenance was gone for the day. However the bell hop came back and did something. However the A/C wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sounding loud by that time-- Maybe it was the start up issue. So it became on non-issue. It worked and kept the room at a constant temperature. The other issue was with the hot water. Three times the hot water just stopped. The hot water wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really hot so I would take showers without any cold added. I swear the water stopped \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no trickle- no cold water just me standing there with soap in my hair and no water. About 4 minutes later, it just started back up\u00e2\u20ac\u201dweird. ROOM SUMMARY Overall it was a charming room, and more than met our needs. If I had a family I would definitely want to rent a full villa with kitchenette. The personal patio definitely made it worth it. Next time, I would want to have a balcony room (verses the patio) but it definitely was pretty great. The patio was a favorite addition, every morning we had coffee & breakfast there. THE RESTURANTS The website claims to have two restaurants, the Eclipse and the O. However the O is open only Saturday nights\u00e2\u20ac\u201dso really the only restaurant is Eclipse. We never did eat at the O, but did have our first dinner at Eclipse. The restaurant is beautiful! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right overlooking the beach, long white curtains flowing in the breeze, lanterns handing throughout. Absolutely breath-taking. The food was a disappointment. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve traveled throughout the Caribbean, Mexico, Europe and live in NYC. We ordered the bruschetta, sushi tuna appetizer and then shrimp tortellini and a meat dish (the first meal my husband wanted wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t available\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich I thought was weird it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a big menu to begin with). The only thing that was really good was the tuna appetizer, the bruschetta was on this cracker thing, the tortellini wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cooked enough and the meat was ok. However for the quality, we felt the meal was over priced almost $90 inc tip without drinks (we had water and no alcohol). This was the only meal we had there. I did look at the lunch menu and it looked like for two it would be $30-40 w/o tip\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot worth the gamble. Also double check your bill, be were charged incorrectly for one of the appetizers. RESTURANT SUMMARY Service wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as bad as some posters had; we completed our meal in about 2 hours (more European/Caribbean pace than US). We liked it. However, value for the price makes it not worth it. THE STAFF Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the staff too much. There did seem to be some disorganization in the processes. For example, we came out one night to see an entire family sitting outside (one was holding a very young baby). They apparently locked themselves out of their room (you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re only given one key??). They said they have been waiting for over \u00c2\u00bd hour to be let in because no one had a key. (how did housekeeping get in?). Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother going to the Eclipse restaurant (next to a pool and the beach) for towels, go to the front desk\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe restaurant didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any when we went. I guess this may be an overall thing\u00e2\u20ac\u201das of today still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a response to the email I sent to the resort. RESORT OVERALL We would definitely stay at this resort again. The quite atmosphere made it feel like we were the only one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s there. There were two or three weddings during our time there and we never felt that it overshadowed our time. Wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat at the restaurant again. If we were to go again, I would have the resort purchase items for the fridge ahead of time (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an option on their site). I think if you think of it as a hotel verses a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcresort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be happier. The term Resort is means activities, activity coordinators and helpful staff. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hotel, where you need to make your own fun and if you need constant entertainment, this is definitely not the place for you. If you are a person that like to plan your own stuff (guidebooks, internet etc) this is perfect for you. Oh side note to mention, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get any cell signal there (Verizon wireless) so if you need to be constantly connected\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnote this. I did see others using their cell so maybe it was just Verizon. SUPERMARKET After dining in the restaurant, we chose to go to a supermarket to buy snacks, stuff for breakfast and lunches. About 10 -15 minutes away you can find the Economico (or something like that) supermarket. Large, clean and plenty of parking *directions: The supermarket is located on the west side of Isabella _ you can stop there on your way to the resort even. Otherwise from the resort take 4466, to 466 E to 459 E. its on your left right has you enter Isabella TREBOL BAKERY We had breakfast here our second day. Great espresso coffee and ham & cheese sandwiches. Its to the East of Isabella -- Take 459E to Carretera 113 (parking is in front). AMANDA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122S This place had amazing Monfungo (mashed plantains forming a bowl, filled with shrimp, chicken or meat (your choice) and peppers, onions and a red sauce.--- mmm our best meal\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgreat appetizers and good wines. Directions: take 4466 to Carr 110. Address is 8.8 km Carr 110.- 10 mins away. OCEAN FRONT RESTURANT This was really good, on Carr 4466E about 5 minutes away. Large wine list for the Caribbean. Walk in, and walk though the bar to a clean, efficient and yummy restaurant. We had dinner there and it was awesome. Definitely a good meal. While you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re waiting, you can go outside and watch the ocean on their private deck or you can eat outside in the outdoor restaurant. HAPPY BELLIES Slightly farther down Carr 4466E from the Ocean Front, total dive bar atmosphere on the ocean. Beer, burgers, fries, excellent quick eats. Kids will defiantely like the food here, but us adults did too.

After being in busy Playa Del Carmen, Mexico on a family vacation just a month earlier, the quiet and relaxing atmosphere was very refreshing. There seemed to be a lot one could do right at the resort, but not a lot for very small children. There is a nice playground though so if you have small children and don't want or need a childrens program, the resort may work for you. It seems like it would be better for kids more in the eight years and older range. My only disappointment was the limited time we had at the resort. Breakfast on the beach was fantastic, but after that we had to leave and work all day and well into the evenings. We will be coming back on business again in a few months and will be staying there again. Except this time I hope to stay an extra day or two for fun. And my wife has been planning to join me. I'll be working and she'll be relaxing on the beach.... :-) I would recommend this resort for people who want a very relaxing vacation free from the hustle and bustle one gets in the big hotel/resort zones. Don't expect to see any vendors on the beach because there are none. You can go for a walk on the beach by yourself - as in not along with 500 or 5000 other people. You can relax on the comfy lounge chairs and not have people trying to sell you things every fifteen minutes. And you won't even have to worry about pushy sales people trying to sell you time-shares.

Many of the units are owned and used by locals who bring everything with them and it seems like the hotel feels that there is no need to provide the typical amenities that tourists require.

Also, glad we arrived in the daytime because the hotel is in the middle of nowhere, but only about 15 minutes from the Aguadilla airport. The town is a surfer village meant for younger folks than us - more bar scene than culinary delights. But just fine for an overnight and we were on our way to Rincon and Ponce. Very nice staff and ultra clean. Two tiny pools and tennis courts we didn't use. Right next door to a riding stables with a horse ring on the hotel's property.

It is very relaxing and lowkey which was perfect for us. The garden view villas are less expensive than the ocean view, but still no more than a three minute walk from the beach. The staff was unfailingly polite and pleasant. There is wireless internet access in the hotel lobby and near the restaurant. I would be very happy to go back again. A few critiques/drawbacks, things you should be aware of: Although the website said that the resort was 90 minutes from the San Juan airport, it was took us two hours to drive on a Sunday afternoon. I was told it can take significantly longer on a weekday when there is traffic. If you can, I would recommend flying into the Aguadilla airport which is about 15 minutes away. Many people appeared to have trouble checking in. Although we had reserved and paid for a two bedroom villa, we were shown to a one bedroom and told no two bedrooms were available. After some persistence on my part, they found a beautiful two bedroom for us. I witnessed several other people checking in who seemed to be having problems as well, and when we checked out early on Sunday morning, the young man at the desk couldn't figure out how to run our bill properly. The hotel staff seemed slightly overwhelmed on the weekend when a wedding was taking place, and the more casual restaurant was closed to accomadate the wedding. We had planned to eat with our son in our villa that night, but if we had expected to eat in one of the hotel's restaurants, it would have been problematice because the nicer restaurant is not really appropriate for a four year old.

Be warned that a meal will take anywhere from an hour to 3 hours - they are SLOW... It overlooks the ocean - so it is a nice view - but a nice lunch for 2 with a drink will cost $40-$60 and dinner with some wine will cost $100 for 2... 2) I think the other restaurant was called \"O\" or something like that.

Snorkling is good here as well. The gym on the property was good, w/ a treadmill and hand weights. My kids and I did horseback riding on the beach using Tropical Trail Rides and it was really good and definately worth the $$$. It may rain a bit every day, but remember that it is a rain forest, and it normally doesn't last long. The area itself is not very touristy, and a knowledge of a bit of Spanish can go a long way! There are very good places to eat close by, I can't remember their names, but one place was on the beach and had a man walking around w/ a little guitar serenading, it was a lot of fun and a bit comical; he would sing spanish songs to the locals, then come to our table of 14 and sing \"I did it my way\" in English.

My situation may be a little different from the average person's because I am planning a wedding here. After a year of emailing and calling back and forth, I was so excited to finally see the resort and meet the people I have been communicating with for so long. As you can imagine planning a wedding from thousands of miles away is a little nerve racking but I must say I was pleasantly surprised! All of the pictures I have seen were beautiful, but to actually be there is 10 times better! We (me, my fianc\u00c3\u00a9, his mom and dad, and my mom) stayed in a 2 bed room villa. It was not your typical hotel room. Beautiful cherry wood furniture and little accent pieces gave this villa character. The rooms were a good sized too. It was very comfortable and clean. I saw a few more of the rooms when they gave me a tour and they were just as nice. Every villa is different, so if you want something specific just ask and they will accommodate you the best they can. The grounds of the resort were beautiful. Green grass, beautiful palm trees, tropical birds, and lots of flowers! I liked the beach a lot. I notice that a few people in previous reviews were complaining about the beach being rocky... and it is, but it is not fault of the resort. It's not like they put the rocks there. It's called nature!!! My advice is to bring water shoes. The waves are very strong and I got knocked over a few times but I had fun! It was great being able to watch the surfer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early in the morning also. The staff was amazing! Our plan arrived on the island at 3am. I feel bad because I can not remember the man's name that was at the front desk, but he was so nice. He gave us a ride to our room on a golf cart and help us bring our bags in to the room. I had to call him back because we needed an extra set of sheets for the couch. He was back at our villa in 10 minutes. I wish I could give everybody we met a shout out but I don't remember everybody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s names. Melany, who is my wedding planner, is one of the sweetest people you will every meet. We have been talking over the phone, emails, and IM's for over a year now so when I finally met her, it was like seeing an old friend! Cynthia and Stacey were also very helpful with our food tasting, showing us around the resort, and helping us make final decisions about our wedding contract. Ashley was one of the bartender's that we met and she was very accommodating. My family likes to have fun and joke around with people and Ashley fit right in and had fun with us. The food!!!! Mmmmm is all I can say. I know that in other reviews people were saying how the food service was slow and it is a little slower than what you would be use to. Keep in mind that they do not microwave their food. Everything is fresh, made to order, and is presented to you as a piece of art almost. Chef Jeremie loves what he does and you can tell through the food that is served. My family was ready to buy him a plane ticket and bring him back to the states. We found our selves just ordering food to see if we could try everything on the menu before we left! Ok I know my review is getting a little long and drawn out, but I really enjoyed myself. If you are really looking to just be able to relax, this is so the place for you. We live in DC where it is full of not-so-nice people and lots of traffic to even get down the street. SO to be able to sit on the beach and literally be by myself was great. There are other activities outside of the resort that you can take advantage of too.

The wedding was beautiful and the property is nice as well. The resort is in a remote part of the island and if relaxation is what you are looking for this is the area to be. The beach is small and the ocean is very rocky which makes it a bit challenging to enter and exit the ocean. If this is important to you I would be cautious of staying here. The property consists of mainly villas which we stayed. Let me start with our check-in. This was certainly not what I expected. Once I completed my registration, we had to wait 30 minutes in the small office area for one fo the employees to escort us to our villa. Why this is necessary I did not understand and was not given a very good explanation. We were with other guests as well who waited along with us. Not a good way to start our stay here. Our first villa was a bit small for our liking and I went back to the office where we were quickly upgraded to a 2 BR villa with 2 bathrooms, 1 with an outside shower which was nice, kitchen and living room area. We were helped with our luggage to the next villa which was a nice gesture. Once in our villa is where things were not exactly what I expected from a resort like this and from the prices they charge. The upgrade to the new villa did come at a price of course. The villa was cleaned that day but overall it was a bit run down and not worth the money. The location is what you are there for, not the accommodations. One of our ceiling fans was broken, the fridge light was broken, there were bugs we had to take care of and the biggest pain was that the villa had one phone which was broken. Since we were there for a wedding we needed to keep in touch with people for daily activities. Cell phones did not work so the villa phone is important. I went back to the office to request we have someone give us a new phone. Our original employee came to the room to try and fix the phone which he could not. He said he would be right back and after an hour later he did not. I had to go back to the office again, to be told there was nothing they could do till the next day. Why couldn't I be given a new phone to plug in? No one could tell me that. So for 2 days we had no phone to keep in touch with our other friends on the resort. The front desk was not helpful at all with this and actually seemed annoyed when I expected this to be fixed. Overall, the resort looks great from the outside and is in a remote and beautiful part of PR. The rooms/villa are in need of an upgrade and I think they need a couple more people to help with check-in and maintenance on the property. The wedding was a success and that was the main thing. If not for the wedding, I would not return to this resort again.", "Date": "November 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "evanston", "Title": "\u201cGreat Getaway\u201d", "Author": "dsklar", "ReviewID": "UR10409029", "Content": "I decided to spend a week in PR as a result of serendipitously finding the Villa Montana website: I was planning a return trip to Glacier National Park in MONTANA.

Our one bedroom villa at Villa Montana was steps from the ocean, the pool, and the restaurant. With our patio just outside our room, we were able to let our daughter take her 2-3 naps/day inside while we enjoyed the soothing breeze off the ocean or caught up on sleep ourselves. Nightly babysitting allowed us to play tennis, relax, swim under the stars, eat deliscious meals (thank you, Jeremy, for making special vegetarian dishes for us) , and walk along the beach. During the day, we enjoyed reading under umbrellas or palm trees, my wife reports two terrific massages, and I snorkelled daily just outside of the resort. A wedding at the resort was unobtrusive and didn't effect our enjoyment of the resort one bit. We felt so relaxed here, that we cancelled plans for a side trip to St. Thomas! As for activities near the resort, I can only speak about a one tank dive from Isabella (average diving); Areceibo, the Caves, and diving at Desecheo island were all on my potential activites list but we were too tired to do much of anything.

Because for two of our days there they decided to power wash all the chairs and tables from the restaurant. The restaurant was just off to the right of our villa. The power washing, of course, required the use of a very loud and noisy generator. The cleaning was done between our villa and the beach, right off the restaurant. So, not only was the noise unbearable, but it also detracted from the beach view. As I sat on our porch and tried to read, I was listening to that awful generator go for two days. This is an example of poor management. The resort management should have shut the resort for two days (not taken reservations for several days at their slowest time) so they could do the necessary cleaning.

After doing extensive research on destination wedding sites, we decided the Villa Montana was the perfect location for our small intimate wedding. We loved the resorts isolated location, its close proximity to the Aguadilla airport and its reputation for great food. Many larger resorts have multiple weddings per weekend unlike the Villa Montana who caters to one bride---This was a huge plus! Despite rattling my nerves by not returning phone calls in a timely manner, missing several important scheduled conference calls, and seemingly ignoring some emails, the wedding itself was spectacular in every aspect imaginable. Our wedding weekend exceeded all of our expectations and our thirty guests continue to rave about the entire experience. With the help of our wedding planner Melany, we arranged for taxi service for all of our guests on Thursday night to the Ocean Front Restaurant (3 miles down the road). Great food and amazing views---I would definitely recommend this restaurant to all. On Friday night, we had our rehearsal dinner at the O Restaurant, the tapas restaurant at the resort. The ambiance was spectacular---dark wood, comfortable cushion seats, candlelight and Asian inspired decorations. The food was out of this world\u00e2\u20ac\u201dChef Samuel Hernandez did a fabulous job preparing the dishes! After the rehearsal dinner, we arranged for salsa lessons for all of our guests. Two instructors came to the Villa Montana to teach us the basic salsa moves. This was one of the highlights of the weekend. The wedding itself was an amazing event. The ceremony and reception sites were beautifully decorated---the floral arrangements were gorgeous. Melany, our wedding planner, took care of all of the little details we requested. She was attentive to all of our needs. We had a very talented guitarist play at our ceremony and cocktail hour while a DJ played great dance music at the reception. Our guests spent most of the evening on the dance floor. Executive Chef Jeremy outdid himself! The food was five star quality! Our guests keep raving about how great the food was at the resort. I am so grateful to all of the staff at the Villa Montana for making our wedding a truly memorable experience.

Words can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t describe how absolutely gorgeous this event was. It was literally a dream come true. My husband and I are from San Francisco and did not go visit the hotel before the actual wedding. As you can imagine, I was completely nervous that things wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go well or that I would be disappointed in the resort, but this was completely blown out of the water as soon as I arrived. The grounds of the hotel are very well maintained and the villas are gorgeous, especially the larger 2 and 3br villas. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor, cleanliness, and spaciousness of the larger villas are unlike anything other I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen. My husband and I stayed in a 1br garden view villa, which was the perfect size for us and was literally steps away from the beach. It was about a 1min walk to the sand and you could hear the waves crashing from the patio in front of the room. We spent 9 days at the hotel to get a feel for the place before the wedding and had a great time. We had a total of about 40 guests and rented a total of 10 rooms at the resort. We were happy with all of them and had no complaints from our guests. During the wedding planning process, I was worried because things seemed TOO easy. I know that sounds silly, but when planning a wedding, you expect to be running around like crazy! But Mildred (our planner) and her staff made it sooo easy for me. We literally just chose what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like from their options (music, food, d\u00c3\u00a9cor, etc) and I sent her photos of the idea I had for the cake, bouquet and flowers. They nailed it and got everything perfect! My flower arrangements were so lovely, my bouquet was perfect, and the FOOD\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6oh man\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the FOOD was to die for!! So good! We went for the 3 day event with a beach BBQ on Friday night, the wedding and reception on Saturday night and a brunch on Sunday. Every meal was delicious. Our guests were sooo impressed! And to be honest, everyone left thinking we spent way more for the wedding than we actually did. The prices are very affordable for a wedding and we got a fabulous 3 day event for less than a 1 day wedding in San Fran. The icing on the cake to our special day was that the hotel arranged for me to arrive on a white horse and meet my father at the end of the aisle. Our guests are STILL talking about that horse! Talk about a fairy tale wedding. I also took advantage of the spa at the hotel. Alfredo, the massage therapist, was so wonderful! I left feeling so relaxed and at ease. The only thing I would write about the hotel, particularly the Eclipse Restaurant is that this is NOT the place to eat if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a hurry. The food is delicious, however, the kitchen is on island time. The upside to this is that it gives you a chance to really kick back, enjoy the sounds of the coqui and the ocean crashing and feel the ocean breeze. For me, when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m on vacation, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not in a hurry\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6so I had no complaints. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. I brought my dog to the resort as well and they listened when I asked for them not to come in the room when I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t around. I really appreciated that. Overall, the 9 days I was there was very well spent. I was so pleased with the entire staff, particularly Mildred, Melany, and Lizbeth. These girls rock and made my wedding a dream come true. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a laid back place to have your special event, this is the spot. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to go back for our 1 yr anniversary. Feel free to email me with any questions or to see more photos of the event....I know that helps when trying to pick a wedding destination. Thanks!

We traveled with 70 of our friends and family to celebrate our wedding which was 9 months in the making! I want to write about the 'resort' experience as much as possible in that I know how much people rely on these reviews when making plans; as did I. My wedding \"planning \" experinece was different and much less personal and much less 'fun' than our stay there so I really want to focus on the positive - and there was a lot of positive! I would advise everyone to visit the resort's web site as much as possible. It is busy but they honestly left nothing to be desired in giving the overall feel of the place. It is not perfect - and that, quite honestly, to us, was the best part of it all! We were finished with resort perfection and super-size a long time ago. If you are the same, then this is the place for you. All of the villas are different - all decorated differently and they were all charming - not perfect; but charming. The beach was beautiful! Yes, it's rocky but don't let anyone tell you it's not swimable. If you want to walk barefoot acoss the sand and walk right into the water - then you will be disappointed. It's just not that 'kind' of a beach but that does not mean it's not beautiful and does not have a lot to offer. Out of 72 people at my wedding, not a single person had ANY problem laying on those overstuffed lounge chairs all afternoon, snorkeling, walking 100 feet to the pool, or walking a few feet off to the side to a clearing that is swimable. It was just different - but still an awesome setting. The staff - WONDERFUL and I mean wonderful! From the Cabana girl (Rosita - we all miss you!!!) to Diana (the resturant manager) to Shakira (at the front desk) they, without a doubt, make this resort what it is. They were attentive, personal, pleasant, chatty, professional and very humble. They truly make the Villa Montana the relaxing and unique place that it is. The resturant and the food - fantastic! The setting is romantic and charming and every meal we had was great. Yes, service can be slow but if you watch very carefully you simply can not miss the fact that they are truly trying and they truly want you to have a good experience. I can't say that about too many places. And, if you got your meal in 1/2 an hour, you would miss the ambiance that the Eclipse has so it's a great trade off as far as I'm concerned! So, sit back and relax! Since we had a rehearsal BBQ and a wedding dinner there, we had the opportunity to meet with Chef Jeremy a couple times. And if you get this priviledge then you will love the food even more! His modesty, attention to detail, and descriptions are enchanting! The comments from our guests about the dishes served at our wedding have not stopped. It was fabulous! On the wedding side - I am addicted to flowers and I was amazed and floored by how beautiful they all were. The time that went into getting a feel for my colors, my dress, the wedding party attire, the mood we wanted - all of it was breathtaking. Jessica did a wonderful job! For our BBQ we enjoyed the music of Mellow Pan Trio and they were perfect! For our wedding ceremony we had Alexis Espada (saxophone) and a guitarist. This was the highlight of our wedding! They were incredible! We could have listened to them all night. The ceremony music was very important to us and we could not have asked for anyone better or a better combination than these two! The resort did have power outages while we where there - one very long one and some of our guests had issues with the air conditioning in their rooms and a couple with the shower water. If you are counting on internet service - don't; it's just too sporatic to be relied upon. With the power - not a lot they can do! And with almost every issue, they responded in a timely manner. Like I said - the place is not perfect and most of the staff really do try very hard to please! They do have an area of opportunity that would make a big difference to guests - especially wedding guests and that is the check in time. The flights into Aguidilla are either very early or very late. Since most of our guests were coming from JFK, that meant most got to the resort at 10:30am. And it's hot...really, really hot so it was frustrating that so many could not check into their rooms until 4pm. That really gets to be an unreasonable period of time for most to sit around and wait for a room to be ready. I think the resort would go a long way in customer satisfation if they would compromise a bit more on these flight arrival times vs. check in times since many travel with children. Just a suggestion. Again, the resort is small and the staffing likewise but this would go a long way in easing a frustration that can develop at the very beginning of a stay. Other musts: Tropical Trail Rides and Happy Belly's!!! And the Lazy Parrot in Rincon. Bioluminescent Bay - forget about it! It's a long way to go for a town that does not even really 'open' until 4:30pm! Just stay on the beach at the resort!! My wedding planning experience was not as soothing and personal as the resort is and that's sad. But, the issues I had were seamless to my guests (for the most part) and I can say with certainty that they all had a wonderful time - even the ones that didn't think they would and each and every one of them said that our wedding was beautiful!", "Date": "July 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cWonderful alternative to \"big-box\" resorts!\u201d", "Author": "pitbulls", "ReviewID": "UR7841853", "Content": "My husband was in PR for work, so we took the opportunity to take a short vacation.

Not only did I get married there but my new husband and I stayed there for our honeymoon as well. We absolutely loved our entire stay there. We felt extremely lucky to have had our wedding ceremony at such a beautiful and romantic location and feel tremendously grateful to the exceptional staff there who gave us the wedding of our dreams. I could go on forever about how special and terrific the wedding was (in fact our wedding photographer from the states liked it so much she is planning her own destination wedding at the Villa Montana!), however since this is a hotel and resort review, I focus my comments on those aspects. First off, I would like to say that the Villa Montana is truly a special, unique resort with heart and soul. The staff at the resort are warm, caring and unpretentious and the overall ambience of the resort is about making sure you relax and enjoy your stay. Not only are the grounds gorgeous, but they invite you to enjoy them with hammocks and comfy cushioned lounge chairs scattered throughout the complex. There is a peaceful, garden oasis in the center of the complex where guests can get massages/spa services, a tennis court, 2 pools (one that is open 24hrs and the other which is next to the bar), 2 fantastic restaurants--each with its own personality-- and of course a stunning beach. If you want to kick-back and relax in a tropical paradise drinking pina coladas on the beach, this is the resort for you. We chose this resort based on the numerous Trip Advisor reviews we read. While we can understand some of the complaints brought up in previous reviews for us, a lot of these issues/complaints were minor and did not detract from our stay at all. Furthermore, our impression is that the resort is concerned about those same issues and working hard to make improvements. We visited the Villa Montana in October 2006 and in the 7 months since our last visit, we have already seen improvements\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsheets, blankets and towels have been upgraded, there is now wireless internet access in rooms, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153O\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd restaurant is up and running, Diana (the former events and sales coordinator) has been promoted to manage both restaurants to improve service because of her outstanding success running events at the VM, and service has gotten better and faster. Since this will be a rather long review, I have broken down the rest of the review into topics to make it easier for readers to browse through. Service: The service at the VM is friendly and enthusiastic. While some people may perceive the service as slow, we feel that it is just more in keeping with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sit-back, relax and enjoy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd attitude of the Carribean in general. Rather than staff constantly interrupting you to check on you, the attitude here is let people enjoy their food and surroundings but be available when needed. We definitely didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind soaking up the sun and watching the beautiful waves while waiting a few extra minutes for tasty food. And in fact, we were very impressed with how genuinely dedicated all staff were in trying to make each guests stay comfortable. To give a couple examples (I actually have many more)\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6during our reception dinner, since our wedding party was occupying half of the restaurant, our wedding coordinator and the restaurant manager waited tables themselves to make sure things ran smoothly for everyone. Another night, there was a torrential rainstorm (which was a fluke) with rain blowing into the open-air \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Eclipse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd restaurant horizontally. Staff ran around completely drenched to make sure guests were dry and comfortable and that food was still delivered hot. I believe that given the circumstances, most restaurants would have suspended service and I was impressed with the way the VM/ Eclipse displayed grace under fire. The most important thing to know about the service here is that rather than expecting to be treated like a king/queen, expect to be treated like a friend. Rooms: Clean, tastefully decorated and fun. We stayed in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Garden-view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (although in reality, we had a partial ocean view) 3-bdrm villa (unit A8) that was about 50 yards from the beach. We loved it. In fact, we were only supposed to stay in it for the wedding weekend, however we loved it so much that we upgraded to stay in it an additional 5 days. The kitchen and living room are sunny and airy with high vaulted wood ceilings. There were 2 bathrooms with distinctive hand-painted tiles and the master-bathroom had a sunny outdoor garden-shower. Amenities include A/C, ceiling fans, CD player, telephone, 2 TVs w/ DVD player, wireless internet access, dishwasher and laundry machine w/ dryer. D\u00c3\u00a9cor is Balinese style dark mahogany furniture and tropical floral print fabrics that look like it belongs in a Pottery Barn catalog. However, each unit is different with its own personal touches. Housekeeping would come daily (although sometimes later in the day) and even washed dishes! We also stayed in a cliff-side hotel room for a few nights which actually had an ocean-view and a well-manicured backyard. There was a 4-poster king bed and hand-painted tile bathroom again. FYI: Garden villas are larger than Ocean villas and cliffside hotel rooms are larger than garden view rooms. However Ocean villas then garden villas/rooms are closer to the beach. Cliffside rooms are about a 5-7 minute walk from beach. Food: Tasty, fresh and innovative. There are 2 restaurants at the VM: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Eclipse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153O\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Chef Jeremie Cruz (who used to be at the El Conquistador) oversees both. Eclipse is the main restaurant open 7 days a week 3 meals a day. It is a stylish, open-air (i.e. wall-less) beachside restaurant with gorgeous views of the water. Food is delicious and seasonal--French/American with a Carribean flare. Favorites: Eggs Benedict for breakfast, black bean shrimp quesadilla for lunch and pan roasted corvina (tasted like Chilean sea bass) with beurre de blanc sauce over pureed yucca/taro root for dinner. Favorite drinks: pina coladas and passion fruit daiquiri. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153O\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd restaurant is an Asian-fusion tapas restaurant/lounge/club open for dinner on weekends. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor is romantic and chic. You enter through an antique, wood sculpted door imported from Bali. The restaurant has 3 eating areas. The first has red curtain day beds perfect for couples who want a romantic, private dinner (definitely make reservations in advance). The main dining room has dark hardwood floors and Japanese style sunken dining tables. The third room is an outdoor tatami room with Safari animal print d\u00c3\u00a9cor. Favorites: lamb tangine and then chocolate tempura for dessert. We tried a couple of restaurants off the resort but loved the food at the VM so much that we ate most of our meals there. Prices were reasonable: Breakfast: $10-15, Lunch: $15-20, Dinner: $20-30\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddefinitely worth every penny. Facilities: well-appointed, with distinctive charm. There are tons of green grass, colorful flowers and swaying palm trees throughout the resort. The layout of the resort is multiple, well-spaced 2-3story villas/condos (not just one large concrete building like many beach resorts). Even hotel rooms are incorporated into the villas. Rather than posh (no valet parking or Jacuzzi tubs) the setting of the resort is stylishly comfortable with a fun and friendly ambience. What I love about the Villa Montana is that it has a distinctive personality and is not like your standard, chain hotel. In terms of activities, there is snorkelling, sea kayaking, tennis, and gym facilities (all for free). For extra fees-- rock climbing wall, horseback riding at a next door ranch (highly recommend), massages/spa services. The front desk can also help arrange tours, snorkelling/scuba trips. There is no casino here but with the addition of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153O\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, there is more of a night-life at the resort now. However, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re like me and enjoy peace and quiet, taking a private dip in their 24-hour pool was the perfect, romantic night for me. Location: rustic but absolutely gorgeous. The Villa Montana is located in Isabela in the northwest corner of Puerto Rico\u00e2\u20ac\u201dabout a 2 hour drive from San Juan but only 10 minutes from the Aguadilla aiport. The area has historically been a sleepy surfing town and tourism hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite hit the area yet (which is actually something we loved about the place), but its an absolutely beautiful piece of land. I think this is one of the most important things to keep in mind in choosing your travel destination. This is a place to escape from it all and not a place to expect tons of museums/city life/casinos. The Villa Montana is the main attraction in the immediate vincinity (other than the beach and water activities of course) however other attractions nearby (about 30-45 min away) include Rio Camuy (underground river/caves) and the Arecibo radio tower (where Contact was filmed). There is also a public golf course about 10 minutes away. However if you want to get away from it all for a relaxing, romantic retreat, staying on the resort is perfect. If you do plan to leave the resort, a rental car is definitely recommended. Beach: The beaches of the area are varied in terms of surf but all beautiful. The one right in front of the VM is idyllic\u00e2\u20ac\u201dclean with tall palm trees, thick purple-cushioned lounge chairs, day-beds and bright yellow umbrellas. There are smooth flat rocks that lead into the water so water socks are a good idea. The surf can be a bit rough\u00e2\u20ac\u201dremember this is surfing area\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut definitely swimmable. If you surf or kite-board (or like me, just enjoy watching), this seems to be the place to be. However, around the corner is Shacks beach which is a bit calmer and easier for kids and snorkelling. There are also beautiful reefs to explore\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe saw tons of coral, colorful fish, and even squid! However, there are also lots of sea urchins so be careful. We read in some reviews complaints about the beach being dirty and littered. Our experience was that the beach at VM and Shacks beach were very clean but when we took the horseback ride further down the beach (maybe a mile or 2 down?) where the beach is public and not owned by the VM, it is not as well maintained. Pros: friendly, unpretentious, personalized service; beautiful setting; delicious food; clean, comfortable rooms with character. Cons: a lot of what other people may consider cons, I actually loved about the resort but depending on what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for, you may find the following problematic: quiet night life, not located near city/museums/casino, web-site is hard to navigate; once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re there, you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to leave!", "Date": "May 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "kuiarra", "Title": "\u201cVilla Montana is Awesome\u201d", "Author": "kuiarra", "ReviewID": "UR7682778", "Content": "We just came back from celebrating our wedding in Villa Montana on 5/19.

I recommend anyone who wants to marry in PR to go there. If you are looking for laid back and quiet this is your place. Alot of people dont seem to understand that the part of the island that Villa Montana is located at is known for surfing, that is why the beach is rough, this is not Villa Montana's fault. Nature plays a hand in it entirely. Both restuarants are awesome Eclipse and O, I have read negative comments on them and let me start by saying that this is not the United States Mainland where everything is done quick, even in New York we see negatives. Villa Montana runs on a limited staff and is working at its best to make sure that everyone has there orders. I personally believe that with time they will be above exceptional. Most people should stop comparing Villa Montana with bigger hotels, it is not it is a remote place to spend quiet time and relax. Our wedding was held on the beach and it was marvelous. Lizbeth the coordinator went above and beyond and she deserves praise and admiration, it is not an easy job dealing with brides aboard, I am one of them. I am extremely great ful to her and Shakira from Front Desk who showed us what a real employee- guest relationship is. We loved them both and can not wait to go back. The rooms were great. We had our moments, but it happens with any hotel even the most expensive bigger name kinds, and I can tell you a thing about those hotels, and in all honesty put Villa Montana at the very top of the best list. They have a beautiful beach, if it is too rocky for you to swim, take a walk and you will end up at the Blue Hole, a spectacular snorkeling spot just a few steps from V.M. we spent hours there. V.M.'s pools are awesome our son loved it. Again I say Villa Montana and there staff, especially LIZBETH and SHAKIRA are awesome.

Not to mention it is located on Shacks Beach, known as one of PR's most beautiful beaches, with awesome coral reefs, and beautiful fish. The resort has two wonderful restaurants, each with completely different styles, each excellent in their own way. The employees are wonderful people and very kind people. The beach on which Villa Montana is located is very beautiful. One is able to walk as far as they can before they reach the end! The west coast of Puerto Rico is completely different than any other place I've ever visited in my life. It is sooo relaxing. Back at home, I was always going every which way, but the lifestyle here has slowed my life down and is is great! The last thing I want to talk about is the grounds. This part of the resort is awe inspiring. The beautiful landscape, the path's to get around, the restaurant, and everything else. I could go on and on about the beauty within Villa Montana Beach Resort. They have two pools, tennis courts, a spa, and of course the beach, the bestr part of PR. This excellent resort is the perfect getaway for those looking to have a great time experiencing the west coast of Puerto Rico. I definetly recommend coming down here for a vacation.

The resort is very beautiful, but it is very disappointing. This will be a long review, so there is the Villa Montana 101 at the end for your benefit if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a hurry. But please read the whole review when you have a chance. I read all the reviews to this resort, but still had to stay there for an event we attended there. My conversations while making my arrangements went very well and Shakira and Janet helped me make changes before I went. While we were there the owners of the resort were there to. So 1st you need to get there. You can either take a 2 hour drive from San Juan in a rental car(250/week), Fly to Aquedilla and land at 3 am in morning($100 more to fly here), or take a cab from San Juan and pay $150each way. Once you decide that that directions the hotel gives are poorly written and only make since once you get there you'll be better off bringing your GPS or googlemapping it. Our friends who used the hotels info all got lost. The resort uses words like \"look for\" but doesn't say do this or that. They also say take 110, but not whether it's east or west. It's a stressful ride so if you do drive, try to land during the day so getting there is easier. Once you arrive at the front desk all you can smell is flowers and all you see and green grass and palms trees. The resort is absolutely beautiful. The grounds are clean like Disneyland. The rooms, or in our case the ocean view villa, was great at first look. But the floors are sandy and there is quite a bit of wear and tear. I have pics and will post ASAP. Our phone was messed up and always lit up there was a message. When we called they said there were no messages, cleared the line but then sent all calls to voicemail with no ring so we thought there were no messages once they said they fixed it but in actuality our friends were leaving messages and we thought because they cleared the lines the light must have been just broken. We were not the only people who had their phones forwarded. Again we were here for an event and needed to communicate with other guests. The restaurant, wow this is a nice looking place. All candlelit, hanging white linen blowing in the breeze and super comfy chairs. But get comfortable, because you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to be sitting for a long long time and paying high end prices from delicious SOUNDING food. Being so isolated in the west of PR, Eclipse is the only place around. O was open but it is only open on Weekends. O is swanky and indoors. It has an open air area, but not ocean view like Eclipse. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty to choose from, but each item is pretty basic tasting no matter what the description. Service is unbearable. Lunch is a two hour ordeal for a burger. Dinner is 2+ at a table. I think another chef would be helpful. From what I hear there's only one. Ok, so you ate, sat at the bar for another drink, and went to sleep on an average mattress. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a little stiff, but you smell the breakfast and are drawn to the PRican coffee. Breakfast is the best meal here; it's quick since there's less items and less customers. But as your eating you glance at the beach chairs and realize there are only 30 of them out and they all have towels on them. Yup, you read it right, even here at the sit back and relax place...you have to deal with getting up early and saving a seat that you may or may not use!!! Who needs this drama on vacation? What to do while your here: If you read the website, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re supposed to be prepared to relax and do beach activities. Well, the resort has a couple of snorkels and masks, and 2 2 person kayaks. Yup, that's it. No boogie boards, no surfboards, no 1 person kayaks, no jet skis, no nothing. Seeing this I went to the front desk to get info on surfing and horseback riding. The resort made my reservation for the horse riding, but messed up my friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reservation. The front desk never called. As for surfing, since this area of PRICO is supposed to be renowned for it's surfing, they front desk gave me a brochure to call for a lesson. They surf place doesn't visit the report, you need to visit them. So, for beach activities, you are going to be very bored. You can go for a walk, but the 3 miles of beaches they brag about is littered with everything from glass to car parts, that is of course once you get away from the wild dogs all over the place. The event we went here for was spectacular. I'm not sure how any of the other guests got anything, since the event took up most of the restaurant and bar, but if it was me as a guest not at the event I would have been making arrangements at another location because there is no way Villa Montana can handle a 100 person event and cater to the other guests. A few more details for you. I saw 3 hammocks not plenty like the brochure, we had two ironing boards no iron, no rooms safes, ran out of milk at our meal, room cleaning came at 5pm, mixed up our rooms keys, they resort is very buggy bring plenty of bug spray, there is 1 masseuse, we scheduled a couples massage and canceled since one person has to wait for the other one, plenty of kids in pools and beach. Not that there is a problem with that, but they are bored and always looking for their parents to occupy them. We were so thrilled to go to this event and had a great time at the event, but Villa Montana needs more help. The owners were responsive to some of my concerns, but if they don't step it up this beautiful resort will lose all clientele to a competitor, if one even comes along in that area. Getting there: Either a 2 hour drive from San Juan in a rental car, Fly to Aquedilla and land at 3 am in morning, or take a cab from San Juan and pay $150each way. Rooms: The villas are cute and spacious, but dirty. The other rooms are like any other hotel room you've seen. Beach: Rocky, so you need to be careful getting into the water near the resort. You can move down, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no service, restrooms, or chairs. Service/Food: Deathly slow.

My boyfriend and my experience was so bad at this \"resort\" that I felt that it was my duty to write. It was so ridiculious that I almost want to call John Stossel from 20/20 and tell him about the Villa Montana \"resort\" as it provides perfect content for his Give Me A Break reports. Some highlights from our trip: Due to an average rainfall, the road to the \"resort\" was flooded enough that not even a SUV could get by and the front desk had no clear solution or timeframe as to when we would be able to drive through. This was our first experience of the \"you are on your own\" mentality at this place. This behavior would be more acceptable if Villa Montana called itself a condominium complex, not a resort it claimes to be. Let me point out that this is after 2.5 hrs of driving over the speed limit from San Juan despite the website indicating it is a 1.5 hr drive. In summary, we had no way to get to the \"resort\" for hours and there is NOTHING in this area other than some manufacturing facilities (Hewlett Packard, Tyco) and a couple of very bad and overpriced restaurants with extremely depressing atmospheres making us wish we had vacationed in Secaucas, NJ. Don't expect fresh fish or fresh produce. The restaurant at the \"resort\" and a seafood restaurant down the street both served frozen fish for the price of an expensive New York City restaurant. Entrees were $20-$40. There are no other food options in the area. The only place we were excited about was this little food stand outside of the resort but unfortunately it was never open....the stand guy must have taken a vacation or something. Given the hassle we experienced, they upgraded us to a 1 bedroom villa. While the room, superficially, looked somewhat charming, the infestation of ants in both the bathroom and kitchen was annoying. Although we we were aware that these ants were harmless, it was hard to relax when our toothbrushes we were about to use or the pinapples we were excited to eat, particularly given the depressing food options, were covered in ants. We called the front desk and told them of the ants issue, and although they said they would have someone come to resolve the problem, no one came. The beaches are not nice either. In fact, on our walk down the \"3 miles of untouched beach\" Villa Montana writes about on its website, we came across trash that truly amazed us. The more interesting ones included a rusted sofa bed and washer/dryer. I wish I had my camera for that walk. I could go on and on about our bad experiences if I had the time or energy. In summary, although the landscape at the restaurant and pool are actually very pretty (this must explain why Vogue and Elle magazines did photo shoots here), there is NOTHING else appealing about this place. The place is in a romote manufacturing area, the beaches are dirty, the service is horrible, and the food options are beyond depressing.

The resort looked wonderful on the website, the reviews were good, and the prices were reasonable. Upon arriving, the resort did look beautiful. However, that's when the fun started. The front desk was oblivious to our arrival, and carried on side conversations rather than check us in. Once settled in after a 20 minute wait (with no other guests checking in at the same time), the room was nice, and things seemed to be in order. My girlfriend enjoys sleeping with 2 pillows, so we called to request an extra pillow. We called and were assured that it would be taken care of and went off to dinner at the resort restaurant. Don't go to the restaurant. I preface this by saying that we are two easy-to-please people. Decent food served expiditiously and some seblance of service is good enough. Even though the restaurant was 1/2 full, we were asked if we made reservations, then asked to wait. And wait. And wait some more. After asking if we could sit anywhere (not by the water, but at any of their multiple open tables), we were seated after a 40 minute wait. Once sat, we were ignored further at every turn by our waitress. We ordered an appetizer after a 20 minute wait, waited 30 minutes more, then asked if we'd have mussels since they're out of clams. Ok then. We took whatever food they offered at that point. Dinner showed up roughly 45 minutes to an hour after that. In total we waited two hours just to get to the main dishes, which were nothing to write home about and superbly overpriced. Perhaps there is a cultural disconnect between what we expect from dinner service and what level of service is provided, but they should know their clientele well enough to make the appropriate adjustments. To ignore us while talking with other staff members for hours is ridiculous and insulting. The restaurant was a waste of time and money due to their lack of service and lack of care for us. We get back to the room, and there is no pillow to be seen. We call again, and are told that the walkie-talkies aren't working between the front desk and the bellman. I volunteer to pick it up. I'm then told that it is \"on the way\". An hour goes by. I call to cancel; they seem confused. I'm not asking for the world, just an extra pillow. We used a spare comforter as a makeshift one. That night/the next morning around 4 am, my girlfriend wakes me up and spots a huge fire below our room in the trees adjacent to the tennis courts, about 200 yards max from our room. We could see it at the treelines, so this is no small fire. No fire alarm goes off in the whole complex so we knock on doors in the building to alert them. We obviously see the threat and report it to 911. Trucks show up quickly and take two hours to put it out. Next morning, we call the front desk to see if they are ok. It turns out the housekeeping building burnt down completely. They say everything's fine, and don't even ask how we are. OK, terrific! The beach looks nice but it is tough to go wade in the water due to rocks. We were happy to leave on Tuesday. The Villa Montana staff topped off their non-service by not even asking how our stay was.

Our two bedroom apartment was clean and well kept. The staff was friendly and the beach was very nice especially if you like to snorkel.

Unfortunately this gourmet establishment is overpriced and the service from the kitchen is slow and inconsistant.

Lack of passports and the new requirements dictated that we go to a US territory, $700 round trip airfare counted out the USVI, our first choice, and so we picked Puerto Rico. We wanted island, not high rise heaven, not hotel chain, mcdonalds cut out, Disney world type island, so we selected Aguadilla over San Juan. As a family of five, finding accomodations can be difficult, especially with two teen girls (hello, two bathrooms.) We read the reviews and took a gamble on Villa Montana. This is a condo complex with villa style duplexs on the beach, townhouses behind them and garden view two level buildings behind that (we were in the garden view two level on the second floor). There were several units that had personalized furnishings and were occupied by local families. Other units (like ours) had the standard issue couch and no personal art. In the distance on the cliff we could see the hotel but did not go to it. Best part -- the resort was full, but you couldn't tell, and the grounds are very, very well maintained. This is where they put all their effort. It was a fine choice, but we were realistic in our expectations. First, you are renting a condo, not going to a resort. Don't expect prompt mainland-type service, concierge help or other typical resort features. We did get a clean, cheerily decorated, roomy two bed, two bath villa, with washer/dryer and two lovely decks. The kitchen was equiped but missing a few items I expected -- like dishtowels, dish soap and potholders. (We stay at a lot of Residence Inns). I emailed a grocery list but no groceries were there and staff did not rush to get them, so the first day we did have to eat at the restuarant for lunch which was $70 for four people -- one child, two teen girls and my husband. Ouch. If the price is right (and JetBlue airfare plus $460 a night for all that space is a pretty good deal during February break) and you do choose to go to Villa Montana here are our recommendations to make it a pleasant experience: Rent a car. Bring dry goods (flour,rice, cereal), including small laundry soap and dish soap, and go to the grocery store on your first day to stock up. Full selection and reasonable prices (Unusual for the islands!) $150 got it done for four days. Bring all the stuff you think you'll need -- except for the grocery store, there are no tourist services like gift shops, etc. (The airport has the only gift shop, and it's only open when flights arrive and depart). Bring snorkling gear, boogie boards and beach towels. Book snorkling in La Parguera with Paradise Scuba for the afternoon and evening bioluminescent bay. It includes some great, well guided snorkling in the cays and open water, terrific chicken empanadas and beer (soda for the kids) and the bioluminescent evening dip is great. (60-90 minute car ride from the Villa Montana to the far south end of the island, down commerical route 2, but worth the effort). If you are a a diver, this is the side of the island where you want to be. If the weather cooperates, the beach at Villa Montana is fabulous and the pools are great, but not in a carribean sea kind of way, in a kiteboarding, surfing, wave crashing kind of way. Wake up early and get out on the comfy loungers, bring the towels from your room and don't sign any out at the beach. Drive down 4466 to the OceanView restaurant for your dinner out . Local food but tourist-friendly, be respectful of local custom and get dressed up -- skirts for ladies. Fun live guitar and kid/adult friendly food. Drive through Rincon and check out the beaches, very pretty. I called twice prior to our arrival to confirm and had booked via the internet so I had written confirmation -- I recommend that you do that. I sat in the lobby for internet service (the only location on the resort with high speed internet service) and witnessed one digruntled guest who wasn't getting the two bedroom they requested on the phone, after submitting an internet request for a one bedroom. The front desk person did try an alternate arrangement (a second room in the \"hotel\" portion) at a very reasonable price but the guest turned it down. Front desk personnel are very friendly and have lots of information, but info is all you get. A fun story -- my daughter wanted a conch shell from this trip. None to be found on the beach at Villa Montana. She didn't buy one or take one from La Parguera, and so we went on a local quest, which involved info from the front desk, the staff person of the tourist bureau calling her mother and a visit to Mom's house where she makes shell jewlery. My daughter got her conch shell and a wonderful lesson about life in PR from a local perspective, but as always when you are a guest in someone's home, it pays to be courteous, friendly and flexible.", "Date": "February 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cLa Isla Bonita\u201d", "Author": "neutrino", "ReviewID": "UR6820202", "Content": "After a weekend holiday returning from Villa Montana the moments spent soaking in the environment were priceless. When you walk to the lef tof the resort theres seriously miles of untouched beach to walk. I felt like I was Survivorman and or part of Gilligans Island. The service is considered slow to the reviews I read but I would say it is island speed. The service to me was great. If one were to look for speedy service than there are hotels that thrive on throwing you the bill after your last bite. Villa Montana makes sure you relax enjoy. If you need the check quickly and or a towel ask earlier and expect it on time. After returning back to the fast pace life I bow to the staff for slowing me down. I rented a room to sleep 5 and we got a 2 bedroom, living room with a sofa bed, kitchen, 2 bath (with bidet), air conditioners in all room with ceiling fans, and a washing machine and dryer. Im not sure if all of them have it. Some rooms are small but like a cruise some of the rooms are only to sleep... We had a chance to rent out the gazebo next to the beach for our reserved picnic I would totally recommend this if you like to be romantic and or experience lifes simple pleasures. If you also get a chance make reservations for \"o\" the restaurant only open on Friday and Saturday. The A/C is blating and the Tapas is tasty. The restaurant Eclipse is great too. Different menus throughout the day. The water is somewhat rough since it is facing towards the Atlantic but there are pockets where you can enter and swim. Those who love to surf this place is like paradise with icing on top. This place has enough you never have to explore outside. We stayed the whole time within the resort. Taxi costed $35. and takes 15 minutes felt like 5 minutes. This place is a giant gem on the North Shore. Im sure in the future things will change.

The hotel consists of one or two story 1-3 bedroom condos. The buildings are widely spaced from each other. The condos are spacious with the two bedroom units being over 1000 sq. feet. The units further from the beach are somewhat larger. There are a few \"hotel rooms\" which are quite small. We have found that the condo's are well furnished and extremely clean. The hotel is beautifully landscaped and the beach is spectacular. You can walk \"forever\", either to the East or West and see no one for long periods. The surf is quite strong at the hotel but on many days it is possible to go into the water. Swimming is limited to strong swimmers. There is kite surfing about 100 yards to the East that attracts international surfers. In addition to Eclipse at the hotels, there are a number of very good, informal restaurants within a five minute drive of the hotel. These serve excellent meat and sea food with less flair than at Eclipse and in a more Puerto Rican style. Unfortunately, noise somewhat dimished our recent visit. A new hotel is being built at the western edge of the hotel. The noise severely impacts the units nearest the construction but does not those room further east, ie closer to the restaurant. We were awoken twice by dogs barking and once by a very late party outside one of the condos. The hotel responded very quickly to our calls about the noise. The front desk of the hotel, including the issue of beach towels, does not work as smoothly as in large resort hotels. However, the individuals at the front desk all mean very well and will respond positively to requests that are presented in a reasonable manner.

We actually arrived early, and spent some time in other parts of the island before going to Isabella for the wedding, so we do have something to compare this to. (See our review of the HoJos in Mayaguez, and the CopaMarina Beach Resort). The Villa Montana is OK as far as it goes, but I wouldn't compare it favorably to other resorts in its price range, in PR or elsewhere. The specific problems we had were: Front Desk/reservations: Not the most on the ball people on earth. When people ask for a room with two beds, they say \"there are no rooms with two beds\" even though plenty of the villas have multiple rooms. That's an example of the sort of mentality you run into at this place: They will answer the question, and do what is asked, but they don't take any initiative to make you really enjoy your stay, which is what you would expect in this price range. Phone service: Room to room worked spottily, there is no cell coverage, so you have to rely on the (one per villa) land line, which went down several times. Water Pressure: Watch out when someone flushes the toilet while you are taking a shower: HOT HOT HOT. Internet: The Internet in our villa never worked, since it was dependent on a wireless access point in another villa, which I would gather was not plugged into the Internet at all. I was able to get it working in another wedding guest's room, by plugging it in. Television: We never had working TV service in the 3 days we were there. The hotel has no competent technical staff to fix any of these items, and the guys they rely on seem to work one day a week . Restaurant: Expensive, slow service. Activities: None on-site that I could see. There are tennis courts, but it is pretty much self-serve. All the activities they recommend are run by expensive, off-resort, local businesses. Pool/Ocean: The pool is small, the ocean unsuitable for small children. I'm a certified rescue diver, and a surfer, and I didn't swim there due to the waves and currents. The waves were the worst part: blown out mush that makes it bad for anything except kiteboarding. One of the other guests, who surfs Stinson Beach SF with some regularity, cut his foot up pretty badly while trying to swim there.

If you look at their really poor web page that some kid did during his lunch break...there are no large pictures for you to get detail of the motel? The first page doesn't even show a clear picture, mostly likely because it would saw trashed on the beach. Second there are not 21 different activates to do. My kids were bored during most of the trip and there was not other large family there. I don't know where they came up with that, and if maybe the GM or another manager can list them the front desk sure couldn't. Nothing is worst when your talking with someone and then they speak another language to there co worker, this happen many times and I always had a feeling that they were talking do to may family and me. My main problem was the resort and rooms where dirty, the pools were filled with bugs my daughter wouldn't go swim during our 5-day trip. They the ocean is not swimable, its not that the waves are rough, its because there are large rocks throughout the whole beach area. The beach also had a lot of trashed and bottles. Oh and you better bring towels with you if you visit this motel (resort usually has live entertainment and a hot tub) You can find any towels near the pool or beach, they you go to the front desk and you get more [--] from them and of course they continued to speak another language. The rooms are not rugged anywhere, the floor was all dirty, there were bugs thought out both rooms. There wasn't even a desk for me to do some work and the couch was ripped in a few area's. We called a head of time to get a roll away bed, but when we got there they were all be used...come to find out later there are only 2 rollaway beds for 50 rooms.

So I just left, didn't want to waste my time fighting with them because I had a plan to catch. So we drove off to the airport where I just thought there would be a ATM, however the taxi driver didn't say anything about there being no ATM till after were got to the Airport. So I had to leave my wife and kids at the airport as I drive to find an ATM. In this time the taxi driver said that he knew there wasn't an ATM there??? Well I thought I wonder if the Front Desk knew that. So I called them acting like I was still at the Resort and checking out soon. What was great is the front desk agent that I dealt with answered the phone. So she when on to tell me that no there is not ATM at the airport...that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s when I couldn't take it anymore....I was so upset that the front desk didn't even care to tell me this important information.

There was a misunderstanding when we checked in as we had reserved an one bedroom ocean front villa with a king bed and when we got there we found out there is no such thing; all of them have only a queen bed. The desk people were upset that we had this wrong information (it came from their call center and not the hotel) and found us a villa that had a king bed but was further back from the ocean. This was quite a task as they were fully booked and had a large wedding group.

And without ever having seen it until we arrived, 5 days prior to our wedding day! I must say I did rely in part on Trip Advisor reviews and photos providing by the resort. Getting There: We flew into San Juan and rented a car. It takes an hour and a half if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re good at driving in traffic. I highly recommend you find a way to arrive using the airport at Aquadilla, only ten minutes from the resort. The last mile or so we began to wonder what we had got ourselves into, as the road narrows to almost one lane, and we thought we were in the middle of nowhere! Then we came around a corner, saw the gated entrance, and drove into one of the most beautiful places we have ever seen. We had 43 friends and family joining us for the wedding, and every one of them loved the resort, and the surrounding area. They had a ball! I reserved a 3 bedroom villa for my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 and me, plus our kids (this was the second time around!) and it was right on the beach, nicely decorated, and as the 3 br is really a 2 br joined with a 1 br, the extra small kitchen was perfect for our son and grandchild. We loved the outdoor shower off of our master bedroom! The villa was well maintained, and any minor items were taken care of quickly, based on island time. (A note here to TripAdvisor readers: we are experienced travelers and have stayed at 4 and 5 star resorts and hotels throughout the Caribbean, Mexico, Hawaii, England, Scotland & Ireland, as well as the USA. If you think of house keepers, food servers and hotel staff in general as servants there to do your bidding, demand instant service, and have no interest in, or respect for, the local culture, well you probably should stay at home. We have found that if we introduce ourselves to staff and local people and show a sincere interest in them, there culture and language, we get great and genuine service. Sorry for the lecture, but not one negative thing we read among the mostly positive reviews regarding this resort ever happened to us, or the 43 people who joined us. Your attitude directly reflects the level of service you receive.) Some of our guests stayed in villas, and some in hotel rooms, all were pleased. One had asked for a king bed, when shown to the room and it had a queen, they were quickly upgraded to a one bedroom with a king. The pools were clean and well maintained. The grounds were stunning and constantly attended to. A group of 9 of our guests arrived at 11:30pm and the staff were waiting at the reception area to greet them. The bartender stayed open until probably 1am, and the staff even prepared sandwiches in case they were hungry! One night I called the front desk at around 11pm to ask if they had a corkscrew, as the one in our kitchen was broken. They said they would check, and a few minutes later one of the managers, Edna, arrived on a golf cart with a corkscrew she had taken from the bar. We opened our wine, she left, and the next day we had a new corkscrew in our villa. Things To Do: There is horse back riding available adjacent to the resort, Tropical Trail Rides owned and operated by Michelle and Craig Barker. Considered by many the best on the island, most of our group went. The ride on the beach is incredible. I also have to mention the Ocean Front Hotel & Restaurant, just a few miles from the resort, right on Jobos beach. They have an air conditioned restaurant, but the fun is out on the ocean deck. The bar and deck are covered, and the staff was great. We went by ourselves our first night, and the food was very good and inexpensive. Two nights later we went back with our two sons and daughter and 19 month old grand daughter. We had such a great time we decided to have all our guests come back with us on Friday night. I called the owner, who was kind enough to set up extra tables for us, and we showed up with 40 of our friends and family! They just loved it. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very laid back, the view is fantastic, and we had so much fun that most of us went back on Sunday! The Wedding: It was a beautiful setting on the grass by the ocean, (note: in the photo of the wedding gazebo, the chairs had all been covered in white, but had been removed due to the rain. See the Villa Montana web site for a photo of the wedding gazebo all set up) with the wedding gazebo decorated with fresh flowers and flowing linens. The path covered with flower petals. The guest chairs all lined up. Then the heavens opened and it poured! I mean serious cats and dogs rain! So while we waited in our villa, and our guests mingled by the bar, the staff moved everything onto the restaurant patio, which was covered, so the ceremony could start. But then there was a break, and Diana, our wedding planner, and that Edna again, knowing we really wanted our wedding on that beach, moved it all back outside in no time! It was a beautiful ceremony in a beautiful setting. Following cocktails on the lawn we moved to the terrace of the Eclipse restaurant. The terrace was also gorgeous, with long tables we chose (at the suggestion of Diana) instead of round, flowers everywhere, and wonderful lighting that gave it a magical air. The menu, prepared by Executive Chef Jeremie Cruz (named Caribbean Chef of the Year 1997 -98) was excellent, and served in a timely manner; there when needed, but not rushed. Diana, our wedding planner was there throughout to oversee. And when my 82 year old Mother, who uses a cane, was ready to go back to her villa, there was Edna with the cart! The next morning we hosted a breakfast for everyone and once again, the food was great and the service fine. (Here I will offer a suggestion to management: people will wait a long time for their breakfast, with that beautiful ocean view, but they need their coffee and juice quickly. A coffee thermos placed on the table means your staff doesn't have to keep checking, and won't forget, and the customer doesn't have his nice hot breakfast in front of him but no coffee to drink with it. Minor detail, but island time aside, more than several people mentioned this.) After Thoughts: Since we have arrived back home we have talked with all 43 of our guests and all agree it was a well run wedding, and a beautiful resort, and not one complaint. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to beat! We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say enough about the staff throughout the hotel. The bartenders, food servers, house keeping staff, and front desk were all very accommodating, always friendly, and ready to help. The hotel general Manager and owner, Jessica Tiphaine, came out several times to greet us and ask how everything was. And last, Diana Perez, our wedding planner. We thank her for all her effort, before and during our stay. She helped us to make decisions on the ceremony and reception, and saw to it that all went as planned. She was in on her day off, waited with us until 11:30 one night for guests to arrive, and just simply went above and beyond to insure our wedding was perfect. The other special mention is Edna Bosques. She was always there, always helping, and we loved her attention to detail. We will go back, and some of our friends and family are already talking about a return trip.

The pool areas are relaxing and offer comfortable areas in the sun and the shade. The lounges in the bar area are especially comfortable, even more so, with the creative refreshing drinks made by the friendly, talented and meticulous bartender. The beach chairs and lounges in front of the ocean are plentiful and many can be moved in the shade or the hammocks provide shade with the palms. While the ocean in front is a little rocky, there are plenty of sandy areas to swim . The local dogs and cats provide great entertainment as do the kit surfers, surfers and fishermen. My husband and I love to watch the old local fisherman fish by hand with their leathered hands standing right in the ocean with only fishing line and a hook! The restaurant continues to improve with nuevo cuisine and local favorites. In fact, the chef uses many vegetables, lettuces, and herbs from the organic garden. I had a pumpkin soup that was better than anything I've ever had in Chicago, and the lobster salad was so great I had it twice! My husband and I have had the opportunity to stay in various different villas, including the hotel room, one bedroom villa, and cliffside room. Each room is unique, clean and a mix between Polynesian and Caribbean. The ocean views are great, but the cliffside also has spectacular ocean views and views of the whole grounds. This resort is definitely not in a metropolitan city like San Juan where there are the old standbys of hotels with chains all over.

There's only one restaurant, but it has inexpensive non-resort prices, and some great local food on the menu. The rooms are nice, especially the 2 bdrm suites. My only complaint is that for the prcies charged, better quality beds n linens should be supplied. Also, the bar closes a little early (11:00 PM) in tune with the sleepy lifetstyle. If it rains, there's not much to do. Lastly, staff moves at snail pace, but that maybe be cultural (lol). It takes forever to get food n drink, but then again, if you are on vacation, sitting on a beach, things could be worse. If you only have a couple of days in Puerto Rico, San Juan would be still be my first choice, but if you have an extended stay, and want out of San Juan, although sleepy, this is a beautiful place to stay, and a healthy change of pace.

We visited many hotels such as Rincon Beach Resort, Caribe Hilton in San Juan, and the like. Although we had a bad experience when we checked in, we immediately fell in love with the place. The owner seems to be regularly on the grounds and is very approachable with a great sense of humor. We saw her decorating the pool area with items she just received from Pottery Barn and it was great to see her excitement in making the resort even more comfortable and beautiful than it was. It was also refreshing to see her passion and dedication to the resort and the fact that she cares enough about the resort to decorate it herself. This is something I am sure you will not see in any hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c anywhere. As I mentioned, we had one experience in which ONE particular check-in individual was not friendly and seemed to be in a bad mood. When we mentioned it to management, she immediately corrected the situation and spoke to the individual. This person also apologized. Everyone else was absolutely wonderful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the bar staff, wait staff, and housekeepers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c everyone was wonderful. Diana, the wedding coordinator and her assistant (Rosio) were also wonderful and listened to our needs and quickly devised a plan for our wedding. We are completely at ease and comfortable that they will take care of everything. I know that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to have a stress-free wedding and that everything will be taken care of. Best of all, if I need to ask her anything as the date gets closer; she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just an email away. The food was delicious and we had the opportunity to meet the chef, whom like the owner was friendly and approachable. He came to our table and spoke to us for a few minutes. At first, I thought that he made it a point to come to our table because we were still undecided about having our wedding there, but then I noticed that throughout the night he visited at least 5-7 other tables. We did wait about 35 minutes for our food \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but trust me it was worth the wait!

Beautiful surroundings and perfect sunsets every day. I thought, what a way to showcase this place to wedding guests who may make it their own destination in the future. However, service remains to be desired. I stayed at one of the cliffside hotel rooms. At check-in, I asked for a second key to my room. As we were being shown to our rooms, the staff member told me the wrong key was given. Turns out my 2 other friends also were given the wrong second keys. Don't know if it is the front-desk staff or their organization system. Later the first night, the toilet was backed up. Housekeeping came to clean up the mess, but they didn't change the rug placed in front of the commode. It wasn't smelly or anything, just that any one looking at it could tell it was soiled. Next day when we came back from the beach to get ready for the wedding early afternoon, the room was not made. We had to call housekeeping so we could have some fresh towels for the shower. The maid came and said she would come back later to clean the room. What an unpleasant surprise to come back from the wedding to see the room in the same condition we left it. The maid never came. We complained to housekeeping and since we were heading back out again, we asked if they could come even though it was a bit late. Front desk said no problem. Guess what, we came back 2 hours later and still no housekeeping. We gave up. The night before checkout, our party decided to look up our portfolios. My friend saw charges on her bill that was incurred before she even checked in. She got it reversed, but still. My bill was correct so I didn't think much of it. I balked when I got my credit card statement and saw a charge posted on the day after I had checked out. I don't know what is wrong with this place. I had traveled to many places and never had these problems. It's a shame because it is beautiful there. By the way, there is no hotel information in the rooms. You have to ask the front desk about everything. Even the voice messaging system doesn't work. If you follow what's printed on the phone you get a busy signal. My friend got a flashing light but couldn't get to the message. He asked the lady at the front desk and was told to dial a completely different extension and passcode. Some things they do at this place just make you scratch your head.", "Date": "May 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bend, or", "Title": "\u201cnice when theres not a wedding\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5035691", "Content": "We really liked this place, its great and out of the way. Surf in the area is nice and the staff is great. The one big problem was there was a wedding there for three days. Two of those days they wanted to serve us food in the little confrence room away from the beach and next to the gym. The highlight is the restaurant and bar, when thats closed you loose a lot. When its the last day of your wedding anniversary holiday and you can't go to the restaurant on the beach or any other, its not so great. Place is great staff is nice but management seems off.
