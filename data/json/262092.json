It was quite an expensive stay for what it was but we were told its one of the cheapest hotels. It is situated next to the canal and is only a few minutes walk to shops and Remembrandtsplein. You will definitely need a map if you're not familiar with Amsterdam. In the room we had a double bed, two bedside cabinets, a dressing table, a mirror and a TV. The TV didn't work and didn't have a remote. There were a few cigarette burns in our duvet cover (We are non-smokers and were given a 'non-smoking room' apparently). The spare pillow was covered in stains. There were water stains on the roof and we were pretty sure we could hear mice scurrying around in the walls and ceiling. There wasn't anywhere to put clothes only a shelf space. The wet room was very clean, clean toilet and sink and shower gel and shampoo was provided. The towel's that were provided were clean. The wet room did seem quite dangerous as the room seems to flood when having a shower and also there's a hair dryer in wet room which seemed a little dangerous. It is quite loud at night if you're trying to sleep (we were on the ground floor) as there's a bar next door and you can constantly hear people, music and people walking up and down the stairs to the entrance of the hotel. Breakfast was pretty poor with a choice of one type of cereal, bread rolls, cheese and 3 different types of meat and hard boiled eggs. There's a hot drinks machine also. The staff seemed okay although we didn't really interact with them much as we didn't really need to.

These are not of the Armada \"hotel!!\" When we first arrived we were given a room on the fourth floor. We had booked and paid for a twin room and were given a tiny double. We complained at reception and were told that there were no other rooms available that night and would have to wait until the next day. The next day, we took our luggage down to reception and were told to leave it in the corner and it would be put in to our new room once it had been cleaned. We were out all day and when we arrived back at 11pm our luggage was in exactly the same place. This room was the reception, the dining area and an area to sit so we are really quite lucky that our cases were still there!!!! Our new twin room was even worse than the first. It was just as small and there was no way of sepearating the beds. It had mould on the ceiling, stains on the walls, holes in the towels and sheets, and was also right above the front door. As a result all you could hear was the music and noise from the pub next door (which has a large outside area where about 40 people a night gather until about midnight). When we tried complaining, the man on reception told us that our new room was a twin and that was the best we could expect. I tried arguing and said it was not worth the money and he actually agreed with me. It is never a good thing when the staff recognise how rubbish the hotel is!! As for breakfast.......... We had breakfast once and i would not recommend it. Disgusting. And it is taken away at 10am sharp so if you start making a cup of tea just before then, then do not expect to be able to have milk with it!!! I would not call this building a hotel. It is a hostel!!! And not a good hostel!! It is dirty and stuck in the 80s and is also a death trap. I think the idea is that the bathroom is a wet room but when the water from the shower covers the entire floor and the stream covers every inch of the wall (including the hair dryer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) then you are taking a risk in this hotel. I wish i had read more reviews before i stayed in this hovel because then i would not out of pocket of 700 euro for 4 night!!

We were told the rate for the remaining two nights verbally, but \"it's impossible\" to be printed on the final bill. They could only print the rate for the 1st night and then a total figure. BTW, we could never add up to the total figure with the rates they told us verbally!

We slept on top of the covedrs every night except for one. - The window is permanently opened, (at least while we were there) and the guests have no control over it.

The window was 2 meters away from a bar entrance, so it was like chaos and noises until 2am in the night. We then asked for another room, and we got a bigger one at the last floor.

If it was not kept pushed, the elvator would just stop. Also, it was extremely slow (a few seconds were necessary to get to the next floor, no matter the direction) - the wi-fi was not present at all on our floor, so no internet connection for our mobiles; - the shower could not stay attached to the wall, therefore we had to find a way to wash ourselves somehow (what about shampoo?); also, there was no protection to prevent the water get out on the floor, therefore you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d better expect kind of a flood in the bathroom every time you have a shower; - the lights near the bed pillows were not working; I reported this to the guy at the reception and\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 he wanted to give me a new light bulb to change it myself! If you consider that it was like I had to undo half of the room to change them, that was not a possible answer at all (and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m quite a handy one). - There was just one small wardrobe, and the room was for two.

There were some good aspects. However, there were many things I was displeased about. To start with the good - the hotel is situated in a relatively quiet part of the town, somewhat central between sites like the Anne Frank House, Heineken Brewery, King's Square, and Damrak and Dam Square and the Red Light District. There are several eating places relatively closeby, within 10-13 minutes walk, so transport is not much of an issue. The hotel breakfast, while very basic, was edible and given the hotel rating, quite good in my opinion. On the negative side - the rooms did not have any heating or cooling, so temperature was controlled via opening and closing windows. The rooms were not very impressive, but such can be expected in a budget hotel. My room was on the 4th floor, and overlooking the back of the building, which looked somewhat like a ghetto. The bathroom had no shower curtain, so water would spray all over the ground when showering. The rooms were relatively clean, though it could have been a bit better. People complain about the steps being too steep, and no lift, but that will be an issue in any budget hotel in Amsterdam, so I will not say any more on that. Overall, the hotel served it's purpose for me, which was somewhere to sleep and shower. However, if returning to Amsterdam, I think there might be a few options a bit more comfortable around the same price range, and I would probably look for something a bit closer to Dam Square.", "Date": "September 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "ND", "Title": "\u201cNo Way\u201d", "Author": "Roaringdog", "ReviewID": "UR8839311", "Content": "The hotel is really in quite terrible condition.

Upon our arrival we were also told that some builders were working in the hotel, but that we should not be disturbed, we were a bit confused that we were not told so earlier and became very angry when we were awoken one morning at 10 by very loud hammer and drilling sounds. Two other weird and unpleasant things occured, the cleaner lady actually put stuff belonging to my friend, deep in his bag, consequently going through his stuff, another time we were awakened by some member of staff opening the door of our room (with his card) and quickly shutting it again.

It was more reminiscent of a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac35/night hostel than of a hotel (I think 1-Star is more appropriate).
