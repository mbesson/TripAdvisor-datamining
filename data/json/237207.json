I went to Europe for two months with other high school students. It was awesome. I stayed at this hotel. All our meals were at this hotel. It was very economical probably under ten dollars a day. I remember the meals being included a huge plate of pasta and a meat dish and wine!! I had beer or wine with every meal. Me and my friends hit on the girls who worked here serving meals,etc until we realized that they were nuns in training. What a waste. The hotel was very close to the Vatican which was just down the hill. There really was a lot to do and we walked everywhere. Nice to know it still exists. I would love to make my way up the hill soon.

This is a very clean, friendly and family type hotel ( probably also run by a family!!!! ) with wonderful, calm and almost spiritual atmosphere. The rooms are very nicely laid out and staff members are super helpful. Its a short walk to the vatican city although the walk back is a bit strenuous due to the somewhat steep climb.

Great location and price. Clean and functional. Safe neighborhood. A hidden jem. Walking distance to St. Peter's Cathedral.

The bathrooms are good, and the showers have great water pressure. It's nice having a bar on hand, and the hill is not that steep, easily manageable unless you're elderly, ill or have mobility problems. The chapels and meeting rooms are nice. Now the downside: The promised air conditioning was not working when we were there, and no one seemed too concerned about it, though it was pretty hot out. Leaving the windows open at night left us prey to mosquitos, and there were no fans available. There are no phones in the rooms, just internal phones for wake-up calls, though there are phones in the public rooms. The drinks machine was also broken the whole time we were there. The food was institutional -- cheap, but in one of the great food capitals of the world, it seems a shame to dine on the equivalent of hospital cafeteria food. And the service ranged from indifferent to hostile. You can save a lot of money staying at this hotel. But if you need to save money that badly, consider staying home. Or going to Rome for a couple days, and then moving on to some of the other, less costly but heartbreakingly beautiful places Italy has to offer. You can get by at Casa Tra Noi, and if you're one of those people who don't much care where you sleep, go for it.

This is a religious house with the best of all worlds. It's close to St. Peter's, but at the top of a hill where it is quiet. You won't be awaken by motor scooters in the middle of the night. Don't expect quiet in the dinning room or lounge areas. While we were there a German church group was staying. No problem for us. We just joined in the laughter. Take advantage of the half board option. The meals are served family style and it's not chi-chi gourmet, but it's good, and satisfying. A great deal for the price. Wine and beer are available in the dinning room, but the best deal is the vending machine with small bottles of wine for 1 Euro. A small bar area serves drinks and espresso. There is a public bus that comes 3/4 up the hill. We didn't ride it up much, but many buses stop at the base of the hill and the San Pietro train station is at the base of the hill. There is a small grocery store with good food just a couple of blocks down from the hotel. If you want to make a picnic lunch this is a good place to go.

The walk to Vatican is 10 minutes. The walk back is longer because the guest house is located on a hill and the climb up the street is an effort....but well worth the quality of the property.
