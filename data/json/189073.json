The hotel is a bit shabby but everything is clean and the staff are so friendly, it's a nice place to stay. For one person, the room was very comfortable in size, although the shower is quite small. Breakfast was included in my rate and the selection of cereals, fruit, cheese/ham/tomato and toast/delicious croissants was nice and a great way to fill up before a day of sightseeing.

As we were working and not tourists, it was not the ideal place to stay. The time we spent there that week, the hotel seemed to be occupied by noisy Italian and American backpackers; which would not have been too much of a problem if the walls were not paper thin. Having to get up at 5am every morning for work was difficult after only 2 hours sleep. The rooms were very basic, but clean. We only had a wash basin in the room. (not all rooms are en suite) and the communal bathroom was not particularly attractive. My colleague's room door did not open fully due to the bed being in the way and in my other colleague's room, none of 3 of the electrical sockets were working. One evening the lights did not work in our rooms, but then came back on at approximately 1am. To which there was no explaination. The windows in the room were single glazed-which is not ideal for busy central London which creates a lot of noise- mostly from low flying planes into Heathrow (every 20 seconds), as well as the usual traffic and Tube noises. Our company paid for bed and breakfast, however, breakfast was not served until 7.30am which we found to be too late for our needs. And the one day I took breakfast there, I found it to be simple and a bit strange. It was the first time I had ever seen sliced tomatoes as a breakfast dish. The staff were helpful and polite although resturaunt staff do not always speak english. One of the reception staff was especially helpful and had a good sense of humour referring to our rooms as the \"prison cell\" and \"honeymoon suites\" respectively. He was not joking in the scheme of things. We were there on a business trip which was not being paid for by ourselves, so I am not sure if he would have used this same humour on actual tourists. It was very well located close to the tube station and lots of food outlets. It was good it was paid for by my company, because I would have been very dissapointed if I had been a tourist and paid \u00c2\u00a350 per night for it myself.", "Date": "June 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "France", "Title": "\u201cMusty, Fusty And Dusty - Don't Bother !\u201d", "Author": "SallyFrance", "ReviewID": "UR7225506", "Content": "wE STAYED in March - and certainly could have done better.
