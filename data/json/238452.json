{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great place, great location Stayed at the Pensione for two nights in October. Booked the room with its own bathroom which we were warned was tiny, which it was, but it served its purpose. You have to phone the Pensione directly and book, as she doesn't have email.Our room was absolutely huge, with a lounge and breakfast table and a lot of antique furniture which was cool, and we had a very nice stay.The place has a lot of artwork and statues throughout and because of this, security is very tight but easy to abide by. There was some noise from the street throughout most of the night but we soon learnt this was standard everywhere in Italian cities if you stay in the centre. My husband used ear plugs one night. Because of the location, you are a bit of a walk away from the train station and Florence is extremely easy to get lost in as the streets are all over the place and connect at weird angles, but with a good map you should be right. We walked with our suitcases, but if you can afford it, it may be easier to get a taxi for at least the way there so you aren't dragging them on the tiny footpaths and cobblestone roads while trying to read a map and getting hopelessly lost! We were fine on the return trip to the station as we knew where we were. From the Pensione, you are very close to the Duomo and markets, as well as the Museum (statue of David) and lots of places to eat. We recommend Restorante Cellini - fantastic! It's somewhere near the end of one of the streets near the markets (if that helps!).We had a good breakfast and you choose what you would like from the options and she delivers it to your room at the time you specify. Overall a great place for a great price and would definitely return here.", "Date": "Nov 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR203197125", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "aussieboy7"}, {"Content": "Great room with FREE entertainment This was our first stop of 3 days, during the two-week trip my wife and I took, through Italy. Finding the Penzione was difficult even though we had a pretty good paper map and a GPS. You see, in Florence, streets start and end all of a sudden. The Penzione's address is #1 Via del Corso, which is in the mid-section of a muuuuch longer street. The name of the Pension was hard to find in itself since the business name is not well signed, and it's only on the list on the door ringer. The Pension itself is located in a apartment on the 3rd floor of a Renaissance Era building. A note here folks: travel lightly, as you have to carry your luggage 3 floors upwards without an elevator. Evelyn, who runs the pension was very friendly and greeted us at the door, excited that we had finally arrived, and showed us to our room, #5, which is one of nine rooms in total, which faced the street below. We were fortunate to have a larger suite that contained a doubled bed, a couch with a coffee table, two single beds, and our own ensuite shower, one of only two. The other 7 suites share a bathroom in the hallway. At the time of booking this was the only room left and Evelyn was vaery nice to allow us to rent it at the same rate as a regular room, even though it was just the two of us, probably because it was shoulder season. This room would be perfect for a family of 4 or 2 couples or 4 friends.Evelyn has a great sense of humour and her breakfast room service is perfectly on the time of your choice. She truly acts as a Mom and makes sure you eat your breakfast right-away so it doesn't get cold. Our breakfast consisted of a hard-boiled warm egg, cheese with toast, tea or coffee and a sweet bun pastry.Here is the thing about staying the centre of Florence. The location is very convenience, right around the corner from the Duomo, close to all attractions, and for you Ladies, great shopping. However, being in proximity of the Duomo, you pay a price. If you are a light sleeper, the chimes of the tower clock may keep you up at night as the go off on the hour, every hour. In addition, the noise from the street below carries upwards and through the walls. You can hear all the people walking on the cobblestone as well as the evening/late night revelers. Overall, this is a wonderful place to stay that offers comfortable beds, eclectic decor, and Evelyn, who loves what she does, and is a great host and guide. A good value for being in the centre of Florence.", "Date": "Oct 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR401916791", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "fstrdr"}, {"Content": "great find My wife and I stayed at this pensione (small, informal hotel) for two nights in May of 2006. The location, the price, and the proprietress make for a great experience. This pensione is an idiosyncratic place, and reflects the personality of the lady who runs it. She is a very interesting and lovely lady from the Netherlands, who has lived in Florence since the 1970's. Unless you insist on deluxe accomodations, you likely will enjoy this place. You certainly will know that you are in Florence, and couldn't possibly be anywhere else. We had a little trouble finding the place at first, despite the central location, so ask for directions. As I recall, the pensione is on the third floor of an old building, and you need to climb stairs in order to reach it.

My husband and I spent almost a week at this perfect little pensione, located a block away from the Duomo. Evelyn, the proprietress, was wonderful to us - personable, charming, and ready every morning with cheesy toast and hot chocolate. The price was unbeatable for the location, the rooms were clean and comfortable, and, after exhausting but exhilarating days of sight-seeing, we would come back and look out over the rooftop of Dante's chapel through our huge windows and just be thrilled. Caution: Our rooms had shared bathrooms, which we did not find to be an issue at all, but may be for some travelers. Also, Evelyn had an 11pm curfew - also not an issue for us, but may be a concern for some. And finally, the pensione is on the top floor of a three-story building with no elevator - if travelers have issues walking or carrying luggage up three long flights of stairs, this is not the place for you.

This was our first time staying at a Pensione/Bed and Breakfast, so we were not quite sure what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised by the wonderful decor, the absolutely perfect location in the heart of the city, the cleanliness of every room, and the hospitality of Evelyn, the owner. She was always there for us to answer our questions and, more than that, became a great friend in the short time that we knew her. She spoke English, Spanish, and Italian very well and had great insights into the goings-on in the city and what to see and how to go about doing so. The Pensione is literally a few blocks from all of the major sights, including the Ponte Vecchio, the Duomo, and the Uffizi and other major museums. We were able to easily visit much of the city on our first day in the city, partially thanks to the location of the Pensione. Our room was very spacious and we had a lovely, large window overlooking the street below. Very scenic and comfortable, and the hallways and rooms include fantastic pieces of artwork and sculptures - the Pensione is like a museum itself!We can't speak highly enough about the Pensione, and for travelers on a budget (or just looking for wonderful Italian hospitality) it is truly a significant find.

What an amazing stay! We decided to take a gamble and go with something a little more authentic for our stay in Florence. After 4 stars (supposedly) in Paris, Nice, and Rome we wanted to try something a little different. In the end the Pensione Maria Luisa de' Medici was the finest stay we had. The inkeeper Evelyn is just wonderful and an excellent guide for any visitor. She speaks English, Welsh, and Italian (and I believe French).Essentially you are staying in the third floor of a large classic building in the heart of Florence's (Firenze) most beutiful and accessable areas. It is about two blocks from everywhere you'd want to go and is readiably accessable by taxi. Parking is limited in this area so driving may be a bit of a problem. The walk to the primary train station is about 15 minutes.The Pensione is filled with art from the 1400's. And when I say filled were talking art gallery here. Some rooms have bathrooms and others do not. But there is more public bathrooms then there are rooms so chances are you'll never be waiting. From our confortable king size bed we looked into the skyline with steeples. Just amazing. The food, the music, the art. It was all within minutes. We would live in the room we had if we could!There were a couple of limitations you need to be aware of. There is a 11pm curfew so if you are a night club person you'll want to stay somewhere else. It is up 3 flights of stares so if your not enabled you will want to stay away.
