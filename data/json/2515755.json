So, I decided to stay at MVR in San Diego due to the great location and great price. I stayed at the property two different times in early 2012. Here is my view: -this property IS NOT A RESORT. it is a motel. -the property is old and dated, but it is CLEAN. -you can pull your car right up to many of the motel rooms -the property is convenient to the freeways that take you EVERYWHERE in San Diego -the front desk staff treats you like criminals in check in....counseling you on parties, etc -the front desk staff is not hospitable, and even had a few experiences that were down right rude -the room keys often loose their ability to work, so you have to go to the desk in the middle of the night to get key reprogrammed. -the manager has not returned my call from early March when I called to express my frustration over a VERY RUDE GUEST AGENT.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201ca huge dump....stay away\u201d", "Author": "Joe L", "ReviewID": "UR128000620", "Content": "my first impression was walking in the lobby and the girl behind the desk arguing with a customer about room service.....then I requested a smoking room and she put me in a non-smoking room.....room was adequate, but old and grimy.....and guess what? the keys sometimes worked and sometimes not...order room service? not for 15.00 for a cheesburger...good god...whole place seemed cheap and unfriendly.....proceed at your own risk", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cbad experience and not a \"resort\"\u201d", "Author": "IMDOCNC", "ReviewID": "UR127165475", "Content": "I checked into the hotel with the intention of renting 2 superior doubles for 3 nights each. I was given the rooms for 1 night and told that I can renew the rooms the next morning as there was some sort of \"block\" that could not be explained. The next morning i went to the office and was told by another desk clerk that I had to check out because my room is already rented for that day. It seems that the check in attendant was clueless. The morning desk attendant was not compelled to be very helpful in situating me, my 4yo, and mother in law in two other rooms anywhere. She was too apathetic. Overall the front desk service has a lot to be desired. In addition, the check in clerk was not giving me the rate that is actually advertised on their own website. The service is just terrible. As for the hotel, I was fine with the exterior appearance of the grounds and pool. The room was only OK but it was worn down feeling with some need of repairs. The mattress had to be replaced probably 5 years ago. The non-smoking room actually smelled of smoke to the point I had a headache in the morning. I think it was from the carpet or the bedding. Overall, even with the low rate of 70 dollars for each of the 2 rooms-- I feel like I did not get any value because of the poor state of the room and service. I was fortunate, that I found 2 rooms at the Vagabond Inn next door which has been much nicer and a much more personable front desk service.

They must be doing something right. Though the facilities may be old, they've maintained it very well. The rooms I have stayed in varied in size and comfort with how much I've been willing to pay. The onsite gym closed but they gave me coupons to a local gym and looks as if they are opening a smaller one. The pool and hot tub is heated and maintained daily (I see it every morning as I have a great view from my room. The food and service at the onsite Valley Kitchen is both fresh and tasty with down to earth and friendly service. Another nice feature onsite is the little liquor store, though they don't stay up late (which is nice) they are open late enough during the week and later on the weekend. Though you can buy stuff \"cheaper\" at Sam's or Costco, all of this is on site and very convenient. Also, the location is FANTASTIC... smack in the middle of all the freeways going North and South and the main Interstate 8 going East and West. The exit East Bound for Hotel Circle South is in fact right at this place. More important I'd like to state that the people who work here make the difference. They have bent over backwards to be ever so accommodating to me and my friends. From the front desk, to the folks at the Valley Kitchen, the liquor store and housekeeping... they all seem happy to be of service. As a Marriott Rewards and Hilton HHonors member since 1980... I can't say I've experienced such genuine kindness on a daily basis anywhere else I've stayed... at the Marriott, Hilton or Sheraton. in the USA. All my friends that have stayed here couldn't believe the value and fortunately the weather was \"like summer\". There was plenty of parking and it's big enough that my friends with kids had lots of space to run around safely without leaving the property.

I stayed with some friends back in 2007 and we had a great experience. Unfortunately this time wasn't as great. The location is pretty good, a 5 min drive to Old Town, about 10 min to the Gaslamp District, and about a 15 min walk to the closest trolley station (Fashion Valley Mall). I called the Friday before we were to check in to verify our reservation. The person I spoke with spent 10 min trying to locate my reservation, and then informed me that they were fully booked and there would be no early check-in available. When we got there on Saturday there was only 1 person working the front desk and 3 parties in front of us waiting to be helped. When we finally got checked in, our room keys didn't work. We went back to the front desk, waited in line again, and were told by there women there that we should be more careful and not put the room keys near our credit cards or cell phones because it will cause the keys not to work. The keys had been in my hand the whole time. The room was pretty run down. There were tears in the sheets, the carpet was frayed, the bathroom had some black stains (smoke or mold- I'm not sure) on the wall, and the shower head barely spit out enough water to wash shampoo out of my hair. Bottom line- its a pretty basic hotel, and if your expectations are low you'll be fine.

I'm happy to get by for less money, and never suspected that it would be on the wedding party's list unless they knew it was decent. Where do I start? Filthy and disgusting room. Carpet so dirty my sox were black. We upgraded from a dingy small room to a balcony room, shown in one of the photos here. So we had enough space because it was larger, and could open the door for fresh air. But the wallpaper was peeling off the walls in many places, the light bar in the bathroom was completely corroded, shower curtain bar corroded, mold around the tub, cracked floor tiles, cracked shower tiles, sink cabinet so gross I wouldn't put anything there. So we wanted to put clothes on the closet shelf, and my wife gave me a wet washcloth to dust it off. The cloth came up completely BLACK. Second wiping with other side of the cloth, BLACK. (not just dusty, but sticky caked-on black filth!) Hadn't been wiped in years. We took the black washcloth to the front desk and showed the guy - he shrugged, says they rely on housekeeping to clean the rooms, he'll talk to housekeeping about it. The exterior of the buildings is just as bad. Everything is coming apart, they must be just milking this place before they demolish it. They could never renovate this place, it would have to be demolished. My cousins came, and were so grossed out by the room they left, and for just a few dollars more, got a nice room at the Days Motel a couple of doors down. The front desk people are cocky, crummy attitude. BUT - the restaurant in front of the motel, (Country Kitchen or something like that) is wonderful. And it's operated by the hotel. What a contrast. It was clean and cheerful, the food was very good, the service was excellent, the people cheerful and gracious. We ate there a lot, and enjoyed going there. Go figure that out!

He said he didn\u2019t care, and I couldn\u2019t check in with that ID. I started to get mad and told him to call his boss \u2013 he backed off, told me to calm down (!) and accepted it as ID. Interesting that a BANK accepted the license as ID with no questions a couple of days later. --Got to my assigned room, which had a giant refrigerator truck noisily idling right outside the room -- I guess the driver had to keep it running all night so the food wouldn\u2019t spoil. So I went back to the front desk, and told the clerk I needed a different, quieter room. He told me there were only two available. Clearly a lie, since judging from the parking lot the place was obviously only about 10% full. Anyway, one of the rooms he offered was in back and quieter, so I took it. --On to the room: Moldy, marginally clean bathroom with peeling wallpaper and low-pressure shower; aging filthy carpet, sagging mattress, spiderwebs in the ceiling corners, missing TV remote \u2013 a generally nasty room. In all fairness, the grounds were nicely landscaped and there didn\u2019t seem to be any bedbugs in the room. --Found myself locked out of the room phone, even though I had used a credit card for incidentals when checking in. Had to call front desk to fix. --Was greeted by a sign in the bathroom that said, in so many words, If you steal our towels, we'll be glad to bill you for them. The \"towels\" were thin, small, and scratchy. --Second day there, while on my way to my room, a prostitute popped out of a nearby room and solicited me. Very classy. The \u201cresort\u201d was pretty noisy, with lots of coming and going at all hours. Gee, I wonder what would account for that? When I checked in I had to initial a line on the check-in sheet that said something about zero tolerance for parties, you will be required to leave, etc. I guess prostitution is a different kind of party. This room was pretty cheap -- $60 per night, but I\u2019ve stayed in much nicer rooms in San Diego through an online booking service for $40 or less per night.

Third-party prices fill rooms, and provide the business with opportunities to sell services and win future customers. My advice to Priceline customers: pay attention to reviews, articulate your needs clearly (both in advance and on arrival) and speak directly and immediately to management if your expectations are not met. If basic room needs are unmet and you bought from Priceline, tell Priceline in writing; use snail mail to the company\u2019s street address and direct to Customer Service VP. I\u2019ve found them responsive. Talk to local management directly and pleasantly: they value meaningful guest feedback and often can use information you provide to correct persistent problems. Be courteous and civil to a fault: it never helps to be confrontational.] Very economical for me for one week on Priceline, this hotel is on an exceptionally beautiful large footprint in Mission Valley, located on the service road just S of the I-8, improbably named \u201cHotel Circle North.\u201d Rooms are basic and dark, my room much too small for the enormous heavy furniture that populated it. My \u201cking\u201d room barely contained a king bed, a huge TV cabinet-dresser-closet, a huge easy chair, crumbling plaster around the old temperature control unit, and a spare desk/chair. Movement from one part of the room to another required moving furniture. Email asking for a refrigerator at check in was answered by telling me I should not have booked thru Priceline, and my request was forwarded to a front-desk supervisor who never answered it. (I gave u email and just asked for the refrig at check in.) There was no TV remote; it was later replaced. The ancient heating-cooling system didn\u2019t respond, and was eventually replaced with a new one. The personnel involved with me were terrific, of particular note the housekeeper (who I tipped generously, twice) and a night maintenance person who cheerfully replaced the AC unit. BIG PLUSSES: Ample free parking, flawless WI-FI, a beautifully-landscaped premises and pools, a self-service laundry on the property, free local and 800-calls, computer with printer near front desk. NEED HELP: outdated decor, bedding just OK, space much too small for oversized furniture, very thin walls and night noise from other guests, and severe attitude from a front-desk person who declined (in a pretty absolute manner) to find me another room (hotel was overbooked) when the AC system started heating the room at 11 PM one night. (The hotel does, however, have cooperative relationships with other area properties to care for guests who find themselves bumped or in awkward situations, when an environmental problem (like a non-working AC) means a guest need can\u2019t be properly met.) A local pizza company stuffs fliers noisily into the room each afternoon, in violation of hotel policy; and apparently calls to it from hotel rooms are blocked!) The on-premise restaurant serves basic but fresh American food staples, generously portioned, lots of specials, pleasant servers. Hotels in this area are close to everything, downtown/Balboa Park/Hillcrest is 3 miles. Local drivers, who will cross three freeway lanes at 60 mph to an exit ramp, are frightening.

I knew it wasn't going to be the Ritz with the price I paid, but next time, I'm staying at the Marriott Courtyard next door. Here's why: The Good: The little diner/restaurant was very good, the wait staff pleasant and the prices reasonable. The gym next door is huge and well-equipped. The landscaping around the pool is nice. The rooms, although outdated and worn (they may want to replace those blankets with cigarette holes, though), were reasonably clean. It was nice to have a laundry room (although no soap). The liquor store/convenience store was nice to have for snacks, drinks, etc. The Bad: Noise: During my stay there were several obnoxiously loud dance parties/weddings that literally vibrated my windows. People screaming, carrying on till the wee hours, no staff control, despite frequent phone calls to complain. Earplugs did not work. Hookers: Hookers, hookers, everywhere -- in the front parking lot, in the back parking lot and in the lobby, trying to reserve rooms. This is what happens when you combine a liquor store, easy highway access and dirt cheap hotel rooms. Even an exciting police bust during my first night at 1 am did not deter them. Seedy, Unsafe Feeling: The hookers' clients spent their evenings cruising the parking lot, sitting in their dark windowed SUVs, waiting for sex. Unfortunately, I had to walk by them (one even propositioned me) every night to get to my room. The exterior lighting was dim and I felt very uncomfortable. And I am not a person who is spooked easily. The hotel has a security guard, but in 9 days I never saw him on the grounds, only playing solitaire on the lobby's computer.

We were in San Diego on business, and from the pictures and everything that was advertised as included with the room, expected to have a normal, enjoyable, and successful stay in San Diego, as we should expect at Mission Valley Resort. A few observations to report: 1) The room was messy when we first entered, and had more than a few solicitor's flyers inside on the floor. 2) The smoke detector was inoperable when we entered the room, due to a bad battery, and we listened to it beep. This was fixed the next day but we had to deal with it ourselves the first night. 3) Being on business, we expected to be able to use the free wifi service and connect to the internet during our stay. I was not successful in connecting to the service because I could find no wifi point that was being broadcast by Mission Valley Resort. I called to the desk for assistance, and got the impression the person at the desk neither knew what I needed nor cared to be of much help.

In looking back, I would say that this is more on an low budget extended stay hotel rather than a resort. The other reviews are right it isn't the Omni but neither is it quite a Hotel 6. Hotel tax is 12.5%. But 1.5% is for their marketing. Nice that you get to pay for thier lie. We booked our room on the web site as a pre-paid 14 day advance purchase . We booked the SUPIERIER double bed, at 56.00 per night. We stayed in room 251. When we arrived - very tired from our drive - I was told that \"somehow they had forgotten to charge my room to my credit card, but \"don't worry ,I would pay the price I had been given\" They were correct, I was - plus 3 charges at .50 ea for local phone to order take out. In this day and age, who practices this? (Especially if you are calling yourself a resort) The hotel offers FREE internet yet they charge for a local phone call? The front desk staff was nice but not overly so. ( too busy talking to whomever was behind the wall) At least they were engaged n the conversation and did a good job telling us about the bus and the internet in the lobby. (you get 15 min.) This must be thier \"Business Center\" I wouldn't do any of my business 2 steps away from the check-in desk. The maid came knocking on our door at 9 am and then she just let herself in when I didn\u2019t immediately answer. Check out is not at 9. Unless a room has been checked out of there is no reason for maid service to just open my door. It would have been nice if the front desk staff would have said something or that there was some kind of notification in the room that a maid would be by that early. I exchanged our towels and asked for more coffee for the next day \u2013 she happily took care of my needs. But she did want to come in to clean \u2013 We were a 3 day stay, I don\u2019t like people in my room while my things are there. The room is fairly large, nicely appointed. The coffee pot is an actual pot with ceramic mugs not paper cups. That was nice. It made 4 cups. The hairdryer actually worked. They do have a safe and a nice size closet. However, that's about it. The room shown on their webpage was not the room we were given, an unnecessary bait-and-switch. Attempts had been made to upgrade the room. Granite tops for the nightstand, desk and coffee area. Newly upholstered and appointed bed, beds were far from large. A full size is not large. The TV remote worked about half the time. Private balcony overlooking the 1940-1950\u2019s style courtyard was nice, table and chairs were plastic with cigarette burn holes and definite rot on the boards \u2013 although they did try to paint over it. We had a spider crawl across us the first night in our bed. Lovely. As to cleanliness: The items that touch a person\u2019s skin were clean. However, the carpet edges had never seen a crevice tool, the edges in the bathroom the same. The walls in the bathroom had several hand prints and foot prints on the wall paper and the door trim was grimy. I am a previous rental unit manger so I wet down a washcloth just to see how easily it came off. Plain water did the trick so I attribute the issue to poor management of the cleaning staff. Obviously the rooms are not inspected after they are \u201ccleaned\u201d The upkeep of the entire hotel inside and out shows decay and rot. The wallpaper has been patched instead of replaced, the vaulted ceiling has been painted white over dark wood, and is now cracked and coming off in large pieces. At night you can see where all the other patchwork has taken place. They have a laundry, but the area is foul, both in upkeep and atmosphere. I didn\u2019t feel safe down there. 3 washers and 3 dryers \u2013 cost is 2.00 per load there is not a bill changer so make sure you have quarters!! You will need to go to the convenience store/booze store (with that type of crowd) onsite and deal with their rudeness to purchase laundry soap. The bathroom is dismally small and in bad repair. It is all inclusive. The sink is in with the tub and toilet, very little counter space. The sink cabinet is melamine and is peeling. They do have Sauve shampoo and conditioner for your use. The tub does not hold water, the massaging shower head had one setting (if you tried to change it fell apart in your hand) , the coupling to attach the shower to the wall is coming off. But the pressure and temp were good. There is a sweet tattered note taped to the wall that states that if you should wish to take their thread bare scratchy towels they will happily charge you ( on that note, there is a LARGE sign at check-in that states that they will hold funds on your card for up to 72 days, so beware) This hotel is on Hotel Circle. There are SEVERAL other places to stay. I would recommend that you do. But as stated, make sure that you have a car. It's a pain. The one saving grace to the \u201cresort\u201d is the on-site restaurant. (the other plus would have been the gas station, but it is closed \u2013 you will have to go up I-8 to find one close) Very Friendly staff in the restaurant, attentive servers. They have a great Breakfast special at 6.99 with several choices and the Blue Plate Special at 7.99 that starts at 11 am and goes until they close \u2013 there are other restaurants in the same area, all are in the other hotels. I can\u2019t rate the Bar or the Gym. We went to neither. But the Gym is up the hill and behind the hotel. It looks nice from below. They do have vending and Ice Machines. The pool is okay but much smaller than the one shown in the picture from the web. They do have a hot tub, my family told me that it was nice and warm, but after looking at the mediocre attempt at cleanliness in the room I opted out of the hot tub experience. Oh yes, the noice level. From everywhere but our next door neighbors who kept slamming the balcony door - very quiet.

You can get the bus to the tram station, and the trams are great. They run regularly (every 10-15 minutes depending on the line). You can use them to get to most of the areas you are likely to want to visit in San Diego. It cost $5 for a 1 day pass which you can use on both the trams and buses - a really good way to get around.

From the moment of my arrival on a business trip to San Diego, the warm and friendly welcome from Curtis and Ileana were very much appreciated. My room was ready, well maintained, and especially important -- quiet! It is a very peaceful and quiet place. The grounds are well maintained by these golf cart crews that quietly go about their buisness, with particular detail to keeping the grounds in immaculate condition. The pool was warm and perfect at the end of the day. I only ate at the restaurant once, but it is a great diner type restaurant where the staff too were very friendly, and a plus on the restaurant is that it is open 24 hours. Also, the women greeters at the restaurant were especially friendly and welcoming. Another plus was being able to work-out at the Frog's gym literally right up the hill from the hotel -- no need to drive, it was almost like walking out of your room and in 30 seconds you were at the gym, which too was well maintained and immaculate. The gym is a full-size gym, with tennis courts and a pool of its own as well! Mission Valley Resort is a great place to stay. As a result of this stay, I've reserved the rest of my summer's business trips here. The people working at the hotel, the grounds, the cleanliness, and the total experience was great. My stay was better than expected, and the value is great -- especially in San Diego.

In April, I was at a conference in San Diego, the weather was beautiful and I had time to visit with family. Knowing it had a pool and a resort feeling, and I had also, stayed at another property owned by the same company (I am very happy with the quality of that hotel). I went on line and got (what I thought at the time, was a good deal), the weekend rate of $105 per night for a double room. Your first sign should be the lobby and its tired decor. Although the staff was helpful and did try to accommodate my comfort. The old Hollywood feel of this \"resort,\" is deceiving. I had requested a double room, quiet on the top floor. I was given a double room, below a two level freestanding building, with a bank of rooms on two levels. No elevators in this facility. As I drove up to the door (parking is outside your entry door) a young man, directly on the floor above, was sitting outside his room on the balcony walkway, drinking a can of beer. Not an encouraging sign for a Grandmother, hoping to spend time entertaining her family. The room was marginal at best, dinghy and dirty, the window was right next to the bed and the bathrooms were small and not very up to date. The 805 freeway borders this property, as convenient as that makes it for access, there is no escaping the noise, and there is freeway noise, but it was the idea of the young man upstairs with the beer, who encouraged me to ask for another room. I went back to the desk and was given (without question) another option, a handicap room with one bed, also facing the freeway on the first floor. This room was a single handicap, with a walk-in shower; it was not any cleaner and still very noisy, again with parking outside the door. Back to the lobby, for the third room. This room was a little away from the freeway and closer to the pool, a little larger, but the beds were still right next to the window, no parking in front, so that helped, but the noise was very apparent. At this point, I should have cut bait and run, but I was tired and with my Grandson, who wanted to swim, so we decided to try for at least one night. This room had a toilet that ran all night, and was necessary to jiggle the handle several times to stop it. The TV reception was fuzzy and not all the stations worked. Noise from the freeway went on all night, so I slept with earplugs. The pool was very nice, but the other clientele was young college students, who were smoking and drinking (I admit it was evening, before 10pm) and we did not stay to see if it was more family oriented the next day. They gave me no grief for early checkout and I then went to my local Marriott, which was a relief after my night in this \"resort.\" I suggest you look for a better deal; this resort will not be your best bet.", "Date": "May 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kaiserslautern, Germany", "Title": "\u201cCall Motel 6 Instead\u201d", "Author": "superjules", "ReviewID": "UR15555289", "Content": "My husband and I had to stay here for a business trip.

It was roomier, brighter, warmer and surprisingly quiet considering the pool (clean, warm and full of fresh towels) was directly outside our door. Nevertheless, it had a small bathroom. To put it plainly, expect to have bruised knees if the door opens while you're sitting on the toilet. Also, the only towel rod for a room which sleeps 4 was broken so that the towels were sliding off one end. What turned my opinion around in the end was Lorraine's (staff member) willingness to go the extra mile for us. When we checked out, my 6 year old forgot his stuffy in the room.

This room had 2 queen beds, nightstand between them, an armchair and ottoman, a combination entertainment center and dresser, and a work desk with work chair. Nothing too fancy, but all seemed to be in decent shape and clean. Closet was roomy, with probably 8+ hangers to use. There was also a little safe on the closet floor. I saw two other rooms, Room 104 and Room 455, and they looked just about exactly the same, except Room 455 had a balcony since it was a 2nd floor room. Nice! The bathroom, even though it served its purpose for me and didn't cause any major problems, should be updated soon. Many signs of wear here. There is one semi-updated aspect, which is the curved shower rod, which improves my shower experience greatly as I absolutely HATE making contact with the shower curtain in a hotel room. All in all, a functional bathroom at best. The AC unit actually did a good job for an in-wall unit, allbeit a noisy one. The restaurant on site is 24-hour, and serves up decent food, especially the Mexican dishes. Prices are reasonable, with breakfast meals going for $6 - $12, lunch about the same, and dinner from $6 - $16. When the adjacent bar is in operation, alchoholic drinks are available with your meals. I was delighted to see that the bar had Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale on tap. Tasty! I didn't not use the pool and hot tub area, but it looked alright. It had a good ambiance about it, with greenery of different types and sizes around most of it. Way better than those pool areas surrounded by concrete. The gym located behind the resort seemed to do a brisk business. A coworker went almost each morning and said the place was quite busy. He also said it was equipped quite well. Overall the grounds were pretty well kept up, landscaping seemed current, only short-term instances of litter sitting around. For a resort that sits on a busy street, has a gas station adjacent, and operates a convenience/liquor store, the overall quality of the stay was good. The location is very convenient to many parts of San Diego. Located right off of East-West running Highway 8, it's a couple minutes drive to a good-sized shopping mall (Fashion Valley), around an average of 5 minutes to Old Town and Balboa Park, and only 10 or 15 minutes to downtown SD, Mission Beach, Pacific Beach, Sea World and La Jolla.

We returned to the hotel clerk and expressed that the room was unacceptable and how could they expect a family of 4 including a crib to stay in such cramped quarters. They advised that was the room which was booked and they had no record of a requested crib. (it was listed on the Hotel Voucher with Queen Beds)!

My daughter and I stayed, on vacation, for 3 nights. Where do I start? The carpet and bedding was damp when we walked in. Contributed it to the humidity, which I thought they would have done something, anything, to keep the rooms from feeling \"sticky\". The room itself is as pictured, however, is about half the size it appears to be. The remote to the tv didn't work, and when asked about it and told it would be changed, well, lets say we had to get up and down to change channels/volume the entire time. Maid service. Despite the \"Privacy Please\" sign, we were woken up at 7:30am by loud knocking from housekeeping. MAJOR no-no for me! The bathroom. When we arrived, there was hair in the sink, the lotion, shampoo and soap had all been USED and not replaced! GROSS GROSS GROSS. We ended up going to the store and buying our own. The major kicker - I paid for the room up front in cash, as well as a $150 security deposit, in cash. They turned around and charged my debit card the $150 deposit! When I realized I needed to get money from my ATM and discovered the \"missing money\", I asked the front desk if they charged my debit card. I got a very firm \"No, we did not because you gave us cash\". This was on Sunday. I couldn't call my bank until the next morning, which I did. Sure enough, they DID charge it AND take my cash. I had to fight with management in order to get them to release the hold at my bank so my daughter and I could return home! The staff - Most were very courteous, however, very lacking in their knowledge of giving correct directions or even knowing where the nearest Starbucks was (it's in Fashion Valley Mall, across the freeway!). When asking about transportation, they were a bit clueless to everything but the Old Town Trolley and making a call to a scuzzy cab company. The Restaurant and Liquor store - Saved the day! The store had soap, shampoo, every kind of first aid needed and tons of snacks. A bit pricey, but that's normal for a convenience store. The restaurant staff was wonderful, the food good but a little high priced for what you get. We found up the street a bit a place called Ricky's which we ate at the remainder of our time there. FABULOUS food, great service and prices you can't beat! Overall..........find a Motel 6! Much cheaper and the rooms are just as clean and accomodating, if not more, than Mission Valley Resort.

But this place...oh, where to begin. We booked the place despite some negative reviews on this site. Heck, there are negative reviews about our favourite hotel on this site, so we take it all with a shaker of salt. A mistake on my part. First of all, the positives. The family restaurant, though most portions of the food served was inviting Coronary Artery Disease (however I find this a US phenomenon not limited to this restaurant), was open late, had good service, and reasonably priced. The Liquor store next door was fabulous, perfect for late-night munchies and of course, the liquor, which we needed substantial amounts to get us through our reservation period at this hotel. The pool - nice, clean, beautiful surroundings with giant rose bushes and floral gardens. The fun stuff ends there folks. The room was dank, dark, the lights worked at varying intervals that could only be attributed to the lunar cycle, the carpet was dirty. It started out as an \"OK\" on the cleanliness factor, and deteriorated to \"Disgusting\" on the day we checked out. The bathtub did not drain - AT ALL. We left a comment about this on the \"housekeeping comment card\" which then proceeded to sit in the exact same table location we had left it on the first day. Of course, travelling with my mom and step-father - who is a hairy guy, if I may be so blunt - the tub and bathroom was filled with disgusting hair by the end of our trip. I hated taking a shower and didn't touch ANYTHING while I was in there. Oh yes, the supersonic toilet. I suppose this is a California water-saving thing, but the toilet had a button on top that you had to push to flush, and you had to pound on it to elicit any effect at all. When you pounded hard enough, the toilet flushed with such ferocity that I started hanging on to loose jewellry/hair/clothing lest I be sucked into the vortex never to be heard from again. Service was adequate, but I felt sorry for the folks who worked there - it has to be damaging to the self-esteem to be forced to wear a neon hawaiian shirt to work every single day. They also advertise the Trolley stops outside the front door. If the front door is Old Town State Park, which is a two mile drive away, they are correct. Trust me, I am not a whiner. I have stayed in some grotty hotels. This is the second grottiest. The only reason the other hotel in my grotty category wins first prize is that it had bullet holes in the door and no towels.

Upon my arrival, the staff was completely unhelpful and ignored me standing at the check-in counter while they talked to each other about the rugby team that was also staying in the hotel at the time. I finally got to my room, which was on the second floor. I had several bags, but no one offered to help me carry them up even though it was 11 pm and very dark. When I got to my room, the lights didn't work and I had to turn on the bathroom lights to even see. The room reeked of cigarette even though I had specifically requested nonsmoking, as I am allergic to cigarette smoke. I had also requested a room with two beds, as a friend was staying with me, and the room I got only had one kingsize bed. I had also requested a room with internet access and had been assured that each and every room had internet access. When I set up my laptop in the dark and reeking room, I noticed that I had a very weak wireless internet signal and could not access the internet at all. I called the lobby and asked if there was a internet plug, and the man at the desk replied no. He suggested that if I needed to use the internet, I could go and sit by the pool, where the signal was stronger. Mind you, this was 11 pm at night and I was by myself. I was appalled by this suggestion and demanded a room with a better internet signal, as I had business I had to finish while on this trip. I went to the lobby to get the keys to my new room and they were practically thrown at me by the concierge. I was told that the room I was being given was available for only one night even though I had booked my stay for two. I was moved to a room that was literally on the backside of the hotel overlooking a very unlit alley. I finally got inside only to discover that the lights flickered constantly and nothing I plugged in would stay in the electric sockets. However, I DID have internet access. I heard constant thumping, slamming noises all night long, and other guests talking in the rooms around me, as the walls were extremely thin and had zero insulation.
