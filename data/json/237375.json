I stayed her with my mom on my spring break (which was in february) and turns out it was one of the times that Venice floods!!! The waters from the sea were about 20ft from the doors of the hotel! (But this is not unusual so fear not) It was quite exciting and the city puts up cat walks where the flooding is so it is still easy to get around when the tide is high. There is also a FABULOUS little trattoria called \"Conca d'Oro\" just up the alley from the hotel where my mom and I had the best pizza in all out our Italian vacation. The hotel serves a free continental breakfast as well and my mom loved the coffee so much she had to have her fix every morning.

We stayed at the Hotel C&P for 3 nights. It was expensive, but we were willing to pay for its central location. If you can live without bacon, eggs, biscuits & gravy for breakfast, you will find the crescent rolls, yogurt, muesli, cold cuts, cheese, juice, coffee, tea...at the Hotel C&P more than satisfactory to start your day. The poorest & most expensive meal we had was at a restaurant recommended by a Hotel C&P desk clerk. The best meals we had were at a restaurant in the Arsenale neighborhood about 3/4 of a mile from the hotel. Stroll along the broad cement walk or get off at the Arsenale vaporetto stop.

It can be reached from the waterfront or via St. Mark`s Square. It is a small hotel not a large lavish `cost a packet` job but perfectly adequate and well placed. Quite a few people were there overnighting before joining their cruise ships. The staff speak perfect English and are very helpful. They suggested where to eat (and told us where NOT to eat as there are many places that will not give good value for money) and the restaurant they sent us to had good food, wine, surroundings and was not too expensive(for Venice!) You do have to be prepared to pay more for everything there so just choose within your price range from the menu. Bedrooms in the hotel were very clean and comfortable, quite spacious with good beds, air conditioning and en suite. There was a lift but you had to walk up the stairs to the top floor where we were.(Not a problem).We slept well and it was quiet despite there being many guests. Breakfast was on par for Italy, coffee,tea, some cereals, rolls, ham and cheese and when I sent my husband down to get me a cup of tea before getting up (yes, in bed!) they gave him a tray with a lovely pot of tea, cup and saucer.(As normal in Med countries no tea/coffee facilities in the room so take your own if you want it.) All the staff were friendly and helpful and we thought the price was very reasonable for where it was. We were very central. Also the little bar at the end of the street was brilliant with very locals prices. Handy tip - Don`t sit down for drinks or they put an extra euro on each drink.

However, we were first given a room (no 403) which was unbelievably small. (I bet it was originally a single room). The window was next to something like a chimney and the temperature of the room was so high (27C!!!) that we had to sleep with the window open (outside temperature at night was below 10C). Next day, we were moved to another room (no 404) of reasonable size. Bathrooms in both rooms were OK. Hairdryer is of the old type (hose) and takes ages to dry your hair, so it's a good idea to bring yours... The buffet breakfast is poor and depressing. The free afternoon tea &cookies is nothing special, and certainly not something you should alter you plans for.

Like gems, not cheap at \u00c2\u00a3100 per night (this is Venice after all) but worth every penny. Unbeatable location at the bottom end of C de Rasse, next to the Danieli hotel at 6 times the price, this 3* is unbeatable. Spotlessly clean and efficiently run (we had a nose in the kitchen too), simple and ample breakfast, very helpful reception staff (I can't believe the reviews that say otherwise) and cracking location. only yards from the San Zaccaria waterbus stop (off the jetty, turn left over one bridge and 20 yards up to your right) where the Alilaguna airport transport bus stops as well as ACTV waterbuses for .. well, everywhere! Just 2 minutes at a slow wander to St Mark's Square with good quality and good value restaurants in the same street - wonderful stuffed toasted sandwiches at the top of C de Rasse on the right - if you can get in for gondoliers etc on their break. 2 enormous sandwiches and cappucinos that kept us going for 7 hours for 14 euros (\u00c2\u00a35 each at our rotten exchange rate 26 March 2008). I would not hesitate to stay here again.... unbeatable.", "Date": "March 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "liljro", "ReviewID": "UR12509155", "Content": "This hotel was one of our pit-stops from our Adventurous Honeymoon. The place is in a great location close to St. Mark's Square the rooms were very clean and the staff was very helpful. The showers are small but that's all of Italy. The hotel provides continental breakfast which includes: cheeses, cereal, coffee, ham & danishes and saved us from spending outside. Would definately recommend this hotel for travelers. Venice, Italy is definately a beautiful city to visit.", "Date": "January 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rugby UK", "Title": "\u201cLocation, location, location.....\u201d", "Author": "AudnAde", "ReviewID": "UR11691291", "Content": "Stayed for 4 nights with a group of friends & neighbours, chance booking by one of the group.
