Just retired. Love Boquer\u00c3\u00b3n beach and the simple atmosphere at the poblado (fishing village). Go there about three times a year. Parador Boquemar is one of the nearest hotels to the beach, we've been there three times and stayed in other hotels in the area also. While San Juan has high season prices in winter, at that time in Boquer\u00c3\u00b3n you can find low summer prices because puertoricans do not prefer going to the beach in winter (except during holidays). If you dont like noise go during the weekdays and not on holidays and ask for a not noisy area of the hotel. Rooms facing the town and pool are noisier in my opinion. The beds must have been updated because i found no problem, no plastic cover or anything. True, two towels, but if you ask you'd be given hand towels and rug towel. Most people understand a little English. The hotel has a website. Employees are helpful. No elevator, maybe you can ask somebody to bring your luggage up. The stairs are wide and easy. The hotel's restaurant has a decorative water cascade because puerto rico is very hot in summer. It's nice to have breakfast there. Dinner is ok. There are other eateries and hotels around. Hope the photos help you. It's a simple but nice hotel. This is not the place to talk about the poblado itself which could take a lot of upkeep.

(By the way Boqueron is nowhere near Ponce.) The main problem here is noise. On a quiet night, it might be ok, but tiny Boqueron is party central. The hotel is a stone's throw from the main drag. On the side facing the main street (Calle Jose de Diego), you will hear music blasted out by competing sound systems til at least 2am. On the other side, it's actually worse, because of an endless line of cars that drive by as long as the party keeps going. The hotel's windows have no glass, just screens and thin metal shutters, so you really hear the street noise, car alarms, voices, booming car stereos, engines gunning, etc. Neither the sound of the AC nor a set of earplugs had any chance against the level of noise here. We had the misfortune of being there on a holiday recently (Dia de Reyes, Jan. 5), and the party went on until sunrise. Apparently this is how it is in Boqueron on weekends and holidays, including many holidays that are obscure to non-Latin Americans. The night clerk was kind and helped us move to a slightly quieter room at 2:45am (the music stopped around 2, but resumed at 5:45am), but the day clerk, when asked why no one warned us that Dia de Reyes would mean an all-night party (even when I specified on the phone that we wanted a quiet room) replied that it is only the hotel's responsibility to inform clients of what facilities they offer, not to tell people about things going on outside the hotel. Thanks a lot. As for the facilities, they are pretty rustic for over $100 a night (no breakfast included). The pool is not heated; the TV gets about 8 low-rent cable channels, and the rooms, though spacious and acceptably clean, are very plain. When we arrived, our room had only two towels, though we asked for and got washcloths and a floor towel. The restaurant in the hotel is the nicest place in town, though nothing outstanding. It's too far to walk to the nearest beach. The only reason to consider this place at all is the lack of good alternatives in the Cabo Rojo area, which does have some nice beaches. We also stayed one night at the Bahia Salinas, which cost a good deal more, but was much nicer and certainly quieter (that wouldn't be hard). If you can afford that, it's a better option.

First, when me and my girlfriend called to make reservations, the employee, conveniently, forgot to tell us that there was a bikers convention that weekend at the hotel facilities. For obvious reasons, this is the kind of information that we expect to know before making a reservation, counting on the good faith of the hotel personel of course, specially if one object the roaring sound of a whole bunch of motorcycles just outside the hotel and the presence of leather wearing gang impersonators everywhere. Second, the lady employee at the front desk was indiferent, unfriendly and kind of rude, constantly asking for a confirmation number, even thou we explain that we do not have it with us at the moment. At that moment, we asked ourselves, is it so hard to look in the reservation records for our reservation, as she finally did?...In my opinion, there is little or no supervision of the front desk employees. Third, there was no hot water!...Can you believe it?...When we called the front desk to inform this problem, at 7:00 PM, the employee told us that the hotel was near full capacity and apparently, every guest was showering at the same time. In our frustation, we joked that maybe the bikers were washing their bikes all at once. Fifth, the location of the hotel allows all kind of loud music and noise from local pubs and bars in to the room even thou the room is air conditioned. This may be a good thing for a party looking guest, but not for the typical, rest and quiet looking person that visit the west coast of the island. Sixth, the pool area was unkept and the water was foul. And last, but not least, the fact that the administration stamped a piece of paper on the back of the doors of each room, explaining, for example, that if you steal a towel you will be billed $10.00 or if you steal the TV you will be billed $300.00 is a very rude and cheaply attitude. They should know that not all guests are thieves and robers. I can not comment about the restaurant because we decided to eat elsewhere, not wanting another bad experience.

The ramp is supposed to make the hotel accessible to people in wheelchairs, but it would take Arnold Swartzenneger to push a chair up that incline! We had dinner in the restaurant which has a Gastronomic designation from the Puerto Rico Tourism authority. That has to be a mistake. I was looking forward to Caribbean lobster, but all they had was frozen lobster from Africa which was done up in a cream sauce and quite good but, there was no lettuce for a salad, and no fresh vegetables. A large supermarket was nearby, and I wondered why someone just didn't go shopping and get fresh food. Breakfast was fine with a delicious and large serving of fresh papaya with eggs, bacon, ham or sausage and juice for $4.25. Boqueron is colorful. There are numerous small stands selling oysters and clams, but they are not refrigerated and I didn't dare eat shellfish that had been sitting in 80 degree weather for hours.
