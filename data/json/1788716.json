It had everything needed for a city break, spotless, lovely decor, very helpful staff, handy for public transport, rooftop pool to cool down after sightseeing. After reading some of the reviews I was a bit worried! Now all I can say is you can not please everyone. I thought it was a good hotel and I would stay there again.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cIdeal if you dont need any sleep and not interested in seeing the sights of Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "BrianWould", "ReviewID": "UR110544209", "Content": "After a long search for the hotel we gave up and took a cab there , not easy to find - address given should be the one for the entrance on the main street,not the side street nobody knows of. First impressions were nice -clean and modern, but as evening fell and noise outside increased we realised there wasnt much chance of a good nights sleep.Loud banging music and chatter from the restaurants below meant we couldn't sleep until around 3 am. Outside you get pestered by street merchants and people trying to get you to go to their restaurants.If you like buying counterfeit goods theres a pop up market around aksaray station at midnight too! A short walk around the area at night was quite intense with dodgy types trying to pressure us into bars with girls girls girls in them..not good for families or women travellers. Breakfast was meagre and there was none of the usual hot food, just some dry potatoes and strange tasting dry sausages..No toaster, and also no kettle or tea or coffee in the room (which you get in most hotels). My travelling partner had sought a hotel with a gym - but this was closed until 11am, and was very under equipped,also the pool was still closed despite the weather being perfect for it - a little effort for the clients?? This hotel is also about 3 miles away from all the main attractions of Istanbul. Most hotels also give a small welcome basket which includes some fruit and a bottle of wine - however not so here - we were charged 10tl for two small bags of nuts in the (not) welcome basket that could be bought for 1.25 tl around the corner and they wouldnt back down when we complained, so ultimately after two more horrible nights i found a lovely (and much cheaper) hotel in Sultanahmet. Avoid this hotel!

The breakfast was terrible, I ended up not even going to the breakfast and paying to go somewhere else and I was on a budget! The room I got was like a shoe box so I had to step over my bags to get to the door or bathroom. The pool upstairs is no more than half a meter deep and in tiny and full of people and Luke warm which isn't nice after walking all day in 35 degree heat. The gym is two tread mills and a bike that has to be supervised by a staff member who watches you the whole time you work out.... Very uncomfortable! The staff are not friendly or helpful, I asked about a shopping area and if it would be open on Sunday which they told me it was be all opened, travelled over an hour away to find out it was all closed. The staff also couldn't speak very good English and could even recommend bars or places to eat in the area. the rooms aircon is controlled by the reception so if it's on you become too cold and if it's off, too hot. The pillows were terrible. The wireless doesn't reach past level 2. This was the worst 4 star I have ever been to. The only positive is the room was clean", "Date": "July 21, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Istanbul Trend", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d1788716-Reviews-Hotel_Istanbul_Trend-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$105 - $209*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Mustafa Kemal Pasa caddesi No:86 Laleli</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34130</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1788716", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/89/2d/cf/front-view.jpg"}}
