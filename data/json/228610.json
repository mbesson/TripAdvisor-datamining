It is situated in a nice area of Barcelona and away from the crowds. It was about 10-15 walk to la ramblas which we loved as it was quieter and the food and drink was a lot more reasonably priced. The only downside is there isn't a metro station right next to the hotel - it is about a 5-10 min walk away. The breakfast is expensive - there are some lovely little cafes very near to the hotel which are a lot cheaper and easy to find. The website is misleading. We booked a standard room, expecting a room like the photos & as per the description on the booking form. The room was a bit shabby, extremely small and had no view (a wall with a tiny bit of a tree). I complained, and the receptionist got very rude and angry towards me which I found very upsetting. After this, he decided to give us an upgrade to a room with a sofa, table & chairs and a view of the garden. This room was lovely, and as described in the website. The only downside was how hot the room was! The aircon wasn't switched on which may be due to the time of year, but we needed it as the room was stuffy and very hot. If we turned it on it blew out warm air! Overall, the hotel was nice, but I wouldn't book a standard room as it is not how described or worth the amount they ask.

Since my husband and I didn't want to sleep in the same room with children (cause we can't sleep at 9 pm), second day we changed the room, which was ok (we \"only\" had to pay for extra room) and we were lucky that hotel was not full. In the first suite it was impossible to sit on the bench in the kitchen, and you can' t really cook in their kitchens, since on the counter there is not even a place for a plate. I'm an interior designer and I would say that hotel is nice, but not quite functionaliy equipped. I suppose there is a metro under the hotel which is the reason for terrible noise and shaking - people with a sleeping problem should avoid this hotel. Our second suite was really smelly - in the bathroom was the smell like in an uncleaned cat-toilet, so if you left the bathroom door open, the whole suite smelled.

It is well located in the Eixample district, quite close to shopping areas (Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia) and many of the best known tourist attractions, but free of the crowds and noise that travelers encounter when they stay at properties near the Ramblas in the heart of the old city. The modern lobby makes a good first impression and, like other Derby properties, emphasizes art: there is a display of African artifacts downstairs and guest rooms had framed prints, presumably by contemporary artists. Breakfast was served in a large, comfortable space and hotel staff made sure to replenish the buffet as needed. My standard room was on the small size, which is entirely characteristic of all the various Barcelona hotels I've stayed at. That said, the space was certainly adequate. Since I had work to do in the evenings, I appreciated the ample desk and very good desk lamp. Hotel lighting is often inadequate so the Balmes is to be commended for excellent illumination. I could read, write and edit in comfort. Furniture in the room was beginning to show its age (scuffs and dents) but the bedroom and bathroom were immaculately clean. Toiletries were provided (shampoo, lotion, bath gel) and a chocolate was placed on the night table each evening. There was a full size shower/bathtub with a rain shower head. The bed was perfectly comfortable and I was pleased to see that the air conditioning system was still running in early November, when the city ran into a spell of unusually warm, humid weather. Apparently the hotel has a pool and garden area but I never found time to check out this feature of the property. One odd feature: both rooms I occupied had a floor-to-ceiling column (in one instance, very inconveniently located right next to the door). I assume this must be a structural feature of the building. Satellite TV offers stations in Castilian, Catalan, English, German, Italian and French. Front desk staff were very helpful. The first room I was assigned was on the first floor, overlooking the lobby area and elevator. When the noise proved problematic, it was no problem for them to switch me to a room on a higher floor, far from the elevator. I spent the rest of my stay in blissful quiet. There is a single computer located near the lobby that is available for use by guests. If there is one recommendation I would make, it would be to add an additional computer to avoid long waits like I experienced. If you have considerable business to transact or need regular e-mail access you may wish to bring your laptop (the hotel has wi-fi). That's a better alternative than doing your e-mail at 1:30 AM--which I ended up doing--when no one else is around. The breakfast buffet was more than adequate: pastries, breads, cheeses, several varieties of fresh fruit, tortilla, juices. As is so often the case, coffee was dispensed from a machine. The added charge for breakfast is not inexpensive; however, if you can find a deal that includes it as part of your room rate it's a good option and certainly very convenient, especially if you're in Barcelona for business. A nice plus: a variety of newspapers are available at breakfast. In sum, this is very comfortable 3-star hotel with good amenities, a central location, and efficient staff.

Main transport routes are nearby but the hotel's away from the main roads through the city, which was ideal for us. There are some great tapas bars and cafes within a short stroll, too. Our first impressions of the hotel itself were pretty good. The staff weren't especially friendly, which was a shame, but the reception area is nicely designed, with modern decor and ethnic art on display. When we got to our room (116), we were disappointed by how dark it was. Natural light was blocked by foliage covering the window and the electric lighting was poor. The major problem, however, turned out to be noise. The information we were given about the Balmes said the hotel rooms were soundproofed, which sounded perfect for a city location where traffic noise etc... can be a problem. Unfortunately, while there was no noise from outside the hotel, the sporadic sound of rushing water from the hotel's plumbing was unbearable. It was almost like the waste from every other part of the hotel was flowing through a big pipe in the wall of our bedroom. It kept us awake most of our first night. When we complained in the early hours, the hotel's reception staff were efficient (again not particularly friendly) and we moved to another room, this time on the fourth floor, the following day. The replacement room was much better but there was still plenty of plumbing noise from other rooms in the bathroom. That was controllable as long as we kept the door closed but there was also a great deal of noise from neighbouring rooms and the corridor outside. Very disappointing. On the plus side, the place was nice and clean. Also, breakfast was included in our package and it was good, with a nice selection of foods designed to appeal to all international tastes.

The standard rooms are just that...standard (I stayed in the executive room which was a bit bigger than a standard room and it was well worth the extra few Euros a night).

After a few days I moved to one of the suite. WOW...the suite was amazing! I saw some people complain about the rumbling of the underground rail, but to be honest we only felt/heard it when we were in the bathroom so it was no big deal. The suite was HUGE and had a walk in closet, separate kitchen area and a lovely bathroom. Plus the room was very spacious with high ceilings. It was like we were in an old apartment...totally made a different in our stay. Only problem was that the suites (a different part of the hotel) did NOT have Wifi in the room. I had to either go to lobby area or outside by the pool. We ordered room service a couple times and the food was decent (not great, but not bad either). Also hung out in the pool a bit which was nice. The hot tub was more of a \"warm tub\" ...but to be honest with such an amazing city at Barcelona, we didn't want to spend that much time hanging out at the pool. A great place to stay.

Once in the city, then the Metro is just 1.45 Euros. Its very reliable and fast - really easy and the nearest stop to this hotel is para-lel - about 1/4 mile away. Suggest you ask them how the Metro and maps work, once you have mastered, its easier than the London tube!

If you are a non-smoker, then be mindful that in Spain people will smoke at their table (outside). Dont bother paying 14 Euros for breakfast. Go round the corner from the hotel and there are many cafe's that will do breakfast for 8 Euros. I have one small comment on the hotel rooms.

I had followed the reviews on here with interest and I have to say we had a great stay. We arrived after 10 on a Friday night, reception were friendly and most helpful at all times ( Bon Dia, Buanas Noches or hola helps a lot). We were not offered either an upgrade or the cheap/ expensive breakfasts which suited us as teh choices near the hotel for a couple of euros are vast). We were given room 319 on the third floor. It looked onto the peaceful garden area. The room was comfortable with two twins (we had asked for a double). I am six foot tall, and I fitted the bed, so not sure about the previous review about wee beds? The room had a 21'' LCD TV with spanish, english, french, catalan and german channels, a mini bar, a good bathroom with great shower, wc, bidet and fresh towels and toiletries daily. The room also had a two seat leather sofa and small table and chairs at the window with electric sunblinds and good black out curtains. We heard little or no noise from other rooms or corridiors. At 63 euros a night it is an absolute Barcelona Bargain. Location wise, its a 15 minute stroll to Plaza Cataluna/ Las Ramblas, 5 minutes from Caller Rambla De Catalunya wiith great shopping and 10 minutes from Passieg De Gracia and Diagonal Metro stops, less to Provencal station. There is a mini bar for the lazy and rich :o), however there is also a reasonably priced 24/7 small supermarket 2 minutes walk from the hotel with water, cold beer, wine, snacks and all your daily needs. It is also surrounded by great local bars and eateries, the best for us being the excellent 'Cerveceria Gastronomia', ( turn left out of hotel, walk 100 or so metres and its facing you on the opp side of road from hotel next door to a bingo hall!). Great catalan/spanish and columbian food and drinks at very cheap prices. The menu changes daily. Try the Cava Sangria and for me the cold poured Estrella beer. The owner Ricardo speak great English and is a gentlemen. A great bar and restaurant. 200 metres on from the bar is the Argentinian Free Buffet (Buffet Libre), ''Freeway'' serving as much spanish starters (there must be 30 choices of starter alone), argentinian grilled meats, fantastic seafood and fish (cooked as you require), deserts to die for and really cheap drinks. You will need to have a basic command of Spanish to get the best from this place but at \u20ac10 - \u20ac15 per person for all you can eat it is far superior to the other buffet chains in Barcelona such as Fresca and Vaca Paca. A bottle of admittedly edgy house white is \u20ac7 euros!! Go there hungry, if you love platefuls for good hearty food and brilliantly simple fish and seafood you will love it. For brekky there are lots of cafes and bars that will sell you a coffee and cake (cafe y pasta) from around \u20ac2 or Coffee and small salami or cheese baguette for \u20ac3? Even the legendary Cerveceria Catalana, 400 metres to the right of the hotel do great sit at the bar breakfast deals. For more classic spanish and catalan food in a slightly nicer surroundings (ie a nice dinner), try 'Balmes/ Rossello Restaurant' on the corner of (Caller) Balmes/ Rossello Street - Good food in nice surroundings, around \u20ac40 a couple for two courses including a bottle of decent house Cava. Hotel Balmes - A great hotel, worth every penny and we will stay again, taking our children next time.

There are a number of restaurants and bars very close to the hotel and they are all very busy with local's so they must be good! I recommend Catalana which is on Calle del Mallorca the same street as the hotel. But book if a weekend as they queue to get in this place. Moon Bar on the corner of the next block up is a little more rustic but very enjoyable in there. If you just want a drink then visit Teo's next door but one. This is very local and is cheap for drinks therefore but you need how to order a drink in Spanish and ask for the bill as they do not speak any English. You are also a short walk away from La Pedrera and Casa Batlo two of Gaudi's buildings and all the desinger shops on Passieg del Gracia. If you are going on a city break get a metro pass and use this to get about this city and visit the sights. Born is good for shopping on a lower budget than Passieg del Gracia. Las Ramblas is worth a look but that's about all really. And if you do use the metro, visit Segrada Familia or Las Ramblas then I would suggest you are careful. Conceal your money/valuables. If you wear a bag put this within your clothing if you can or put a ruck sack on your front not your back. I always use a hidden money belt under my clothes.

This is their mission and they do it in an acceptable way - but don't expect more than this! LOCATION - The true reason for choosing Balmes Hotel. It's located on Calle Mallorca 216, a few blocks from Passeig De Gracia. Underground station is 5-10min walk and there's also the urban train station going directly to the airport in 30min - a real plus! Key Gaudi buildings are walking distance (casa Mil\u00e0 and Battl\u00f2), placa de Catalunya and the Ramblas 15min walking. HOTEL - We were given a very quiet room on the 6th floor overlooking internal courtyard and swimming pool, we slept without any problem. Double bed was a bit hard but OK. Tiny bathroom but well working, they even change towels every day, together with courtesy set (!!) Quite oddly, the room was incredibly hot despite we were in December... we switched off the heating system, still it was too hot. We had to sleep 2 nights in December with fully open window and 5\u00b0C outside in order to chill the room... SERVICE - Staff spoke basic English without problems, they even tried some Italian when they understood we're Italians. Very efficient cleaners. BREAKFAST - I can't rate that as we bought only night without breakfast (to avoid 14\u20ac/person surcharge, much better options out in town). PRICES - Good value for money, a double room costed us 60\u20ac per night without breakfast (over the weekend, Fri and Sat nights).", "Date": "December 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, good hotel\u201d", "Author": "DeshiMusafeer", "ReviewID": "UR51077752", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at this place for six nights recently.

It is common in Europe to get two single beds pushed together, and this hotel probably has rooms like this. But our particular room (518) had one double bed with a nice mattress. It was very comfortable. - Quiet. We paid 20EURO more per night to get a room facing the internal courtyard with a pool to guarantee peace and quiet during our stay, and it was more than delivered. The room was absolutely silent. We did not hear any sounds from our adjacent room, although we know that someone actually stayed there. - Pool. We have used the pool twice during our stay, and truly enjoyed it. It is not heated, but in June in Barcelona it does not need to be. We also enjoyed their two-level deck and the loungers. - Location. The hotel is located 2-4 blocks from the metro, depending on which line you need.

Whilst good value for e7 each I would not have paid e14 each. Our room, which was simply but tastefully decorated, faced onto the back and we did not, therefore, get any road noise. However, as meantioned by other reviewers, you do get noise. Whilst the rooms are supposedly soundproofed you can hear the plumbing, doors closing etc from other rooms. Despite being a light sleeper it didn't really affect me to much - I guess it may have been that the hotel was not busy. On our first night the heating did not work (and the room was freezing) but it was sorted straight away once we reported it. Another night we came back to find the electrics in the room had gone - again sorted quickly. We found the reception staff to be very friendly and helpful with reasonable English. Whilst being January and unexceptionally cold for Barcelona we did not use the pool. However I think that it woud be a bonus in the summer plus having space to lie in the sun after a hard days sightseeing/shopping. Whilst I would stay in this hotel again I have stayed in others in the same location which were equally as good and similarly priced so would depend on what offer I could get. We stayed in the Barcelona Center last year (opposite the Balmes) which I think spoiled us. I would like to recommend the Dry Martini Bar (recommended in several guide books) for an experience - worth going but the martinis start at e9!", "Date": "January 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cNot the best ;0(\u201d", "Author": "rollerchick", "ReviewID": "UR19906709", "Content": "Stayed here on business as the rate seemed quite good.

We took advice from this site and booked rooms facing the courtyard (paid 20 Euros extra per night per room) and it was incredibly quiet. We liked the hotel's location and access to dining spots. The small pool was very pleasant. The staff was very grumpy and did nothing to make us feel welcomed. Personally, I think all but one of the staff we met should be fired. There should be a reason that hotels are considered to be part of the hospitality industry. I think if I checked in again I would immediately make it known that I was not going to tolerate the unpleasantness of the staff. Additionally we wanted to change something on our reservation. This was impossible to do via email or phone calls we made before we left the United Sates. We wound up keeping the reservation as we originally booked but we did feel scammed. All this being said, I still would stay there again. We found the rooms to be perfectly cleaned and maintained. One final tip, we wandered over to the \"Passeig Gr\u00e0cia\" a beautiful boulevard about three blocks from the hotel. We had a quick breakfast of coffee and pastries at a cafe .... it turned out to be a $75 breakfast for four of us. My guess is this is just emblematic of the priciness of this particularly elegant thoroughfare - cafes off on side streets charged a fraction of this cost.", "Date": "July 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNo double rooms on standard rates\u201d", "Author": "Annabel53", "ReviewID": "UR17366697", "Content": "Having booked a double room through expedia we were then told on arrival that in order to get a double we needed to pay a supplement but that it would be very quiet, until they knocked down a wall outside our window at 8am.

First of all, if you are not fluent in Spanish, this is NOT the hotel for you. The staff seemed very annoyed to have to speak English with us. I understand that we're in their country, so why should they have to speak our language? But it is a hotel, it happens. Every hotel guest we encountered was British (and spoke English with the staff), so this isn't an uncommon occurence for them. Secondly, my bedsheets and pillowcases were covered in brown stains. It was quite gross. And last but not least...the airline lost our luggage, and our cell phones did not work overseas. The manager seemed very annoyed that we gave the airlines the hotel's phone number as our contact number. When we asked simple questions about the airport, we were given short, gruff answers that were far from helpful.

The heat/AC seemed to furnish only heat, with no thermostat, and when we threw open the window to relieve the stuffiness, there was a constantly noisy street scene outside. 2. There was a loud dripping noise at times on the ceiling of the bathroom, 3. The bath/shower is designed in such a way that the bath spout protrudes into the center of the tub, making it an easy target for your knee when showering, 4. The room was a bit on the shabby side and in need of some minimal decoration, such as pictures on the walls, 5. Some of the desk staff seemed a bit arrogant and unaccommodating.

The public areas are smart and stylish, the rooms well equipped, very clean, nicely decorated (we had a lovely bathroom) and a comfortable size. There was also free internet access in the swish foyer! The staff pleasant, efficient and professional- all one should expect really: they are not there to be your friend! In terms of noise, we had had a room on a lower floor above the entrance and yes we could hear traffic when we had the window open but when it was shut, it was barely audible apart from the odd siren (quieter than my London flat anyway!). We were disturbed by another guest outside our room on her mobile but a hotel is not accountable for its guests and it is a hotel not a library after all. I would not describe it as noisy. The best bit though was definitely the breakfast - fantastic choice of food from the buffet such as cold meats, pastries, cereals etc (none of it rationed) as well as freshly cooked dishes (first time I have seen real bacon served by a continental hotel!). It is also served in a very nice conservatory style room. This hotel seems to have its detractors - I can only think they want a 5* hotel at 3* prices. This is definitely the best 3* hotel I have stayed in that I can think of. You can certainly do a lot worse for your money.
