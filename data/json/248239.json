Just because you book for 2 people doesn't mean you both want to sleep in the same bed. We stayed 5 nights so with taxes & the extra $30 per night we almost paid an additional $200 than anticipated. Good customer service would have been to honor the original rate. Besides that, the hotel was very nice & clean. The atmosphere was quiet.

However, my husband did his research and found this to be the best price we were willing to spend and read many different reviews from different websites. I'm glad we chose it. First off, the receptionists are very friendly and knowledgeable. Everything went smooth and quick, was told about great places to eat and how to get to some of the site seeing places easily, and had great attitudes. Our room suprised me the most, it was up to date on the furniture, bedding, floors the whole lot. Everything was very clean and very presentable. There is a bathroom window that you really can see out of unless you wanting to look, but there isn't anything to see as it's just the back of some buildings. All the front windows will overlook the parking lot. The pool was kept very clean from what I noticed, they do have a snack machine nearby as well. If I had to make one suggestion about the whole thing, it would have been that I would have liked to have day curtains in the window. There were only black out curtains and if you wanted to have light come in, the whole world could easily look in. But that would be it. That and the horrible traffic that fills all the streets from the afternoon on. But that's pretty much to be expected around these parts. We ate at 2 of the places we were recommended, one across the street at an outdoor grill type place. Delicious food! The other was a Mexican restaurant around the corner next to a Chinese place. One plate would fill 2 people easily, the selection was great, the staff was very nice and on top of everything. A good place to have a drink and walk back to the hotel. The neighborhood was very safe, no problems whatsoever. The bus stop was just a block away that can take you down to Hollywood, every bus driver was just as nice and helpful as everyone we've been fortunate to talk to. Venice Beach is a straight shot down, not even 10 minutes. The Dollar Store was within a 5 minute walking distance, just incase you forgot anything. Lots of other stores and places to eat as well. The continental breakfast wasn't really anything to write about, it made up of 2 cereal types, some packaged pastries from Costco, orange juice, milk and coffee.

After staying there a week we can say we never felt uncomfortable at the motel or the area. In fact, Culver seemed very clean, quiet, and with some nice restaurants. Pitfire pizza has great food and fun atmosphere. IN n out burgers are a tradition in LA, but they're so-so. The fries are what really stood out, like fresh potatoes. There's even a COSTCO a mile away. What a great location to explore from. Just a few minutes from the beach, Hollywood, Rodeo Drive, Venice, anywhere you want to go. Just go during non rush hours to cross the city to Griffith Park, Glendale, Pasadena, etc. The staff was great as well, very responsive. The only problem we had was with a bad iron and they replaced it immediately. If only our future stays at other hotels could be this nice !We stayed at this Super 8 for the entire week in LA, and couldn't have been more pleased with the accomodations, the staff, the location, the amenities, the incredible value (w/ AAA we paid $71/night). If we had another 7 days we'd have stayed here, that's how much we liked it. We usually stay at Marriott Courtyards, places like that. This was just as nice if not better. But all our fears and anxiety about where and what we stayed in were gone after the first night. If you're going to explore LA for a vacation, I can't imagine finding a better value/location than this Culver City gem. Oh, and FREE PARKING ! At $20+/day at other places, that adds up fast. ps, we didn't realize that Super 8 is part of Wyndham hotels, so you can add points to your Wyndham account if you have one.", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Napa, California", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel, especially for the budget traveler!\u201d", "Author": "perfectly_cromulent3", "ReviewID": "UR86133272", "Content": "My boyfriend and I are definitely 'travelers on a budget'.

The rooms were fairly dark, but this was good the sun didn't wake you up early and I guess helps to keep the rooms cool in summer. The pool was nice, although we didn't use it as it was too cold. Breakfast was a sufficient for me - cereals, muffins and pastries - and a welcome start to the day. Staff were always on hand to re-fill things as they run low. The location was ideal for exploring LA. The area felt safe and fairly quiet too.

The location is good, about a mile and a half from Venice Beach and less than that from Marina Del Rey. Depending on traffic it is 15 minutes to 30 minutes from LAX. Ramps to the 405 are fairly close, so it doesn't take long to get to where you are going, at least in Los Angeles terms. The location seems to be safe, and for the most part, quiet even though it could be considered a high-traffic area. Restaurants and shopping, including a Costco, are nearby, The hotel is well maintained and the grounds crew were busy taking care of the landscaping and pool regularly. The cleaning staff know their stuff and were helpful if we needed something. If there are any draw backs it is that the breakfast is very simple. This isn't a complaint, but if somebody is expecting a big spread with fancy pastry this isn't the place. There are a couple kinds of cereal, milk, juice, coffee, some packaged sweets, and bread for toast. Nobody will starve. Besides, the price is good and includes wireless Internet at no charge.
