Unfortunately our room was not on par with the lovely entrance-dark red walls and a little claustrophobic. The shower was grubby with yellowing shower curtain & dirty stained bath. It was by far the least impressive room we had in 4 weeks in Europe & one of the most expensive (to be fair, acom in Paris is generally more expensive than anywhere else). Most of the staff were great, a couple of average touristic restaurant recommendations resulted in us choosing our own restaurants, one fairly unhelpful staff member seemed really put out by me enquiring how to get to the airport & how long we would need-left a bit of a sour taste -but the others were lovely. It's also unfortunate to read that another honeymoon couple had received special treatment when we had previous correspondence with the hotel that we would be traveling on our honeymoon (months in advance) and informed them we had been recommended to stay there by a family member who returns annually, only to feel like we got the worst room in the place and no special treatment (rightly or wrongly we had probably come to expect this seeing as every other hotel had). Nonetheless, the hotel is located in a great position and the restaurant up the road is fantastic (red & white table cloths), because of this it is a good place to rest your head.

One example of their exceptional service was when my husband and I were walking through a part of Paris we did not know, we emailed them looking for a restaurant, they emailed us back right away with recommendations. The honesty bar, a bar that is in their sitting room that you can take out any beverage you want from juice to champagne to cognac and put your room number down to be accountable, is something we have never encountered before and it is a fabulous idea.

I lived in Paris years ago and I knew that I wanted to stay in a central location. We researched hotels meticulously. This research was part of the fun. We kept coming back to the Relais-Christine as our choice because of the location, size, and unique look. We were not disappointed. We loved our room (#57) and the location was wonderful. The hotel is in the 6th arrondisement and very close to the Seine, Notre Dame and Place St. Michel. Although located in the bustling 6th arrondisement, the hotel is located on a small side street and it is very private and quiet. The front desk staff was reserved yet quite enthusiastic when asked for suggestions. We loved the restaurant that they suggested just across the street. We also loved soaking our sore feet in the hot tub in the downstairs gym at the end of the day. This is an overlooked but \"well worth it\" part of the hotel. There is not an extra fee and the gym and hot tub are lovely. This part of the hotel also has that former abbey feel with the vaulted ceiling and quiet stillness. What a wonderful way to cap off a day of nonstop walking and sightseeing. We also enjoyed meeting other travelers while we enjoyed a drink in the lounge area after a busy day. A special thank you to Director Jean Luc Chomat for his help in researching a cooking school. My daughter was set on taking a cooking class while in Paris. We researched and found 'La Cuisine Paris\" online but we were unsure about whether it was legitimate. Monsieur Chomat called the cooking school and made sure it was legitimate. Our subsequent class at La Cuisine Paris turned out to be one of our best experiences during our trip (see my review on La Cuisine Paris).

We splashed out a little and after much research decided to take a trip to the Relais Christine. My husband and myself were well aware that often four star French hotels are not always to the same standard as four star hotels in other countries but in spite of this we decided to pay a little more in order to have the perfect location (even if this meant sacrificing the standard of the hotel). It turned out to be a brilliant choice for many reasons. Location: The hotel is right in the midst of the action in Paris, literally a stones throw from the Seine River. Directly across from the river is the Louvre and walk a little further down from there and you fall upon the stunning Notre Damne Cathedral. With two close Metro stations next to the hotel it is so convenient for touring all of the Parisian hot spots. The hotel itself is located towards the back of a quiet little side street away from the bustle of the surrounding Bistros, bars and cafes. The cast iron gate way reveals a building full of old age charm with picturesque flower boxes on every window and ivy climbing the traditional stone walls. Rooms, Sleep Quality, Cleanliness and Service: We had paid for a left bank honeymoon package and so this came with a deluxe room, spa access (which we didn't use as were too busy- I believe this was only a sauna, jacuzzi and fitness suite though, massages etc come at extra cost), Buffet Breakfast both mornings, bottle of champagne and open top car tour. I really feel like this package turned out to be good value for the money we paid with all of the extras that were part of the package. The room was nowhere near as small as I expected (Ive stayed in France before and the rooms are often tiny!), nice decor, lovely bathroom with duel sinks and large mirror, plenty of storage, hifi, mini-bar, t.v, air-con, and large french windows that opened looking out onto the pretty courtyard below. We couldn't fault the cleanliness, the beds were so comfy, thick dark curtains, cooled room from the air-con and the hotel so peaceful that you could not do any other than have a good nights sleep! The buffet breakfast was wide and varied. You sometimes have to wait for your table to be reset before you dive in but there is no hurry, the staff are happy to help if you need something and so polite. The waiters offer you tea or coffee and bring you a basket of delicious fresh rolls, pastries, jams and butter. You can also help yourself to sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs, toast, fresh fruit, yoghurt, cereals, ham, cheese and fresh juices. All very fresh and tasty. The service was impecable from all members of staff. We were left chocolates and a note about the predicted weather the next day afte the turn down service on an evening, were served the most delicious champagne in the honesty bar with a note congratulating us on our honeymoon and the staff were more than happy to order a taxi for us when we needed one. They spoke fluent English and were so respectful and helpful. As for the open topped car tour, that was brilliant! One of my favourite moments of the trip (we did have glorious weather for it though!) our guide was lovely and spoke English better than we did! He was so nice and friendly and gave us the choice of a classic or unexpected tour of the city, we opted for the unexpected as we had already seen most of the most famous sites and we weren't disappointed! It was so interesting to see and hear about the city's oldest houses and churches, a secret garden, beautiful statues and buildings and many other places of interest. All in all the Relais Christine and the Honeymoon package more than met our expectations, beautiful hotel, great services and a fantastic stay. It was a little more expensive than we could normally afford but that is the price you pay for such an optimum location. Up-market without being snooty! It wasn't the Ritz but it had such a charm, picturesque, truely Parisian feel to it that Id rather stay there any day!

The lobby and public area of the hotel is attractive, although very compact. The hotel's location is excellent for walking to many of Paris' sites and metro stops to get to the all the others. There are lots of hotels in this area and while this is a very good hotel, there are likely many others of comparable quality and perhaps better value. Front desk personnel were personable and efficient in all dealings, with excellent recommendations and reservation service for meals. The lobby seating area features very comfortable furniture and an overpriced honor bar. ONE general use computer, with complementary internet access, is in a hallway in the lobby- more on internet later. Our room was a Junior suite on two levels-the main level featured a very nice ensuite with a very creamped living area. The upper level was up a steep, narrow stairway to a large sleeping loft and closet. On the plus side the bathroom ( including towels and toiletries) and the bed ( and linens) were very good. The cramped main floor was dark and not overly comfortable. And of course with the bathroom on the main floor and bed up, navigating a dark, narrow strairway a night was a bit harrowing. The overall decor was rather plain and dark- not nearly as rich feeling as one would expect in a 4 star house. In-room Internet had to be purchased through a third party vendor which was not user friendly and at nearly US$11 per hour not inexpensive. Why do expensive hotels charge for internet access and inexpensive hotels and B&B's offer it for free? While the room was a pleasant enough place to stay at US$530 per night it was not very good value- although our deal included one bottle of Champagne on the first day. Breakfast was about US$40 each in the attractive vaulted basement area- good quality but no variety from day to day and again not a great value. If 4 stars is important to you and money is no issue, Relais Christine will provide you a very pleasant stay.", "Date": "January 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton", "Title": "\u201cGreat location but far from the best hotel in the SLH Paris group\u201d", "Author": "pedantictraveller Posted by an OctopusTravel traveler", "ReviewID": "UR91030902", "Content": "The location was fabulous -really difficult to beat as it was walking distance from some of the best spots in Paris.

I planned a short trip to Paris with my Mom (her first time in Paris) and wanted it to be special so decided to book 2 nights at Relais Christine as it had looked nice when I had peeked in while walking by on previous trips. I booked though the Small Luxury Hotel (SLH) website as we are SLH club members and there was a deal for a \"Superior room\" for about 340 euros per night that included a free bottle of wine, complimentary breakfasts, and as SLH Club members, a complimentary room upgrade if available. A week or so before the trip, I emailed the hotel and asked about a few dinner reservations as well as the status of the room upgrade. I received a response confirming the dinner reservations which was nice but the reply ignored the question regarding the room upgrade. I figured it would have to wait until check in most likely due to availability so no big deal. We arrived in Paris and checked in at the front desk. The woman was rushed and didn't mention anything about the room upgrade. I decided not to say anything since this was a treat for my Mom and didn't want her to focus on anything but having fun. We got to the room (via a dusty and dingy hallway) on the ground floor overlooking the courtyard. The room was small and rather blah with a double twin bed, tiny desk and a chair in the corner. The bathroom had clearly been updated and was very nice with a bathtub on one side by the window and a step in shower on the other side. There was no wine in the room as promised on my room reservation confirm email and no mention of our complimentary breakfasts on the welcome sheet. However, we were happy to be in Paris so we quickly grabbed our coats and headed out to explore Paris. On returning to the hotel through the entrance courtyard, we looked over and wow, you could see right into our room down to the book we left on the bed! So much for keeping our curtains open. We went back to our room and couldn't get the key to work in our door. We tried and tried and finally, with some embarrassment, went back to the front desk to ask for help. I was told that \"Americans always turn the key the wrong way\" (although I am now living in the UK and seem to manage to open doors). So, with my head hung low, we followed the person back to the room and lo and behold, she tried to open the door exactly the same way I did and it wouldn't work! We finally had to get a third person who with a lot of shoving and pulling got it to work and showed us the \"trick\". I'm all for quaint hotels but having to learn the \"trick\" of opening my hotel door is a bit much. Back in our room, we quickly shut the curtains and realized that there was actually no curtain in the bathroom over the tub beyond a clear vinyl sheet. We laughed as we figured you would have to crouch to get in and out of the tub if you didn't want to give someone outside a show! As it was, we grabbed our towels off the towelrack while we were still in the shower in order to not be seen through the bathroom window. The other strange thing was the location of the toilet. I think that with the room remodel, they didn't have room for the toilet in the bathroom so they relocated it to what was probably a smallish closet right by the door into the room. The toilet room was so tiny that you literally had to step inside and almost straddle the toilet to get the door shut! Again, not a huge deal but the small inconveniences were adding up when you are paying US$420 per night. The twin beds were a little soft for my taste but my Mom seemed ok with them. We enjoyed our dinner and returned to the room around 10pm. People were hanging out in the courtyard talking so we shut our window to cut down the noise. One thing I did notice was that the hotel staff did try to rush out and help people who were hauling their roller bags across the courtyard cobblestones. We all know what a racket that makes and I did appreciate them trying to carry the bags in order to keep people with rooms overlooking the courtyard from hearing constant rattling. We called room service for some ice and 30 minutes later still no ice so I called again and oops, they had forgotten so another 15 minutes for ice. This type of inconsistent and below par service continued through the second day and was just not to the level I would expect for an SLH property. In summary, Relais Christine is a nice hotel in a great location but absolutely mediocre service and average facilities for a hotel belonging to the SLH group. Also, if they are going to offer booking packages including things such as complimentary breakfasts and wine, it is not right in my opinion to make the guest have to ask again for those benefits. I had much better service and nicer rooms at the Hotel D'Aubusson (and even Villa D'Estrees which is a less espensive hotel) and would absolutely choose the D'Aubusson over Relais Christine next time around.", "Date": "June 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Wylie, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cPeaceful Oasis on the Left Bank\u201d", "Author": "navygoat", "ReviewID": "UR66207953", "Content": "Forget the double or triple-glazed windows often needed on the bustling Left Bank --- Relais Christine is a peaceful oasis.

By international standards the room was not large , but it is Paris and you do not expect large rooms and it kind of adds to the ambience of the place. My room was very clean and I found the staff most helpful , especially Jeremy at the front desk who was only too willing to help us with any questions we had. I think the only other option in the area is Hotel D'Aubossen which we went and looked at , although I think noise there might be a problem.While at Relais Christine , I had a look at the garden rooms and also the standard rooms and and I think the garden rooms are expensive and not as big as the room I had.I think I would take a standard room next time as that looked quite qdequate.

I did not get the opportunity to eat at the one in the street off Christine closer to the Seine ( just before the laundromat ) which looked very good. Would i stay there again - undoubtedly yes. Any criticisms? None really although in my room there was a pretty significant step from the shower /bath to the floor which could present a problem if you were elderly or unsteady on your feet.

We had booked a Deluxe room with SLH but where upgraded to a Duplex on the third (top) floor. The room was recently refurbished (which I had requested after given such recommendation in other reviews) and it was top of the line! Downstairs a sofa (bed sofa), table, flat screen TV, bar and stereo. Several windows giving nice and light view. A smaller dressing room with plenty of clothing space. Next the modern and beautiful bathroom having 2 washbasins, bathtub and a separate shower with a rain shower. Great! Upstairs was the bedroom with small working desk, a built-in bookcase and another flat screen tv. Good size, very comfortable and lovely decorated.

To get wide awake I took the shower which resulted in a very wet wooden bathroom floor where we spotted some until now unknown fungus that apparently did love the wooden floor. My wife took the bath.. We got use to wash one by one one since there was no place fot two in the bathroom but the toilet was ok. All in all I do not think we'll be back..", "Date": "November 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Boutique Hotel all-around\u201d", "Author": "WhhCalifornia", "ReviewID": "UR48193264", "Content": "Great experience recently.

It was my eighth trip to Paris and I had never stayed in a luxury hotel before. Pluses: I cannot imagine a better location, unless you are going to Paris for a very long stay. A block from the river (for sightseeing), Rue de Buci and Blvd St Germain (for eating and shopping) yet quiet--I mean pin-drop, like a tomb, quiet! I have never had a room in Paris which was so isolated from street noise. Room was tastefully outfitted, unlike some Paris rooms which seem to decorated within an inch of their lives; it had a lovely small balcony overlooking the courtyard, on the first floor. For our anniversary, the staff gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne. When we needed anything, like ice or directions, the hotel staff was obliging and speedy. The bathroom was excellent, with a long tub (I am tall, so I appreciated this.) Cons: the superior room was not huge for the money (300 E), although roomy enough for two chairs and desk. (I gather the classic rooms are smaller, and would not recommend them if that is true.) And we did not take the breakfast: 30E ($40) pp is a ridiculous price to pay when there are great cafes, boulangeries and patisseries literally around the corner on Rue de Buci (Carton is legendary), where you can get the best pastry of your life, or on St Andre des Arts where you can get juice, snacks, pizza, etc. You are paying only for convenience and fancy china. All things considered, though, the hotel was an outstanding Paris experience and we would definitely repeat it, for a short stay.

A picturesque, charming and quiet place in the heart of a very old but hopping part of Paris.

We know that space in this area is scarce and dear, and they do their best to make use of every centimeter. It helped that they stored away our luggage and that were happy to continue to store it for the time we left Paris. Things that could use improvement were\u2014 1. the lighting in the rooms (they are way too dark) 2. the electric power (we never had enough plugs to charge our phones, cameras etc. and the fuses were not working well) 3. although the bathroom was magnificent and immaculate, the bathtub was uncomfortably small. The shower curtain sticks to the guest\u2019s body because the tub is very narrow, and the tub is hard to get into and very slippery which can cause an accident 4. most importantly, the air-conditioning never did cool down the room to a comfortable level.
