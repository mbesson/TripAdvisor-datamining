It is a long way from Mexico City's charms and riches. If you are here for business, there are better choices than this. As lover of great architecture I was looking forward to staying in the unusual oval building, yet after checking in I soon realized that it lacks any kind of atmosphere or style, and because of its remote location guests are likely to feel captive. Management takes advantage by price gouging as much as possible. Internet access, bottled water (anything from the minibar), and in-room coffee are outrageously overpriced, and the hotel facilities and services do not make up for it. Because of high occupancy I was \"upgraded\" to the club floor, but was charged for the privilege of using the lounge. The rooms are very ordinary for a supposed stylish, contemporary 5-star hotel, with ugly commercial carpeting, Ikea-like furniture and clunky obsolete TVs. My in-room CD player was not working, later removed and never replaced. Luckily, the TV system offered a couple of music channels, but no on demand movies or basic hotel functions. Speaking of high-tech, there are indicators in the hallway for housekeeping and others to know whether guests are in their rooms, (tiny red and green LED lights), yet one housekeeper opened my door without even knocking or using the buzzer while I was in, and did not even apologize. The next day, when I returned to the hotel around 4pm my room had still not been cleaned. Not that I wanted to spend much time there, since my 7th floor view was of the loading areas and roof of the convention center across the street. All in all, it was a less than pleasant stay.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cordoba, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cVery nice\u201d", "Author": "crsampieri", "ReviewID": "UR118201411", "Content": "Very nice hotel, spacious rooms, good food, good location, excellent view, complimentary transportation services (to the business zone monday thru friday, to the mall on week ends), very good service, I definetly recommend it.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, TX", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly surprised\u201d", "Author": "loveHR", "ReviewID": "UR116088900", "Content": "I stayed here on business the latter part of February for eight days. I was pleasantly surprised because i really didn't expect such a nice hotel in the heart of Mexico. The decor was nice and the staff was friendly and remembered you by name. The hotel room was extremely nice and clean and was in close proximity to my job. The staff ordered me a cab each morning. I loved the bathroom with a sit in shower. I ate at the breakfast area several times and the staff was accommodating, making sure I had what I needed. I stayed in my room for the most part and didn't venture out into other parts of the hotel such as the pool or fitness center. I did order room service and the food was good. The staff did not speak too much English but could understand what you were asking. The nice thing that happened each night was that they brought bottled water and turned the TV to a mellow music channel which set the tone for a relaxing evening. If I could, I would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Location": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Bloomfield, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cLeave valuable jewelry at home.

There are NO public transport links AT ALL. Taxis cost a fortune (not helped by the hotel commission) & take 30 minutes to the nearest metro station. When I arrived my booking was messed up (the hotels fault).They refused to try my credit cards & it took me 4 hours to get into a room after an 11 hour flight. Only one member of staff showed any concern. I was also charged for what I had been told was complimentary water and coffee in my room and phone calls that I did not make. Food in the restaurant is limited and not that great. & given how far it is you're not spoilt for choice (The only places to eat locally: Papa Johns Pizza, Chi Chi's and Starbucks) Accomodation is what you'd expect from a 4/5 star hotel, but this is so far from everything in Mexico City that it does not compensate. Unless you have business in the Santa Fe District, avoid at all costs.

This area is a business district but I would rather stay here than many other areas of the city because it is quieter and you get more for your money. This hotel was the lowest priced of the 4 others I checked in the area. For only $168 a night we received a very clean, comfortable room that looked like new. Great shower, one of the best at any hotel I have stayed at. Also nice flat screen TV's. I also enjoyed the indoor pool area and fitness center. From the fitness center you have a nice view of the area. The service at this hotel was exceptional. They did everything I asked correct and prompt. There are always about 4 people at the door saying hello and offering to serve you. Valet parking was very reasonably priced.
