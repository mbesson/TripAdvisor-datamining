That's the good news. This however, will not prepare you for the disgrace that is room 206, should you be unfortunate enough to stay here. Firstly, you must understand that the first five of the seven floors are designated as 'Smoking'. Something that the mostly non European clientele embrace to the fullest extent. The room stank worse than one of Keith Richards' ashtrays and had more burn marks on the furnishings than I have ever seen in one room. The smell of cigarettes would have been overpowering were it not for the stench of mould, mildew and damp.The plaster and wallpaper had long ago given up trying to stay in place, with even the framed pictures on the wall curled up. The furnishings were mostly broken and/or held together with protruding screws. There was a mini fridge, 'dumped' on the rancid carpet, complete with broken door and exposed wires. The worst part though, filth aside, is that the smoke alarm was disabled. it's innards gutted, removed, gone! PLEASE CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING: any hotel management team that allows smoking in 80% of it's bedrooms, has numerous unprotected electrical cables and actively promotes/tolerates the disablement of smoke alarms, is risking more than one life.

I was there 3 weeks on a business trip so the location was perfect for me. I walked 5 minutes to get to public transportation which allowed me to go anywhere for about $1.20 US. The hotel offers free breakfast and has a dining room for lunch and dinner. The staff was great and I probably talked to them at length almost everyday about sites to see, cost, and the best way to get there. When I travel I enjoy doing things as the locals would do them. The hotel lobby and restaurant is well kept and clean. There is a computer for guests and wifi is available in your room, just ask the front desk to turn it on for you. The rooms are very dated and have no frills. Most of the guests are business men who need to be in that area of town. The cost for that area of town is average and you can easily go down the street to the W but expect to pay almost triple the rate.
