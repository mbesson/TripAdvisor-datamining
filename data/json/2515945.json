It is always welcoming, squeaky clean and you can't beat the location. I have read many reviews here about the hotel and there are 2 common complaints- the rooms are small and no A/C. Well, the rooms are not huge, but they are comfortable and if you are there on vacation, why spend a lot of time in your room? There is so much to do in S.F.! The A/C issue has never bothered us as we open the window- there is always a breeze and it cools off in the evening. It has never affected my sleep.

We read great reviews on this place which is why my friend and I booked it. The hotel itself is fine, clean rooms and bathrooms but no safes in the bedroom. We noticed on the 3rd day of our 4day stay that our key cards didn't open the doors so we took them down to reception to replace them. The following night we came home from an evening out, getting ready to head to New York the following morning. My friend began looking around for a skirt when she realized that her entire suitcase was missing! We had been using this suitcase as a safe as there wasn't one in the room & we didn't think to ask reception. Anyway, as this was an extra suitcase containing recently purchased items, jewelry, an iPod, debit card etc. We realised that the room, although not immediately noticeable had been disturbed and that draws were open & bags on the ground as it had been searched through. We called reception & the police and were moved to another room. It was a reay bad start to a holiday & an unpleasant experience. It was especially unnerving given we are two young women & our radio had been left on. We encouraged the police & hotel staff to view cameras but it appears this wasn't possible. We did not receive any remuneration for our accommodation. Fortunately this is a time were being vigilant and taking out travel insurance paid off. I don't want to speculate as I am sure most people at that hotel are honest however, we couldn't help wonder if it was an inside job given the lack of break in & the knowledge as to what to take. Mainly no one was hurt but I couldn't in good conscience not post this review in the hope that it encourages management to ensure tightened security.

I wasn't expecting a modern, luxury room and had previously stayed in other older hotels in the downtown area, so I had reasonable expectations. Our check-in was late due to plane delays. We were assigned to a very small room that had an entrance inside an alcove which made it awkward for rolling in the luggage. The room was very dark when all of the lights were turned on and did not have adequate space for unpacking two suitcases. Upon entering, the room was quite cold as the thermostat was off; but the heater did not work at all even when turned on for more than ten minutes. I called down to the front desk and was informed that I could come downstairs to get keys for another room, but there did not seem to be anyone available to check it out. We changed to a room down the hallway which was a bit larger (which then made me wonder why we weren't assigned there initially). This room was more comfortable; but the heat couldn't be adjusted when on, so we had to keep the window open a bit. This made us more susceptible to street noise which sounded like clanging trash bins being collected at night. I didn't mind the small size of the bathroom which was plentifully stocked with toiletries including toothpaste, but the height of the sink vanity was quite low. The alarm on the clock radio malfunctioned the next morning, and we overslept to find no hot water available. TV reception was limited to local stations.

When we requested to see the Deluxe King Room, he gladly brought us up to not 1, but 2 rooms having different views from the room. I was impressed by his friendilness and customer service and was happy we have booked 5 nights in this hotel. We checked in at noon the next day and was happy to know the room was ready. (Check-in time was 3pm). The room looked exactly as the pictures posted and was cosy. I loved the fur blanket on the bed, which gives it a very luxurious feeling. I requested for a foam pillow 3 times from the hotel staff before someone got back to me and say that they are not available. I was quite annoyed by that. They need to work on staff communication and follow up of customer's request. Complimentary wifi was a dream and connection was fast except for 1 night which had technical issues.

I'm very picky about where we stay since I've had some terrible hotel experiences in the past at supposedly \"upscale\" hotels. I'm happy to report that the Kensington Park provided a fantastic stay over five nights. We checked in late and there were no issues. I'd had to create two separate reservations in advance since we added a night onto our stay after I'd made the first reservation and when I went back into the system to extend it, the room type I'd booked wasn't available for the extra night. However, when we checked in, they not only gave us the corner king room I'd originally booked, but they gave us that night at the same rate as I'd booked for the lesser room. The hotel is older, but it's got a ton of character (in a good way). It was *extremely* clean and the staff was *extremely* friendly. The bed was fantastic - so comfortable, to the point where I actually slept in late a few mornings. The bathroom was small, but well-appointed, with a hair dryer, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, toothpaste and makeup remover towelettes provided. The view was fantastic - the corner king rooms have windows on two walls, so we overlooked Nob Hill on one side and Union Square on the other. There's a coffee maker in the room, but they also provide coffee and orange juice mid-way down the hall, and coffee, tea and water in the lobby in the morning. The location is good - just off Union Square, although they were doing major sidewalk work outside the entrance. It was about a five-10 minute walk from the Powell St. BART station, and there are lots of restaurants very close by, including one of the best seafood restaurants in the city that's literally connected to the lobby of the hotel (they have great happy hour deals on fresh oysters and drinks). The only minor detail is that there's no heater in the room; since we visited in November and it was cold/rainy for half of our trip, the room got pretty cold, although you could call and have a heater brought up to you. However, the bed was so warm that once I got into it, the need for a heater was gone. In fact, the first night we were there, we slept with the windows cracked and we were totally fine. Would we stay there again? Yes, absolutely. The Kensington Park is a charming hotel with friendly staff, great amenities (free wifi!) and a good location.

(FYI -- this is not a recent review) I started dating my wife in April of 1996. In September, we made our first trip together as a couple, and decided on San Francisco as a destination. I had contacted my travel agent and told him I wanted something romantic, close to everything and reasonably priced. He asked if I needed anything else and I suggested either a violinist or spanish guitar player in a courtyard playing up to her in the evenings. While the musicians never materialized, everything else was met to perfection with his booking of the Kensington Park for us. Upon check-in, we were told that our travel agent had gotten us an upgrade. We took our keys and headed up to our floor. As I walked down the hallway, I read the room numbers, looking room #920: 912, 914, 916... the last two doors were marked \"Presidential Suite.\" \"No way,\" I thought and tried the key. The door opened on about 2000 square feet of opulence: lead crystal chandelier above the 12 person dining table, two full bathrooms with jacuzzi's, a reading/music area and an oversized king bed on a pedestal sitting four feet off the floor, with a control panel on the wall for the fireplace, television, lights and curtains! Wow! The staff at the Kensington was nothing short of sensational. Everyone there offered their opinions on restaurants, tours, activities, shopping... they were all great! Here's a hot tip: there are 22 restaurants that will deliver to the Kensington Park! You never have to leave the hotel. I have a photograph of my wife lounging on a couch in our suite, looking like the cat who ate the canary! It's one of my favorite pictures of all time. The Kensington Park Hotel was instrumental in the formation of a relationship that led to a great marriage and I will always look fondly on our days and nights there.

First and foremost is the LOCATION. It is near to almost majority of the must-sees in SF. Union Square is just a few steps away, Market Street for affordable shopping is also just a walking distance. For the lovers of branded and/or high-end boutiques, KPH is the ideal place to stay. Just walk down/up Post Street and the areas surrounding Union Square. Second on the list is SERVICE, specifically the front desk. They're very helpful and polite. I specifically would like to complement a male staff who delivered a complimentary sherry to my room even if it is already a few minutes past the \"complimentary sherry/tea time\". He saw me slumped on the elevator seat as I was so exhausted at that time coming in from work with a really heavy bag. Kudos, you made my day! Internet in the room is fast and hassle-free. Now the BUTs... the room is quite small. Since I am traveling alone, I stayed in a single room but compared to other hotels in Asia (which is good for one/two), my room is really small. There is not enough space to move around. Also, there is no safety deposit box. You need to go to the front desk to deposit your valuables. There is no refrigerator in the room where I stayed either. I am not sure if this is dependent on the type of room but majority of hotels do have mini refrigerators. If you want to order food and have it delivered to your room, you need to order from the outside restaurants and you have to do it before 7pm. They don't have their own restaurant (apart from Farallon I guess) and they don't have the room+breakfast arrangement. You really need to go out in order to eat. Not a problem though as there are a lot of restaurants adjacent and surrounding the hotel.

The rooms are comfortable, the toilet is relatively spacious compared to some other hotels we've been to, and the bedside tables were nice - there was a pull-out compartment for you to do some writing on and things like that.

We chose this hotel primarily for the location and proximity to all major destinations.

Immediately I walked the perfectly safe block to the center of Union Square. So much shopping, restaurants and very close to the Gold Dust Lounge - which was frequented daily (sometimes twice). We also were able to walk through Chinatown and into the North Beach area - then on to Lombard Street and down to Fisherman's wharf - lovely day of walking - the weather was fantastic!... We didn't use any public transportation but it would have been easy to get where we needed to go. Cabs were plentiful in the area. The rooms were on the smallish side but it was exactly as I would have expected (actually a bit more roomy). The hotel had a vintage flair - very cute... a lot of personality. The housekeeping staff and handymen walking around the hotel were always very friendly and personable. The front desk staff did not seem familiar with the area AT ALL (horrible restaurant recommendation - KULETO'S - don't bother) and were not overly helpful. My husband called down on the last night of our stay to request hot water to the room - it never came. Overall the stay was amazing... nice, clean rooms and great location.

We were delighted to be greeted pleasantly and were informed that both rooms were ready for us. The Kensington was very clean and comfortable. The beds were amazing! Beautiful linens and comfy mattress, like sleeping on a cloud. The decor was updated and stylish. Evening tea and sherry were available on the lobby. Service was top-notch.

I happen to like old buildings, so the fact that the door sill between the room carpet and the hall carpet showed wear just added to the charm for me. The stairwell had a cool brass railing and other old fashioned touches are here and there. There is no AC, but there is a ceiling fan. This goes back to the old building issue and the fact that SF is usually quite cool and AC would be only needed about 2-3 days a year anyway. The walls are not soundproof (building materials were not as advanced back then), and I could hear the neighbors talking, opening/shutting doors, TVs, etc. With that said, I would definitely stay here again because that's what you have to expect in downtown SF.

We booked a Royal Court double double at $249/night. I noticed on this site that others paid far less than this and I'm not sure where they found their deals...hmmm. Nevertheless, they unexpectedly \"upgraded\" us to a Deluxe double double when we got there. Oh goody! Except that the room was on a lower floor with less expensive rooms and without the amenities that were promised. It was a corner unit (I suppose to make up for the inferior room). The furnishings were well worn, large scratches on the walls and furnishings and the carpet was dirty. I can overlook some things but the bathroom really put us over the top; it was dated, dingy, and poorly finished with a moldy shower! The next morning I complained to the front desk clerk who was not able to tell me the amenities offered for their better rooms (amenities that we paid for), compared to the Deluxe rooms. I spoke with the manager who admitted that we were placed in an inferior room, that they were completely full the previous night, and that we should be happy because the room had 2 windows! We booked this reservation 3 months ago when they had many rooms available. Why should we suffer because the hotel filled up?? After much discussion, she reluctantly took $30 off the bill. We will never stay here again. We stay in SF frequently and ALWAYS try to book at one of the Kimpton Hotels. This time we were unable to to find a room at one of our favorites (not sure why), the Hotel Monaco. They have far better rooms with wonderful amenities and very professional staff.

The room at the front of the hotel which my wife and i were given didn\u2019t have much of a view but we really didn\u2019t care as we spent as little time as possible in the hotel and as much time as possible out and about in the city. Due to a little bit of Post Street noise very early on a morning, i did find myself waking up briefly a couple of times, but due to the location it\u2019s just something that can\u2019t be helped \u2013 besides, it really didn\u2019t bother us and soon went back to sleep until the alarm went off!

This one was far superior! Alsobe sure to have a drink at the Clock Bar located in the lobby of the Westin St Francis hotel across the street.

The room was on the small side. With 2 double beds and a desk and dresser, the room was too full to comfortably put a suitcase on the floor without having to step over it to get around. The closet was very small as well. Luckily, the bathroom was a decent size and we could put one of our small suitcases in there. Bathroom was clean and shower was fine, but not the greatest water pressure. The beds were very comfortable with nice linens and duvets. Decor was also very pleasing and updated. Our room did not have a ceiling fan, and as some other reviewers pointed out -- was a bit stuffy -- even in March -- with no A/C.

And she said that we could have it for $20 more per night. We declined. Not the best way to start the trip. I didn\u2019t expect to be able to check in right away, but I really didn\u2019t expect the tricky up-sell. She asked for our voucher. What voucher, we asked? She had our reservations, but still insisted that we give her a voucher from lastminutetravel.com. This company does not send vouchers. Arghh\u2026 so she took a copy of our email confirmation instead. She suggested that we come back after one and perhaps a room would be ready then. We dropped our luggage and returned at close to two. When we came back, our room was ready, and we asked for our luggage. There was now a different desk clerk, and she went to get our luggage and then returned and said that somebody would bring it up to our room. Um\u2026no that\u2019s okay, we\u2019ll take our luggage now. As you can see, we are thrifty travelers, and did not want to be obligated to tip somebody for bringing up our two carry-ons that we are perfectly capable of bringing up ourselves. The desk clerk was not pleased, and visibly scowled. She went back into the luggage room and continued to search for our luggage. Apparently, she couldn\u2019t find it, which was why she said somebody would bring it to our room. Finally with the help of (the concierge?), she was able to locate our luggage. We were on the leper floor with some sort of Elks facility and a business center. Our room was fine, but nothing nice. Here are some things we noticed about the room: * The bed sheets are ancient and thread-bare. There is a little sign next to the bed encouraging you to not get your sheets changed. I\u2019ve seen these before and I\u2019ve not been particularly perturbed, but this one was especially scolding, saying, in all caps, MAKE THE DECISION FOR YOURSELF. *There is no air conditioning, and the ceiling fan rattles if you put it above the lowest setting. *There is a lot of street noise, especially drunk people at night. *There is no shower cap. *The toilet paper is very thin. *There were stray hairs in the bathroom. *There are very few television channels. Here are some things we noticed about the hotel: *The elevator certificate has been expired for over a year. *D\u00e9cor is sloppy and crookedly placed. Not a big deal, but there is a clear inattention to detail. *Front desk clerks are ignorant at best, and willful liars at worst. Along with our check-in experience, we talked to the front desk regarding shuttles to Oakland Airport. I was told that it would cost the same amount to take a taxi with the hotel\u2019s preferred company as it would to take a shuttle. It\u2019s actually 30% more. They were no help in finding airport transportation. All and all, not a pleasant stay. It just wasn\u2019t comfortable, and it sure didn\u2019t feel special. You can do A LOT better for your money.

Which gives rise to the next highpoint-outstanding service. We decided we didn't need /want full housekeeping service on the second day of our stay but did want the garbage emptied. The staff was on the scene within two minutes of our request. Front desk staff politely greeted us by name upon entering and exiting. The decor of the hotel is just as subtly classy as the service. Complimentary juice and coffee are served in the morning and sherry and tea in the afternoon. Some light snacks with the latter-nuts, etc., would be a nice touch. Room service is from a deli (La Taza) two doors down and stops at 7 with what is basically a lunch menu. We just went there and got take out for breakfast (opt for the fruit rather than the burned potatoes) to avoid the service charges. There's another deli (Cafe Encore) two doors down that's open until 8 and has a broader selection of sandwiches and salads that can suffice for dinner but a less appealing breakfast menu. The Farallon, a highly regarded restaurant, is part of the hotel, so it's hard to understand why they don't have room service from it at least for dinner. The room was fine (nice decor, great TV, comfortable beds) but quite cramped for two people and a dog, including a small bathroom. The low speed internet access was adequate for our purposes; higher speed connections are available for a fee. The room was supposed to be one class up from the base (it was about fifteen bucks more per night), but in fact the only difference is you're on a higher floor \"with a view of Nob Hill or Union Square.\" Our \"view\" of the latter was the side of the new tower of the St. Francis. There is a well functioning ceiling fan but no a/c and the window lacked a screen.

As a native northern Californian, I can attest, it can and does get into the 80s several times a year in SF and even the 90s an handful of times. I would suggest checking the 10 day forecast if planning to stay there any time from April through October and if there's a chance of such temps, changing to a hotel with a/c. Noise from Post St. was a real problem; up to 1:30 am on Sunday morning, partiers literally screaming and many sirens. I would imagine that's a problem anywhere you stay in the Union Sq. area. All in all, a very positive experience at quite a reasonable price for that part of SF (around $130 per night through the hotel's web site, booked over a month in advance).", "Date": "April 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eastbourne, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "mrfd1979", "ReviewID": "UR61142424", "Content": "Nice hotel, in good location for exploring SF, right by Union Square, ideal for Trams, Cable Car, Buses, Muni and Bart (at Powell Street).

The rooms are pleasant, clean and although you may hear some street noise (ask for earplugs at the front desk, just in case), I have NEVER been bothered by noise from the hallway, adjoining rooms, etc. This hotel seems to attract a respectful clientele. Hint: For your morning coffee, go down to the corner Borders bookstore and visit their 2nd floor coffee shop. Grab a seat by the window, which directly overlooks Union Square, and enjoy people-watching at its finest!", "Date": "June 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oahu, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cKensington Park Hotel - Fit for Royalty\u201d", "Author": "skycastles808", "ReviewID": "UR30166206", "Content": "Everyone knows that traveling can be expensive. On tight budgets, oftentimes the first place you cut is your hotel quality because all you really need is a place to lay your head at night. However, this can be one of the most important parts of your trip. Who wants to share their bed with bedbugs or mites after a long day of sightseeing? That can truly ruin a good time, don'tcha think? My experience at Kensington Park Hotel in San Francisco has been wonderful. It is one of the Personality Hotels in SF and is located at 450 Post Street, right in the heart of Union Square. I stayed there in November 2008 for a couple of nights and again on my recent weeklong adventure from May 5-11, 2009. Why'd I go back? First off, the price was right. Obviously, from looking at its website, Kensington Park can be a bit high for most budgets. However, remember that you're in SF and that everything is pretty expensive. I got a great deal for air and hotel from Honolulu so I booked it right away. There were other air/hotel deals out there (believe me, I combed all the usual sites and then some), but when Kensington popped up within my budget, I jumped at the chance to stay there again. What I learned last fall is that their beds are truly heavenly, especially after a day of walking up and down hills or in and out of stores. I have never slept on a bed better than this one, and this includes my own bed at home. I don't even know how to describe it to you. It's just the right firmness and softness to ease your aching body to sleep every night. You melt into the comforter and are engulfed by softness. Another good quality about this hotel is that the staff is very accommodating. My flight arrived at 5:55 a.m. and by the time I got to the city it was around 7:15 a.m. Despite this ungodly hour, the staff allowed me and my BFF to check in way ahead of schedule. (When we called to double check that they had our reservations, we put in a request for early check-in but they said they couldn't guarantee anything.) I can only imagine that either we looked pretty had-it from the red-eye flight out of Honolulu or that the staff was very, very accommodating. I like to believe the latter but cannot be sure. The room we were given (#4 on the fifth floor) was a bit smaller than the one we received on our last trip. However, this could also be because we were only two people and last fall we had three. Even though the room and bathroom were smaller than before, they were still very satisfactory. Everything was clean, which was a definite plus. There was no mold, mildew or hair in the bathroom. The beds were made and everything seemed to be in order. For a peek at the rooms, check out their website. Yes, those are probably professionally done pictures and no doubt are enhanced with a little help from Photoshop. But, trust me. That's exactly what the rooms look like, if not just a tad less bright and vibrant. Still, the beds and rooms definitely live up to the PR/marketing hype of the website. Another good thing about the staff is that they're very friendly. I hate to admit it, but for the life of me I cannot remember the name of the guy at the front desk. There were actually three different people at the front desk at different times of the day and night. However, the night shift/early morning guy definitely stood out. He's the guy who checked us in (this time and last time if I remember right). Every time he saw us, he'd greet us with a big smile and address us by our names. Yeah, he actually remembered our names! Amazing when the hotel seemed to be almost fully booked. This kind of customer service is a sign that Kensington Park is really going the extra mile for its guests. If you're not convinced by now to try this hotel on your next SF visit, let me add that it's only a skip away from all the shops at Union Square, steps away from the Muni (cable car and buses) and just a couple of blocks up from BART. The location is hot, hot, hot. So definitely try Kensington Park Hotel because it's fit for royalty. -------------------------------- Check out: http://skycastles808.blogspot.com/ http://movieaddictsclub.blogspot.com/", "Date": "May 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Service": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cNewly Renovated and pet-friendly\u201d", "Author": "ginnyblueeyes", "ReviewID": "UR29927448", "Content": "When I went the rooms had just been renovated and every detail was immaculate.

When we got back that evening there was a bottle of red wine with two wine glasses in our room with a note congratulating us on our marriage. There are love seats in the elevators. Enough said. We were on the 12 (top) floor in room 96, a queen room with a view. We could hear traffic, but we didn't mind it at all. It reminded us we were in a bustling living city, but it wasn't nearly so loud as to wake us or have us raise our voices to talk over it. Overall, this was an amazing start to our honeymoon and i was bummed that we stayed somewhere else the last half of our trip. I would DEFINITELY stay here again. Great honeymoon hotel, especially room 96!", "Date": "June 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "City Gal", "Title": "\u201cNeeds a bit of tweaking\u201d", "Author": "foodiefromupnorth", "ReviewID": "UR16363932", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for 6 nights, so I think I have a pretty good idea of whether it's a good hotel or not. I will break it down into pros and cons, since there are quite a few of each: Pros: great location for catching buses, streetcars and cable cars; great location for late night dining; the beds were super comfortable; they had the room ready for us when we checked in at 9 a.m. Cons: the woman on the phone told me there was no way that they would have the room ready that early and was quite rude. Housekeeping would call us to ask if we wanted our room cleaned, even if we had a \"do not disturb\" sign on the door - what if we were taking a nap? It was because housekeeping leaves at 4 everyday so you can't get anything after that time. There was a pink stain on my comforter when we got there. We used the same sheets for 4 nights, then I left the \"please wash these sheets\" sign on the bed so they would change the sheets (clean them). The pink stain was still there when we got home and our sheets had been \"cleaned\", which means they don't change the sheets when you are there or in between guests. This, to me, was a very, very big CON. Gross! The room was really noisy because the hotel is old, so you could hear other guests taking showers, etc. They claim they will have tea and coffee in the morning, but they never had hot water for tea. There is no minibar so you can never take food back to your hotel to put in a fridge. Our toilet didn't flush right (it kept flushing for about 20 minutes). All in all, if this hotel was $70 a night, I would be raving, but for over $200, it's absolutely insane. We even had a \"Royal Court\" room, which is more expensive, because they give you one-dollar slippers and a busted up coffee machine.

It was adequate in size, considering we used it primarily for sleeping. The closet was large and there were plenty of other places to store our things. The bath was large for one, and two could share it without much problem. The main room had two other mirrors as alternatives for doing hair and makeup. A few nice, unexpected features were a refrig, a magnifying makeup mirror, flat screen tv on the wall, and a lamp with a plug in its base. We were told there is a/c; if there is, couldn't find it.

Receptions staff was great. The lobby hearkens to early 20th century Bavarian hotels. Very nice. Daily tea available for guests in the afternoons. Room was great. No AC, but in the bay, you'll only need it in the summer. The room looked similar to the pictures on their website and spacious because the flat screen tv was wall mounted and no furniture other than the desk and an extra chair were present. Beds were a bit old but still comfortable. The bathroom was very clean There is good complimentary coffee and tea in the mornings, but you just have to be willing to go to the 9th floor to get it. All in all, you can't go wrong with the Kensington park. Location is amazing. It's a 5 minute walk from the Powell Bart station and is next to the Powell cable car line, and the closest stop is literally fifty paces up powell. It is really in Union Square and close to the major shopping. It is only a 10 minute walk to China town. The #30 bus that goes to the Wharf/Ghiradelli square area as well as the Palace of fine arts is on stockton which is the next street after powell, and the closest bus stop is only a few hundred yards down union and up stockton. There is a Walgreens on the same block as the hotel, right around the corner if you need basic goods and snacks. You might spring for a disposable cooler and some ice (the ice machines are only on floors 9 and 12). There is also a Borders a few steps away in case you need some Seattle's best coffee or a guidebook. Caveats: -no bathroom in the lobby -no AC -ice not convenient, and no ice bucket liners Despite that, I definitely recommend the hotel.", "Date": "April 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern VA", "Title": "\u201cGood value for location\u201d", "Author": "cochineal", "ReviewID": "UR7291690", "Content": "I stayed here on a business trip and was happy to find a centrally-located hotel in San Francisco at a reasonable rate.

The staff was all friendly and helpful. On the downside, the cable TV was extremely basic and the window drapes completely blocked the heater when closed, so I was chilly at night. Also, the internet access is complicated- you have to get a key from the front desk for a 5th-floor business center.

The friendliness and warmth of the staff is half the reason why we chose the Kensington; the rest, of course, was the beauty and charm of the Royal Court Suite and the Sherwood Room. The Suite was enormous, lush, richly appointed, and extremely clean. It comfortably fit all 18 of our guests after dinner, and we loved that it had a huge sitting room, dining table, and 2 large bathrooms, both with shower/bath combos. We appreciated that the bedroom area had its own entrances/exits-- from the main entrance, you can enter either the bedroom or the sitting room area, and you can close off the bedroom from the sitting room as well. We also liked the kitchenette, although the mini-fridge wasn't that useful for keeping food/beverage items cold enough. The room was mainly quiet, except in the early mornings, when the garbage trucks (12 floors below us, but we still heard them quite clearly!) emptied dumpsters from nearby restaurants. The Sherwood Room is an intimate meeting space on the Mezzanine that we used for our wedding ceremony. It was perfect! The sales manager, who said we were the first to use the room for a wedding since she'd been around, gave us helpful suggestions and support preparing for decorations, room set-up, ceremony timing, etc. The whole event went off without a hitch. We couldn't have asked for a better site for our small wedding ceremony, and our friends were all very impressed by the gorgeous room and the helpful staff. As I said, the front desk staff were amazing-- always friendly, helpful, going out of their way to assist us with our guests and our wedding ceremony. The hotel was in close walking distance of a huge variety of restaurants, bars, shopping, theaters, and other entertainment (Ruby Skye!), as well as other hotels.

Bob, the concierge was very helpful. There are quite a few nice bars and restaurants in walking distance. Check out Lefty O'Doule's on Geary St. (on the other side of the St. Francis Hotel),a nice Irish piano bar/pub that is very casual and super fun as you can gather around the piano and sing a long. The Cosmopolitan restaurant has great food and some of the best Cosmo's, but better than that, see Sam at the bar for a Huckleberry martini...outstanding. For breakfast the Mason St. restaurant on Mason south of Post St. a block or so, or any one of the Lori's diners. Don't waste your time waiting in line for Dottie's True Blue cafe...not worth it. Your best bet for a tour is with Joe at [---]. He was WONDERFUL We took a 6 hr. wine tour. On Joe's recommendation we stopped at Robledo's winery and it made our whole day--good wine, excellent experience.

The coffee/fruit juice station on each floor is a lovely treat as is the sherry we received in the afternoon as an amenity. The hotel has charm, warmth and is a comfortable place to stay.

We checked out the hotel for one night and returned for another three night stay, and they were kind enough to allocate the same room, which made it seem a bit like home.

This relatively small hotel (70-80 rooms, I believe) was everything that my girlfriend and I hoped for. It is in a very convenient location (1/2 block from Union Square), and our room was clean, comfortable and well-appointed. We arrived on a Saturday morning, having taken BART from the San Francisco Airport to the Powell Street station. This was about a 4-5 block walk from the hotel, but as we had not packed too heavily, this was no problem. We got to the hotel around 11 a.m., expecting to simply check our bags for a few hours until our room would be ready. Imagine our pleasure when the desk clerk informed me our room was already cleaned and available. Our room was on the 10th floor of this 12-story hotel, which only has guest rooms on floors 6-12. I had read that rooms on the front of the hotel (Post St.) side tended to be too noisy, but we did not find this a problem. Yes, we did have a street musician down on the corner below us each evening, but they seemed to quit by 10-11 p.m., which was plenty early enough for us. Plus, they were all quite good! We were blessed with wonderful San Francisco weather. Days were in the high 70s and nights in the low 60s. Really could not have asked for any better. I had done a lot of research ahead of time, so had a pretty good idea of where we wanted to go while we were there and how to get there, but the staff at the front desk were always very eager to answer any questions and help with any request I had. Very friendly and responsive. Being a small hotel, they do not have on-site housekeeping or food service. The housekeeping was never an issue, as rooms were cleaned by the staff that comes in each day, and any needs we had after hours were quickly handled by the bell staff or desk staff. And, with so many fantastic restaurants in SF, we certainly didn't come there with the intention of eating room service meals. The hotel has an arrangement with a Cafe a few doors down for continental breakfast service. You get a voucher at the front desk and go down the street for tea or coffee, muffin or danish. We didn't expect much from this service, and we didn't get much, either. Not a very impressive selection or service at this Cafe. The hotel's 2nd and 3rd floors house the Post St. Theatre, a quaint little theatre with not a bad seat in the house. We saw \"The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee,\" a play I was not familiar with ahead of time, but highly entertaining. Good music, great performances by the characters, and just a very fun, cute show. We got tickets the morning of the show at the TIX booth on Union square for less than $30 each. Well worth it, but hurry, it closes in early September. I would love to see another show in this theatre, and if you're staying in the hotel, you certainly can't beat the ease of the drive home after the show. The hotel is in a great location. Having been to San Francisco a few times, I really enjoy staying around Union Square better than any other location. With the 3-day passports we got for public transportation, we could take any of the cable cars, streetcars, buses or subway trains for no additional cost. Best $18 I ever spent in SF, and we felt we could get anywhere we wanted to within the city by starting within steps of our hotel. With all the great shopping, eating and people-watching we love to do in the Union Square area, this hotel was a great choice for us.", "Date": "August 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cSurprised!\u201d", "Author": "BigJHD", "ReviewID": "UR5540120", "Content": "I stay in San Francisco for business quite often but usually at one of the Hyatt's or Hiltons.
