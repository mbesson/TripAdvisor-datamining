Had much better perks with other chains within the group ie. holiday inn and crowne plaza etc. I thought being an actual intercontinental hotel the benefits would be rewarded more there from loyalty. So no free breakfast- a big surprise.But a free film choice was given. you HAD to use valet parking. Although they were friendly most people are there as tourists and want the freedom and flexibility to get in their car when they want and go out and about in la. this wasnt possible with valet you have to go down with ticket get them to go and fetvh the car wait while that happens really frustrating. Also you had to pay $36ish for this. When we didnt even want to use it. As a another couple of reviewers have written, I also have to comment the room stunk, it was very bad other reviewers have described as wet dog it was a old musty vile smell in the lounge area of the suite. Having said this I will be fair - the bedroom was fine and so we didnt ask to move rooms. The furniture looks like it has had better days, the settee needed to go in the tip it was a faded ornage brown colour which was once clearly a dark brown settee. carpet was old too. however as i say in the title the things that genuinely matter on a stay in a hotel were good.. bed- was extremely comfortable and luxurious clean new sheets as you appreciate a good nights sleep when travelling. Products were high quality and good brand although tiny bottles and 1 bottle per 2 so not enough. They were happy to provide more when i requested. breakfast was wonderful- really impressed with it. Although pricey it was the best I had had all through my trip and i had just come from staying at the encore wynn - las vegas amongst many other 5* high end hotels. It was delicious and really enjoyed. the guest service was also very good and i was impressed that i was called after i requested more toiletteries to make sure someone had brought them. Overall it was fine to stay the night with a good nights sleep and lovely breakfast for either a business traveller or on holiday. The room did smell very bad in the lounge which is off putting and valet forced upon you was really annoying. they could do with just having a small carpark for guests wanting to use that I would not want to stay for more than 1 night though. I would not stay again purely as I was not happy with the lack of reward/benefits for being a top member of their loyalty programme. Was really disappointed with this.

Although this hotel is just a bit out of the main area it feels a little isolated. It is surrounded by office buildings and apartments and really not an area a tourist would want to be in, as it's far from the main shopping area of Century City. The hotel looks like an Eastern Europe, Soviet built block. It has no charm or style from the outside. It almost has a bunker like feel to it. The lobby is spacious and had some color with a large table of beautiful flowers, but overall the lobby and public areas feel a bit cold. The service was efficient, but not overly friendly. It was by no means rude, just very business like and did feel welcoming in anyway. The parking fee is $36.30 per day, which I found outrageous. We stayed for 3 days and our parking cost was $100.00. The hotel is so out of main stream of Century City it was kind of an insult to pay such a big parking fee. I found the halls of the hotel very odd. It was like a maze to get to our room. We had so many twists and turns it was easy to get lost inside the hotel. Our room was fine. It was a little dated. It did not have much flair. It was brown and beige and not interesting. We did have a nice view of Westwood from our balcony. We did eat in the hotel restaurant one night and the menu is very limited and has an odd selection of food items.

They do nearly everything right from opening your door to giving rides in the property limo if it is not in use. It does not have a porte cochere at the entrance. I know this is LA but I found this strange. Only noticed because it was raining when I arrived. Of course they don't need one since the valet immediately came out with umbrella in hand ready to fend off any of the unusual bits of water falling from the sky. I see a few negative comments on the rooms. I must have been given a renovated room as the descriptions don't match what I found. I would never pay five fifty for the room but at one thirty on hotwire, it is a serious bargain. I was a bit uncomfortable mixing with the predominantly vainglorious clientele. I felt like I need to have a jacket just to go to the pool. I am sure I was uncomfortable simply being outclassed. Speaking of the pool. this is a very nice outdoor area with cabanas and a large pool suitable for short laps. You will find everything you need here in the well-appointed/maintained rooms including excellent robes. Because this hotel seemed to serve wealthy clientele you can expect everything to cost a fortune from the internet to the parking. the restaurant and bar menu is good and not too highly priced however the dishes seem to be all tapas; but you can't tell that form the descriptions. You only know that when the miniature portion arrives. Eventually I became so hungry after the third day working from the food deficit that I asked the restaurant waiter if they could serve a larger portion, which he happily did. The bar is hit or miss depending on the bartender on duty. If you see a young guy there, expect to wait a bit and explain simple terms like what \"neat\" means or put up with ice in your whiskey. The business center will do anything form you; again, it will cost you. Property is first class, but you so must you be or you will feel uncomfortable. They can and will do anything to help you, but it will cost you. Do not pay rack rate. You can Hotwire this hotel for one hundred thirty at times. If you don't use Hotwire you should check it out - they give you satisfaction ratings which make it better, (athough a bit higher priced), than priceline.

If I were to stay there again, I'd be a little more active about making sure they clean all they are supposed to. The gym is pretty nice, but the women's locker room could use an upgrade - I was unable to use the steam room or sauna b/c it didnt get warm enough and the attendant said both rooms were already on thier highest setting. I've heard very good things about the spa treatments, but skip the steam/sauna. The pool is also nice, but nothing interesting. It was a huge help to have the car service that drops you up to 1.5 miles from the hotel -- this gets you to the Westfield Mall - which has a very nice selection of shops. It was a nice answer to constantly taking your car our of valet -- which also can get pricey w/constant tipping. I would say the rooms are a bit dated, but perfectly nice.

I have probably stayed at this hotel 30 times over the past 7 years or so. THis hotel was formerly a Park Hyatt, and has changed very little since the conversion to Intercontinental a few years ago. The rooms are comfortable and very clean. Beds are awesome. The decor is a bit dated though, being much the same as when then i first stayed here many years ago. There seems to be a clash of styles between the VERY traditional feel of the hotel rooms and suites....and the more contemporary decor updates (cheap) that were added to the lobby and exterior a couple years ago. Leaves me wondering what this hotel is trying to be??? LED wall washers behind the front desk change the color of the back wall like a \"W\" property of similar. Doesnt fit with the rest of the hotel. Other visual clashes make less sense. Intercontinental usually has a more seamless design...... Pool has a nice, large deck...although again could use a bit of updating. Seems a bit 80's, as does the gym. Again, everything is clean....works well... but it is dated. Restaurant was fine for breakfast....great. Thats the only thing i tried there, as there are SO many wonderful dining options outside. The location is great, almost residential. Just south of Century City on Avenue of the Stars...the Mall is a short walk on a nice day. Great proximity to Beverly Hills and all Highways. Quiet. I was not so impressed with the Concierge, as he seemed a bit rushed, and gruff. The hotel has a car that will take you anywhere in close proximity of the hotel, and i inquired yesterday morning to use the car to head to Beverly Hills. I called downstairs to ask the Concierge about using the car at 9:30 yesterday morning. I was told \"Car Service begins at 10:00\". OK....i proceeded to ask how i reserve the car: \"Car Service starts at 10:00\" and is 'first come first serve\". Where do i meet, or inquire\" \"Car service starts at 10:00....in the lobby\". OK, i got it. He was short, gruff....and i wanted to shout \" I got (expletive omitted)...the car service starts at 10:00, I'm not stupid.\" I bit my tongue not to rip his head off verbally. I really was not impressed with the concierge then, or later when i when to get the car. Again, he probably had a tough morning.....we all do.

I ask him to contact Steve Choe, the GM, which he refused, again I insisted again he refused, eventually I had to return to my room, and EMail the GM for him to contact me.

The spa belongs to an outside company, so not under his control< the A/C is an ongoing problem>>>> but to me my time is too precious and I would never stay at this hotel again, and it is all down to the Staff's attitude and lack of direction and training, because as I mentioned everything is in place at this hotel. To me the first place to start, Is the GM or a suitable number 2 should be at this hotel at all times at least until all the issues that they already know about are rectified, but seems it was the holidays and everyone was off !! and the people on duty, just have no idea in running a hotel of this standard, and that is just unacceptable!!!!!!!!", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saltsjo-Duvnas, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cGreat location good service\u201d", "Author": "saltsjoduvnas", "ReviewID": "UR122569578", "Content": "We stayed 3 nights at The InterContinental Century City over new years eve 2011-2012 and we are super satisfied with everything.

When we pulled up to the hotel it looked as if it was in the middle of no-where with nothing to do although we had read reviews that it was right next to rodeo drive (not true) and fox studios (true- right next door). The hotel lobby was lovely and the outside areas too and i would give them a 5star rating. However, when we went to check in they said our room wasn't ready and we would need to wait half an hour although half an hour turned into an hour and a half which my friend and i weren't happy with. To make matters worse we were told we would need to pay a deposit? We said we had already paid for everything and the manager then said it's just for them and they'll give us it back when we check out so we thought that's fine until the woman said 500 dollars between us!!! We were shocked as previous to los angeles we had been in Las Vegas and had budgeted our money for both trips as we needed to take into consideration food as well as day trips etc! We sat outside annoyed as we had lost out on 250 dollars each but i asked to speak to the manager and got us 100 dollars each back and the manager explained that it was their hotel policy (something that our travel agent hadn't warned us. about)! The manager also explained that it is usually only 100 dollars but didn't explain why she was charging us 150 more and at first 250 but my friend said because we were 2 young girls and that will probably be the reason why! We are 24 years of age so i would warn people in their mid 20s to budget for this as well if making a trip to La and staying at this hotel. When we got to our hotel room my friend said wasn't a five star room and it was not, i would grade the rooms about a 3 star on decor etc. However the rooms were cleaned and the beds made every day with fresh towels left out. We ate in the hotel quite a lot and i would recommend the spaghetti bolognese. The waiters and waitresses were lovely and catered to your every need. It wasn't expensive either for a hotel that has been awarded 5 stars, we were 70 dollars for 2 spaghetti bolognese and 2 ice-creams plus a coke each. When we ordered 2 spaghetti bolognese without dessert or drinks to the room it was 90 dollars as you need to pay vat, a service charge and something else. We felt as if some of the hotel staff looked down on us probably as they expect famous faces or extremley rich people staying in their hotel although back home we come from privleged backgrounds so it wasn't nice of them to make us feel like that. Not once did the bar staff or restaurant staff make us feel like that though. We had booked to do the grand tour of La with Vip tours which i would totally recommend! They pick you up from your hotel and bring you back at night. The tour consists of visiting the main attractions of Los angeles so get your cameras ready as there are lots of photo opportunities! We done Universal the next day and that was great too! However, we weren't too impressed with Disney as there wasn't much to do. We also went to Santa Monica beach which was great, nice food and shops! The Ferris wheel situated on the beach also provides you with good photo ops!! On our arrival we thought the hotel wasn't near anything, however it is actually only a ten minute walk from a shopping centre called Westfield which has various shops and restuarants plus a cinema. Shops include Macys, Bloomingdales, Zara, H&M, Victorias secret, Juicy...! There is also places to eat that would cater for all budgets. There is a big grocery store on the ground floor as well which is open to 11pm and opens around 10am. There is also a bus stop when you walk out of the hotel and turn onto the main road where entrance to fox studios is and for a dollar bus (big blue bus) takes you to Santa Monica beach. The chauffeur service was good but sometimes there was a queue to use the service but there are taxis outside so if you don't feel like walking to the mall it's only 5 dollars in a taxi which you would give to the chauffeur anyway. The chauffeur service finishes at 9pm weekdays, not sure about a Saturday and the Sunday we were there he finished at 5.30pm. On a whole we felt welcome by some staff, dining in the restaurant was reasonable, the rooms were clean, the hotel was near transport to go to different places and there was a mall 10mins away. I wouldn't rate this to my friends or to families but to older couples or groups of older friends looking to get away for a quiet and relaxing holiday. Next time i would stay in Santa Monica as the location is great and it is so central to everything.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Providence, Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cElegant hotel\u201d", "Author": "81FrequentT81", "ReviewID": "UR120813515", "Content": "I stayed here one night on business.

They don\u2019t listen, they are not polite, they ignore you and are only concerned with payments. They actually spend more time with one\u2019s credit card than with the hotel guest him/herself. I was just appalled by their attitude. As far as the hotel is concerned, its location is far from the important tourist attractions, but the hotel offers a free limousine service to/from Rodeo Drive. However, close by, there is a shopping centre and not far from the hotel you have Beverly Hills. The lobby is large and beautifully decorated with fresh flowers. Sometimes it gets busy due to conferences/meetings/events and it may seem that the quietness and privacy of the hotel is gone. There is also a pool and the hotel offers several eating areas. The hotel also has what appears to be a small inner court, which is worth a visit. The concierge desk is very helpful, but be aware of other guests, because some of them have never heard of something called queuing. I opted for a room with sundeck, which left me with a massive bedroom/sitting area, an enormous bathroom, double balcony, a very quiet corner of the hotel and most importantly, I had the best LA view from my 11th floor, overlooking not only Beverly Hills, but also Downtown LA and the famous Hollywood sign.

Our neighbor had left his TV on and gone out around midnight. We complained and security knocked on the door and eventually went in and turned the TV off. Security said to their suprise the TV wasn't on that loud, so I assume it was because the TV was near the adjoining door. We had fallen asleep until our neighbor returned and turned the TV back on. I didn't want to bother the neighbor since I didn't think he was doing anything unreasonable, so I went down to talk to the front desk and they gave us a suite on one of the top floors with a large roof top deck area for sunning.

As other reviewers have noted, you can be in Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, or downtown LA in a matter of minutes. My room was in the front of the hotel and the \"Hollywood\" sign was directly in our viewing area. Sweet! Hotel is nicely maintained with lots of fresh flowers in the lobby. There are several outdoor seating areas, featuring heat lamps or fire pits - nice for cool CA evenings. Room was nice, with a comfortable bed and linens. Flat screen TV and the outrageously priced mini bar (stay away!) Bathroom was large and well-appointed. Two fluffy robes were provided. I'd say that it is about time for a freshening up, though, for the whole place, as the carpet is looking a bit dated and several areas would have benefitted from a new coat of paint. It is not an inexpensive stay, and anything you order from any of the restaurants or bars will not be, either. It is LA, though, so just be aware. Service: Everyone we encountered was polite, professional, and very helpful. All seemed genuinely interested in making my stay as positive as possible. Parking: $33.00 - ouch - and you need to specify that you want in and out privileges. As there are few places to walk, you'll need a vehicle. Restaurant: We didn't dine or use room service, but there are restaurants on site. Sunday was busy, although there was no one in any of the dining areas on Saturday night. Facilities: There is a well-equipped 24-hour fitness center, which is free to guests, as is the outdoor pool. There is also a spa, with services for purchase. Area attractions: Although I am not sure which, a trolley tour stops right outside on almost an hourly basis. There is an outdoor mall about 5 blocks away, featuring all the usual suspects (Banana Republic, Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom\u2019s, Bloomies, etc) as well as a food court and 4 sit-down restaurants. LA has an awesome farmer's market/shopping area at Third Street & Rexford. You can eat just about any cuisine your heart - or stomach - desires, from Spanish to Mexican to French to Cajun to....you get the drift. Walk around, take in all the choices, then decide. There are several small bands that play on Saturday night, and the whole thing becomes very festive. Right behind it is an outdoor mall, featuring most of the places named at the mall earlier..

The male checking me out told me that platinum members don't get upgrades that is only for Ambassador Members. Clearly their front desk staff does not know membership levels which could explain why i did not get any. He said that there was no paper mentioned in my profile so he added one for me. Nice pool, steam room locker room and breakfast. The Concierge staff need to be a little more down to earth as they were snooty despite the fact that they are actaully working there and not guest. You do want an upscale feel but there is a thing called being friendly. The hotel decor is dated and showing age. Still very clean but the hallway carpet shows wear and is noticable.

The hotel is really well done and peaceful. The new pool was amazing since it has a non-slip bottom and an infinity pool type feel. We were there attending a wedding but made a little staycation out of it. Our corner room was wonderful and plan on requesting it again next time. The bathroom needs a bit of updating but it was a nice size with a separate tub. Floor to ceiling windows and a balcony. WOW. Also, the room service food was so yummy! We stayed at another hotel for the last leg of our trip as it was closer to another event and let me tell you the room service was so yucky after having the food at the intercontinental hotel. The only negative thing and what I would make a note of is the \"Valet Only: policy and the $36 per day/overnight parking rate.

I advised the Duty Manager that Royal Ambassador members are guaranteed an 8am check in and a 4pm late checkout. If the booked room type is not available then another room type must be made available. This is the Royal Ambassador guarantee. After checking in I printed out the Abmassador Membership terms and conditions and presented it to the Duty Manager. After apologizing for making us wait for over 3 1/2 hours he conceeded that I was correct and included the buffett breakfast for us. I have noted that many hotels in the IC group have this unwritten rule that they will not allow anyone to check in prior to 12noon even if there is a room available. Events as indicated above only happen because of poor staff training. Housekeeping is open from 8am and during our wait for room availability we witnessed over 15 groups checking out and over 8 interviews for job applications! With 10% unemployment in the USA and 45 million people reliant on food stamps I would think that you could have better management suitably employed. There is no check in counter for Priority Club or Ambassador members and there is no mention of these two programmes at the front reception area. SECURITY: Anyone can walk into the hotel lobby and take the lift to any floor without the use of a key card - there is no security. In room safes are free standing and not attached to anything - you could place one in any suitcase and walk out of the building with it. I mentioned this to the front office and they put me through to security and they indicated to me they did not think it was a problem as the hotel was in a safe area. So, the mentality is that you wait for an incident to happen and then you address the problem Like closing the gate after the horse has escaped! CLUB FLOOR: None available which is very disappointing for an IC Hotel. POSITION: Located in a nice area suitable for walking or jogging. RESTAURANTS AND SHOPPING: Westfield Mall is a 15 minute walk from the hotel and Rodeo Drive is about a 30 minute walk from the hotel. Would recommend BJ\u2019s at Westfield for a nice meal at great prices and a good menu choice. The hotel has a complimentary drop off and pick up service within a 5 mile radius from the hotel. TRANSPORT: Taxi fare from LAX airport to the hotel is approx. US$45. FOOD: Buffett breakfast is Approx US$31 per person inclusive of tax plus an 18% gratuity which is added to the bill. However, the hot section (which has exactly the same choice each day) only includes chip potatoes, bacon and scrambled eggs which are set hard (like concrete) in the heated tray. This would be the worst buffett breakfast I have ever had at any Intercontinental hotel ever. (As indicated above complimentary breakfast was included for us - and I think it should be at US$375 per night). OVERVIEW: Probably the best area to stay in LA would be Santa Monica which is on the beach and has many shops and restaurants in the area. If your first stop is at the Pier area then you will be very disappointed as you must go back along the main restaurant shopping area to appreciate Santa Monica. The Hop on Hop off LA bus stops at the pier so you can use this facility to go to all the main tourist areas in LA. Checked out the Holiday Inn in this area but would not recommend it as it is just like a pimple on a pumpkin and is bounded on three sides by very busy noisy streets. Also has very small rooms. They also never answer any e-mail requests for information. The Hop On Hop Off bus also stops directly outside the Intercontinental Hotel, however, it goes via Sana Monica and takes over an hour to get to the Hollywood Walk of Fame area which is the stop where you need to change buses to go to the other 3 loopes included in the ticket price.", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cWILL NEVER BE BACK!\u201d", "Author": "JerryP84", "ReviewID": "UR117478169", "Content": "Arriving out of the car to the front desk the hotel appeared to be very beautiful.

Killed the bug. left it in the toliet. Called front desk and they sent security do inspect? Security? I have no understanding as to why security would come. When he came he said I shouldn't have killed it , but instead kept it confined to that security could take it. Bizarre. No apologies or offer to change the room Day 2. - Air Conditioning goes out. Called front desk and they sent an engineer to fix air conditioning. 1 hr later the air conditioning was fixed. Again no apologies from the front desk manager Blanca. Day 3- Ray-Ban Sunglass Stolen out of Room. Spoke to Blanca again and she told me that I should ask the other person in the room or a friend from another room if they had taken them. I was so annoyed, did she not think that I would ask my friends if they had taken them before calling her to report them missing. Filled out a claim form and have yet to receive contact from them. Received a phone call from Blanca saying that nobody had entered my room according to the security logs that monitor my room's electronic key identifier. Now I don't want to accuse housekeeping of taking them, but I vividly remember putting my glasses on next to the tv after opting to use a different pair of sunglasses for the day. Day 4- My key card would not open the door. I went up and down to the lobby 4 times to get a new key. Blanca the manager said to me, \" I dont know what your issue is all you have to do is slide the key in the door and it will open\". Well Blanca i'm not a 5 year old I know how keys work. After trying the fourth time they had an engineer come up and took 2 hours to reprogram and replace the electronic card access panel from the door. At this point I was fed up. I called Blanca and told her this was unacceptable and that I demand an apology and a credit to be compensated for all the issues I had. Blanca very unpleasantly offered to credit our room free internet for the day. What a joke. I told her that I don't need internet access that I didn't bring my laptop and that I have a phone with internet service. She then told me that even if i use my phone that I would have to pay for internet access on the phone. This lady is crazy. After going back and forth for 10 minutes she offered me breakfast for one person. Mind you that 2 people are staying in my room. I will never be back to this place. The service was horrible. We paid a lot of money to be stay at this hotel. Next time I visit L.A.

Indeed, it was this property which set the standard by which I have come to judge other hotels. In 2007, I booked a suite for a business trip because at the time I had Gold status with the Six Continents loyalty program (now it's Priority Club). When I arrived for check in, I requested and was given an upgrade to a large suite for an additional $100 per night. The additional cost was well worth it. Upon arrival, I also took special care to tip the valet and bellman well - which I highly recommend if you ever wish to return to a hotel. They took extra care to learn my name and where I was from. Throughout the entire trip there was not one time I entered the hotel without having someone greet me by name. The 1,200 Sq.ft. Luxury Suite I was given was like an apartment, complete with views of the Hollywood sign. Each time I drove in to valet my car, the attendants literally ran to the vehicle to greet me and open the door. I completed my business and was so impressed with the hotel and service that I decided to return several months later with my wife and our dog (who is a certified therapy dog). My subsequent visits all lived up to my high expectations and my wife loves both the service, the location and the luxuriously spacious rooms. Indeed, as a direct result of my multiple stays at this single property, I reached Platinum status with IHG and later opted in to pay for the Ambassador service (something I highly recommend). We alos frequently order breakfast in the room and the food is fantastic. They have the BEST coffee. I continue to frequent the property and have experienced only one minor hiccup with the Front Desk staff - who surprisingly were less familiar with who I was than the bellmen, valet attendants and room service waiters. I spoke with a manager about it and the problem was immediately rectified by manager dSteve Choe Ever since, I have used this hotel as my de facto West Coast home base for all of my entertainment-related client activities. What makes this hotel great is that it has allowed me to fly my wife out for several weekends so that I can convert a long week business trip into a mini-vacation. Beverly Hills and the Westfield Century City mall are just blocks away and the hotel even offers chauffeur service to the mall and local stores upon request. If you are planning a trip to Los Angeles and are wiling to invest in becoming loyal to a property, then this is the hotel to do it at. There appears to be little turn-over with the key staff and If you take the initiative to get to know and treat them well, they will most certainly reciprocate and provide you with the type of service that only Five Diamond properties are known for offering.

There is no lobby shop, so no luck buying any incidentals you may have forgot to pack. 2. Don't try to call the operator from your room or conference room, it will just keep ringing and nobody will answer. 3.

It is about 30-40 minutes driving if there is no traffic jam. The hotel is located on the Avenue of the Stars next to the Westfield shopping mall with a lot of shops and small fast food restaurants. The hotel has a very nice exterior and big lobby. We checked in at around 11AM with Judy, she was friendly and checked us in but our room wasn\u2019t ready so we had to wait 20 minutes next to the reception. It is weird she didn\u2019t tell anything about our ambassador privileges, breakfast, our room or internet login. There is also no separate ambassador check in. Our room was on the 9th floor not far from the elevators. We were upgraded to a big suite I guess, it was not modern at all but big. It had a separate seating area with sofa, big TV and a desk. Then there was the sleeping room with a big bed and another TV. The bathroom was very big with 2 doors, one to the bed and the other one to the living room. The bathroom had a big bath, shower, toilet and 2 very nice soft bathrobes. We had also 2 terraces adjacent to our room. The room was overall very clean and in the evening we got one small bottle of water and some fruits. The beds were very good and the next day we had breakfast in the main restaurant. I booked a Red Carpet arrangement which included breakfast. We were surprised that Jairo, our waiter gave us a menu card for breakfast but e couldn\u2019t explain us what was and was not included in our room rate with breakfast. We just got the buffet. It is build out of 2 sections. One with hot food and a selection of fruits and salmon, ham , \u2026 The other part are the pastries and breads. Overall it was very small and only 1 kind of egg we could choose. They actually forgot to turn on the heat under the eggs. Every other egg we wanted was paid . The quality was very good but the selection was very small. This was a disappointment. At check out we even had to pay for breakfast taxes even when it was included in our fare !! Big disappointment We want to take a cab to the departure station of the hop on / off bus and a very very kind staff member with short hear ( I am sorry but don\u2019t remember the name ) asked if we wanted to use the free house car. Nobody told us there was one but he asked the concierge Stephen but he told : No, to far. So we wasted time but just took a cab. We asked the Concierge Stephen when we had to leave the next day for the Warner Bros studios and he told us 10.20 for tour departure at 11.00 . The head concierge booked it for us but he was nowhere to be seen during our stay. We took a cab and arrived very late at 10.59 and the lady told us we normally had to be there 30 minutes in advance also the concierge booked under my name but it was spelled not correctly. The concierge Stephen was overall not helpful nor friendly. The hotel has a big pool but we did not have time to use it. As we were Ambassador members we got free internet daily ! Otherwise it would be very expensive ! We checked out, again with Judy. Now she was less friendly and at check in I gave my VISA card to guarantee the stay. But on the IC website I booked with my Amex card. Judy forgot to delete one breakfast and even before I could check, she already debited the wrong amount. After asking and arguing she credited the amount ( 56 $ ) back on my American Express card. When I got home I saw on my bank account that Judy debited my Amex for the wrong amount but credited the difference but also charged my VISA card for the wrong amount. She so double charged me !! I couldn\u2019t believe this ! So I called the hotel and again I had Judy on the phone and she was rude and did not let me speak out? When I started a sentence she over talked me all the time and was not friendly and rude. Eventually yesterday my Visa card is credited again. Overall a good stay with mostly friendly staff except some and a good location.

Once finally in the room (and in fairness a suite upgrade due to my Platinum Priority Club status) this feeling of being underwhelmed continued. The room looked tired and a bit scuffed around the edges. Nothing was complimentary in the room including bottled water. The only thing that took my breath away was the the price of a Snickers ($5!). Service levels followed this pattern of not quite being spot-on e.g the concierge did not seem to be particularly effusive in his assistance and would often disappear from the desk for long periods. This meant I got charged $8 for a local call (to book a restaurant) because I could not locate him by phone or in person! I was also advised I would have to purchase a UK/US power converter rather than borrow one which tends to be the norm in most hotels I visit. Got the feeling the hotel was just a little bit mean. Location is pretty good, about a 10 min walk to the Westfield shopping development and 30 min on foot to Rodeo Drive etc. So in summary nothing really wrong with the hotel, just fails to impress in the way other Intercontinental properties I have visited (Paris, Istanbul, Al Khobar etc) do.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay, beautiful hotel!\u201d", "Author": "kfoley", "ReviewID": "UR113212665", "Content": "We were in LA for our niece's graduation from UCLA so we booked this hotel for it's proximity to the campus and decent rate compared to everything else in the area for that weekend. Upon stepping out of our car we felt like royalty. There were staff members everywhere ready and willing to help with whatever we needed. When checking in, the front desk attendant noticed we had our 5 year old daughter with us and upgraded us to a suite for free. She even asked if we wanted somebody to come up and make up the pull out bed for us. Our room was beautiful. A living room with a large flat screen TV, couch, chair, coffee table and desk. There was a balcony with two chairs and a small table. French doors led into the bedroom which included another flat screen TV mounted to the wall and a king bed. The bathroom was spacious with a seperate shower and tub. The room was extremely clean and smelled like a spa! After getting settled we went downstairs to the restaurant for a bite to eat. Everybody was really great with our daughter calling her princess and waiting on her hand and foot. Probably the only down side to our entire stay was the menu. It was extremely expensive and not a lot of choices. We opted for a couple of appetizers to share and our daughter had a kids pizza and our check was over $60 with no alcohol. Everything we had was very good though and the service was great. After dinner we went to the pool. The pool area was very pretty with lots of plam trees and it was very clean. There were cushioned lounge chairs with plenty of towels available. We had to pass by the gym on the way to the pool and we noticed that it looked really big for a hotel gym and it had nice equipment. The pool was heated but still didn't feel very warm on that chilly night. Our daughter didn't mind it, but we ended up sitting in the hot tub instead. A couple of final things, the hotel didn't have any kind of coffee bar or place to grab a quick breakfast or even a place to grab a soda and a snack. I didn't even see any soda machines, not even where the ice was on our floor. It had a gift shop, but everytime we walked past it was closed. There was a Starbucks a couple of blocks down and they did have a courtsey car to take you to places nearby, but that's not too convenient with a 5 year old in tow.

Every single staff memeber from the valet, front desk, bellman, room service, housekeeping, restuarant and bar staff were all friendly and happy and always asking how our stay was going. The room was very nice with windows and balcony that wrapped around. The spa was nice and the staff member were friendly and educated. I recommend getting a massage if you stay at hotel. I am a frequent spa goer and I definitely rank this massage up there.

I have stayed in many hotels in many different price points--this exceeded all expectations. I took my 20yr. old daughter for 'mother/daughter' trip to LA. We were lucky enough to upgrade to stay in a suite--better than any suite I've ever stayed in. We had a friend staying at the hotel -she had standard room which was great--I would have been perfectly fine in that room as well. We took advantage of the courtesy house car which will take you within 1 1/2 miles of the hotel--got us to area malls, restaurants and to \"window shop\" in Beverly Hills. I liked that the hotel was in Century City-kind of tucked away from everything-felt more relaxed. We enjoyed the restaurant but the menu was somewhat limited. I must admit, after running around all day we ended up eating at the hotel most nights--due to our own laziness--didn't want to venture out after a long day. If you like sushi--it looked fabulous and was enjoyed by many in the lounge area. Looked like a great place for happy hour after work...and you must try the Parmesan French Fries--to die for! The only major knock against the hotel was that you had to pay for wi-fi --for each device in room-with what we were paying-that seemed somewhat excessive. I know other chains charge for it as well and I put the same complaint on their reviews as well. I also know others had complained about the parking charges if you had a rental; I read that and opted to use the courtesy car-it was perfect for what we needed but realize that may not be the case for everyone. Honestly though, most hotels charge for parking regardless of what city you are in these days. Overall and the reason I highly recommend this hotel was the staff..they went above and beyond their jobs on a daily basis. Customer Service is my main priority and from the moment we arrived--from the Bellman, Front Desk staff, Courtesy car drivers, wait staff --all were extraordinary! Luis-the Concierge--phenominal job--made the entire experience that much better! They all made you feel at ease and no one was in the least bit snobbish--can't say that about a few places we visited in the area.

The room was a great size and I'm glad we upgraded, it had all the amenities you would expect from a hotel of this standard. I still object to paying for wireless, something which is all to common with ICH group hotels and I really think they need to stop charging for it. Cleanliness and comfort of the room were fantastic, my only criticism and I'm being picky here, is that the decor was well worn in places. Torn wall paper on low corners in the room and slightly dowdy looking curtains did mar the otherwise warm and modern feel of the room. Breakfast was excellent, expensive if you didnt have it included. Staff here were great, one chap was a little bizarre, friendly but over familiar and kept telling us about his other jobs (comedian I think he said) and his travel, and gave us his business card. This I found off putting, but as I say food was great and service matched this. Overall hotel staff were great, the concierge was amazing and helped us with restaurant bookings and activities. Again if I had a criticism it would be that the front desk staff could be a little cold, at one point I felt I had to apologise in asking for their help. The hotel itself is lovely, very nicely designed and we really did enjoy our stay here. The pool and gym area were great. It does feel a bit \"removed\" from LA due to its surroundings and you definitely need a car if you stay here but I would highly recommend this hotel. It was actually quite nice to come back to after a day in crazy LA! The quiet relaxed feel of the place helped to make us feel very comfortable and welcome. They have a car service which was brilliant and we used this to take us into Beverly Hills for dinner a couple of times. Good points, great hotel, lovely mordern decor, overall friendly staff-nothing was too much trouble. Bad points, extra costs like wireless and the extorntionate valet parking charge! BE AWARE ITS $35 A DAY!!!! You cannot park your own car and this wasn't mentioned on the ICH website, if I had known this I may not have booked as I felt paying an extra $140 plus tips everytime you needed the car was a step too far!

I recently stayed at the Century Plaza (just down the street) and can use this for a local comparison. The good: The service was beyond amazing. Every person in the hotel (the valet, the doorman, the front desk, the servers at the meeting rooms, and the bartenders) made me feel incredibly welcomed. Nothing (NOTHING) was left to chance. I arrived a bit late the first day for my meeting and the valet was extremely sensitive to this. He made sure that I knew exactly where I needed to be in the hotel (and would have walked me there if I needed help). The front desk made sure that my frequent stayer credit got to my account. Normally, this is not big deal, but since I didn't pay for the room, I was particularly impressed that they did this. The servers and bartenders at our meeting were beyond amazing. Without asking, the servers noted what I was drinking and made sure that my glasses were never empty--even making sure that whatever I wanted could be brought in from the outside bar. Small touch, but great service!! The final point was that there was some minor confusion about parking for the meeting. On two days, I asked a hotel employee to clarify small details for me. On both occasions, they immediately found a manager and immediately addressed the issue. I didn't have to ask for for special treatment--they just immediately took care of my concerns. The location of the hotel is great--easy walk to a wide variety of places to eat and drink if you don't have a car...can't imagine that you would be in LA without a car though... The bad...

So, I started driving around the neighborhood instead of paying $35 per night. There's no street parking in any direction for at least a half mile. I went down Olympic to the neighborhoods there, but overnight parking is prohibited, so I sucked it up and went to the valet. As soon as you arrive you're swarmed by 2-3 guys and you don't know if it's bad form to tip one and not the other. So, the parking added up quickly. Internet is $13.95 per day as well, so there are many extras.

The rooms are very large, and the one I was given had a huge balcony (including 2 lounge chairs and two regular chairs) with a 270-degree view of the Los Angeles skyline, as well as two flat-panel TVs. The bathroom was also large, with both a shower and a tub, and the vanity in a separate room. In general, this hotel feels a lot more exclusive and fancy than the nearby Century Plaza (Hyatt Regency), which has much more of a tour-group and convention/conference feel to it. At the same time, the IC Hotel is not quite as centrally located as the Hyatt -- it is about a 10-minute walk farther from the Westfield mall and most of the big office buildings (except for Fox Plaza), including the office that I frequent. The last time I stayed here (4 years ago), this hotel was a Park Hyatt. It seems that not much has been changed, which is actually fine. The furnishings are still holding up, although I can see that a renovation may be needed in another 4-5 years. The gym is exactly the same as it was in the Park Hyatt days (same equipment even).

A resounding silence would be more fitting. But if my review helps save someone from the royal pain in the *** of staying at this hotel, it's worth it. The only thing luxurious about this \"luxury hotel\" is the orchid display in the lobby. What a woeful place it is! On the first night, my colleague and I were given a room in which one of the mattresses had a broken spine, and for the second and third, an L-shaped room by a service elevator. Nothing like being woken up at 6 in the morning by staff shouting at one another. To make matters much, much worse, the place is run by a legion of automatons who keep saying to you, If there's anything we can do, let us know -- and yet cannot actually do even the most simple things you might ask of them. My colleague and I started attempting to predict how the hotel was going to screw up on our latest request. One of their true winners: canceling part of our room service order because someone in the kitchen decided that we were ordering too much food for one person. (We were of course trying to order for two!) And then when we checked out we discovered that -- after all of the delights of our stay -- we were not only not going to get a break on the bill, but they were, rather, going to overcharge us -- and by a huge sum. We got that sorted only to discover that they found the idea of splitting a hotel bill in two an impossible proposition! We stood at the front desk for half an hour while they attempted to sort this, and then had to leave for the airport with it still a mess. It took me -- no joke -- three weeks to get the hotel billed sorted out over the phone. It doesn't matter what you're in LA for -- business or pleasure -- you simply cannot afford the headache of staying here (and paying royally for the little that you get). In over twenty years of travel as an adult, I have never felt so thoroughly ripped off by a hotel. \"Luxury\" at this place is nothing more than a label they use in their attempt to justify extracting as much money from your wallet during the time you are unfortunate enough to find yourself housed under their roof.", "Date": "October 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wales", "Title": "\u201cSwanky, top end business hotel\u201d", "Author": "DJK42", "ReviewID": "UR47339407", "Content": "We stayed here on our first 2 nights of a 3 week trip to west coast USA.

My room was outstanding - although lacking a hair dryer. It was also very quiet. However, there were some drawbacks especially if you are a tourist. This hotel is near nothing. I had been warned but totally didn't understand it. I mean you are in the middle of the Fox backlot. There is nothing - no 7-11; no coffee shop; nothing for a long walk. Also, there is nothing in the hotel. There is allegedly a gift shop but it wasn't opened on the weekend and it only had gourmet candies. No post cards, LA shirts, sundries. Nada. There is a restaurant but it far too swanky for most people and who wants to eat there every day and night. The concierge made me feel like a country bumpkin when I asked about things to do. He suggested art museums (yes that is why I come to LA) and insisted on this tour of LA that the hotel endorsed but was something I did not want to do. The tour was more expensive and was in an enclosed bus. If I am coming to LA, I want to be out in the weather. He did give me info on the cheaper tour with the outdoorsy bus but didn't make me feel good about it. As there was nothing around, I presumed they would have a soda machine or something. But no, they had nothing but a mini bar. $7.00 for a can of soda. No complimentary water (I stayed at a luxury place last year and they offered one bottled water per day) and no snacks of any kind. Then I expect to be gouged on the room service but this was too much. A $4.00 delivery fee; a 25% mandatory gratuity (and they put a spot for additional tip) and tax. I dropped $50 for one meal... which was not that great. They do have a lovely car that guests can reserve but you are limited to Century City, which is big but has little in terms of things to do or food. Plus it is first come first serve, and well, it is a big hotel. If you are here on business, especially for Fox, it is a great place to stay.

Bathroom towels/linens were clean, and loved the separate shower and tub. Bad Things: Knowing I was 1 person, I got a room with 2 doubles. When asked to switch rooms to a King it became a lot of hassle for them. After going into 2 rooms (that apparently was only available) that smelt like smoke, I opted to stay in the 2 Double Bed room. This hotel I believe is supposed to be smoke free. Bellhops are pretty bothersome, trying to take your luggage even when you say you're fine. The pool area, although beautiful and comfortable, is in an area where you get high winds. It is therefore an area that ends up being cold, so you can't enjoy sitting outside by the pool. It's VERY chilly on a hot day. Maybe when it goes into the high 90's and above it won't be as bad. I was there during mid 80's where Santa Monica Beach was hotter. Even though I had a lot of bad things, I might stay again. I guess it depends on price. The room itself was fabulous, the front desk could have been more accommodating.

After check out she very insincerely quoted the \"I hope you enjoyed your stay at ... I hope you return soon\" etc speech - I wish I'd said something to her at the time about her attitude. I later found out she had refunded the wrong credit card despite my clear instructions as to which card I wanted money returned to - I just knew she wasn't listening to me at the time! It's a shame that the attitude of one desk clerk can sour a persons overall experience of what is fundamentally a good choice for LA.", "Date": "May 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Torquay", "Title": "\u201cFantatstic Stay in super Hotel\u201d", "Author": "andrewt3233", "ReviewID": "UR30651346", "Content": "Stayed here with our friends on the first 3 nights of our USA trip.

We checked in on the Amex package with a free upgrade. And it was a true upgrade. A junior suite!! We were traveling with our two boys, on our 6th night, so it made it nice to have our own room. The junior suite they gave us looked brand new as if it had never been used. We had a great view of the old Century City studios (now Fox). It was a nice view from the 15th floor! We had room service for breakfast and it was delicious. The boys ordered off the kids menu and the portions were huge. My husband said his breakfast was the best breakfast he remembered having in a long time. The rooms each have a Kourig coffee maker in them with Emeril's coffee which was especially good. They also had a nice coffee station located in the posh lobby (as early as 4:00am--time we had to leave for our flight) which really made it nice. The staff was very good--my only complaint was that I think that they must let their maid staff go home early because we waited a very long time to get the pull out couch made up for the boys. Bed was very comfortable but boys did not think the pull out was very comfortable at all. We dined for lunch in their hotel restaurant because we had a $100 credit. The waiter was nice and the food was very tasty---however it was overprice. We would not have normally paid $110 for lunch (which is what it came to) but we did have the credit.

After the pool, there was a note in my room saying that the power would be out the following day for 2.5 hours during a critical time for me. i was attending a red carpet event and needed to get ready during that time. the manager on duty said they could get me into a GYM to get ready- UM NO that will not work for a hollywood red carpet event. my colleagues were able to get us out of the hotel for the second night which was great. i did sleep well and was impressed with the TV selection for the night I was there. i have to agree with a previous poster about details- there is not attention to them here. Lastly- check out was a nightmare- the desk clerk was VERY rude- she said they had charged me for both nights but would reimburse me for the second night but it took a lot of persistence to get that receipt showing my reimbursement. She seemed annoyed with me when I asked for that. while the rooms were nice and the pool was great, i will not be going back to this hotel anytime soon.

Also, the bathtub was shallow -- if you like to relax in a soaking tub at the end of a busy day, this won't cut it. The towels were nice and fluffy with quality amenities. The spa was also a letdown. I walked down to see about a simple manicure. The women sitting at the desk promised me a call to confirm a time the next day. No call came....until 2:15pm the following day asking if I was running late. Huh? No-one ever called to confirm an appointment and they still tried to charge me. The room service food was good.

Even if we had booked through Hotwire, and our rental car looked like a mess after 2236 miles on the road, we were treated like king and queens when we finally arrived at the hotel. No fuss at all. The hotel is ideally located on the Avenue of the Stars, in the West LA district near Beverly Hills and Century Plaza Towers. It took us just minutes to get to Rodeo Drive and Westfield Century City Mall. LAX is located about 11 miles from the hotel. I guess it took us 30 min to get to the airport, in traffic. So all in all a very convenient location if you have a car. If you don\u2019t have one, I would stay somewhere else. Didn\u2019t really get to use any amenities at the hotel, but checked out both the pool-area and the fitness-room, which looked fabulous. No excuses if you\u2019re supposed to work-out on your trip, in other words.. The valet parking is steep, but hi \u2013 that\u2019s to be expected in LA. Wanted to check out a Nike-outlet in the area, but the concierge only knew about the Nike Store next to Wilshire Grand. Also to be expected in Beverly Hills\u2026.

I think they are trying to be something that they are not though. All staff encountered were friendly and appeared to be trying their best. Valet and doormen were superb and I do not mind paying $30.00 per night when the service is as excellent as what they provided. Not just on 1 day-- I was there for 4 days and that area was consistently superior. As others have posted-- housekeeping was inconsistent. There were 2 of us in 1 room. When we checked in, there were 3 sets of towels in the room. On day two, only two sets were left. On day 3- five sets were left. Seemed a little odd. Also, during turndown service-- one attendant would empty garbage, refresh used towels and fill ice bucket. The others we had did not do that and only turned down the bed. Room was very well appointed. New carpet and bedding. If you looked beyond the surface though the baseboards were covered with dust. One lamp had a cigarette burn. On the top of the desk lamp, someone had used the metal plate to put out a cigarette and this was never cleaned by housekeeping on the 4 days I was there. I will say that the room did not smell like smoke at all, so they obviously did a good job getting rid of the smoke smell-- just not cleaning up the ashes. If the room would have smelled of smoke on my arrival, I would have changed rooms. I had requested a synthetic filled pillow because of an alergy to feather pillows. Twice, feather pillows were delivered. The housekeeper who delivered the pillows was very sweet and she really wanted to do the right thing, but said that she did not know the difference in the pillow types. She was able to find the correct pillows. Workout facility and pool were fine. Food and beverage was of high quality and service was okay. One other weird thing did happen during the course of my stay--- the patio chairs were removed after day two and replaced with old ripped ones. I have no idea what this was all about, but I had taken pictures when I arrived, so I know that I was not imagining it. It would take a lot of training and probably a change of leadership to get this hotel near 4 or 5 star level.

We booked our stay with Hotwire and paid $219/night... it was a little expensive compared to what other reviewers paid, but we basically booked it within a month, so it was the cheapest I could find in the Beverly Hills/Century City area. I was really excited to stay here, but mostly because I haven't been on vacation for a long time. After booking with Hotwire, I called the hotel and put in a request with reservations for a nice room with a king bed and a nice view - plus, we had a flat screen TV, which was a nice touch. Fortunately for us, when we arrived, they had honored our request, which was really nice! We stayed in 1512 and had a great view since it was a corner unit. Overall, I would say that this hotel is very nice - definitely a 3 to 3.5 star hotel. The details are what brought down its rating in my book (see the end of my review for more). It's obviously more suited to the business traveler, but is centrally located near good shopping - you've got Venice Beach to the West and West Hollywood to the East. There is a free concierge car service to Rodeo Drive in the heart of Beverly Hills, which is a nice touch - however, they warn you that they won't go beyond Rodeo Drive and the hours aren't conducive to late nights. The lobby was really nice and the 24 hour exercise facility was excellent. Make sure to go to the spa and ask for a locker and you will have access to the spa's nice shower area. The locker room closes at 11 pm, but the spa closes at 9 pm. If you want to use the locker room from 9-11 pm, make sure to go to concierge and ask for a key there. A lot of reviewers are shocked at the price of room service and the items in the mini fridge, but seriously, you're staying at a 4 star hotel within 2 miles of Beverly Hills, what do you expect? I wouldn't be stupid enough to order room service or grab anything out of the fridge. Instead, head to the Century City Westfield Mall, about a mile away and go to the grocery store, Gelson's, and pick up some snacks there. Although the fridge is sealed, you can also chill your drinks using the ice basket provided. One nice touch is that they provide you with free Fiji water - we got 3 each time they cleaned the room. Note, they do a general cleaning in the morning AND a turn down service at night, so they will knock on your door before noon and probably around 8 or 9 pm. The turndown service is also really nice touch. One thing about the cleaning service: we stayed for 5 nights at the hotel and we noticed a drop off in the quality of the cleaning towards the end of our stay - for instance, not all the towels were replenished and we no longer received 3 bottles of Fiji, but only 2. Again, head to the Century City mall for most of your dining needs as it is not only a gorgeous outdoor mall, but the food is very fresh and there is a LOT of selection at the food court and other dining establishments. DETAILS: Although our guest room (1512) was impressive at first glance, there were some issues I observed that brought down my overall impression at the Intercontinental Century City. First of all, the heating and A/C unit was very loud, but functioned very well. Secondly, the price of wireless internet access was exorbitant (nearly $10/day!). A hotel of this caliber should have free wireless access, especially considering the amount of business clients at the hotel. Note: you can go to the business center (not the greatest at all) and also pay for internet access), but you can also go to a little cubby near the check in desk... there is a tiny claustrophobic space where they have a free internet terminal. Sometimes people stand in a line waiting to use it, so just be aware of that. Thirdly, there were no in-room mirrors (they were only in the bathroom), so it was inconvenient getting dressed before we left our room. Fourthly, the cost of mandatory valet parking was ridiculous. Although I understand that the custom in LA is pay parking (a lot of places, such as the Westfield Mall offer the first 1.5 to 3 hours free), $30 a day is quite high - HOWEVER, the valet service was excellent, so it felt like you were getting what you paid for. Lastly, the bathroom also looked impressive upon first glance... however, upon closer inspection, I was shocked at the lack of attention to detail. For instance, the bathroom countertop was not properly attached to the wall, so where it connected, instead of a waterproof seal, the wallpaper extended onto the countertop to cover up the absence of any waterproof seal. Finally, although the separate shower was a nice touch, the tiling in the shower was a little uneven. Again, these are small details, but in a top tier hotel, it's the details that count. I think overall, I would rate this hotel a 3.5. Had it not been for the details, I would have definitely said a 4, or possibly a 4.25. But due to the lack of attention to details, I would overall rate this as a 3.5.", "Date": "November 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cBest hotel stay I've ever had\u201d", "Author": "mas709", "ReviewID": "UR10915152", "Content": "I will keep this short and simple: the best hotel stay I have ever had - anywhere.

However, as soon as we go there, it was like a dream come true. All four of us couldn't have asked for more! The servie there was excellent. We honestly felt like stars! We ate in the restaurant there once only because the food can be a little pricey, but it was really good. Honestly, I could say alot of good stuff about this hotel...but i think i would write for hours. All i can say is that if i ever go back to L.A i will return to this hotel. Great price, great service, and just great people over all! The only one thing that wasn;t so great was the fact that it is a little ways away from all the areas that, as a tourist, you want to go see. I suggest to rent a car for the majority of your stay if you do stay here. However, you do a complimentary mercedes (with a driver, theres two and one of the guys is the funniest! his name is junior, he is a great guy) and they will take anywhere within a certain distance though, for example Rodeo drive).

Alot. Mostly for business, but my wife and I mix in our fair share of fun traveling. If I'm traveling for business, I tend to stay at Marriott properties because the company is paying and I like the Marriott Rewards program. When it's personal, we like to roll the dice with Priceline to get a nice hotel room at a great price. Priceline has yet to let us down, and this includes the Intercontinental Century City. The hotel staff was friendly and attentive, our room was a decent size 300 to 400 sq ft., and the bed comfortable. Sure, the tv could have been a flat screen, and the bathroom amenities could have been high end, but they weren't and for $90/night on Priceline (rack was 3x's that) who's complaining. Besides, I'm in that room to sleep, not watch tv or sit in a tub. The hotel's location is another one of its attributes. It's a short drive to Santa Monica, Beverly Hills and Hollywood. Also, if you happen to get a room on the back side, your neighbor is the Fox Studios, so you could get the extra bonus of seeing, Brad, Angelina, Scarlett or George. If I had to give it failing marks in one area, it would be the parking situation. There is NO garage for self parking, and you can't park your car along Avenue of the Stars, because there isn't any. They've got a monoply on parking, and they make no apologies for sticking you with a $30/night rate. All in all, it's a nice hotel. What makes it even better is that you can probably get it on Priceline for a fraction of the normal rate.", "Date": "September 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cWow!

I was a little disappointed when I got this hotel on priceline due to the location, but I quickly changed my mind upon arrival. The staff is top notch. The rooms are great. Coffee downstairs in the morning. Sunday morning paper at my door. Car service to the surrounding area. Fox studios right next door. We were given a king on the 14th floor. Great room. Large bathroom. Comfortable king size bed. It had two floor to ceiling windows with a walk out patio!!! The patio was the size of the motel 6 room we stayed up the coast in. Seriously, two lounge chairs, table, and two sun chairs, on the large patio overlooking Beverly Hills, Downtown, Hollywood, and all the surrounding hills. You could see the Hollywood sign from our balcony on a clear morning. Very quiet up that high too. We stayed in room 1411. I would highly suggest room 1411, or maybe just a little better than that, room 1407. Only drawbacks. $30 valet only hotel parking. Was 30% of my room rate. But, very convenient and fast. And to a lesser extent. Location. There is nothing immediately around the hotel. No neighborhood. Beverly Hills is just a few streets away by car, but nothing you really want to walk to. But, if this hotel were right in the middle of one of the trendy neighborhoods, you wouldn't be getting it for $100 a night on priceline either. I would stay here again for sure.

Not only this but the same guy who crashed our car drove our car the same three days we were there, when we asked for someone else they shrugged and said \"okay\" but didnt change a damn thing.

The location - downtown LA is good in that it's central, but there is *nothing* worthwhile nearby and as you'd expect, takes *forever* to drive anywhere in LA. This spot would be better fit for business travelers than tourists really. Valet parking - you can not park your own car. Annoying. Room service - while it definitely was a super chocolate milkshake - the room service menu is off-the-charts price-wise (and this is coming from a New Yorker, I'm used to big bills). Plus even though a tip is calculated into your bill, the wait staff clearly expects to be tipped in addition to that amount. Sigh.
