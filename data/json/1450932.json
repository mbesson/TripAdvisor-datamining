The name Hesperia was familiar to me from my previous stay at the Hesperia Hotel in Madrid a few years ago and it brought back memories of a wonderful high end hotel while in the capital city of Spain. Trusting the name which since has merged with NH hotels of Spain (also a very respectable hotelier chain) I prepaid and reserved 3 nights at this location. The place is not bad but one needs to go into it with realistic expectations. The front is managed by one person, during my arrival this one person was also the front office and reservations manager, quite pleasant indeed but totally overwhelmed with the arrival of numerous passengers from the early morning flights and of course, all the rooms were occupied the night before hence one had to wait a couple of hours to get into the room, this is not unusual with international travel into Europe. The location is perfect if you want to see action and Las Ramblas, the hotel is 150 feet from Las Ramblas on a very safe side street adjacent to a wonderful open food market (La Boqueria). As an added safety feature Hesperia Las Ramblas has a security guard at night and the main door is always locked and controlled by the reception via a remote--- similar to an automatic garage door opener. Upon arriving, Mr. Bosch kindly placed all our luggage in a secured locked area, which gave us the opportunity to wonder into La Boqueria for a cup of coffee. The rooms at this Hesperia are tiny. My king size bed more like a queen could have used a better mattress but it was bug free, the floors are synthetic wood as opposed to carpet which gives you the feeling of being less bacteria impacted. The bathroom albeit small was modern and clean. The room had the most minimal amount of everything, one chair with arms, not practical to put your suitcase, but we were not looking for a fancy room, just a clean and safe to sleep and we got it. As stated, by prepaying the reservation we saved some money although under this program its not refundable, the breakfast offered for additional Euros its not worth it, you can do much better at La Boqueria. The street is narrow and a taxi cannot park next to the hotel for a prolonged period of time so loading and unloading baggage requires some gymnastics and logistics but its not usually a major issue. A big plus at this hotel is the free wireless internet throughout the entire complex, in Europe this is worth around 10-15 euros per day depending on the hotel, rarely gratis. Would I stay there again?---definitely, good value, clean and safe rooms, excellent staff. If you need a \"bellman\" to help you with your luggage in and out this place is not for you, remember one front desk person does it all--answers phone, stores your luggage while your room is becoming available, opens the main door and answers to the numerous questions of arriving and or departing guests, at first sight it looks crazy but they are pro's at this.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint John, Canada", "Title": "\u201cClean and Great Location!\u201d", "Author": "Kevin B", "ReviewID": "UR120049787", "Content": "We thought we had reservations at another Hesperia hotel in Barcelona only to find out they didn't have our reservation and that hotel was booked.

We were buzzed into the hotel, and I began to check in while my wife, mother-in-law, 4 kids and all our luggage were within about 15 feet of me in the lobby. All of the sudden, my 7 year old says \"that man took the black and white bag\". Someone in the lobby had stolen my wife's purse (which was on top of one of the suitcases), and ran out the door. I ran to the door and looked outside for a few minutes, but could not find the thief. I returned to the lobby and began complaining about the security, when my 13 year old daughter screamed out that someone was stealing my mother-in-laws purse! This was about 10 minutes after the first theft. We were able to catch this thief and recover this purse, but my children were really upset by what had happened (can't blame them), and our day in Barcelona was pretty stressful for them.

And, in the case of this hotel it is most relevant. It is a very short walking distance to the bustling La Rambla with it's sidewalk cafes, shops, restaurants, street vendors, kiosks, and people watching galore and in addition the famous Boqueria Market just a block behind the hotel. It's also just a short walk to the Liceu Metro station (Blue Line), the Gothic Quarter filled with Old World charm including the Cathedral (not the Gaudi one), the Opera House (Gran Teatre Del Liceu) and the Placa Reial (vast square with more restaurants, shops, cafes, fountains, people watching, clubs, outdoor concerts, and even 2 giant lanterns by Gaudi). The hotel is a small, boutique type hotel situated on a very quiet side street (L'Hospital). Look carefully as you come down the street from La Rambla for the entrance on the right as it is a bit hidden due to it's front doors being offset from the street. You will need to buzz the speaker on the wall to the right to gain entrance (you must do this each time you enter even after check-in providing a nice sense of security). The reception area is spacious, modern and clean with very attentive and friendly staff who quickly checked us in and answered all of our questions with well informed answers throughout our stay. We stayed here after a 12-day cruise and so arrived early in the morning around 9:30 am. We fully anticipated having to just store our bags and then head out to the city but were informed our room was ready and they would be more than happy to let us go ahead and fully check-in. A very nice touch! The room was very modern and immaculately clean with a great bathroom, comfy beds, flat-panel TV, and large windows that opened to provide air and views to the street level. There was also a very large closet/wardrobe unit that included a safe for your valuables. The room felt spacious it seemed to me, especially for European standards. We were on the front of the hotel but despite that didn't experience any problems with noise. The windows are very thick and sound-proof and as mentioned the street is far enough away from La Rambla as to not be much of a problem. The bathroom could have used more counter space but otherwise it served very well. The door is clear and so adds a more airy feel to the rooms. The room rate is very reasonable and provides excellent value for your money. We booked it directly through the hotel's website as part of the Hesperia hotel chain. There is an additional 10 euro charge for the breakfast downstairs which we opted-out of as there are just too many places nearby to eat otherwise. The taxi from the cruise port was about 10 euro + surcharge for baggage and the tip and takes about 10 minutes or less depending on traffic. The taxi to the airport was about 30 euro + surcharges and tip and took about 20 minutes or so. We left early in the morning so the traffic was not a problem. But, I understand that at other times, that can be an issue. There are 2 small elevators to the rooms that seemed more than adequate. We never waited long for an elevator. The only negative aspect that I saw of the hotel was the hall carpets (which are carpet square) were quite dirty and needing repair and/or replacement. But, that was minor in context. Of course one of the primary reasons to visit Barcelona is to explore all of the Gaudi architecture throughout the city which is not to be missed. From this location, all his major works can easily be reached by the Metro station nearby or in the case of Palau Guell (which was just recently reopened) you can even walk. All in all, you will not be disappointed with choosing this hotel for modern accommodations, friendly staff, value and most of all location.", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Antrim, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value for central location\u201d", "Author": "MapRad", "ReviewID": "UR115164285", "Content": "The hotel road is located right in the middle of La Rambla (half way between the Christopher Columbus monument at Port Vell to the south end of La Rambla, and Pla\u00e7a Catalunya at the top/north), so it is right in the heart of the action. The hotel is only 50 meters off La Rambla, on a small street which has a few shops, bakery, bank, etc. The street to the back of the hotel leads directly into the Mercat de la Boqueria (or you can also access the main entrance of La Boqueria from La Rambla) - a wonderful fresh food market with an astounding variety of foods - excellent for breakfast or refreshing snack through the day, so no need for any expensive hotel breakfast if it's not included in the booking. The hotel is recently built and modern inside, although as with the majority of 3* hotels, the lobby/reception area gives a false impression of marble luxury, which is not carried on through the rest of the hotel corridors, where the carpet on our 3rd floor was looking a little worn. This unnerved me at first, but on reaching our room we were pleasantly surprised to find the room spacious, very clean and furnished in very neat, modern minimalist furniture - very tasteful, nice, adequate, and all that we required for our 3 night stay prior to our cruise. Likewise the bathroom was a fairly good size, with bathtub and shower, but most importantly very clean. There is no good view from the hotel rooms apart from looking down onto the small street below (large windows, so the rooms are lovely and light, but with good blackout curtains). At nights La Rambla is buzzing and noisy, but the hotel is just nicely situated off from the crowds and we had no problem with noise. Although our bed was 2 large singles pushed together (not sure if other rooms had proper double/king size beds), it didn't bother us and we found the mattresses really comfy and enjoyed 3 good nights sleep. Staff are excellent and helpful. The previous occupants of our room had left the safe locked, so when I rang reception for assistance they had someone up to our room to sort it within 2 minutes! Free WIFI is available throughout the hotel and in the rooms, which was really useful, you just have to ask reception for the code. Need to press a buzzer to get into the hotel, which was no hassle because the staff respond to it straight away. The area around the hotel is quite interesting and offers a taste of the real Barcelona life - we wandered around the small streets on our first night and found it all quite intriguing, but you need to be careful as it can be a little seedy in places, and you can become quite isolated and vulnerable the further off the beaten track you go, for example within a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel we found ourselves unknowingly in the middle of the red light district. It would not be wise to go out around these smaller backstreets alone at night. Liceu metro stop (green line) is very close to the hotel on La Rambla (2 minute walk), or a 10 minute leisurely stroll will take you right to the top of La Rambla to the Pla\u00e7a Catalunya where you will find a major metro station with access to most of the metro lines. Its best to purchase the T10 ticket if you plan on using the metro a number of times during your stay, and you can also use this for the train to/from the airport. Pla\u00e7a Catalunya is also the place to pick up the start of the Hop-on Hop-off buses. We chose to go on the Barcelona City Tour buses (red buses - prebooked online to save 10%), rather than the Barcleona Bus Turistic (blue sided buses), although both tour buses are the same price we were glad we chose the red buses as they were definitely not as busy as the other company. We never had any problem getting seats together on the top deck and the buses were really frequent - great way to get an overview of the city and then go explore yourself. Our prime reason for choosing this hotel was its excellent location along La Rambla, so that we would be near the touristy heart of the city for the first part of our holiday, but also because of its proximity to the port for our cruise. We walked from the hotel right down La Rambla to the Christopher Columbus monument, where we got the port bus to the ship - although walking with luggage in the midday heat was tiring. Compared to other hotels in this area, the value for money for our 3 night stay was excellent, and I would not hesitate to highly recommend the Hesperia Ramblas. Word of warning for any travel in Barcelona - beware of very clever pick pockets!! On the train from the airport to Barcelona at the very start of our holiday, my purse was pick pocketed from my handbag (which was actually in my hand luggage case which I was sitting on!) by a young couple (in their 30's) very smartly dressed, definitely not the scruffy Artful Dodger characters that I was initially looking out for. Thanks to a previous tip review I had read on TripAdvisor, I was alert and on the lookout for pickpockets, so noticed that the man had a coat hung over his arm, while the woman was being distracting with her over-affection towards him. Thankfully I caught on to what had happened and shouted to my husband that my purse had been stolen - the guy dropped my purse and moved into another train carriage to find the next poor victim.

Arrived mid afternoon, taxi was around 30 euro from airport and took around 35 mins, but there was heavy traffic due to public holiday next day and everyone leaving early from work. Hotel is one minute down a side road off the Ramblas, entrance is through glass doors and you need to buzz to get in at all times so its secure. Reception area gives instant feel of modern clean feel and freshness. Reception man was efficient and polite and he had on record special request for high floor and double bed. We couldnt get both but chose double bed on floor 2. Whole check in process was fairly quick and painless and we were provided wifi code (free access) for our stay. The room (floor 2) was quite small with double bed, with en suite shower and had small wardrobe and safe (free). No balcony but door opened inwards for air. Air conditioned room. We asked to move to higher floor with two twin beds - this was no problem. This room on floor 5 (top floor) was so much bigger (probably more than twice as spacious - L shape) with separate large bathroom with bath. Everything else same and overlooked another alley. Perfect for us - and was so so much better than first room (we had room 510 which was opposite lift - but quiet). Like the other room this was spotless with TV (only BBC News as prime english channel + National Geographic). Breakfast room was on floor below reception - was so very clean and airy. Continental, but cereal, toaster, juices, meats, a few hot items incl scrmabled eggs and cheeses and wonderful fresh assotred fruit on trays, coffee and tea (leaves in tins for fresh brew). As a bacon and eggs person this was such a great change and lady (who did everything) was friendly and helpful. We were very pleased with this and more than adequate. Only criticism was tables werent cleared very quickly. Location - come out of the hotel door and turn left to get to Ramblas in one minute. Half way to Ramblas at first alley on left if you head up alley a few yards up is the market hall for fresh fruit and assortment of items. A tourist attraction. There was somewhere to get breakfast I believe too if needed. If you otherwise turn right from hotel there isnt much to see, and we did once but not again. Hotel provides maps and advice. They provide you witha tour bus discount - you pay 4 euro for a discount voucher which you then exchange at tour bus offices on Catalanya Plaza (where buses start) at a cost of 17 euro. You cant but ticket from hotel. Overall all this saves you 2 euro each - but better than nothing. There are 3 tourist bus routes - red, blue and green. Most people do red as more stops and attractions, blue visits football ground, green was small. You can use ticket and do all three and jump on and off and swap etc - but must use in one day unless you get two day ticket (extra cost). We did red and blue same day and each was about two hours - red was best. You can wait for next bus is you want upstairs. Catalunya plaza - left out of hotel, left at Ramblas and walk to top of hill (10 min). Red bus stop is straight ahead, blue bus stops on right of square (make sure you get right one). Ticket offices are on square too. Can be busy but buses are regular and wait isnt too long. Other Tips/Views on Area: On Ramblas if you turn right (opposite to Catalunya direction) this ends up at port (10 mins) where theres lots of attractions near waterfront. Very much tourist area and lots to see and shopping centre too. Off Ramblas go down all the lanes and alleys. They all end up at churches and aattractions, so many shops and bars and restauarants to see. You can walk for hours andso much to discover. Be warned that shops and bars on Ramblas are so much more expensive. If you go off into alley, bars and restaurants you get more value. For example on Ramblas tapas selection and drinks can easily cost 40 euro plus for two, yet we paid 25 euro for 3 tapas (big portions) including hams and drinks at a non Ramblas location. Souveniers same - t shirt for kids (adult size) cost 12 euro dont pay more. Haggle will get items cheaper and dont accept first price. Safety wise just be sensible is the advice. My wife put handbag strap over head, and I kept wallet close in deep pocket and I only took out enough euro for the day. Be wary of people who approach you asking directions or in groups. There are lots of crowds. Dont trust anyone. We had one event where group of lads approach close pretending to be drunk, but clearly sizing us up. We let them past before proceeding. Just to add that whenever you see prices at restaurants etc dont forget there will be 8% tax added - prices on boards tend to be exclusive. Tips are normally around 5% if you want, and in bars we tended to leave change in coins a few cents. Quite a few beggars which you can ignore and they go away. Others play music or perform acts and if you like then a few cents are appreciated. Check out from hotel was midday and you can pay 20 euro till 2pm if you want (we didnt). At Catalunya Plaza you can catch the airport bus. It is located on the right hand side of plaza close to above the blue tour bus location. Cost was 5.30 euro one way each and there is a separate bus for terminal one and for teminal two (same bus stop). Was around 30 mins trip and drop off was right outside terminal. Good tip to use this both ways - wish we had done so. Think was around 9 euro. I feel like a tourist guide but if I try to help readers not just with hotel but with some tips we learned. Sorry its so long. Back to hotel - it does what you need and is very clean and was perfect for us. Avoid a small room though and request a larger one on higher floor. Likely if you want double bed you will get small. If we returned to Barcelona we would definitely return here as was central to everything we needed and very friendly. No frills and no restuarnat except for breakfast - but didnt expect it and didnt need it. Rooms have no view - didnt need one wasnt in there long excpet to sleep. Would recommend. Anyone wants to ask question just send email about hotel, location etc. Happy to help if we know.

I love Barcelona but it really isn't safe there right now and I wouldn't recommend traveling there until they fix the street crime. I'm usually good about keeping my eye on my wallet, but these teenage or early-twenties kids will distract you by crowding around and falling, or getting run over by someone's bag while another one grabs your wallet.

The location of the hotel is perfect; in a small street by Las Ramblas (the place to stay in in barcelona). The staff is so nice, courteous, and helpful. The rooms are quite spacious fro european standards. The design is ultra chic & modern, all made with white & grey shades. The beds are comfy & the bathroom is very modern. The hotel & rooms are kept clean daily. It's a lit bit noisy as it is right on the city center, but you can still sleep fine at night. We checked other hotels in the area, & all had the same problems, at least Hesperia is located in a small street, so the noise isn't unbearable We never felt unsafe while walking to the hotel at night, although we found many prostitues on the main avenue in Las Ramblas, but really, nothing to brag about. Getting around : - You can take the hop on hop off busses (bus turistica is by far the best) to see the main sightseeing, don't forget to ask for the headsets once inside. We tried it on friday, which was a good option but i'm glad we didn't get it on saturday & sunday as there were HUGE lines to get into the bus. If you are interested ask in the front desk for the tickets coz you get a 2 euros/person discount & they give you a small booklet that has tons of discounts. Otherwise the taxi is a very good option as i found that it was't expensive at all (25 euros to the airport for the four of us). Food : - We had breakfast at the hotel, almost 11 euros (2 euros discount if you tell them as soon as you come). Ok it's a little bit expensive, but it's worth it; good selection of pasteries, fresh juices, coffee, cheeses, scrambled eggs, breads, sausages, fresh fruits, cereals & yogurts. Otherwise, there's a starbucks coffee 5 to 10 min walk from hotel. - We found the food in barcelona very delicious, we tried many tapas restaurants; i think the best one is called Txapela (located in passeo Gracia right after plaza Catalunya, you pass across the huge \"El Corte Engles\" & it's 3 min away on your right), there was also a good one (u shouldn't be on a hurry though & i woudn't recommand their paella) named \"Taller de Tapas\" & located on the small streets in front of the hotel in Place Sant Josep Oriol, N\u00b09 (Pl. del Pi) - On my birthday we tried \"Con Gracia\" Restaurant, you have to make online reservation at least couple weeks before on tehir website. It is expensive (around 60 euros/per + beverages), but in my opinion it's one of the best. It's not a hispanic restaurant, but a great mixture between japaneese & mediterranean food. They have only 2 menus, one they call traditional & the other one \"surprise\", made up only for you based on what you like & dislike but you can only pick up one menu per table. We tried the traditional one & it was a great experience, we also saw some people getting the surprise menu & it was as delicious. There were some combination of food i've never tried & the mixture of ingredients was devine. For sure, i'll go back there if i ever visit barcelona. SIGHTSEEING : We didn't have time to see it all, but we picked up the following & it was a rewarding experience : - Nou Camp (Stadium) : for the FCBarcelona fans, yes i'd recommand ot, otherwise just skip this tour - Casa Batllo : Very charming & beautifully made with all the details Gaudi thought about. I highly recommand it - La Segrada Familia (Church Sacred Family) : Beautiful structure. Unfortunately we couldn't get inside on the 2 days we went there (we went quite early on the 2nd day). there was always a 3hrs waiting line & we just couldn't take it. Maybe we'll be lucky enough to visit it next time - Guell Park : When the bus drops you, you will have to walk on a VERY STEEP street for 5-10min. It's a wonderful place on a sunny day. You can enjoy a nice view from teh top of the gardens, & there r musicians all around the park - We loved walking around & discovering the city especially on the narrow streets just past Las Ramblas area, we'd get lost & then found out our way. Totally safe & fun visit. You get a different taste of the city.

There is also a safe big enough to store and charge your notebook as there was a power plug inside. Free wireless and very important: quiet rooms! We have ordered a quiet room and got one to a back alley. Close by to all the sightseeing spots in the old town district and to the subway station. There is breakfast available but we haven't used it as there is plenty of patiseries around to start with a coffee and some sweet pastries into the morning. Service was ok and friendly. We were able to check-in at 11 AM. I would highly recommend to stay there as everything was better than expected and required.", "Date": "July 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hull, England", "Title": "\u201cUltra modern and supremely clean hotel in fantastic location!!!\u201d", "Author": "koggyboy", "ReviewID": "UR72902739", "Content": "Had read the glowing reviews on this hotel and was not disappointed when we arrived. Just off la Ramblas down Hospital St, the exterior is glass and cream stone with a really modern look. Good security, you have to press buzzer to let you in (security man in background at night). When you walk in, it's so quiet and peaceful, long reception desk and easy check in, staff were polite. Good lifts that arrived quickly at all times of day and night. Rooms are ultra modern again and so clean, the whole hotel is almost sterile, I've never stayed in anywhere so pristine. The rooms are ultra modern again, with a massive bed and crisp white linen. The decor and curtains are lovely and modern, the floor is a grey resin sort of floor that matches the modern decor, so don't be expecting a plush carpet! There is a double sliding wardrobe and shelving that contains an easy to use free safe and also a good sized fridge that contains the mini bar at very reasonable prices, but if you're stingy like us, you can put your own stuff in there. There are two white bedside tables and a matching larger one opposite with a big mirror above. There is a flat screen TV on the wall. The bathroom is excellent with quality white modern fittings set in a cream stone, a good sized mirror and excellent lighting. There are some nice touches like an extendable mirror, hairdryer and lots of toiletries and bits and pieces like nail file and shoe shine, in fact I've had lesser things in some four star hotels I've stayed in. Lots of white towels. There isn't a bath but the shower makes up for it, it's so big you could could fit three people in it and easily the best shower I've ever come across. Fab air con as well. The whole place has a tranquil vibe about it and considering it's location, we didn't hear anything and slept like babies all the time we were there. Will be the only place we'll stay now as it's such good value for money and would definitely recommend. If you haven't been to Barcelona before, getting around the place is so easy. Don't get a taxi from the aiport as they can be very costly. Come out of the aiport , go left and walk to the Aerobus stop. It's 5 euros to Plaza Catalunya, the big square at the top of La Ramblas. It announces the stops in different languages so you know exactly where you are. About 30 mins on the bus, get off and walk straight down La Ramblas and Hospital St is on the right, a good walk down. Coming back, go to the square again and get a Terminal 1 or 2 bus and they run approx every ten mins. The open top bus is a great way of seeing the city, it has red, green and blue routes and you just hop on and off as you please. You can spend all day on this if you wanted and it costs 22 euros or 29 for a two day ticket. It's so worth it as there is so much to see and it's a brilliant way of seeing it all. The whole system is so well organised and you hardly wait anytime for the next bus to come along. Shopping is fantastic and so are the many restaurants and bars, all serving quality food. The market off La Ramblas is so colourful and vibrant and you can buy ready prepared fruit and freshly squeezed juices which are great after nights out. At the other end of La Ramblas is the harbour area with a shopping plaza and great seafood and Tapas places overlooking the harbour. A colourful and vibrant, bustling city with great architecture, will be rushing back soon!", "Date": "July 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel in central location\u201d", "Author": "jonnytekno", "ReviewID": "UR72589514", "Content": "Can't fault this hotel.

Breakfast was OK, although being only a stones throw away from the markets and gothic quarter, we found a number of more 'cost effective options' elsewhere. The staff are friendly and genuinely helpful, and possibly the most important feature of this hotel is its security. Even as we waited for our taxi on the last morning, the staff were constantly keeping an eye out for us and our belongings. However, as everyone else has commented, the location of this hotel is possibly its best feature! Although the little back street it is located on is a little dingy, the hotel basically backs on to the markets and is a one minute walk from Las Ramblas and the Gothic Quarter and is central to the Metro (ride at your own risk!) and public transport. Despite its close proximity to the nightlife, once you decide to settle in for the night, the rooms are completely quiet! On our second night, Barcelona had won their league soccer finals and Las Ramblas was packed with soccer celebrations. Despite finding ourselves on the wrong side of the mall, and having a little difficulty making our way through the crowds, riot police etc and back to the hotel, we were pleasantly surprised to find that once safely inside, we didnt' hear a thing for the rest of the night.

We caught the Aerobus directly from the airport (El Prat) which drops you off by the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9. The hotel was just a short 10 minute walk from there. Admittedly we did catch a taxi from drop-off point to hotel just for convenience but in retrospect, was not necessary. The hotel is situated on one of the roads leading off la Ramblas \u2013 you could not be better placed. We were a 5 minute walk from the port and virtually on la Ramblas. Catalunya Plaza was a 5 minute walk. The nearest metro station is just 1 minute away! Although close to the action, we were just far enough away to enjoy a peaceful night. The immediate area is quiet but well lit and safe enough. The hotel itself is clean and well presented. Check in was quick and easy. The rooms were just as shown in the pictures and were immaculate. They were spacious, stylishly decorated and cleaned everyday. Bathroom again was large and very clean. As others have mentioned, the shower is very powerful - almost like having a massage (which is the perfect tonic after a long day of sight-seeing). We thought that the bed was comfortable and afforded us a good night\u2019s rest. The hotel staff were brilliant. All spoke clear English, were knowledgeable and extremely receptive to our questions. Offered great directions and suggestions of places to go according to what we were looking for. You have to be buzzed through the main doors, but this was never a problem. We were never kept waiting and most of the time they seemed to almost pre-empt our arrival! They also kept hold of our luggage on the last day with no fuss as were weren\u2019t flying out till the evening. Of course the hotel has no restaurant or bar or any other facilities for that matter, but then, you just don\u2019t need them being so close to la Ramblas.

Noise wasn't a problem.", "Date": "November 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "new orleans, la", "Title": "\u201cgreat choice\u201d", "Author": "darhines", "ReviewID": "UR49182214", "Content": "Just returned from 4 days in Barcelona. This hotel is centrally located just off Las Ramblas, the rooms are small but comfortable. Staff is friendly and helpful.Only drawback is they turned the A/C off to the entire hotel and you could only get heat. It wasn't quite time of the year for NO air, but we made due with opening windows, although the street noise was a distraction. There are plenty of tapas bars and breakfast location on Las Ramblas, so no need for a taxi. I recommend the Bus Turistica, hop on/ hop off open air buses for viewing the city. Get the two day pass discount at the hotel and enjoy the bus. Plenty of sights to see and lots to do. Don't miss Park Guell, it is fabulous!", "Date": "November 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austrtalia", "Title": "\u201cnot possible to go wrong with this hotel\u201d", "Author": "petesh", "ReviewID": "UR48812832", "Content": "The other reviews say it all. great location, lovely rooms, friendly staff. we are on our way back to Australia following a cruise and booked into this hotel based on reviews and were definitely not dissappointed. to exchange currency if staying in this area change your money at the hotel. they charge 4% if you change it on las ramblas expect to pay 18%.", "Date": "November 9, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hesperia Ramblas", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1450932-Reviews-Hesperia_Ramblas-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$140 - $253*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">C/ L'Hospital, 26</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08001</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1450932", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/af/fa/affa69551843e3c125fdd144dc0dccbe5large.jpg"}}
