The breakfast selection was everything you'd need, beds comfortable and very clean and well looked after. Great free internet access from the lobby computers hooked to a printer to print out directions and places to visit. Ideally get a room number on the canal side of the hotel ending with a 9 or an 11 so you get a bay window overlooking the canal. The hotel is in a good location, 10-15 mins walk to the Centraal Station for trams. We walked to Anne Frank's House, the Van Gogh Museum and Rembrantplatz. Good market round the corner on Sunday morning where you could buy an old second hand Dutch bike for not much more than hiring one for a week... then just sell it back the next week-end! If you have a couple of days to fit lots in, buy a Holland Pass and get the 5 [44 euros] or 7 pass ticket per person from the office in the station concourse, you get red [tulip] and blue [windmill] passes to attractions which save significantly on the entry prices with Rapid access to some museums. The Blueboat Canal Tour was worth it [Blue pass] 1hr 40mins. We got local buses out to Keukenhof Gardens for the Bulb Shows [until 2nd week in May] using the Holland Pass tickets. No.179 out to Schipol Airport then a No.58 to the Gardens. We travelled over on the DFDS Ferry overnight... great buffet breakfasts and the 7 Seas buffet is a great tasting introduction to more varied North European food- pickled herring and marinated salmon... lovely. The Blue Riband restaurant on the way back was an extravagance but worth it! ...though the food portions in the Bake'n Coffee cafe were fantastic- especially the chips with ketchup and mustard mayo!

It's adjacent to a few bars, supermarket, canal-side coffee shops (that is...coffee to drink) but so much more just a walk away. The room was cosy (end of October) and clean. The bed well dressed in white cotton and very comfortable. More than the other two Ibis hotels we've stayed in this one had a flat screen TV built into a flat unobtrusive unit on the wall which worked a treat. The room was well soundproofed (we had neighbours either side but we couldn't hear a thing)) with double glazing and a thick main door (please guide these closed guests as they are so heavy they close with a thud....it's the only hard sound you hear if guests allow the door to slam closed behind them). The pod-style bathroom is also spotless and the shower had endless constant hot water. These fabulous all-in-one bathroom pods would be better if when fitted they were lined with insulating material 1st as they do make even the most nimble inside-shower manoeuvres sound lie a mule trying to kick it's way out of a barn. We didn't pay to have breakfast. We prefered to get up, shower and get out but from what I could see by the breakfast area lay-out it's seems quite low-key for the hefty 15 euro per person charge. Also, we had a pint (well half a litre) of lager one night and it was a hefty 5.50 euros eachOther Ibis hotels we've stayed at in the UK had tea/coffee making facilities in the room. Maybe they don't in Europe but we did miss having a cuppa in the room in the morning when we thought the facilities would be the same UK to Europe.

Members of staff we have dealt with have been most friendly and helpful. When standing at reception you overhear how some of the difficult situations that clients have are dealt with by the reception staff in a friendly professional manner. Over the last fifteen years I have stayed at most of the Ibis Hotels in France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and the UK and I would think that the ratio of people staying at the hotel and eating in the restaurant is amongst the highest I have seen. The breakfast is of a very high quality and includes both hot and cold food. Some Ibis Hotels do have a lot of people eating in the restaurant but they move on after they have eaten and a lot of bars at Ibis hotels are often deserted. I have stayed at the hotel with my wife on several occasions and at one time saw there were around forty people from several nationalities in the restaurant, eating, drinking and looking very relaxed, at ease and in no rush to go anywhere else. In the past when the hotel was full we stayed somewhere else but in the evening we went to the Stopera to have our evening meal and a drink. The hotel has the air of a well run family hotel where people are made to feel at home and happy to spend time for a meal and a drink. The restaurant now has an Italian theme which again proves relaxing and the food is good and reasonably priced. We recently went to Germany via Amsterdam both ways; we were again made welcome at reception, followed by a meal in the restaurant which again was very good. . Some guests had experienced difficult journeys due to the weather conditions but everyone was well looked after by the staff in the bar / restaurant in a friendly manner. While in Germany we stayed two nights at a Mercure Hotel which in my opinion was not half as good as the Stopera .", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood times\u201d", "Author": "Cmb1978", "ReviewID": "UR89388742", "Content": "Me and a friend moved to this hotel after the one we booked was horrible and were very impressed, good value, clean, warm, comfy beds a working telly and a good shower room.

A few days later I found I had skipped the special offer option which cuts down on prices to a great degree, and includes breakfast as well, but it was too late. When I got to the hotel I realized I had made the right choice: The hotel building was new and modern, the rooms perfectly clean, the receptionists very-well trained and helpful, and most of all, the location was great; close to Amsterdam main attractions while having a quiet and peaceful neighborhood. There are only two negative points about the hotel: One is the small size of the rooms;even so, they're designed in the most functional way. The second, I believe, is that the small size of rooms can be tolerated only if you stay in the rooms with the beautiful canal view. My first room had the view of the back of some buildings which intensified the sense of suffocation I had because of the small space, but fortunately I could change it to a room with canal view the second day and that really made a difference.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOverall a great hotel for an Amsterdam visit...\u201d", "Author": "CraigandKeely", "ReviewID": "UR82218326", "Content": "After arriving at the airport, which is huge, we caught the train into Amsterdam Central Station which cost 3.70 euro and took around 20 minutes, the ticket machines were very easy to use, and helpful that you can select a language. (Note the machines we saw were either card only or card and coins - i didnt notice any machines that took notes) a ticket office is available if the machines seem a little daunting! On arriving at Central Station, the hotel is an approximate 15 minute walk away, and is very easy to locate. The location of the hotel itself is on a fairly busy road, and is in the old Jewish quarter about 100m away from Waterlooplein, and the flea market. There is a Metro station around the corner, but we never used it as we walked everywhere in the city, a supermarket is also located nearby which was useful as there are no tea/coffee facilities in the room. All attractions are pretty much nearby aswell, with a 10-15 minute walk taking you to most attractions including Dam square, red light district etc etc. We arrived at the hotel just before 10am, there were not any rooms ready but the lady on reception kindly told us one would be available at 12 noon and offered to look after our bags in a secure room/locker. The room itself was on the third floor, and was a good size, modern, with an lcd tv on the wall. The bathroom, again, was a good size, with a large shower and hair dryer attached to the wall, both rooms were very clean and to be honest, spotless. Our towels were changed daily, and the bed made everyday. We stayed for 3 nights and had breakfast each morning which was great, it was a buffet style, which had everything from coffee and juice, to fruit, to hot food, pasteries, bread, yoghurt etc etc... all was very nice, and was replenished often, great for filling up before a day exploring! The breakfast room doubles as the restaurant later on in the day, we never actually ate there later on, so i cant comment on the food in the evening. During our stay we experienced no problems whatsoever , all the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful, they all acknowledged us as we passed. I would definately recommend this hotel for a visit to Amsterdam. One final tip would be to book your tickets for Anne Frank House onine, you just print your tickets out at home, (take them with you of course) and you can just walk right past the extremely long queue, that snakes round the corner and walk through a door on the left and straight in!

The hotel was easy to reach from the train station, with a short hop on the bus (I would advise that you take the day-pass for the bus - very handy). The hotel was a five minute walk from the bus-stand, and a 10 from the nearest metro, so a bus ride is advised. The locality is okay, with a flea market at a walking distance and a big supermarket at two minutes walk - prefer to shop there than the overpriced vending machines in the hotel compund. The famous Dam Square is a good 10-15 minutes walk, but the view is good so the walk is comfortable. The rooms themselves are confortable - not too large, but enough to keep your basic luggage. The room we got was very nice - it directly overlooked the canal, and the view was beautiful - reminded us of Venice! With an LCD TV in the room and a large closet, the room was one of the better ones I have seen at IBIS hotels. With a (comaparatively) large bath area, the toilet was clean and adequate. The staff at the hotel was courteous, and helped out with some hot water from the cafe which I needed for my soar throat. While the water in the taps is potable, I would not advise risking it and suggest bottled water there. Overall, a good value for money and a nice, clean hotel for all age-groups and families. Would recommmend this for the next visit. Directions: By train: From the Central Train Station, take the metro two stops to Waterlooplein.

We selected the City Stopera rather than the Ibis central station after reading reviews on trip advisor about the noise. OK-we're hens, but we want a good nights sleep! We were extremely impressed by the Ibis. I've stayed in Ibis hotels before so am aquainted with their no-nonsense funtionality but they seemed to have taken the quality up a notch. Rooms had a flat screen TV and were tidy and clean. The bed was comfy and the duvet fluffy. Curtains blacked out every ounce of light-perfect for lying in after a hard nights partying. The hotel was quiet and we weren't frequently woken up by late night door-slamming and talking in the corridors which can be true of other town centre budget hotels. The shower cubicle was roomy and was almost like a wet room and the shower was powerful with plenty of hot water. I thought the hairdryer wasn't powerful enough and was wired into the bathroom which wasn't convenient as I wanted to dry my hair while my friend was in the shower. I was glad I brought my own. Shower gel and a shower cap were provided and was impressed to see Ibis using eco-friendly shower gel. Towels looked new and were fluffy and soft. Staff were friendly and helpful. They allowed us to check in early. During late afternoon we sat in the hotel bar for a couple of small lagers to chill out and bar staff brought us brushetta to try with meat on them. When 3 of us explained that we were vegetarian, they made special meat free ones for us, which we felt was a nice touch. Hotel reception ordered a taxi for us to go out of a night who was reasonably priced and helpful. The bar is tastefully decorated and had a nice atmosphere. Tables were decorated with candles and flowers and had a buzz that a hotel bar doesn't usually have. A word of warning it was extremely expensive (11 euros for a brandy and diet coke! ). The Hotel was conveniently located near Waterlooplein and we were able to get metro/trams and buses. We didn't try the breakfast as we found an excellent bagel shop round the corner called Tony's where you could get a bagel and a coffee for about 7 euro and tasty! Hotel check out was 12 and we appreciated the extra hour in bed as we thought, like most hotels we would have to check out by 11.

I was going to stay 2 nights at the Ibis Central Amsterdam (next to the station) but they were sold out of the cheap rooms for one of the nights, so I stayed one night here and one night at the Central Station Ibis. This hotel is actually quite good, though it seems out of place in the neighborhood. It's about a 15-20 min walk from Central Station (not a hard walk). I didn't spend much time in the area (arrived late, left early) but the hotel itself was nice. I generally like the Ibis hotels, and this was no exception. Great staff, nice, clean room just the way I like it. Would definitely stay here again if the Central one is booked. Two things to note though: one, is that while they charge for local calls (as most hotels do), they ALSO charged for 0800 (toll-free) calls (ie, they charge for an \"outside line\" whether it's toll-free or not). I was using a calling card that had a more expensive rate for their 0800 number access but used it instead thinking there'd be no hotel charge for a 0800 call. Wrong. Ibis hotels charge for outside lines, doesn't matter if it's local or 0800. Also, all Ibis hotels seem to do this: even if you don't want the breakfast (an extra charge) they automatically put it on your bill before checkout, so you've got to tell them AGAIN at CHECK OUT that you did NOT have the breakfast, otherwise you'll be charged for it. For instance, I pre-paid for my room (my Visa card was charged before I even arrived) to get a great price. The price was without breakfast. But when I checked in, it said Breakfast Inlcluded: YES on the check-in card folder, so I thought it was included anyway now. I had breakfast, and when checking out, was told no, it's NOT included at that price, that they automatically add it to the bill and you have to have them take it off at checkout if you don't have breakfast. They were nice and didn't charge me for it because of the mixup, but just be aware, this is one quirk of the Ibis chain (not just this location). If you don't want the breakfast (E10-E15 depending on the location), even if you're already pre-paid, and even if you've told them before you don't want breakfast, you have to AGAIN tell them at CHECKOUT that you haven't had it, and not to charge you for it. It's just a quirk with the Ibis chain. Once you get used to that and the phone thing though, I really DO like the Ibis chain, and this hotel was no exception. I'd definitely stay here again. For those going to Amsterdam, I'd recommend the Central Station location first (just because it's so convenient, and the rooms are nice there too) but if they're booked, and you don't mind walking 15 mins from the station, this was a great hotel too.", "Date": "August 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durham", "Title": "\u201cVery good and will go back again for the third time\u201d", "Author": "Brewman-here", "ReviewID": "UR35579664", "Content": "Arrived and was promptly attended to, clean spacious room.

It was 30 degrees, so stifling hot, even the residents thought it was v.hot, so once we got off the coach at central station, we wanted to know where our hotel was so that after a few hours we could go and check in. This is very straight forward as there are signs placed quite high up on the lamposts so you can see which general direction to go in, and all the streets are named so if you can manage to get a little map before you go this should help. We did get a little lost, but found our way - if you head for the science museum named Nemo, this should be on your left and the Ibis is down the street to your right - it is across the road and a couple of buildings down from the fire station. We arrived at 1.15 pm, and even though check in was not until 2 pm, they were able to let us check in early, which was a godsend considering how hot we were. The room (and building) were nicely air conditioned and the bed was really comfy. You do get BBC1 and BBC2 so if you get back to your room later in the evening you can watch the evening news or similar. A visit to the NEMO science museum is good for all ages. A canal trip is also good - several different ones to choose from. We also went to Anne Frank Huis and although this said in our guide book open till 9 pm, it closed at 4.30 pm both the days we were there, we had to queue but only for 30 minutes - there was an entrance for people who had pre booked so if you can book on internet maybe worth doing - it was ok for us as it was hot sunny weather and the little shop round the corner must have made a killing selling cold drinks to us all! If you want to catch a bus or tram, it is best to buy a ticket before you get on as not all buses and trams have ocnductors. Next to central station there is a information centre (called GVB & tickets). You have to take a number from a machine (like a deli counter) and wait your turn, but this was really helpful to us a the man we spoke to was very helpful. We could have bought a return tram/bus combi ticket for 6.50 euros or a 24 hour combi ticket for 7 euro - it's a no brianer really! You just blipin and off the buses - like an octupus card realy each time you get on. He also gave us an information booklet which was really useful as it lists all the attractions and next to them tells you which number bus or tram to get. The public transport system here is really good. A word of warning - don't have a drink in the Ibis bar! one pint og Heinken and a barcardi brezer (he didn't know what peach snapps was) cost us 12 euros! I think if we had known the price we would have gone elsewhere. There is also a left luggage facility at the Ibis so after we checked out, we left our backpacks with them rather than carry them around with us. For anyone travelling with P&O - the coach took 2 hours to get us to Amstrerdam from Rotterdam - horrendous traffic and 2 hours 20 mins toget back - even worse traffic, but it was a Friday night at rush hour! If I went again I would definately book the coach as not sure where the train station was even though I looked for it. Check in at Rotterdam was quite chaotic as not enough staff, but I think they take this into account and would let you on the ferry anyway!

I read lots about how nice the shower was in this hotel and yes the shower is lovely, hot and powerful, just what you need when you've been walking all day. However, the bathroom was like a unit that had been fitted in to the room, it was all plastic and felt a bit like an oversized caravan bathroom! We've stayed in several ibis hotels and i don't remember anything like this before. The room itself was what you might call functional, the usual twin beds pushed together that they call a double room, TV with several language channels. A full length mirror but the electric socket was on the other side of the room so very difficult to dry your hair. No tea or coffee but we knew that before we went. Several reviews mention noise but we didn't hear any at all. It was very quiet, a welcome respite from the city centre. Not much going on in the area at all. The bar man was very keen to close up on the two nights we stayed, it was the same man both nights, the first night we arrived quite late and i think he was disappointed that we arrived. the second night we got back at 20 to 1 (it's advertised as being open till 1) only to be told that they were closing early as there was no one there) it's hardly the place you'd want to sit all night but plenty of people must want to have a nightcap before bed.

I booked the hotel largely based on reviews on this site, breaking my golden rule for short city breaks. I.e that the hotel should be right in the middle of the action. I can only blame myself but I was slightly disappointed. This hotel has a number of problems. Firstly location. It is situated on one of the most non descript streets in Amsterdam, a decent walk from the main nightlife, with very few cafes, bars or shops of any description. It is not much fun walking back late at night through deserted streets. The street outside the hotel, despite having a lot of traffic has virtually no public transport either. Having been in Amsterdam before I thought this slightly offside location would guarantee a decent nights sleep but the hotel is popular with the British stag trip crowd so you can expect to be woken between 4 and 5 at weekends by slamming doors and drunken voices singing the virtues of \"Inger-lund\" If the Brits dont wake you then the housekeeping will. The second issue are the prices. The room rates are not too bad for cental Amstaerdam (although this is stretching the idea of central) but everything else is expensive. Breakfast is a bit pricey at 13 euros (and quite mediocre) whereas internet acces in the lobby at 5 euros for 15 minutes is a total ripoff. Although the hotel is clean and fresh, the public areas are extremely souless and joyless.The bar/restaurant is possibly the least cosy I have experienced in many years of travelling.
