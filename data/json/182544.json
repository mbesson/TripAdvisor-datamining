I wondered if she might find the Vancouver landmark either too urban [lots of traffic, ditto people] or insufficiently posh [what, no boutiques?]. Built in 1912 and nestled into the West End, the Sylvia resembles a small, European hotel in, say, San Sebastian. It has been updated from time to time but will never achieve the efficiency of a modern chain hotel --- if that is what one is looking for. As for my niece, she was won over by the view of English Bay from our room and by the hotel's location: cross the street and you're on the beach; a little further on, and you're in Stanley Park; nearby Denman Street has great restaurants and markets. Our room appeared to have been recently painted and refurnished: the beds were extremely comfortable; the linens, first rate. On the less positive side, the bathroom lacked a fan, and there was a sharp step down from the bathroom to the sleeping area -- a night light or even some reflective tape would have been helpful. The hotel was also having problems with the Wi-Fi connection in the guest rooms while we were there. The computer in the lobby, which seemed to be more dependable, was also available for guest use.

We were upgraded to a suite overlooking English Bay on the 7th floor and were very pleased with our room. It was spotless and consisted of a bedroom, sitting room, and a small kitchen and bathroom. The views from the room were great and a Starbucks (for morning coffee) was right across the street. We parked the car and walked everywhere... There are several excellent restaurants within one block and you literally cross the street and walk onto the seawall to access Stanley Park. You are a bit far from the downtown core and you would probably have to drive or take the bus to reach the shopping malls, but we weren't there for the shopping, so this didn't matter to us. We had great walks into the park and around Lost Lagoon, beautiful eagles flew right by our hotel window and we enjoyed the view of the ocean beach. A short walk along the sea wall towards the south gets you to the Aquabus dock, where a little water taxi takes you across the water in about 3 minutes to Granville Island, where many shops and restuarants are located. This is also a great place to buy fresh produce and baked goods to take back to your room. The Slyvia Hotel is a heritage building, built in 1912, so it isn't a modern upscale place and it definitely has an older feel, but if you are planning to visit Stanley Park, the Vancouver Aquarium, Granville Island, or the West End of Vancouver, you couldn't ask for a better location.

The nine-story pre-WWI hotel is a Vancouver landmark, its vine-covered brick walls giving it the comfy look of an old dowager. I've stayed at the Sylvia many times over the last few decades (!), but was surprised this time at how good the rooms looked. They seem to have been spruced up with new furniture and paint, but without clashing with the building's style. Without going into too much detail, we made some heavy demands of the catering staff during one of their busiest times, and they amazed us with their kindness, thoroghness and efficiency. The hotel staff seem like one big family, and the decorations throughout the lobby and restaurant made the place seem even more homey. During our stay, we overheard a guest complaining rudely to the front desk that his room was not as large as one he had on a previous stay, and he demanded a larger room. The desk clerk quietly and professionally filled the man's request, despite the fact the hotel was likely full. It reminded us to take with a grain of salt any negative reviews we see for properties that seem to get generally good reviews. Some people are harder to please or simply have a bad day - these things should not be allowed to damage a good hotel's reputation. The Sylvia is a friendly older hotel with loads of character and in a superb location. They do a great job at looking after their guests, and the rooms are clean, comfortable, and well appointed.

The rooms they had always were lovely, a bit quirky compared to a chain hotel in a positive way, and comfy, clean, spacious, and with windows that open to your view of English Bay.

Apparently the hotel has been a hotel, then an apartment building, and again a hotel, so it explains the size and the layout.

The real plus, to my mind, was accessibility to the walk/bikeway that goes around Vancouver. I could walk into Stanley Park with ease. On the way it is easy to observe the water, ships, yachts, and a variety of wildlife. Most interesting were a pair of raccoons in a tide pool, scratching underwater for brunch.

In fact, I was just there last Friday. It's been my primary Vancouver abode when travelling there for over 20 years! For me it has everything, an incredible location on the beach a block away from Stanley Park, innumerable shopping and dining experiences nearby, and an atmosphere you won't find anywhere. Now for the hard facts. This hotel is in fact an elderly apartment building from the 1910's \"renovated\" into a hotel a long time ago. What renovated means is that they took the apartments and chopped them up. Some are big, some are small, none (at least in the old section of the hotel) are of standard size, shape or configuration. The furnishings have been upgraded over the last few years (if you think they are funky now, you should have seen them in the 80's) but luxurious is not a word applied at this hotel. Unique, quirky and irresistably charming do apply, but you must be in the right mood. This is not a boutique hotel. The building is old, the rooms of mixed caliber and decor, the plumbing variable(the higher up you go, the more the water pressure varies) and the heat (in winter) inconsistent. However, the food in the restaurant is excellent, room service prompt, the staff are incredible and the guests range from European hikers to American tourists and everything in between. You don't have to worry about rowdies or low life's, it's not cheap (though there are some deals on the smaller rooms - be warned though, they mean small) and your typical guest is likely to be more boomer than Gen X'er. Lovers of the more typical North American hotel experience would more likely enjoy themselves at the Coast Hotel on Denman, just a block away. Overall, if you like quirky, can handle some inconsistencies in amenities and don't get freaked by a total lack of Holiday Inn uniformity, then the Sylvia is for you.

The ceiling had a very odd texture on it (not a big deal, but it did stand out). The bathroom was more notable. When you sit on the toilet your knees literally touch the vanity. Beds were comfortable. *Location: Couldn't be much better in my mind. I suppose some could say that the distance from 'downtown' is a detractor, but we were easily entertained for 3 full days in this part of town. This part of town is very quiet and laid back. Stanley Park is a MUST do and a very short walk to the park entrance. A free shuttle runs around the perimeter of the park through the summer. It's a short (15 min) walk to water taxis for Granville Island. And if you are inclined to head downtown it's a pretty reasonable taxi ride. And if you're lucky enough to have nice weather English Bay beach is lovely! *The food: there is a restaurant/bar in the hotel which is always nice and convenient. The restaurant is pretty decent, but a little overpriced. The cocktails from the bar are nice and well priced. But you shouldn't limit yourself to the hotel. This area is a treasure trove of great local eateries. The sushi can't be beat - ask the front desk for any recommendations. They recommended Tanpopo. It looked a little shady to us, but it was so excellent and affordable that we went 2 nights in a row. This can be an expensive city so it's always nice to find a bargain.

The Sylvia hotel is one of those hotels you would love to restore to it's former glory with style and features which you know are in there but you just cant dig them out. What the Sylvia has is a great location - just over from the beach and a minute or so walk from Stanly park. Our party had 3 rooms each with their own querkyness. In one you could not stand up at the toilet because the sink unit was behind you. (great for the traveling businessman because they can sit their laptop on the vanity unit and work while sitting on the toilet). In another the windows would not stay open and slammed down (luckily not on anyone's fingers). One room consisted of a small single room plus 2 doubles in the adjacent room which would have been better knocked into one large room to allow for space. In a third there was a kitchen and separate lounge which also had a lack of anything to use in the kitchen. Towel sets seem to be given out sparingly as both rooms with 4 people only ever got 2 or 3 sets of towels. During our stay new furniture arrived in our rooms daily, firstly coffee tables, then chairs, then the pictures all got replaced. It became fun to guess what would be replaced next and I still wonder if this is part of the weekly entertainment at the Sylvia but I assume it is an attempt at updating. It would be better to spend some time decorating rather than changing the furniture. So if you are the type who likes clean modern hotels or elegant old world hotels then then this is not for you. But if you have a sense of humor, treat the hotel as a place to sleep rather than a home away from home, have a sense of adventure and want to be near the beach then this may well be the place for you.

I'm happy to report, however, that, if the old and much-loved Sylvia was gone for awhile, it's now back.

My room was large, spotless, if a bit sparely furnished. The bed was very comfortable. The carpet was in great shape, and the towels, which early reviewers complained were thin and stiff, were in fact just fine.

The hotel is a historic landmark in Vancouver and is situated right on English Bay and adjacent to Stanley Park and a main thoroughfare. Depending on the room type you get, there is a nice view of the bay, otherwise you'll get a fair garden view and vistas of the surrounding buildings. The exterior of the building is lovely ivy covered stone that greets you as you head towards it. The interior of the hotel lobby shows that the building is from the early 20th Century, and the lovely marble square staircase reminds you of a bygone era. However, the carpet, as well as the elevators are also of that era, and a bit cramped and slow, but it worked. Once you leave the lobby, you'll be greeted by dank hallways and doors smothered in several layers of old paint. Not very appealing at all. After you enter the room/suite, you'll be a bit more pleased, but not too much. The bathroom is modern, if small, but clean. For those particular about towels, the ones provided are thin and rough, and there aren't much in the way of toiletries. The general decor is slightly outdated and a bit spartan. The suite was spacious enough for all of us for the most part. We had a queen bed with a queen sofa bed suite with kitchen. The kitchen had new appliances that functioned well, and included dishes, utensils, towels and detergent. The kitchen is a convenient alternative to eating all of your meals out, although restaurants are plentiful and reasonably priced near the hotel and around the city. However, I don't recommend the restaurant downstairs. We had breakfast there one morning, and the food did not boast much in the way of taste and the temperature of the meals were tepid at best. Our waitress, while friendly, was a bit clueless and botched our orders, but I have to say the breakfast was average priced. That evening we returned for cocktails, and while the libations were good, the appetizers were wanting again in quality and temperature. We were served by another polite, but brain-dead member of the wait-staff. The front desk staff, were very friendly and eager to help. They made good recommendations and wanted to do what they could to ensure you had a good stay. The furniture (dresser) offered good storage, and the provided ample space. The suite also featured a TV with several channels, and windows that you could easily open and close. The queen bed that I slept in one night, was restful and the linens clean, however, the same can not be said for the sofa bed. It was thin, hard, and completely miserable. The bars that comprised part of the sofa poked through the flimsy mattress. It was impossible to get comfortable and we almost put the mattress on the floor to escape the torture. I was slightly dissapointed, as the photographs on the website, especially of the hallways, show an older and more classic feel, but in reality the hotel is a bit shabby in some respects, and there are several things that can be done to improve the look and feel of the hotel that would still help it to retain the ambiance and preserve the essence of that era. I don't think I will stay here again if I ever returned to Vancouver. It's not a bad place, but for what I paid, it wasn't that great, and there are many other places that can offer more for the same or lower price.

However, I would not stay at this hotel again. I stayed 11/7/07 through 11/10/07 (today). Please beware! There is major construction on-going on the entire first floor of the hotel. They didn't tell me about it when I made my reservation a month ago. Judging by the enormity of the project you should expect it to be on-going throughout the winter. They moved the lobby out into the foyer and set up some tables to substitute for a front desk. You literally have to wind your way through a maze of scaffolding to get from the \"lobby\" to the elevators, restaurant, and other exits. Seriously, I'm pretty certain it violates fire codes. There's no way what they set up is safe. Only one person can fit through the maze at a time. If someone is coming the other way with luggage you have to back out to the lobby and wait for them to pass. It may sound minor but it's not. The noise is very loud all day long. They start early in the morning. The walls are thin at this hotel. I wish they had posted this on their web site or at least told me when I made my reservation a month ago. I would have either stayed somewhere else or asked for a discount on the room, which I very much deserved and still do deserve. I was on the 2nd floor right above the construction and it had a hugely negative impact on my stay. I don't really know what others who have posted here mean about the friendly hotel staff. I did not experience that kind of treatment at all. I'm a pleasant enough person. I'm reasonable. The hotel was pretty much empty but they would not move me to another room when I checked in. I know it was empty because they had a board of room keys hanging on the wall behind the check-in table and it was practically full of keys. There were plenty of alternative available rooms. I was perplexed but figured I'd give the room a chance because they called it a \"suite.\" Well, it was pretty awful and calling it a suite is pretty funny. If this room was a suite then all Motel 6 rooms are suites. Please be aware that there are no amenities in the rooms; the floor-board heaters did not work. I asked for them to fix it but they said the repairman wasn't available and I never heard from them again. There is no coffee maker, no mini-fridge, one small 3-draw dresser under the TV, a very old TV with a broken remote control that was obviously purchased from another hotel, a tiny closet, and a window that would only stay open with a wooden slat placed under it to hold it up. I was afraid I might start a fire when I plugged my cell phone charger into the wall because the outlet looked like it had been installed in 1940. The carpet was old and dirty. I gave it the white sock test (walked around for a bit in my socks) and it failed. My socks were dirty. The worst was the mattress! Oh my! I woke up every morning with a back ache and that's not something I normally have problems with. I can sleep on a log, but the mattress was somehow worse than that. They said the bed was a queen-sized! It wasn't! It was a full-size! Hysterically funny that they would think people are that stupid. To get ice, you have to go to the lobby and ask for an ice bucket. There is one ice machine and it's in the \"lobby\" (foyer). Housekeeping took the ice bucket out of the room everyday. There is one soda machine in the lobby but the only button that worked was diet coke. None of the other drinks were available. There is no snack machine anywhere in the hotel. There's no continental breakfast. No coffee in the lobby (foyer). There's no gift shop/amenities shop and the nearest drug store is a 1/4 mile away. There were only two small glasses in the entire room. That's it - not even plastic cups. They don't use real bath towels. They are those half-size towels that feel like they were washed in sand and dried in an oven. Instead of preserving the architecture of the building, they put in generic drop-ceilings and painted the walls awful colors. It's NOT a boutique hotel or \"quaint\" as some have posted here. It's a mish-mosh of delapitated construction, path-work fixes, and borrowed furnishings. The very worst part of my experience was last night. I needed to check-in for my flight 24-hours in advance. They have a single PC in the lobby for guest use. They have wireless access throughout the hotel but my laptop isn't wireless enabled (something else they didn't tell me - they just said, \"Yes, we have internet access\"). Ha. I used (or, attempted to use) the lobby PC 4 times during my stay. It was only working on two of those occasions. Last night when it wasn't working I asked the woman at the foyer check-in table to help me. She came over, tried it, and it wasn't connecting to the internet. She said, \"Let me check my PC.\" (which was 5 feet away) She said, \"Mine's working fine.\" I asked, \"Can I use your PC to check-in online?\" explaining that I had to do it ASAP to get a good seat on my flight. She wouldn't let me use her PC! I explained to her that I was a guest at the hotel (giving her one last chance to redeem the hotel and my terrible experience) and that I would very much appreciate it if she'd let me use it this one time. She started to tell me why she couldn't do that but I interrupted her and asked if there was an internet cafe nearby. She said, \"Sure. Just go around the block...\" Well, that was yet another lie. The internet cafe she directed me to was a 1/2 mile walk. At this point my partner and I had had it. So, I'm confused regarding the so-called friendly service others encountered at the hotel. They didn't even smile at us or say hello when we checked in! You may ask why we stayed after the first night. It was a personal decision. We were on vacation and we had plans and tours to take so our time was limited. We didn't want to have to endure the hassle of finding another hotel, packing up our stuff, and going somewhere else. We figured it was just 3 nights. Now, we regret that. We should have left after the first night. I realize some of this sounds harsh. But it's all true.

We decided to have a waterfront lunch to cheer us up before reluctantly returning to book an overpriced $200/night room in a hotel where the room, the location and staff were all unappealing. We drove to the water and found a parking space which happened to be in front of an entrance to a small hotel. It turned out to be the Sylvia Hotel, a designated \" Heritage Building\" dating back to 1912. To our great relief they had a room available. The room we got seemed fairly new with a king sized bed overlooking a quiet tree lined side street. Not only was it one of the nicest rooms we saw, it was also the cheapest room at $159/night. Though the room had no air conditioning, and during our stay there was record breaking heat, the sea breeze always kept the room at a comfortable temperature. The location was fantastic. The hotel is in the area known as the west end . It is where the locals live and is full of small cafes, restaurants and stores. You just have to cross the road in front of the hotel to reach the beach of English Bay which is one of the entry points to Vancouver's Stanley Park. The hotel has an outdoor patio where you can eat or just sit with a coffee and enjoy the sunset over the ocean. The hotel is not modern, sleek or luxurious. The keys to the rooms are just that - keys. You lock your room and give them to the front desk, where friendly hotel personnel quickly learn your name and you become one of the hotel \"family\". Their advice for dining and places to see were spot on. The furniture in the lobby has seen better days, but the friendly atmosphere combined with the location and the price is one of Vancouver's best kept secrets. It turns out that the Sylvia Hotel has guests who have been coming to the hotel for years and this we found out while sitting in the lobby (where there is free wifi) and hearing comments by the other guests.
