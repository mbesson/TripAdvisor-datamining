The room was quite modern, warm and clean, although a bit small. If you are a smoker, note that smoking rooms are on 4th floor and the air in them is also clean. That's something that smokers do appreciate.Excellent breakfast,rich and tasteful,friendly stuff, if you don't speak german, they all do speak very good english,really value for money.The location around the hotel is nice ,kind of \"posh\", makes you feel secure, we were never afraid even though we were coming back to the hotel late at night (about 03 or 04 o'clock) You should also note that there's no room service at all. And no fridge, but we didn't mind. Now, the location. It's true that the metro stop is about 50 m away, but the hotel is not close to many attractions. It took us about 1 hour to berlinermauer. It's about 30 minutes to Alexanderplatz, where you usually change metro line or S-bahn (the connections are well-served and fast and you can buy tickets to the reception without extra charge) but it's close to other stuff, such as the zoo,which is great, the german opera, KaWeDe, so I guess it depends on what you want to see. From my experience, there are too many sites all around the city, so wherever you choose to stay, you'll have something close to you and something away.

Additionally, the rooms were quite small. The customer service wasn't the best - the staff were generally quite gruff. They don't really give you any help with local tourist information, so you're pretty much on your own. The only positive was that the breakfast spread was one of the best I've seen. I have stayed at a range of star hotels but they really had a great hot breakfast at Leonardo and the service here was quite prompt. Last but not the least, the Wi-fi service here is a total rip-off.

Room is big and comfortable and bathroom is modern. Only gripe will be there is no bathroom door so since we are 3 in a room, 2 had to really sit near the door so they won't see whoever is in the shower (if they sit watching the tv from the seating area, they can catch the reflection in the mirrors). Love the many windows in the room although we don't open it because our room look down into the garbage area but there is a small church behind our hotel and one can hear the bell chime at night. Hotel restaurant is classy and since we were there on Xmas eve, we were presented with chocolates and also champagne (yes, for breakfast).

Was in Berlin for a conference at ICC. Hotel was just a really short distance away from the metro station, and the ICC was easily accessible by the metro (if memory serves me right, it is only about two or three metro stations away). I had no problem arriving on time for the morning conference sessions. Breakfast was not included in the hotel price. But that was not a problem as there are some cafes around. There is also a supermarket round the corner from the hotel which sells a great variety of things at very reasonable prices. I bought a one liter bottle of mineral water for 0.50 euro! For the price I paid, I really wasn't expecting a lot from hotel Leonardo. But I was in for a pleasant surprise. The hotel rooms are spacious and the bathroom was huge. The bed was really comfortable too. I noticed that there are a lot of emergency push buttons in the room (one next to the bed, two in the bathroom). I don't know why there are so many of them in the room though. There are also grip bars installed in the shower and WC area, probably for safety as well. One night, I pressed the emergency button by mistake as I was looking for the light switch, and some one called the room soon after that to make sure I was okay. So the buttons do work... Wifi is not included in room charge. Service at check in and check out was adequate.

Good points: Helpful and polite staff, value for money, modern large comfortable rooms with large windows for more daylight from outside, only a few meters from Bismarckstrasse U-bahn station, nice relatively quite neighborhood with plenty of shops, super markets, restaurants and fast foods. Minor bad points: no refrigerator at the room, free but slow inconvenient internet access at the living-room next to reception area, very expensive breakfast rates(10-15 euros per person) for those that have booked accomodation without breakfast. Some tips: 1. Book only accomodation without breakfast to be included. You save a lot of money compared to the small nice cafes nearby that provide everything for a delicious breakfast with only 3-5 euros! including coffee or tea. 2. If you wish to visit Bundestag (German Parliament building) and especially its glass-made dome (it is worthwile) you have to prior register online at least 2-3 days before the day you plan to visit it, since it is a way to firstly screen your details, to see how many and at what time to expect their visitors 3. Issue an unlimited transportation card for the days you are going to stay in Berlin since you will definitely need it. U- and S-Bahn is very useful to get you around.

Hotel was very easy to find and is a two minute walk away from BismarckstraBe, we stayed from the Monday to the Friday. Don't expect a grand frontage or imposing location, the entrance is just a set of double doors like a shop front along a very unassuming side street. The reception area has a very minimalist 21st century feel to it. Reception was prompt, decent and of course for Berlin full English was spoken, despite my best efforts of broken German. We were allocated room 527 which we weren't too happy with as this was adjacent to the main elevators but thought we would give it a go. Room was spacious and modern with the customary flat screen TV although English channels were VERY limited. I think there were only 2 or 3 which were all the international news channels. We have previously stayed in Berlin and the hotel room offered a decent choice, so this was very disappointing, although we weren't in Town to watch TV, it is nice to catch up and put your feet up. The room didn't have a bath which was a disappointment and the toilet bowl a very odd design. Without going into too much detail the bowl was very shallow and didn't seem overly hygenic. Otherwise the large walk in shower was hot and powerful and everything else worked well. For one of the nights I didn't sleep well with the clacking of the elevator weights being very faintly heard, my partner also had a couple of iffy nights - this was more down to the room location than a fault of the hotel itself, I'm sure most of the other rooms were fine. There was quite a bit of construction work going on around the area too which often started quite early. The view from the room was average rather than exceptional. My advice would be do NOT buy any drinks from reception, these were around 2-3 Euros for a small drink - around the corner there is a supermarket which sells drinks for a much more reasonable charge, so prepare in advance. The restaurant looked clean and there is a small bar adjacent to the main reception although we didn't try this out. The location is very good for the West end shopping of K'Damm and there is another large shopping centre two blocks south of the hotel which has all your high street brands. Like anywhere located in the CBD of Berlin, transport is excellent so getting anywhere is pretty academic and for most well known locations takes no more than 30 minutes. I only paid around \u00a350 a night which is pretty cheap for Berlin - so I would say the hotel represents fair value for money but if you want to make the stay special spend a little more and go elsewhere. Have previously stayed at the Hotel Berlin twice and I would say little details made that superior for the extra money.

When you first come in, it looks like an average-sized room but after a couple of minutes inside, with your suitcases open, then you realise that it is effectively smaller than it appeared. The trick is the size of the bed: you assume is a regular one but in fact is narrower. The lack of separation between the sleeping room and the bathroom means that if you had to go during the night, when you switch the toilet lamp on, you light up the whole room and disturb your partner\u2019s sleep. Neither of the above should be a problem if you travel solo, but that was not our case. We had a similar experience with the hotel\u2019s car park. After getting the ticket on the barrier, we had access to a parking lot where only two spaces where free, and we soon discovered why: there were too small even for a compact car. So if you plan to get to the Leonardo on car, our advice is: 1) don\u2019t assume that there will be a place waiting for you, because the car park is quite small for such a big hotel; 2) if you drive a large car or a SUV, consider an alternative. In conclusion, we left the Leonardo with a mixed sensation: it could have been a very good choice for a solo traveller that gets there on taxi or public transport.

The hotel is only one block's walk from the bus stop on the corner of the Kaiser-Friedrich-Strasse and the Bismarckstrasse which is directly served by the 109 bus from Tegel airport. The area is calm, with a few local restaurants, including a good Italian and a good German opposite the hotel's entrance, which is not actually on the Wilmersdorferstrasse itself but round the corner on the Spielhagenstrasse. The hotel is only 300 meters if that from the Bismarkstrasse U-Bahn which is only three stops from Berlin Zoo, and which has a direct S-Bahn link to the Hauptbahnhof (Central Station). You can buy picnic ingredients locally, and the Rogacki delicatessen and stehcaf\u00e9 (standing up caf\u00e9) is just opposite the hotel. The hotel's bar is open in the evening, and the Brazilian bartender is friendly and efficient. I pointed out to the check-in staff that comments had been made about some of the bathrooms leading directly into the bed part of the bedroom rather than being off the entrance part of the room. If you want to have your bathroom 'separate' from the main sleeping area, please mention this to reception when booking and they will make sure that you get a room in this style. The bed was very comfy and the duvet light but warm. My 6th floor room was very quiet and there were 3 lifts so you didn't have to wait a long time before one arrived. The room was cleaned efficiently everyday, although the chambermaid was quite keen to start early - 8 am! The breakfast buffet was delicious, generous and fresh. Waiting staff were quick to remove crockery and cutlery that had been finished with, and to replenish the food. The free internet facility in the lobby was very useful, especially as you could use a printer directly ... checking in for a return flight was a breeze! It's a large hotel, and we noticed several tour groups during our stay. However, the hotel was not noisy, and the infrastructure was well suited to processing large groups very quickly. We found the secure baggage room very useful as we had a late evening departure, and appreciated the fact that valuable items such as laptops were locked away securely in a different location - the manager's office - and identifying numbered labels helped you get your items back very quickly. The staff were all very helpful and friendly, and coped with many different languages.

December is a great time to head to this fabulous City which has a large selection of Christmas Markets in a place that already has so much to offer. I would highly recommend Berlin as a city break but I would stay in this hotel again.", "Date": "December 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "pharmaas", "ReviewID": "UR45663055", "Content": "Spent 4 nights during our long weekend trip. Hotel is located in a quiet but interesting part of Charlottenburg, only 15 mins walk to the Palace. U-Bahn station Bismarckstra\u00dfe is on the same block, as well as restaurants and stores. Hotel is brand new, clean and neat. Rooms were fairly spacious with LCD screen. Rooms have internet connection, though a pay service. But there are 2 PC's with internet for free in the lobby. Service was typical Berlin style, efficient and polite. Breakfast was excellent with lots of choices, I recommend the French bread. I have stayed in tourist hotels in cities all over Europe, but this one beats them all in terms of price vs quality. 5 out of 5 on the tourist hotel scale. I will definitely be back!", "Date": "October 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "sweden", "Title": "\u201cMixed feelings - but hotel in it self overall good\u201d", "Author": "sannah_swe", "ReviewID": "UR45633702", "Content": "I have mixed feelings. This is overall a nice hotel as they opened in august this year. The hotel is located 30 sec from U-bahn BISMARKTSTRASSE and Wilmersdorferstrasse. You cant miss it. Its not the funniest location, but it is so close with u-bahn and if you want to save some money do it by taking the u-bahn 10 min in to the real city life. On arrival the person at the reception desk did not even notice us, I had so speak up to get attention (and yes we are over 18 and well dressed). We got our room on a high floor, the person at the desk did not say much. The Room ++++ The good part is that it is new = fresh! A flat screen TV, a good twin bed and a closet and safe. The Room ------ The shower is outside the toilet wich could be good but the lightening system is the same. So if you go up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet you wake up your partner as you turn on full lights just to go to the bathroom. Also you should not be shy to the person you are traveling with as the shower is right in front of the bed and you practically have to get out naked in front of the other person to get your towel. Pillows in bed - probably one of the worst I have slept on ever. If you are picky - bring your own! Barstaff - Wanted to borrow a glass of icecubes to our white wine in the room. The man asked me if I had 2 Euro. I said as you se sir, i did not even bring my keycard to the room. He ignored me some minutes then said again. \" - So how would you like to do\"? I answeded i could just go up, pour out the ice and go back right away. He said its not possible, because how could he know I would not STEAL the glass. This made me reaky pissed off so I gave him my private jewellery just to give him something. The glass was from Ikea and worth 0,50 cent. To me this was very dissapointing, as this musut be one of the most common questions in a hotel. Overall - Hotel and room itself - good. Staff - Many things to work on!!!! I would still reccomned it though, if you dont want a hotel where you can chat with the staff and care mre bout room/good prices.", "Date": "October 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "greece", "Title": "\u201cNice Basic Business Hotel\u201d", "Author": "smurf77", "ReviewID": "UR44741090", "Content": "I stayed at the Leonardo Hotel while attending a conference at The International Congress Centrum Berlin (ICC Berlin). The hotel is just around the corner from the Metro station and the ICC is two stops and a short walk away, so it is close enough without having to pay too much. The Metro is also on one of the main lines that will take you directly into the central tourist areas. The hotel itself was clean and comfortable. Rooms had a TV (all in German though) and air-conditioning. No fridge or iron, but you could pay for the laundry service which was a bit expensive. Wireless Internet is available for a cost of about 11 Euros for 24 hours. The bathroom had a nice shower and a decent hairdryer and was clean. Check-in is no earlier than 3pm (especially in busy times), but they do have a luggage room for storage until you get to your room. The breakfast was excellent consisting of the usual tea, coffee, breads, jams, eggs, sausages, muesli, yogurt, cheeses, cold meats and salad. The waiting staff, however, were a bit slow and more interested in clearing up than serving most of the time. The reception desk was always busy and although polite, the staff were not very knowledgeable about the area. I also had problems getting internet access on occasions because the hotel was fully booked and they had run out of internet codes, something I have never experienced before, so get yours early! Overall a good hotel, but staff could use a bit more training and they need to address their internet usage capacity problem.", "Date": "September 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leiden, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel\u201d", "Author": "Mel071", "ReviewID": "UR43938089", "Content": "My husband and I have just returned from one of our many trips to Berlin.

Although they advertise of free Wi-Fi, we found out that we have to pay for it and it is quite expensive. On our last day, the hot water was not working and when we complained of it, they apologized and said they are experiencing some difficulties with their water system and instead provided us with free breakfast, which had a very good choice.
