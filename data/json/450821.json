It was not until we checked into the two rooms that we discovered the rooms were filthy. There was black mold in the bathroom. The shower door didn't close. There were big cobwebs in the corners. The entire place is right next to a huge rice field, so there are tons of mosquitoes everywhere. The beds don't have mosquito nets. The person at the front desk immediately tried to sell us a dolphin tour right after we arrived. There is a beach at the end of the long finger of land the hotel sits on, but there are many touts and we quickly learned that kept most hotel guests off the beach. After just 50 minutes in this dive of a hotel, we packed up all our stuff and told the hotel front desk we weren't staying. THEY INSISTED ON CHARGING US 1/2 PRICE FOR EACH ROOM even though we had been there less than an hour. This place is awful. We stayed for a month in Bali, and didn't ever ever encounter anything nearly as bad as this place.", "Date": "Jul 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR464437036", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "HawaiiSun07"}, {"Content": "Good Staff is friendlyfood is good but too internationalsmall swinning pool beach is small with black sandtypical rooms holidays for rest (quiet)", "Date": "May 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR467536800", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "fab78"}, {"Content": "Our time at Aneka Lovina We arrived at Aneka Lovina by car from Ubud with no reservation and asked if any rooms were available. We were shown a very nice villa unit and negotiated the price.(approx 30% of the published rate) We stayed 5 or 6 nights and where happy with the resort.The room was quite large, the bed was very comfortable and the a/c and the fridge worked well.The pool and gardens were very beautiful and inviting.The staff were very pleasant (as most balinese are)The locals who sell watches,massage,sarongs etc on the beach are not to pushyand if you take the time to have a chat with them they are all really nice people.There are a few minor negatives however-The bathrooms are a little dated--but are very clean.We were woken very early (5am) by the other guests going on the dolphin tour.My wife contracted a upset stomach after eating at the restoraunt.However we did enjoy our stay and would go back again", "Date": "May 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR872168707", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "gordy2539"}, {"Content": "l'horreur ....   showReview(21216631, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR319990363", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "ParisSuperbob"}, {"Content": "Le truc a touristes !       la piscine", "Date": "Jul 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR411014562", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "noemie1702"}, {"Content": "\u9288\u581b\u4e9c\u9289\u6d96\u5110\u9289\ue0a0\u4ef9\u9287\u6b0d\u501b   showReview(19171973, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR793187270", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "finalement, assez acceptable ...       jardin", "Date": "Feb 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR158079385", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "lamourestharmonie"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g469403-d450821-r18701716-Aneka_Lovina_Beach_Hotel-Lovina_Bali.html", "HotelID": "450821", "Price": "$57"}}
