The rooms are so big and so poshy, elegant and fashionable. Upon arrival we were given a free room upgrade + free wifi in the room too. The bathroom is very elegant too. We requested to stay on a top floor to have views of the city. Upon arrival and once checked into our room, we received a complimentary welcome fruit platter. Every day, they leave a complimentary big bottle of water in the room. The spa is so beautiful!! I have never seen such a big jacuzzi with comfortable seatings in it. The breakfast is amazing too but costs around EUR 40 per person. The hotel is very centrally located with many restaurants and shops on the same street. Just 30 seconds away, there's a train station. The staff at the help desk are very very helpful. The hotel is a non-smoking hotel apart from 1 bar which is smoking. The only drawback we had was that one evening, there was a red carpet event and we went to this bar to have a smoke and they told us that the bar is out of reach for that evening. So we had to literally go out of the hotel to smoke which was quite uncomfortable since there were a lot of cameras and elegantly dressed people.

With the exception of one night (when there was a party in the ballroom), it was extremely quiet. When I called reception to inquire about the noise, they immediately offered to relocate me to another room where I wouldn't hear any noise. I was too tired to move, but the party ended within an hour and a half, so I was okay with that. I then settled into dreamland and, again, slept like a baby. As for the spa, I only used the pool, but it was quite nice for swimming laps. Also, the spa and hotel room had excellent rain shower heads. The hotel is nicely designed with a contemporary flair, the rooms are a nice size and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I really enjoyed my stay there. As for location, it worked for me. It's not in a tourist location, but if you want to get to the tourist areas, the metro is across the street and taxis are easily accessible directly around the corner from the hotel. As for shopping, there are two malls within walking distance of the hotel. I found Istanbul to be a wonderful place filled with friendly people and, of course, a very comfortable and enjoyable hotel experience at the Edition. The only thing you may want to consider, when returning to the airport, is walking around the corner from the hotel to the taxi stand. By doing so, you can negotiate your own rate to the airport.

I really don't think that is debatable. And if you are traveling for business it may be a perfect place, but I am guessing most people that read this aren't traveling for business primarily. The hotel is located in probably the most bland financial district around, you have a couple options to eat, but both are in malls, that are a short walk. To me a mall isn't the place you really want to eat when on vacation. Secondly, you know that feeling you get when you go through airport security? Well it's like that every time you go in and out of your hotel. As they have a TON of security around the place, and you put your items through an Xray machine and you go through a metal detector as you enter the property.. Nothing says welcome home quite like that! Now I do understand why they have this security, as this building was once a bank ( its got a definite bank feel throughout) and was Bombed several years back, it just isn't representative of the city/ country. Its an optimistic 30 mins from where the touristic sites are. We travelled for a fast trip and wanted to see all the defacto standard Istanbul items.. well they are at minimal of 30 mins away no matter the mode of transportation, and in a cab, its probably a bit more as traffic is horrendous at best. Yes there is a metro just on the next block, but if you don't have much time to learn it then its probably not your best bet, as its 7 interchanges before getting to the Blue Mosque / Hagia Sophia etc area. Another item, I don't want to feel like I am ranting.. ok maybe I am. But, we took a couple day trips (FULL day trips) to other sites of Cappadocia and Ephesus that just wore us out completely from 4am-11pm so when we got back to the hotel we were totally exhausted to put it mildly. We attempted to have a glass of wine when we got back from one of these excursions to \"wine down\" and as one could imagine we were not wearing our sunday best, nor looking like a million dollars either. Although we weren't looking trashy at all either, we were barely acknowledged in the semi full bar, as the after work posh crowd was given full attention. 2 glasses of house wine was about 60 bucks, which is fine, but give me a little attention, ask if we would like more, a snack something is all I ask.

The Harry Cipriani had poor service, 1 high chair in the entire restaurant, which was strange and overall a poor unexpected service experience. I am sure it will be better with time as they iron the kinks out, but I will be back.

Although this property is a bit far from old town, its simple to navigate the public transportation (right outside the front door) to get anywhere you need to go. The biggest kudos we want to give the Edition however is the service. We were greeted upon arrival by the manager on duty, and all staff we encountered throughout our stay were so polite and helpful. We truly felt like VIPS, and they went out of their way to ensure our honeymoon was enjoyable. I am not sure if Cenk is still there, but he was FABULOUS as a concierge. He helped me so much before our arrival with tips, maps, restaurant recommendations, and sat with us upon while in Istanbul to go over our stay in detail and offer tips, etc. He offered a guide to us at no cost (which i forgot to take him up on prior to arriving), so instead he provided a complimentary luxury transfer back to the airport upon departure. He was amazing.

True 5 star places offer style and substance...the Edition is attempting style but provides no substance. 1. I requested a loft room with a terrace on a high floor - I arrived to find that my room was on the second floor beside a 4 lane carriage way. It was deafening an not possible to sit out there for more than 5 minutes. Also the terrace was shared with the room next door. I complained and was shown another room with a much better terrace, but the room was tiny. 2. The restaurant attached to the hotel is Le Caprice, all meals / rooms service were prepared by Caprice and the price of the food reflected this. However, the room service breakfasts were terrible. The order arrived either completely wrong or with missing items 4 mornings out of four. The breakfast was also of poor quality and cooked badly. 3. I decided to use the Rain Shower in the bathroom only to find that I had flooded the entire bathroom and part of the hotel room. I contacted the manager who advised that this was a known problem - there was a design flaw which meant the water did not drain away. 4. The bedside light wouldn't go off, it took some time for me to convince the hotel staff that I couldn't wait until tomorrow to have it fixed and that in order for me sleep someone needed to come and fix it now. In the end they send someone to turn part of the electricity off in the room. 5. Maid service was erratic, we had turndown twice out of 4 nights After my stay I contacted the hotel again about the problems I encountered. They apologised and said that the breakfast had been outsourced due to problems in the Caprice kitchen and that the design faults with rooms were being rectified. they did offer me a free upgrade if I come back and stay with them again, but I won't be taking them up on their offer.", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Hotel - Remarkable Helpful Staff\u201d", "Author": "rbg3", "ReviewID": "UR117673460", "Content": "We choose the Edition over The Ritz using Marriott Points and couldn't have been happier.

The location of the hotel isn't ideal for vacationers, but it is directly upstairs from the metro, which is particularly easy to use (and if you have any questions on how to get anywhere, the front desk has help cards with directions you can take).

I checked out today the 17th of July after 4 nights in room 504 and i was truly sad to say goodbye to what was the nicest, kindest, warmest and most hospitable team I have had the pleasure to be served by. I am someone who frequents the Four seasons, The Chedi and other GHM properties but never before have I been so impressed by a small boutique city hotel- its is simply Exceptional. The rooms are large and fabulously designed with an impeccable attention to detail, the bed feels like a Duxiana or a Hastens and is just WOW !. The rooms are truly delightful and this level of excellence is carried forward into the incredible spa and gym and the wonderful silver tiled pool. The only negative i would bother to comment on is the breakfast which is far below the standard expected- it was a poor spread and rather amateurishly managed and certainly not in keeping with the standard of the property. Cenk the Concierge introduced us to Istanbul in a manner no other could , out every meal, our day schedule was all so superbly recommended that we could not thank him enough. Any concierge could recommend the fancy mainstream places but Cenk found us well priced super restaurants and great venues to ensure we experienced the city the best possible way we could - I urge any reader to simply allow him to plan your every day and trust in his judgegement. I can go on but in conclusion i and my family Loved our stay here, we would not stay anywhere else- the location is fantastic and so so central and convenient .. I would award this Hotel 9 of 10 (the negative 1 mark is only for the poor breakfast).
