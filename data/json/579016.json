Going to the airport the stop is three blocks from the hotel. There is a metro stop a block and a half from the airport. The area around the hotel has many restaurants bakeries. I have only one complaint - the volume on the tv's only gos to six. I have a hearing disablity and asked if I could get the volume turned up. I was told the manager (no one would provide me her name) was not going to have other guests brothered by old people or people with hearing disabilities needing the volume louder.

Our room faced the main street and was fairly spacious. We had a large shower, plenty of storage and a mini bar.

Breakfast was simple but the pastries and coffee were lovely, and I liked the fact breakfast was served untill 11.30am which was great after a late night. The hotel is well located for exploring the beautiful streets of Barcelona. Playa de Catalunya is a 10 minute walk or the underground is a couple of mins down the street. We got a 4 day travel card (\u20ac56 for both) and used the tubes to get around everyday - very easy to use and clean! We got to/from the airport with the aerobus which located 200 metres from the hotel. The buses run every 12 mins and cost \u20ac5.30 one way. There are plenty of restaurants near the hotel. A short walk north takes you into the Eixample area where we ate out the most. We had tapas at La Fluta which was around \u20ac40 for 2 (incl. drinks) and we had a fab steak at 9 Renias Argentinian. This was expensive but not a typical tourist haunt - def more local. We went to the 7 sins bar a couple of times and drinks were very reasonable unlike the street cafe we sat at in Ramblas - \u20ac17 for 2 drinks (1 of which was non-alcoholic!). As a final must, get a pastry from the patisserie near the Universitat tube station - so many to choose from but a great indulgence after all that sight seeing!", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelona, Spain", "Title": "\u201cBasic Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Andy_betshemesh", "ReviewID": "UR125387914", "Content": "Room was small, with barely a desk to work on.

The hotel is well placed just about 2 minutes walk off the Pl. De Universitat (may have spelled that wrong but it's the University Square) which is one of the stops for the Aerobus from the airport. This is an economical way to get into the city at 5.30 Euros each way or 9.10 return and runs very frequently from just outside the airport terminal. We arrived fairly early to check in at about 11 am but the very helpful receptionist told us our room was ready anyway so we were able to go straight up. The hotel is quite modern and very clean, the bathroom was spotless with a walk in glass shower cubicle and everywhere felt very comfortable. We were given a walking map of Barcelona and left to find Las Ramblas, it didn't take us long at all and Barcelona is made up mainly of blocks similar to American cities so it's easy to find your way around. Our first day it rained more or less all day so after a couple of hours walking we were glad to be able to return to the hotel to read and relax especially as we'd had to leave home just after 3am to get to Gatwick for our flight. The following morning we had breakfast which was included in our stay and there was a good selection of everything including scrambled egg and bacon but the hot food was luke warm at best. This was the day we would join our cruise so we checked out but were allowed to leave our luggage until we were ready to go to the port and went to the Sagrada Familia, we asked directions at reception and were told the best way was on the metro the station for which was only about 100 yards away, this day was far more enjoyable as the sun was shining though it was still cold but it was the end of January what more could we expect. We enjoyed our stay at the Advance and when the sun was shining we enjoyed Barcelona, if we return we may well use the Advance hotel again as it is well positioned, clean, smart and comfortable.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for a city break\u201d", "Author": "JaneandDavid63", "ReviewID": "UR124746780", "Content": "Being just a few minutes walk from La Rambla, this hotel is in a quieter part of the city.

I was offered free breakfast for the 2 days that I stayed. The wifi was pretty good and up to speed considering that I was on the 4th floor.

I slept very comfortably at night. Customer service was superb! The two lovely ladies who manned the front desk during the morning and evening shifts did a great job.

The decor is possibly not to everyone's taste, but no problem for us. The hotel and rooms were very clean, although our room was a bit on the small side. The walls also seem to be very thin as we could hear a lot of noise from inside the room, particularly when other rooms were being cleaned, which seemed to start around 7am. First floor rooms at the back of the hotel have patios outside which is nice, however it did mean we were woken up early one morning to the sound of metal chairs scraping across the tiles as the maid cleaned next door's patio. We had the hotel breakfast which was again adequate but not the largest selection I have ever seen. The staff are very helpful and friendly and the hotel has good wifi coverage throughout, if that is important to you. In terms of location, the bus from the airport drops you only a couple of streets away so it is easy to get to. It is also very close to major metro stations, so very good if that is how you intend to get around. If you want to walk, it is around 5/10 minutes to the top end of the Ramblas and about half an hour walk to get across the old town or to the beach so the location is convenient, but not right in the middle of the action - probably good for people who want to get out of the tourist areas but stay within reasonable distance. Overall, had a good stay here but I wouldn't say it had any 'wow' factor for me.

This was my first trip travelling alone and being a female I wanted something in a safe and good location and I found it at the Advance Hotel. The rooms are nice and modern and the bathroom was quite large for European standards. It's a short 2 block walk from the University Square and very easy to get to and from the Airport. I took the Eurobus from the Airport to University Square and walked with my suitcases 2 blocks until I was at my hotel. The Eurobus is only $5.30 Euros each way. On the return the Eurobus is 2 blocks down from the hotel to catch going back to the airport. Catalyna Square and La Rambla are only a 5-10 minute walk as well. The hotel is on fairly busy street and can be noisy at night so if your a light sleeper I would suggest asking for a room in the back of the hotel. Previous to going to Barcelona I heard it was known for pick pocketers. As long as you take precaution I don't think it wold be an issue. I had a money belt that clipped on the inside of my clothes and had a small pack that I wore in front of my body and everywhere I went I felt safe.

I'll start with the pro's of this hotel. 1) The room was clean and modern. I found it to be a bit on the small side, but we had a very nice terrace and a sliding door out to it making it seem very spacious. 2) The staff were very polite and helpful with directions, recommendations, and phone calls requiring a Spanish speaking person. 3) We arrived early from our all night flight and there was no problem checking-in which was greatly appreciated 4) Very quiet. I was concerned after reading about paper thin walls and the fact that I am a very light sleeper. It was very quiet and we didn't hear a thing the entire time we were there. We had a room on the 5th floor (the top floor), and we had no one above us - that may have helped. The con's: 1) I was some what disappointed with the location. It's true that it is an easy 10 -15 min walk to Las Ramblas, but we found the neighborhood itself to be a little \"sketchy\" - it was on the boarder of being seedy. We stayed here because we were told that Las Ramblas could be sketchy. We found Las Ramblas to be quite nice...although probably noisy at night if you had a room facing the street. 2) There wasn't a business center. Unless you bring a laptop, you will only have access to 1 computer tucked into a dark corner of the small lobby, and it's 1 euro for 15 mins of use with no printing capability. The desk will print something for you if you need it (such as boarding passes) However, for a hotel that is ranked with 4 stars, I was surprised by the lack of services and ammenities. TIPS: There is a restaurant directly across the street rom the hotel that was VERY good - one of the best we had in Barcelona (La Bodega). If you walk out of the hotel and turn right there is a little joint on the corner that has the best cup of coffee in the city and wonderful pastries and breakfast. Two coffee con leches and two croissants were less than 2 euros. They open quite early, and we had breakfast here every morning before going on our adventures. Each a wonderful lunch the Boqueria market on Las Ramblas - delicious, fresh, and a great value...one of the few value meals we had on this trip.", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cModern hotel, but ants in the room were a dissappointment\u201d", "Author": "Travelers804", "ReviewID": "UR99060108", "Content": "Hotel Advance has a sleek modern lobby.

The Area is a bit gay with a rather curious bar just down the road but the local cafes and bars are pleasant and cheap compared to Ramblas which is a ten minute stroll through some really nice streets. Markets galore at the weekend, Babs had a field day. Parking is a pain in the neck and frankly a car is probably a waste of money. We needed it as our flight came in at Gerona and left from Barcelona. the underground parking which is only a few feet from the hotel cost about \u00a350 for the two nights. Next time I will get a bus into town and hire a moped for the weekend, much easier to get around on and park and driving in barcelona is a piece of cake compared to other european cities. Pretty much everything we would want to do is within a 30 minute walk from the hotel or you can jump on one of the tourist buses which cover all the major touristy things. I still think the best fun is to be had sitting in wee cafes watching the world go by though and this is a good area to do that in without being ripped off.

Once off, cross the square and head to the right and walk down Ronda de Sant Antoni, then right on Sepulva. Hotel will be on your left side. To catch the A1 aerobus back to the airport, I'm afraid you have to catch it at Playa de Catalunya (in front of the Ignes de Cortes shopping mall). It's 10-15 minute walk to top of the Ramblas. It got quite of a walk after sightseeing all day, so we used the very accessible Universtat Metro line stop 2 blocks from our hotel. Easy to negotiate. Buy the T10 card at the machines. Way cheaper. Hotel: The staff was really nice and helpful. The hotel smelled like scented candles, which to me was a little off-putting. The breakfast was standard but I wouldn't pay 15 euros like some other reviewers. Ours was included in package. If you have a choice, don't buy the breakfast, there a million breakfast options within 1-2 blocks for cheaper! The free internet wi-fi was spotty at times, but I do appreciate it being free.

Booked the hotel based on a good rate from Expedia (approx $100 USD per night), location, and pictures of a modern hotel. Location: the hotel is centrally located, near the University Square and Metro station. It is a 5-minute walk to Catalunya Square or to the top end of La Rambla. I was able to walk to all major sights (La Rambla, Barri Gothic, Picasso Museum, Gaudi Buildings) easily from the hotel within 15-20 minutes. The Metro is also very close, although I only rode it one time. Note that the airport bus also stops very close to the hotel. My favorite thing about the location was being so close to everything, but on a nearby street that while busy, was much less busy than others nearby. Room: the room was modern and as shown in the pictures, if on the smaller side (as European hotels tend to be). The bathroom was extremely modern and tastefully decorated. The bed was not the most comfortable but it worked good enough. The heating worked well in the winter, and I believe there was AC if you're travelling in Summer. In short, the room was very modern, as pictured, clean, and in good shape. Service: the check-in service was great, but friendliness at other times could be spotty. One woman in particular was rather icy and unhelpful, but it didn't really matter to me. Overall nothing to raise a red flag here. Amenities: there is free wifi in the rooms, and a computer in the lobby that charges 1 euro for 15 minutes (accepting 1-euro coins only). However, right around the corner is an internet cafe that charges 50 cents for 30 minutes - I'd go there instead. The hotel has breakfast also, but it's more expensive than the cafes/bakeries/sandwich shops nearby. All in all, I'd use these other facilities before paying more for the hotel's offerings.

We were also disappointed that our so-called \"king\" bed was in reality two single beds pushed together.

Nothing special - most things previous reviewers said were true: dead-quiet lobby, street noise, rice-paper thin walls. The front desk staff was very helpful, but maybe its in Nov, but the hotel was \"dead\" i.e. no one else was ever in the lobby, rarely saw other guests, etc. The hotel is very chic, and has potential - so not sure why it shouldn't be livelier. Convenient location to get to most sites, although it is more on the east end of the district (by no mean is it outside of the Rambla area, as its still only 5-10 min walk). I wouldn't recommend getting breakfest there, as there is a great bar/corner cafe just up the block. It is a convenient location to the Raval area. Pros: - good location, off the beaten path - convenient to Raval area - friendly and helpful front desk staff (can arrange early morning cabs to Airport) Cons: - no atmosphere at hotel (at least in Oct) - very thin walls (hope for quiet neighbours) Would I stay here again if I was back in Barcelona?

Wonderful experience! Great modern decor. Wonderful attentive service. Extremely clean. Fantastic location (less than ten minute walk to Placa Catalunya and Las Ramblas). Lots of good, local restaurants within walking distance. Extremely reasonably priced. Service was top notch. Cristina at the front desk spoke perfect English and gave our group great tourist advice as well as a wonderful help in resolving a missing bag issue with Iberia Airlines. This hotel is only about a year old and is in wonderful condition. Warning to those who like soft mattreses - their mattresses are EXTREMELY firm. However, every hotel I've stayed at in BCN is this way. They serve breakfast, but it is expensive. The hotel staff recommended some of the neighborhood restaurants and bakeries. For some great home-cooked food, check out the \"Forn de Pa\" (Catalan for \"The Bread Oven\") across the street from the hotel (near the end of the block). Wonderful homestyle food (tortilla espanola, homemade quiche, pizza, croquettes, tuna empanada). I spoke to the owner who said her secret is \"absolutely no processed food\". Keep in mind that a lot of the smaller, mom & pop stores and restaurants in BCN still observe the siesta and close between 2pm and 5:30pm. Make sure to plan accordingly! As this hotel is fairly new and fairly small, be sure to have the address with you to give to the taxi driver at the airport. For two people and five suitcases, it was only about 25 euros to get to the hotel. For those leaving on a cruise, a taxi to the port only cost about 10 euros, bags included.
