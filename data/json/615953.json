And once again, we had a wonderful experience, enjoying their very traditional Japanese hospitality. All of the staff were unfailingly kind and helpful, particularly Mr. Hiroyuki Yajima, the general manager. There's a very sleek and comfortable new shower room on the second floor, which is generally intended for western visitors. The Japanese bathhouse on the lobby level continues to be a relaxing delight. And don't be concerned about using the communal toilets on each floor...they're western-style, spotlessly clean, and have all of the high-tech amenities peculiar to Japan, including heated seats and cleansing sprays from below! The cafe which adjoins the lobby is also a nice spot for either western or Japanese breakfasts. We now tend to think of the Hotel Kamogawa as our home-away-from-home when we're in Tokyo, and can hardly imagine staying anywhere else in that huge, amazing city.", "Date": "Jan 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR358185092", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Japan0phile"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066461-d615953-r14387847-Family_Hotel_Kamogawa-Taito_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "615953", "Price": "$58"}}
