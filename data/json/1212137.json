It is smack in the middle of the Museumplein, so very central and within (mostly walking) distance of all major 'sights' in the city. The hotel/hostel is situated on a very quiet 'pedestrian' side street; though, facing a primary school building so there are children playing in the street during play-times in the day....but that was nice. The street itself runs off one of the the very chi-chi 'Bond Street - type' roads famous in Amsterdam; so leave wallets behind if taking your partner shopping !! My single room, facing onto the back of the hotel, was quiet, beautifully-decorated (with a large Van Gogh mural on the wall behind the bed, of course), clean, and fully furnished; including brand-new (shower) bathroom & fittings, flat-screen TV, lift access to 4th floor etc There is WiFi throughout the hotel and the #5-Euro breakfasts are in a communal area next to the lobby with all the standard 'help-yourself' foods and facilities of any major hotel in the city. Only difference is that guests have to put away their trays and used items; which is a fun 'change' from the fussy performance of the normal 4*/5* hotels where I normally stay; and where the breakfasts can cost up to #80Euro's ! Being a hostel - even if a classy one - most residents are young (late teens/twenty's) so the atmosphere is 'buzzy' but civilised. The front-desk staff are efficient, rather than overly friendly, but this is fine, and they are very helpful about transport & tourist information e.g telling me how to get a #4Euro bus-ride to the airport ,vs #50Euros by taxi !! The latter price is what I paid for the room per night!

However as we were a bit late getting there, when we arrived we were told by the staff on night duty that they had assumed we were no longer coming. Luckily after some arguing and having to fork out an additional 10% booking fee (that we did not know much about) we were able to check in.

I asked him how much a tram into the city centre would cost and this seemed to annoy him greatly. Also, the lift doesn't work and like most Amsterdam hotels the stairs are steep. If you have a lot of luggage it might be a struggle to get it up them. The hotel's in a good location, but there are much nicer places near museumplein for around the same price.", "Date": "June 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cGood stay\u201d", "Author": "wen_c82", "ReviewID": "UR108995351", "Content": "I came across this hotel by accident as my first preference was booked and I want a clean room, this is just renovated. The hotel is in a perfect location for my purpose - visiting museums. You can take tram 2 or 5 and get off at Van Gogh Museum stop then walk a couple minutes. It is across from Hotel Fita. when I first arrived I thought it has a more hostel vibe. Indeed the hotel has a hostel on one side and hotel on the other side and they shared front desk and dining facility. When I was there it was quiet and I got a good night sleep. I reserved a twin room just because I know how small hotel room size can get in Amsterdam. My twin room was simply furnished with a 32 inch flat panel TV. The room was a slightly bigger than 2 beds so if you have a lot luggage this may be a problem. The bathroom was brand new also, clean with a big shower. - better than a 4 stars hotel I stayed. The check in process was a bit slow as the receptionist was new. I like the fact that WIFI is free and throughout the hotel. They also have 2 computers for you to use. Hotel charges 5 euro for breakfast which I think it's a good value in Amsterdam.", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunnyvale, California", "Title": "\u201cGo somewhere else\u201d", "Author": "CoreyBaird", "ReviewID": "UR107591927", "Content": "I booked a room at this hostel for one night and when I arrived the booking was made for the previous day. This was completely my fault and I would not normally write a review over this however how the staff handled the situation deserves mentioning. I waited in line for 15 minutes while the Asian male clerk handled an irate traveler in front of me. During this time he talked down to another staff member (Indian Female) which I thought was very rude. When it was my turn to check in he looked at the dates said I was late handed me back my paperwork and said in a snobby tone 'you late, you card already charged, goodbye.' In my brief moment that I was there and what they will not tell you on their website is there is a pre-school across from the front door with kids running and screaming during the day hours and the hostel is under construction. Just worth mentioning. I also found another hostel (Anne Marie) that was close by and the staff was awesome.", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel Aviv", "Title": "\u201cUnder par -- and worse by the day\u201d", "Author": "topmooi", "ReviewID": "UR32665145", "Content": "I stayed in Amsterdam many times over the past 40 yrs.-- in basic to comfortable accommodations, but never in luxury ones.
