From Roma Termini central station, tram 5 and 14 have good frequency. The tram stops right in front of the hotel. However, please talk to hotel staff to get directions. (That is what I did.) The hotel is on the 7th floor. The lift is very small - only for two people. No space for baby wagen. We reached early in the morning. The room was not ready, but they allwed us to leave our bag with them. Our room was on the 6th floor. But we always have to enter the 7th floor and then walk all the way to other side and take the steps down to 6th floor. There is a tram depo nearby so there will be some sound throught the night. Some staff is not good in English. But John is good. He also gave good information on some other questions about Rome. The room size was okay for what you pay. But the shower was leaking. The bathroom door was not closing properly. The whole area smells of cigarette smoke. If these things could be fixed and price reduced further, this hotel is a good bait if you want to save your euro.", "Date": "September 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelona, Spain", "Title": "\u201cAvoid this \"hotel\"\u201d", "Author": "jitbag", "ReviewID": "UR21477486", "Content": "Everything about this place is a scam. The \"hotel\" is actually on the 7th floor of a residence building, and nowhere near anything. Termini is about a 20-30 minute walk, and the trams are nearby. Upon arriving at the designated check-in time, the hotel clerk advised that the rooms weren't clean, and I had to wait almost an hour. This wasn't so pleasant after arriving from the airport with all my bags. The room was ok, but rather dirty. The shower didn't work, tv didn't work, and there were dirty stains EVERYWHERE. And to top it off, when I asked about the complimentary breakfast (included in the booking price), I was told they don't offer it. Then I saw them serve another guest breakfast in their room...don't stay here. It's cheap, but it isn't worth the trouble.", "Date": "November 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boise, Idaho", "Title": "\u201cSteer away from this hotel.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3658291", "Content": "My family and I ended a great trip to Italy with three nights in Rome. We booked rooms at the Amico Hotel before we left, which was convenient. However, the hotel promises rooms as low as 49 Euros and a shuttle from Termini Station. In actuality, they do not offer a shuttle and the rooms for 49 use a common bathroom, which looked like a utility closet, with paint and supplies stored inside. We ended up spending 69-100 Euros per room (depending on the number of beds). Finding the hotel was tricky, as it is quite a long distance from the Termini Station (although a direct route of the tram will take you quite near). We found ourselves in a very seedy neighborhood, 7 floors up by way of a tiny elevator that holds only 2 people. There was no food available, and no place near in the neighborhood. There is no lobby, but a desk area where you may find an attendant, and he or she won't speak English. The hallways are very dark and dingy and the rooms smell of stale smoke. Depending on the room you get (we had three between us), you may have air conditioning (but you must ask for the remote control if you plan to use it). You may have a TV, but ours was too high to reach. The rooms were adequate for sleeping, although they were cramped, as were the bathrooms. The biggest problem was the personel. The attendant we first met allowed us to store our luggage behind the desk until our room was ready, but would not let us access them later. She acted as if our being there was an imposition. Another time we saw the attendant smoking right underneath the no smoking sign. When we complained that the room smelled of smoke and had even had an ash tray, the attendant shrugged it off and said--well, someone was smoking, we can't help that. Needless to say, we spent most of our time at the sites, and had no desire to be in these rooms any longer than necessary.", "Date": "July 11, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Amico Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d528684-Reviews-Amico_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Piazzale Prenestino 15</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00176</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "528684", "ImgURL": "http://www.venere.com/img/hotel/3/0/4/8/8403/8403.jpg"}}
