The hotel is located just below the \u201cMontemario\u201d hill near the headquarters of RAI. The hotel is officially a 4 stars hotel but when you get out of the elevator I can\u2019t find immediately my room \u2026. My room hasn\u2019t have the door as the others rooms because it was in renovation \u2026 so I check all the other room numbers to be sure that the horrible door was effectively my door room. The room is quite spacious but the furniture is old and you have the sensation that all the furniture would be renovated and not only the door!! The hotel has a nice terrace on the roof which is divided in 2 parts: on the left side you have nice sofa and low table, on the right side there are some tables and the chairs very old!! Please renovate all the terrace!! The terrace is just below the \u201cMontemario\u201d hill and you can see a nice view!! The breakfast in nice with a lot of good food where you can meet some Italian TV famous people. The hotel is not a 4 star hotel without a renovation in the rooms!!", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAuthentic Charming Italian Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Rocks_to_travel", "ReviewID": "UR118593227", "Content": "I had the chance to stay at the Clodio hotel in Rome in September, 2011. The hotel is located in a residential area about 1.7km directly north of the Vatican. The hotel is frequented primarily by Italians and there were very few non-Italian tourists at the hotel. The hotel is on a quiet side street and has a very unassuming front to it. The staff is quite friendly and speak English perfectly (probably other languages too). There are two different sized rooms available that I am aware of. I stayed in quite a large room that had a couch and a very large private patio overlooking the street. The rooms are very clean and well appointed in a typical European manner. Internet WIFI is available from the hotel for 4 Euro/day. They have a very good continental style breakfast that includes many breads, pastries, cold meats, fruit as well as scrambled eggs and ham. I am not sure if they have a full restaurant as I never checked it out. They do have a rooftop patio. There is a breakout/conference room for groups up to 20 or 30 on the main level. There is also a bar that opens around 7PM on the main level. There is lots of couches and seating space just off of the lobby. As far as location, it is not the most convenient to the main tourist attractions (except the Vatican). The Vatican is approximately a 20 minute walk away. Otherwise the Coliseum is over an hour walk (about 5.2km). A taxi ride is approximately 12-15 Euros to the gates of the Coliseum. This walking will have to be your fitness regime as there is no fitness centre that I am aware of in the hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel if you want to avoid touristy hotels. Ask for room 110 if you can get it, it is worth it.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel, amazing location and helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "vrotelli", "ReviewID": "UR56801617", "Content": "Was really impressed with the rooms and service at the hotel. It is located in close proximity with many of the landmarks in Rome. The staff is very curtious, helpful and very knowledgable. Loved the breakfast to start the day off on the right foot.
