We liked being in an area where there were lots of cafes, bars, tapas bars, pubs, shops and really in the heart of the City. The wi fi didn't work in the room but there is a computer at reception guests can use. That was our only complaint.

The hostal is located smack bang in the middle of the city in a busy street with many good shops including some upmarket labels. The Hostal is also close to the Gay area in Madrid. We stayed in a double room. We were intially given a small double (and it is small although there is ample room to get around). We were then given a bigger double room for the next 2 nights. However the bathrooms were still smallish but we had no complaints. For a bargain 40 Euros, we found the rooms super clean, well maintained, super clean toilet (with 4 fresh towels) and bathrooms and it was very quiet outside.The showers had plenty of hot and cold water and it was super clean. The rooms smelled faintly of smoke and it is to be expected in Madrid where locals smoke in public places as well as in hotels and restaurants (although from my understanding, this is against the law). We stayed in a room facing a typical spanish courtyard and this was in itself a beautiful experience. I gather the rooms facing the courtyard were very quiet as opposed to the rooms facing the street. The passway leading to the rooms was at times smokey and a tad noisy with hotel guests thumping their way around but then again for a budget hostal in a super central location, the hostal was super!", "Date": "June 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frankfurt", "Title": "\u201cColors Host is OK\u201d", "Author": "MedeaFrankfurt", "ReviewID": "UR15152606", "Content": "The hostel is situated in the 4th and 3th of a lively alternativ street near the center.

(Only one change) The check in area is very small but offers a free internet service. The owner and his staff were friendly and helpful. Because the card payment didn't work, we got a little breakfirst brought in our room for free. The room was small but clean and nicely rennovated in IKEA style, the bed and shower were fine. We had a sigth to a backward yard, but it wasn't noisy. I don't know how loud it can be on the streetside. No tv was offered in this room, but we didn't matter.

Stay here at your peril!\u201d", "Author": "Sunny_EU", "ReviewID": "UR12656670", "Content": "What you get for your money (in summary): - - Unsafe and dangerous area - You can\u2019t keep your keys - Small and very overpriced rooms - Poor service from Philippino proprietors who speak limited English - Noisy corridors in the middle of the night - Broken or unfinished wardrobe - No view, no air, limited daylight - No facilities, TV or radio - False and misrepresentative web site - Bacteria infected beds with possible risk to human health I have never written an online review for any other hostel or hotel before, but then, I've never caught a fungal infection on my back from any other place that I've ever stayed at! The hostel is situated on the Calle de Fuencarral, which is a very long street running from Bilbao, in the north of Madrid, right into the centre, ending on the Gran Via (Madrid's equivalent of Oxford Street). Calle de Fuencarral is a fairly narrow road (one lane for traffic) and has nothing but clothes shops on both sides. At night this entire area becomes dark, fairly deserted and very eerie; quite worrying if you're travelling with anything valuable. As a guy I felt unsafe so I certainly wouldn\u2019t recommend being alone in this area at night if you\u2019re female. The Colors Hostel is situated on the 4th floor (reception and rooms) and also has rooms on the 3rd floor. There is a small old fashioned lift. The proprietor\u2019s insist on keeping your keys when you go out, and you have to press a door bell and announce yourself if you return after about 9pm, as they lock the main doors. It takes a while if nobody\u2019s in reception, and it doesn\u2019t feel very safe to wait outside for anything up to 10 minutes. I stayed here for 2 nights in early December, and I had booked the room nearly 3-weeks in advance. I had spoken with the proprietor on several occasions, specifically requesting certain basic amenities i.e. TV, a double bed etc, which I was assured wouldn\u2019t be a problem. Upon arrival I was told by the proprietor\u2019s wife, who was in the grubby little the reception area on the 4th floor with her daughter, that all the larger rooms were occupied (there are several larger and supposedly better rooms on the 4th floor). Accordingly, I would have to have one of the 'newer' but ridiculously smaller rooms, situated on the 3rd floor. The prices had also mysteriously gone up in the process and did not reflect the prices quoted on their flashy web site. Incidentally, do not be fooled by the hostel\u2019s flashy, colourful, musical web site. This hostel would never be allowed to misrepresent itself in the way that it has on it\u2019s web site, in the UK. I have attached a photo of the room, and as you can see, it isn\u2019t much to look at. There\u2019s a double bed, which was good, and a small but adequate shower, toilet and wash basin area (I couldn\u2019t possibly justify calling it an en-suite). There were also 2 children\u2019s stools and a small round table in the room, and a big blue home-made MDF wardrobe, which had no clothes rail and no hangers. The big brown wooden doors you see in the middle-top of the photo are this hostel\u2019s equivalent to curtains, and lead to a window with no view i.e. looking inward to other rooms and private flats, with no air and not much daylight. There was no TV, despite my specific request, and the worst possible aspect to this stay, far worse than any other minor annoyance or frustration with having to pay 50 euros per night, for an empty shell of a room in a hostel with absolutely no soul\u2026 I caught a fungal infection on my back from having slept here. Dozens of small dark coloured spots appeared on my back after the first night (I noticed in the mirror the following day). I thought it might be bed bugs or something, which isn\u2019t that big a deal. I slept on my towel the following night, just to be safe, although the damage had been done. I had a medical a week ago in London, and was told that these spots were a fungal infection which could spread and get worse. Treatable with a cream, so nothing major, but still pretty disgusting, and made even worse, when you consider that I had to pay for the bloody privilege! Avoid this hostel like the plague, because the plague\u2019s sure as hell not going to avoid you!!", "Date": "January 15, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Colors Hostal Madrid", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d674679-Reviews-Colors_Hostal_Madrid-Madrid.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Calle fuencarral 14</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28004</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "674679", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/c0/84/64/colors-hostal-madrid.jpg"}}
