We ate a lovely breakfast on our balcony, and enjoyed the island vista. For about $4 a person, you can take a very short drive, to the \"state park\" next door. They have public restrooms, public beach, campgrounds and primitive rental condos. There were food vendors like pizza, ice cream, etc, parked close to the beach. The waters were beautiful and calm. They have playgrounds for kids and picnic tables. The hotel doesn't have its own beach, just the pool (which we didn't use). Since we only stayed one night, I don't know if there is more to do in the neighborhood. We drove to Ponce the next day, to tour the art museum. Definitely give it a visit, if you are in the South of PR! We'd stay here again. *Note, if driving, be prepared for their odd parking arrangements. They park your car two to three deep, in one spot. You have to leave your keys with the front desk. So, when you are ready to leave, be prepared to wait a while, so they can move the other cars. ;-) My only complaint is that the restaurant closed at 8pm and we had no other options for food, on the property, except the vending machines.

This was amazing for $110 per night. No place is perfect, and many guests did not have accommodations nearly as nice as ours. Among the hotel's other imperfections were the fact that wireless is only available in the 2nd- and 3rd-floor lobbies. Why wireless is not available in each suite defies logic. I need to use the internet daily and often, and going to the sometimes crowded and noisy breezeway lobby on the 3rd floor was far from ideal. In fact, it could be irritating at times. Other irritants included a poorly stocked kitchen, so far as cooking implements and eating utensils are concerned (We prefer to cook our breakfasts.) and the interminable wait for warm water in the shower. These annoyances aside, the charm of the town, which truly deserves to be called \"funky-nice,\" the near-by nature reserves, the excellence of the food in town, the friendliness and hospitality of the English-speaking staff at the hotel, and the scrupulous cleaning that daily took place throughout the hotel (save for one day--a Tuesday--when our room was not cleaned or the beds made), combined to make this a real find.

I used Delta Sky miles for the stay and had wanted to see the southern part of the island, heard the beaches were nice, and that was the reason for our stay here.

Pool area is nice (we did not use pool), etc. Lobby was nice. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Room was nice as well. Had a fridge and a sink. Nice Balcony. We got a room that had two double beds. THe mattresses on the beds were very soft, and caved in the middle. Not very good sleeping mattresses, for me at least. My wife and I by the middle of the night were in separate beds, due to the poor mattresses. Other than this one issue, the room was fine. Check In was at 4, an hour later than most hotels, and check out was at 11, an hour earlier. Any additional hour is $35. This was annoying, but the room was free, so I cannot complain. You get a special key to get to the beach and town. If you lose it, it is $100. Not a big deal just be aware of potential hidden costs. You need to sign out beach towels and return them by a certain time each day otherwise there is a charge. There is also no place to just get a cup of coffee during the day unless you go to the restaurant, if it is open at that time. My wife is a tea drinker, no tea on premises.

Both bedrooms had king beds (master with en suite bath, second bedroom with bath across the hall). This place had an adequate kitchen, although it should be noted that it is a cooktop (no oven) and that while it has service for six as to plates and cutlery, it was limited as to pots and wineglasses.

The water play structure was a big 'hit' and a great place for kids to make friends. The staff at the resort, as well as all the people in the area are genuinely welcoming. We started talking with a family in the grocery store and ended up being invited for Christmas dinner and hanging out with them for the rest of the holiday! We were invited for a day on the boat at La Parguera as well as an amazing trip through the mountains. What hospitality- we could hardly take it in! Grocery store, bakery and a strip mall where you can get pretty much anything is five minutes away in Cabo Rojo, there are also convenience stores within walking distance. A mega mall is 15 minutes away in Mayaguez. If you want to buy fresh fish, drive to Danny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s - a fishing place in Puerto Real. You have to be there around noon when the catch comes in; there should be buckets full of lobster, conch and fish of all sorts- even if you don't want to cook, the place is an experience! The front desk can give you directions. They were always friendly, patient and helpful! The area has much to explore, beaches all around and the mountains are fabulous. Boqueron is very small and the main street along the water has a grimy bar scene for college students, we took a peak and then avoided it for the rest of the time. If you want an exciting pool scene, glamorous facilities and organized activities, you should probably stay in one of the hotels in San Juan. If you want a safe, spacious and friendly place in gorgeous natural surroundings where you can spend time with your family and get to know Puerto Rico, you will enjoy this place.", "Date": "February 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bernardsville, NJ", "Title": "\u201cDawning of Aquarius\u201d", "Author": "NJGirlSeeingtheWorld", "ReviewID": "UR23607457", "Content": "My husband, cousins and I decided to go to Boqueron for a night in January 2009. We had no reservations and my cousins (who live in Puerto Rico) knew of Aquarius, but had never stayed there. So, we called and were told they had availability: a studio-style room with two full beds for $119 or a suite with two bedrooms with king beds for $189. We reserved the studio-style (the four of us agreed to save a little). Upon arriving and seeing how great the grounds looked, how secure the resort was, and how close it was to the Poblado (center of town) and beach- we asked at check-in if we could get the two bedroom suite and for two nights. It was no problem at all. We were given suite 505A- which has an amazing view of the beach. (Half of the suites do not face the water, but the parking lot). When we walked into the suite, we were so impressed- living room, kitchen (with washer dryer), and long balcony. The one \u00e2\u20ac\u0153master\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bedroom had a door out to the balcony with an attached bathroom with Jacuzzi. The other room was a little smaller with a bathroom right across the hall without balcony access. All the rooms were decorated in a modern design and felt very \u00e2\u20ac\u0153homey\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. All that for $189!!! The beds were super comfortable. Everything was clean and smelled fresh. The location is amazing- you are given a key to the back gate ($100 value if you lose it), which leads to the beach and Poblado. The Poblado has great nightlife (restaurants, bars\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and a great spot to catch sunsets). The gate guarantees that none of the drunken or unsavory types have access to the resort. The beach is great- and easily accessible. The pool is very pretty. For people with children, it has a kiddy pool/slides. The restaurant is open all day and the food is good. It also has a bar open all day with Happy Hour specials. Hint- if you are offered a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd lunch, be aware that it comes with a hitch. You can purchase time share at Aquarius, so a pitch comes with the free lunch.

We rent the main condo and the connecting room to make it a three bedroom. It had a full kitchen and a small limited kitchen in the third room.

It is in a short walking distance to the beach and the downtown village which has a great nightlife. Overall, great times. You don't get housekeeping everyday but they do exchange towels and bed linens upon request.
