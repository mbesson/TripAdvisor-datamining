The room was also slightly cold as the radiator hadn't been bled in a while.

They didn't have a room with bath available, and the single room they put me in was very small, at 50 pounds per night. The next night I was moved to a larger room with bath, but when I saw a mouse, I moved back to the smaller room. The women at the front desk were nice, but didn't have a lot of knowledge about tourist-type questions. The breakfast was very good - you can get a full English breakfast with eggs, sausage, bacon, beans, tomato, toast, and there were cereals and fruits on the sideboard. Just down the block is an excellent fish and chips restaurant called North Sea Fish, just across Marchmont on Leigh Street. There are other restaurants and pubs and grocery stores all within two or three blocks, and the Russell Square Tube is about four blocks down Marchmont. Also, you can catch many buses at Russell Square, about five blocks away, including the Big Bus Tour, which I would recommend. London is so big, the tour takes about four hours. You can get on and off as you please. One note of warning. Never, EVER, attempt, under any circumstances, in this life or the next, to drive in London. We rented a car to go to Devon for a week - and it was entirely possible that we could have spent that whole week just trying to navigate out of London. Every two blocks, the road names change, you encounter a roundabout with indecipherable signs, and don't know where the heck to turn off! It's a nightmare. It would be far better to take a train or bus out of London and rent a car from another town.

It is about a 5 minute walk from both Euston and St Pancras and is set in a rather pretty tree lined crescent. I arrived about 12.30 and having read on the website that it was ok to leave luggage on your arrival and departure dates thought I would just leave my bag. But I received a very warm welcome and was told my room was ready. However two minutes later I was informed 'ooops no it isn't' but \"we have another one that is ready if you are happy to stay on the third floor.\" My single en suite room contained a double and a single bed! I was very happy to spread out with all that space. The third floor was quite a trek up and there is no lift, but it was a lovely room. There is a dressing table/desk, a fan (a godsend in London!), tv on a unit and more than adequate tea/coffee/hot chocolate supplies. Irons, hairdryers, dressing gowns are all available from reception. I was given a room key and a front door key. There are tennis courts and gardens available opposite for guest use. There is a lounge with a computer with free internet access. Breakfast was plentiful and rather nice. Usually in London I am very distrustful of little independent hotels and stay in one of the chains where I know what to expect - but this room that was booked for me was a very pleasant unexpected surprise and I will certainly be staying here again. One last point is that although the hotel was full the noise was minimal - and I slept with the windows open and still the noise was minimal even from outside.", "Date": "September 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBetter than I could have ever expected\u201d", "Author": "rnetzley", "ReviewID": "UR18319427", "Content": "The Crescent was one of the hotels suggested by a conference I attended at the University of London.

Plus, when I first arrived, it turned out that there were loads of American undergraduate students staying in the area. I must say, though, that the Crescent was a fabulous experience: sure, the room was a tad small, particular for Americans raised on gigantic rooms, but it was absolutely quiet and the broadband connection worked consistently throughout. The English breakfast was fine, but there's a great patisserie around the corner if one prefers a lighter breakfast.

Our room was a high-ceiling first floor room. We discovered the first night that it was a little noisy from sidewalk conversations to sleep with the window cracked open. The room was comfortable with a bathroom, shower, TV, and phone. Because the entire hotel eats breakfast at the same time (it being included), we found that the hot water for showering often ran out in the morning. It was there if we got up earlier or took an evening shower. The breakfasts were generous English breakfasts of satisfactory quality. The hotel has a TV lounge with a computer available for guest use; which was so great to research tourist information. There's a little garden available for guest use.

All in all, a good budget hotel in one of the most expensive cities in the world. I paid 49 pounds per night for a single, with shower and sink in the room, toilet down the hall. Room \"compact\" with little storage other than a wardrobe and desk with 4 shallow drawers. Noise was rarely a problem, as the hotel is on a crescent and the traffic is mostly on the main road which is 100 yards away. In the crescent is a park with tennis courts. On a warm Saturday night there was a lot of partying in the park, otherwise peaceful. Room fairly clean, as were bathrooms. Good full English breakfast (eggs, bacon sausage, beens, tomato, as well as hot and cold cereal, orange juice, yogurt, fruit) included. Hotel people generally helpful. I arrived at 11 PM, tired. Man at the desk brought my bag up to the room, did not wait for a tip. As I was on the fourth floor (American, 3rd floor European), and the last flight of stairs was steep and narrow, I was appreciative. What not to like? They advertised Internet access in the room, which they provide with a plug in cord that apparently runs on a wireless signal. Well, there is insufficient signal on the top floor. They do provide free a computer in the lounge, which unfortunately was broken for the first few days of my stay.. They did not charge me for the wireless cord, since it did not work. Since private Internet access is quite important to me, was a big problem. I had e-mailed before arrival and asked for a lower floor room. I never heard back and did not follow up (my mistake), so of course I ended up on the top floor. Since I'm an older traveler, a nuisance but still a problem. Overall, if you want basic economical, clean, convenient accomodations fairly close to Underground and in central London, this is a good choice. Not for person with trouble with stairs (no elevator), perhaps not if Internet access is important, but for most a reasonable choice.", "Date": "May 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, value, service.\u201d", "Author": "namaste246", "ReviewID": "UR16061697", "Content": "Located in the Bloomsbury section, close to three tube stations, within walking distance to the British Museum and the British Library, this b&b gives great value in a pleasant setting.
