Its only available in lobby or the tea room beside the lobby where plugs chairs and tables are available. Location is pretty good. Just outside the door on left there is a walkway which is easy to follow to Hung Hom mtr and the shopping center alongside and takes only 5mins or a little more with bags. To sum up its good value clean relatively well run hotel with easy access to all areas of city via mtr.

Two good things, however. One, wi-fi (in the lobby area and the sitting area next door) was very dependable. Also, the hotel was within about an 8 minute walk to Hung Hom station and therefore well located. Bear in mind that if you wish to take the MTR over to Hong Kong island, there is a bit of walk to transfer at the East Tsim Sha Tsui (East TST)/Tsim Sha Tsui (TST stations. As you have to first exit the East TST station and then enter the TST station, purchase the Octopus card to enjoy a free transfer, or else transfer at Nam Cheong for Hong Kong MTR station. It would be very hard to stay here if you have a lot of luggage (you'd have to be very creative in 'squeezing out' space in the room). For two people in the standard double, once we've placed our bags on the floor, there was no way the door would be able to open fully. I would not recommend two people in the standard room unless you were on a shoestring budget like we were! Beware if you are a light sleeper as the walls are thin and you will be woken up by people moving about in the morning. Then again, if you are a price sensitive traveller, but want the convenience of a central Kowloon location, this is probably about as good a deal as you can get. Not entirely satisfying, I know, but that's the reality of Hong Kong hotels these days.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mandaluyong, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cHmm... small... but ok... maybe overpriced...could be great ?\u201d", "Author": "passion4u", "ReviewID": "UR122671644", "Content": "This one is tough because I actually booked it by accident so that might have normally been a negative but it was my fault :) (was supposed to have booked the other location Sham Shui Po) Anyway hes the rooms are small I was alone and if you are travelling with someone you need more than the basic room, its great for just one person or perhaps someone you might meet for a few hours :) (Thats a JOKE :) LOL) PS - there is a Mcdonalds but it s a bit of a hike and the staff won't give you great directions - Its left and then keeping going straight almost until you can't go then I made a right and found it :) It is not perfectly clean but its fine shower has everything you need nice hot water and soap and mugs but if you have a large suitcase and want to move around its almost like doing it in a phone booth I truly feel that for the price you should have WIFI in the rooms rather than in an area at the lobby seperated ffrom the hotel The staff at the front door are nice but always busy and it's about a 10 minute walk IF you know where you are going. Anyone who just arrives at Hung Hum station might have issues especially if its dark as you have to go outside cross some busses and then down a bridge on your left and its quite close in the middle of a bunch of places that look like funeral parlours.

The cost of reservation was USD105 per day and it was about 2 times higher against the reservation cost right at the lobby (USD60)! I wanted to book the hotel at the lobby and required Sinohotel to return money but they refused. I will never use this company again! The apartments were the smallest ones I've ever seen. There were 2 beds (beds were quite good), tiny thermo electric cooler about 15 liter capacity, electric kettle, 3 coat hangers, TV on the wall and a telephone. There were no table no chair, no space for luggage I had. But thanks god the apartment had toilet and a shower and it was quite OK for a single traveler - one can use one of the beds to keep the luggage and clothes. For the couple the apartment are too small and is not convenient. The hotel has Wi-Fi but you can use it only in the room next to entrance to the hotel. So I had to leave my room at 22nd floor and go down to reach Wi-Fi spot each time. The view from the window was quite good - right to HK Island. The hotel in not far from MTR station and from the ferry (about 20 min to go) and its location is much better than it could be expected from the map of HK. The area is a dormitory one and you can find there food stores and cafes with reasonable price - much more moderate than in a districts near Nathan road for instance. So this hotel may be quite a good choice for those single travelers who want to stay in HK at moderate budget. But do not book this hotel via Internet reservation services at least via Sinohotel.
