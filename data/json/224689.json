Back in October, my boyfriend and I bought a groupon for Opus and stayed the weekend after my birthday. We travel from Seattle, so while it isn't that far, it is still a nice getaway. We fell in love with the posh interior, the amazing service, and yaletown! What an adorable neighborhood! Well, as soon as we were heading home, I made sure to follow @OpusHotel on twitter to follow what was going on at this lovely spot. Jeremy, the social marketing coordinator responded to my follow right away, followed me, and let me know to let him know the next time we needed a place to stay. Cut to present day. My boyfriend and I haven't been able to have a romantic weekend away in awhile, so we decided to spend the weekend before valentines with our good friends at Opus. We decided to go big and get an executive king suite and Jeremy got us free wi-fi, late check out and a food and beverage credit! Talk about taking care of your customers! Walking into Opus always makes me feel extremely chic. The modern decor is incredible. I love the magenta and gold seating. Our concierge was nice enough and commented \"oh, you're in the penthouse\" while we were checking in. We didn't think much of it, what do we know? As we jumped in the purple lit elevator we realized we were on the top floor and were excited to see what room awaited us. Opening the door was a new experience entirely. Wow. The black velvet wall paper, magenta and gold pillows, fire place that can be viewed from the living or bed rooms all were incredible...but the bathroom, oh man. The bathtub, while large and jetted, overlooked yaletown. What an incredible view. You better believe I utilized that tub and the complimentary L'Occitane products!! Jeremy also left us a bottle of wine, some snacks, and a nice note letting us know if we needed anything he was available. I popped open the wine and my boyfriend started playing w the complimentary iPad 2 that is now available in every room. Jeremy also got us reservations at Coast (review to follow) on a busy Saturday night. Coast was recommended by the concierge last time we were there and we fell in love with it. The next morning, after a restful sleep in the comfortable king sized bed, we decided we didn't want to leave, so we cancelled our reservations at Cento Notti for brunch (we will try it next time, right?) and ordered room service. This room was simply too amazing to leave if we didn't have to! Every step of the way was a delight with Opus. I recommend this hotel to everyone I know and we will be returning soon...we just don't know how we can ever settle for an average hotel room again! We were spoiled this weekend for sure...thank you, Jeremy and the rest of the staff at Opus!

We happened to stumble upon a Groupon for Opus that gave us $40 in breakfast credit at the hotel restaurant, free-wifi, and a great discount on a fabulous room. When we walked into our room, we were blown away with how posh it looked. But what really blew us away was the free bottle of wine and snacks that Nicholas, the manager, left for us after he heard about the reason for our trip. Amenities are great. The gym is small, but we used it every morning. There is 1 treadmill, 1 elliptical, dumbells, and a multi-purpose machine. What's great is that there is a snack bar area inside with complimentary apples, refridgerated towels, and a water cooler with slices of fresh lemon. There's also a stereo system that lets you hook up your iPod/iPhone to the gym speaker system. We stayed for 3 nights at Opus and really didn't want to leave. The location is amazing. It's in Yaletown, right across the street from the train station. There are many great places to eat, including a grocery store that feels like a Whole Foods.

We found the hotel to be clean and well-managed, but I have to say that it wasn't what I expected from the price and the advertisements. The rooms were clean and had decent amenities, and I loved the heated floor in the bathroom. Other than that and the nice bath products, however, I wasn't sure what justified the high price. For one thing, the decor was an ugly brown--a color guaranteed to hide dirt and which I consequently associate with places like Motel 6. Also, it's discomfiting to pay so high a price for the room, only to be charged outrageous sums for extras like parking and internet. The service also left something to be desired. We had purchased the continental breakfast option when we made our reservation, and we told the waitress about it when we sat down in their restaurant for breakfast. However, she told us to put our voucher away and preceded to let us order off the regular menu without explaining what would and would not be covered by the voucher, so we were left with the erroneous impression that everything was. Her supervisor had to come over and tell us what our breakfast options *after* we had ordered, which he did in an extremely rude fashion. And although the hotel had said they would be able to accommodate my boyfriend, who is a vegan, they did not even have soy milk in the restaurant! To their credit, they did get some the second day. On the good side, the actual breakfast options (eggs, etc) at the restaurant turned out to be tasty, but the continental breakfast was pretty blah.

Hippest hotel in Vancouver.\u201d", "Author": "John C", "ReviewID": "UR123264378", "Content": "After being tired of staying hotels they all look like they were decorated by my grandparents I wanted someplace for my wife and I to stay was fun, stylish (without being fancy pancy) and close to the happening stuff downtown. I started reading the reviews about the Opus and thought - this sounds like the place. I saw the picture of the room with the bathroom that has the full window facing the street and decided that we'd give this a try for a one night downtown Vancouver hotel+dinner+drinks evening. The hotel might be a little hard to find for first timers and there isn't the typical recessed pull out in front for the valet (it's fairly busy street and you just have to pull over to the curb and the valet will come out, or you might have to run in and let them know you are there). Valet is $30 for the night which is a little steep, but easier than worrying about finding parking in Yaletown (where the hotel is located). The lobby was decorated for Christmas and it looked like you stepped into a cool update 60's lobby. Modern design but funky and cool. The lobby also doubles as a lounge (and a nightclub on weekends I guess). As you check in they offer you champagne (or water) and then it's off to the room. I opted for a the basic room with queen bed as it's the one with the cool bathroom. They have nicer rooms with a fireplace and stuff but they face an inside courtyard and what's the point of staying in a hotel downtown if you can't look out the window. I asked for a room on a upper floor so I wouldn't hear as much street noise. The room was fairly small, but perfect for a couple. The rooms are blue or red or yellow and we got the blue room. Again like the lobby it look modern, had a fun funky feel, but had everything a hotel room needs. Small flat screen TV, chair, desk, night tables, etc. The bathoom is separated from the main room by some Japanese looking sliding doors. The bathroom itself is the coolest thing in the room - free standing table, full windows, and nice tile shower with glass door. bathroom was very clean (room had nice clean robes as well). The view wasn't anything super exciting but you could see another building and the downtown buildings in the background. And of course you can look down and see people on the street. If you want to do your business there are shades that can be lowered so people can't look in and see you :) Now maybe lowering and raising the shades is a little annoying but you've probably never had a bathroom with a full windows so it's worth the trouble. Also late at night with the lights off I didn't bother to lower the shade when taking a shower so I could look out at the city (I assume no one could see me) and it was a cool experience. We had drinks in the lounge downstairs (this was a weeknight). The waitress was nice but seemed a little full of herself but we got drinks quickly and charged it to our room. I had considered eating at the place inside the hotel but I'd read mixed reviews and with tons of amazing places nearby I figured we'd go out and explore. The hotel is located in Yaletown which is the hip and cool place to hang out in Vancouver. It's near everything! There are dozens of great places to eat within walking distance. We chose to eat that the Blue Water Cafe (some of the best seafood in Vancouver) and the dinner was amazing. It's a great place for a romantic meal - even though it's a larger room and quite busy the tables are far apart and the service makes you feel very well taken care of. There is a 7-11 nearby and on the way back we picked up some late night snacks to enjoy in the room. Checkout the next day was a snap and the valet had our car ready out front in about 5 mins. The stay was around $179 which is reasonable for downtown Vancouver and we enjoyed ourselves very much. No it's not as fancy as some hotels in the area, but for younger 20-40's couples who want a night out on the town and a fun hotel to stay in without breaking the bank the Opus is a awesome experience.

In the past, workers at hotel seemed a bit cold and aloof and I never felt like a valued guest. It seems they've really made strides here and is one of best hotel experiences I've had in awhile (and I stay at a LOT of hotels). There was an issue with the Groupon I used for the personal travel trip, but the front desk agent offered both deals (one printout I had said one thing and the other something else - agent told me the Opus has offered different deals via Groupon before and it seemed they'd been combined depending on which page was printed out). I appreciated this and then after we got to our room he called and said he felt badly about the confusion and also wanted to offer us free breakfast. I did not expect this! We had left the front desk content, but then his effort even after we'd arrived in our room really stood out. While the valet did not greet us upon arrival (we arrived in the evening, around 5pm) - and this has been an issue at the Opus before, where you just bring your keys to the front desk - upon checkout valets were there and they were just as friendly as everyone else had been during our stay. I'm a returning guest at Opus, and there was a note and some items thanking me for my business waiting for us in our (upgraded) room. I love this little effort and it leaves an impression on me.

The Opus lobby is a real wow for the senses. Obviously the staff is cherry-picked for their attractiveness and to go with the young, contemporary and stylish looks this hotel exudes. Where else would you find a lobby person dressed with coordinated purple infused dress shoes to match their striped dress shirt and the lobby lighting? This hotel is all about design and fashion. The standard guest room can be a little on the small side; but, it is amazingly comfortable. The clean, all white sheer curtains gave the room a large look. I loved the crisp pressed white bed linens. They felt so good. The nightly turn down service is sensational. There is a total blackout shade rolled down at turn down to give the late night celebrants the chance to sleep in. There is even a small stereo system in the room that is tuned to really nice music at turn down. The bedside carafe of drinking water is useful and an environmental friendly alternative to plastic water bottles. Like an ocean liner, the best housekeeping service is that which is never seen...it just magically happens. And so it is at the Opus. Controlling the lighting in the room was a bit confusing and one needs to go back to the switches at the room's door to control them. And if the hotel could get the neighboring building's 7:30 AM waste removal truck to come later would be a welcome treat for late sleepers. The high speed internet service, while a little pricey, was excellent. The bathroom toiletry amenities are pretty nice, too. The bathroom is clean and stylish with its glassed-in shower, that could easily accommodate two people, and sparkling metal sink basin. The overhead shower heads feels so good, even if having to shower alone! The room has a generously stocked mini-bar which I did not discover until I was preparing to depart. That was probably a good thing for me. There was a vast collection of \"goodies \" discretely hidden away in the base cabinet which could sustain a party for two should they elect not to emerge from the room for a couple of days.

You walk 100 feet from the station and you are there. The Opus is located in Yaletown, which is a great area with lots of restaurants, bars, easy walk to the seawall and anything you may need. For a vibrant city like Vancouver, I prefer staying in Yaletown because it is so quiet compared to other areas in downtown. It is much easier to get in and out from here than anywhere else I have experienced in the city. Staff at this hotel are ALWAYS accomodating. Very friendly, not pompous, and sincerly down to earth.

It looks like something our of Wallpaper magazine: ultra-trendy, understated-modern punctuated with vibrant colours and a hip vibe. My room was spacious with a glorious soaking tub and a walk-in shower. The king-sized bed gave me the chance to try the TempurPedic mattress (sheer indulgence and a great night's sleep). All the amenities are high-end: the l'Occitane toiletries, larger bottles of liquor on the desk, the softest bathrobe ever. Yet for me the most important part of the room was the feeling I got as I entered after a hectic day of sightseeing: It was tranquil and I welcomed the feeling of privacy and quiet. I could get used to this. When I returned to my room at night, there was little card at my bedside that told me what tomorrow's weather would bring, along with a carafe of water. Where else would nightly turn down service come with an all-day sucker one night and a string of fizzy candy the next, instead of the ubiquitous chocolate? That told me that I was staying in a place that takes its service, rather than itself, seriously. And that really made a difference, because I'm so far off the fashion/trendy grid that it's a non-fashion statement in itself. So I was worried that I'd be treated to pretentious staff looking me over and making me feel like I didn't belong. Instead I was spoiled at and by Opus - starting with informed, cheerful and courteous staff and running the gamut. The David-Bowie-does-Andy-Warhol decor of the restaurant (complete with silver walls, sprayed-on graphics, crystal chandeliers and disco balls) was so retro is took me back to my grad school days in NYC. Breakfasts there are really worth it: lavender-honey yogurt, chunks of fresh fruit, and thick, toothsome multi-grained toast really got my attention. And it couldn't be more convenient: a few blocks walk to the pier to catch the Aquabus fro Granville Island market, walking distance to almost anything I wanted to see, and just kitty corner from the Yaletown-Roundhouse stop of the Canada Line to the airport.

Speaking of closet, there is one =) That is also where the safe & umbrella is located (which came in handy since it rained). There is a flat screen mounted on the wall. Beneath the TV, there is a CD/Radio/DVD player. The hotel even provides a selection of CDs for you to listen to. Also, for those nights when you are tossing and turning and there is nothing good on TV, the hotel has a collection of DVDs that you can rent to watch (for free). There are 2 sliding doors that opens up to a bathroom which has a floor-to-ceiling glass window. There is a copious amount of counter space. The coffee/tea and hairdryer can be found on the counter. The standing shower has a rain-fall type of shower head. All the toiletries (soap, shampoo, conditioner, and lotion) are from L'Occitane. But what I love the most about the bathroom is the bathroom floor. I know that sounds strange, but seriously, I do! The floor is heated. It's so amazing~ It might not sound like it's a big deal, but once you experience this type of luxurious flooring, you'll be raving about it too~ Overall, I love this hotel!

We were on our way back from Thailand and stayed there upon recommendation from locals and the outstanding reviews here. Checking in was strange. We had a Trip Advisor coupon for a free upgrade but were told very apologetically that there were no other rooms available. We were then shown to our room #205... when we approached, it became quickly apparent that the room was not going to be good = Located directly on top of the \"Club\" and next to the fitness center. We asked the bellman if this room was any good and his lack of comment made us suspicious. He then said \"Well its a Standard Room\". I looked at my reservation and it clearly said I had booked a Superior Room so I went downstairs and discussed this with the Front Desk. They said they needed to check the reservation and then lo and behold, a Superior room on the 6th floor was made available. All this with strange smiles which led me to believe I was intentionally \"downgraded\" and the unavailable upgrade business was a little contrived. Overall this hotel tries very hard to be a \"design, in hotel\" the place to be for those with sophisticated taste.. the issue is the design is ok but a little dated ala ABFab 1990's and is lacking in warmth and charm which leaves you feeling a little cold. The front desk staff seem tense and uptight, in contrast, the BellStaff and Housekeeping really shined. If this hotel could loosen up and ad some warmth to their customer interaction, they could have a winner because in the end, the hotel has great potential. - Super Location - Nice Rooms - comfy Beds - Free Bikes for Exploring... The whole \"Club\" issue detailed here is a real non issue in my mind. The club which apparently attracts folks in droves, is really a melange of the hotel lobby and restaurant with a velvet rope to give the appearance of exclusivity but overall, could not see what the fuss was about.. In the end you sum up a hotel by weather you want to come back... in this case, I would say no. But then again, if they upgraded the staff and service, maybe..

As a boutique hotel, it has all the niceties that I expect from a boutique in a major city: rooms designed with thought, cleanliness, better than average beds and furnishings, good local to restaurants and downtown life, etc. In terms of value, I felt it was a good value for all the special touches, amenities and especially the service. The small courtesy touches like delivered water and snacks at night and drivers willing to take clients to parts of town were nice flourishes to the experience. I had the standard room and have in the ceiling shower heads that gives you that full on deluge, which I love. However, the staff are the true standouts. From front desk/concierge, valet/bell person to maid and evening turn down service all the staff exhibited a consistency of professionalism, courtesy, friendliness and a willingness to assist no matter whether personnel was client facing or not. It is truly a wonderful and refreshing experience to have even the maid service displaying the same professional and smiling courtesy as the front desk. If you need anything, all of the staff is willing and able to assist, but I have to say Janelle at the front desk exemplifies customer service with personality!

I mean, the Opus is no dive - it's a luxury, boutique property, and as an overnight guest, I expected posh rooms and excellent service. My concern, going into the event was the meeting venue and service. With but two rooms to hold events, my concern was that the focus of the Opus was more on ensuring a positive guest experience, with perhaps less focus and experience in meeting the needs of a business meeting. The stress of ensuring all went smoothly for our meeting counterparts who were traveling internationally didn't help. Our meetings kicked off well with setup completed and catering delivered as pre-arranged. Still, in the back of my mind, I had concerns. When I asked the Opus events manager how I should communicate any needs during the course of our meetings, the response was, \"Oh, just call down to the front desk and they'll take care of it.\". I must have visibly cringed. You tell me - would you expect to call down to the front desk of a hotel and get the desired assistance you need for a business meeting? I wouldn't. Our meetings continued, and with the pleasant and timely service delivered by the Opus staff (thanks Abby!), my stress lessened. It's the type of meeting you hope for - lunch mysteriously shows up when you didn't even hear them enter the room; coffee gets refreshed before you have a chance to ask; food tastes fabulous. All good. Then, on the final day of our meetings, we actually have an issue that needs to be addressed - original plans called for lunch outside the hotel (i.e., not catered by the Opus), but we needed more time to complete agenda items in our meeting, and really needed to have another \"working lunch\" catered. I picked up the phone in the meeting room, around 9:30AM that day, dreading the call to the \"front desk\", and knowing full well that odds were stacked against any positive resolution. The first 15 seconds of the conversation included me blathering as I tried to explain our situation. \"Kelly\" at the front desk waited patiently and then delivered the following response:\"If appropriate, we can provide a full lunch, similar to what you've arranged over the last two days, with some variety so as not to seem repetitive. Same time?\". My jaw dropped. I hung up the phone and looked at my colleagues in stunned surprise that I had just arranged a last minute lunch for six people (soup, salad, 3 different sandwiches, dessert, etc.) with the front desk of the hotel.

I then realised that we were no longer in a hotel at all. It had been hijacked from under it's own nose. We were forced to stand in a very busy discotheque, unable to get served or hear ourselves talk. we were excluded from our own hotel foyer. I wandered over to reception to ask why we couldn't sit in one of the empty seats, and the answer was that he was powerless, as this area was now a bottle only bar. after much fuss were were offered a seating area, in a dingy room, which felt like a back room at a wedding buffet.

I then went on the computer and saw 4 different \"non-refundable rates\" all at different prices with no descriptions. I called the hotel to get an explanation on the different prices, I wanted to know why they were all different (ie, bigger room, more perks, etc) but the person in reservations did not know the answer. I then booked one of the non refundable rooms online using a debit VISA card and everything was good, got a confirmation. I even called to inform them I was bringing my puppy and to double check that everyhting was ok as they let me know that the card will be charged immediately rather than at check in, and the person on the other line said yes, and repeated all the specifics. When I got to the hotel, the valet was nowhere to be found, I parked in front, got the dog as well as our bags out of the car myself and went inside. There, I was informed that the card \"declined\", I told them it was not possible and called the credit/debit card company immediately. They told me that all was good with the card, but that the hotel was not set up to accept these new cards yet (it is a CIBC canadian card by the way). The bank suggested that they run it as a debit, and the person at the front desk at Opus was EXTREMELY rude, she did not even know how to ring in a debit card and had to get help from someone else. The attitude that we received from the woman at the front desk was shocking - she even raised her voice at us. The other hotel clerk was much nicer, calmer and was able to charge the card (after 15 minutes at the check in) with no problems. The valet who was quite friendly did come eventually and moved the car. After our glass of champagne (which was much needed at this point), we got our room key and we went up to our room with the dog and the bags (no bellhop). When we got to the floor we realised that the room was right next to the elevator, the abolute closest and noisiest room on the entire floor (remember we had a puppy....and naturally all dogs will jump and be anxious when they hear noises). the room was terribly noisy and our dog was quite stressed out (and we traveled with him before and did not have this problem). The room was quite clean (except for a small wet stain that smelled like stain remover) near the bathroom. the TV was old, the signal was horrible and the menu was so difficult to use that we got frustrated immediately. room service took quite a while, but the hotel clerk who brought it was very nice and friendly. We talked to someone at the bar who said that the hotel had complimentary service (which we did not know about), so we called the front desk for the car to take us to a restaurant near by, and she said the car is out...and did not know when to expect it back...ok..... We also overheard something about a complimentary coffee from another guest, so the next morning we ordered one single cappuccino but when we asked if it was complimentary for hotel guests, they rudely answered NO! we went online and found out we were supposed to order the latte....oh well... At checkout again we got attitude, rolled eyes and no smiles. Again, nobody helped with the bags... Overall, it is not what I expected. The customer service was touch and go. We would have really appreciated if the check in agent would have asked us if it was our first time there, let us know the perks....etc, but this did not happen. Overall, bad experience !!!

To the Opus: aside from its great location in Yaletown and close enough to Downtown Vancouver, I can't praise the friendliness and helpfulness of its staff enough. Everybody I've had the pleasure of meeting there is constantly creating an atmosphere that is giving New York's Mercer, Tribeca Grand and Hudson hotels a run for their money. The Opus staff doesn't carry the \"You should be thankful that you can stay at our hotel\" attitude but instead is abundantly inviting and friendly. The rooms are quiet, stylish and comfortable and even have color schemes to chose from. The only color scheme that's not so cool is the latest incarnation of the hotel bar/breakfast area. Now getting remodeled every 100 days and named accordingly, the space looks like a youth center in the 70s and 80s, graffiti, empty spraycans and folding chairs included. But the next iteration is coming soon, so there's some hope left. All in all, I can't imagine staying anywhere else during my trips to Vancouver.

The rooms are generously-sized, with comfortable beds, but those facing the street have a quirky feature: a bathroom that has floor-to-ceiling windows; to be clear, the bathrooms are on the outside, so you have to roll down the blind to use the toilet or have a shower. I rather liked the arrangement, but some people will feel uncomfortable with the \"privacy\" aspect. The restaurant area was undergoing reconstruction so I my comments would probably already be out-of-date, but when I was there I found it overwhelmingly noise, open to the packed bar area as it was. Service at the Opus is outstanding: a friendly, smiling young front-of-house crew along with helpful and flexible housekeeping staff. Room servicing is impeccable. A cute and unusual feature is the shoes the male lobby crew wear: black brogues with a \"saddle\" of bright pink/purple leather. Stunning and different.

The best feature is its location. It is located in a safe, clean area with plently of restaurants and bars to choose from. There is a great coffee place right next door called Agro Cafe. We are from Melbourne and love our coffee and this met our approval. Also loved the fact that we could take the train from the airport to Yaletown. After our long flight from Melbourne to LA then on to Vancouver, getting out of the train station and seeing The Opus right opposite was fantastic. The room was a good size for a hotel room with a nice, roomy entrance, good size wardrobe and the room was painted a funky red. The bathroom was also stylish. We had a Superior room with 2 double beds. We also loved the free internet with 2 ports in the Business Centre. Staff were friendly enough but certainly not outstanding. We asked questions and they were happy to answer but nothing particularly special. The only disappointment was the lobby bar. From reading some reviews, we expected that this was going to be the place to hang out. We found it incredibly small and lacked atmosphere. In fact, the only time it was busy was when it was booked out for a private function so we had no access to it anyway. All other times, after returning from dinner, there was never anyone there so we just went up to our room. Overall, really glad to have picked this hotel for our 5 night stay.

I travel all the time and have been to lots of business meetings in Vancouver and have stayed at lots of hotels there. The Opus is on top of my list now (just ahead of the Wedgewood). Here's why: 1) Location - love Yaletown, v. convenient for downtown Vancouver (wouldn't mind being closer to Stanley Park, but life is all about trade-offs), but really LOVE the fact that it's just across the street from the new Canada Rail line (Yaletown station). Great restaurants nearby, great shops, great spas. 2) Service/staff - everyone is friendly and helpful. I'm a bit concerned they're drugging those folks because, boy, from housekeeping to maintenance to front desk to waitstaff, etc. etc. EVERYONE was helpful and friendly. 3) Really comfortable beds and room. If you travel enough you know - you remember the comfortable beds, and this is one. Turn down service every night - lollipops and PEZ instead of chocolate. Rooms with dock for ipod (and if you'd rather have a different dock, some friendly person will help you with that). 4) Cookies. Just try the cookies in the Elixir or meeting rooms. 5) Great vibe. I'm a fan of the W-style of funky, hip hotels - but, more often than not, that comes at the cost of exceptional service and comfort. But the Opus was cool without being too cool - service like a Ritz Carlton but style like the W.

The Staff I have never found staff to be so helpful and friendly! As I stayed 5 days I got to see quite a few reception staff and can honestly say that they were all very friendly and helpful. I took my hair straighteners from the UK to use and although I had an adaptor they didn't work. With a quick call to reception I realised I needed a voltage converter (to go from 220v to 110v) and one member researched online where I could find it locally and how much it cost! Also, came out of my room to see maid hoovering and she quickly stopped and apologised for the 'noise' even though it wasn't noisy at all! My fridge wasn't working so with another quick call down to reception, someone came up within a few minutes to take a look. It was all working by the time I came back later that day. Went to a l local restaurant around 10 mins away by car but instead of booking a taxi for us, one staff member drove us in a very nice BMW!! My colleague and I had to leave 5.45am one morning to catch the coach to Whistler but as the restaurant didn't open until 6.30am, they kindly prepared a wonderful breakfast for us to take away. Coffee, juice, fresh fruit salad, granola with yoghurt and fresh banana nut bread! The Rooms I stayed in a standard room which I absolutely loved. Decor was red and I didn't realise that the rooms had different colour schemes until I looked online today. There was a cd playing when I arrived and some sweets/candy on the bed to welcome me! The heated floor in the bathroom was the icing on the cake! Each night when I returned to my room, the duvet was pulled back and again, music playing on the player. I also loved the L'Occitane tolietries they supplied. The only thing I can think of to make my stay better would be to have softer towels and maybe some slippers to use but apart from that it was great!! All in all a wonderful experience and I even missed The Opus when I flew on to LA!

You know that when someone has been at a job for a long period of time, and still has a (real) smile on their face, it means that not only are they being treated well, but they take great pride in their work. The rooms are fun, with some great, funky design layouts, and the nightly turndown service has that added touch with both a carafe of water and a touch of something sweet left for you on your pillow (such as a chocolate covered marshmallow lollipop). The lounge and restaurant are great, with a solid drink menu, well versed staff, and very tasty food, from the appetizers to the mains. Even on the slow nights, the team there will always take care of you, but also expect the possibility of a little star gazing, as many from the film industry like to stay at the Opus. There's always somewhere to go within walking distance, and the staff will never hesitate to recommend a place to eat (and they can almost always get you a table at the busiest of spots!).

When we arrived, they quickly came to take our luggage and valet the car, the check-in was prompt and courteous. The hotel itself is very nice and classy. We got up to our room, and they had set out a couple cupcakes on the desk for my husband's birthday! It was a nice gesture. The room is very nice - modern and clean. I liked the bathroom that had a separate shower and tub and nice amenities. The shower was awesome - with the rain shower head, water pressure was great, unlike many other hotels.

When we called for anything, they were always prompt. The turndown service was great- always left a little treat of some sort in the room and music playing. The only few things that I would consider a con are: the valet was an additional $26/day, and there was no self-park option (you could go park yourself in the pay lot nearby). At night, even though we were on the 5th floor, we heard a good amount of street noise. The bathroom lighting wasn't that great for makeup application, nor was there a close-up mirror, so I had to awkwardly lean over the sink to see closely. The full-length mirror would have worked, but there was no light above it. So until this changes, bring your own vanity mirror. It would also be nice to have the toilet separate from the rest of the bathroom, but, like other hotels, space is constrained and I can understand it's not really feasible without taking something else away. But none of that would keep me from staying there again. It's in a great location, very close to some awesome restaurants, shopping and the walk up to the park is beautiful.

I was travelling solo, took a cab from the airport and was at the hotel in about 25 minutes. By the time I paid the cab, the attendant had already taken my bag to the front desk. I was impressed. Checked in at the front desk, was told my sister had already checked in was waiting in the lobby bar. The attendant took my bag up to the room and I met my sister in the lobby bar. Room: Room had a cool vibe, not the usual hotel decor. Modern, lots of dark wood, white, and chrome. Room was small but roomy enough. Had enough closet space to hang clothes. One wall was windows with a small balcony. The bed was very comfortable especially since they didn't have the usual huge cheap pillows which kill my neck. Quality sheets and duvet. Bathroom was modern and roomy, L'Occitane products were another plus. the glass shower with a sheer curtain was cool. If I was there with my husband, it would of totally rocked. You can pull back the curtain and view the person showering from the bed, interesting, maybe not so much with my sis, but not a big deal. Had turn down service before we left for dinner. Had a great sleep and was amazed how quiet it was, especially since it's right downtown (we were on the 7th, top floor). FYI: Room also comes with 2 ipod docking stations, so don't need to bring your ipod speakers. Business Centre: I had to use the business centre during my stay, on Saturday before check-out, since I was doing a distance education course, something was due. Bus. centre is on the 2nd floor, which I liked. Not placed in the lobby in a small room. Card entry was required, room was large, with 2 spacious desks. Room was even equipped with printers. No password was required, so it was very comfortable just like I was at home, which is important I think when you want to deal with your work/school responsibilities and get back to your vacation. Service: We were impressed by the service, it was professional and extremely efficient. We had to call down twice during our stay. Once, we requested more coffee (house brand is starbucks) which was brought up to our room in about 2 seconds it seemed. Second time my sis was wondering if they had morning paper service and was then asked which one she would prefer out of three choices, nice!

Not very peaceful, calming or romantic. Rather garish, actually and it was a distraction to the rest of the vibe in the place. Very quiet hotel. We didn't hear our neighbors conversations, tvs or anything.

One last point - we've had several events at this location utilizing their confernence space and the events have always been a huge success. The catering is very very good, the bar staff really friendly and professional, and the sales team that run the conference centre are really helpful always going out of their way to ensure you and your event guests are taken care of.

We told them - they seemed surprised as if no one has ever mentioned this to them. They moved us to a room on the 6th floor in the back and we got a sound sleep that night (although I still took two Benadryl just in case). You can stay here unbothered if your room is higher than the 4th floor and in the back. We were on the 4th floor initially and you can clearly hear the words to the songs and the conversations on the street. Funny thing: The room service attendant asked if we wanted earplugs - so they obviously know about it! Also - the rooms for less than $500 are not worth staying in. The room they moved us to was a suite which costs $550 but is not huge by any means. We reserved a $250 - which is normally around $300 - and it was like a coffin.

I got no response; when we checked in, late and exhausted from traveling, and I once again asked for a quiet room, the desk clerk was really rude. The room he assigned us was next to the elevator, painted dark blue, and long and narrow. The bathroom was at the end opposite the door, separated from the room by opaque sliding glass doors. The only window was at the end of the bathroom--behind the sink and the mirror. If the blind was open, all bathroom activities would be open to the street and the offices across the way. Otherwise: no natural light. The space was creepy and depressing, even with all the lamps on, by day and by night. The bed was barely a double and without the most basic support (it had no box spring--seemed to be a trundle). The furniture was modern, but it was already worn-looking. To plug in the laptop, we had to crawl under the desk. There was a huge gap under the door that let light in all night--not to mention noise. The Canada Line dig is RIGHT beside the front door to the hotel, and below the windows. This wasn't a huge problem for us, since we were up early for work commitments anyway, but we left as the construction started up, and I can assure you that (contrary to the desk clerk's assurances) the noise is loud, and not just limited to trucks moving in and out. Access is also complicated, since Davie St is shut off directly below the hotel. There seemed to be no Oroom service except breakfast delivery. The foodservice seemed to be limited to the scary-looking, neon-ridden bar/restaurant on the first floor. When we came back at 11:45 am, our room had not yet been cleaned. The only good thing I can say about the opus is that the shower was great. That's not a good enough reason to spend your money there, in my opinion.

On one hand I liked the Opus for its convenient location, comfortable room and friendly staff. On the other hand, I could barely stand the pretention and wannabe-hipster vibe. I appreciate interesting design, and I'm all for a hotel trying to fit its neighbourhood, but...elevators bathed in red and blue floodlights? C'mon. I've stayed in plenty of hotels, like the Gault in Montreal or Le Germain in Toronto that ARE cool, without resorting to parlour tricks like that. I appreciated the function, comfort and design touches (like the Aeron desk chairs and raindrop showerheads) of the hotel but I found it hard not to snicker at all the awkward attempts to be funky. Two issues I had: 1) if you stay on the 2nd, or even 3rd floor, expect street noise. We live in downtown Toronto and are used to it, but on Saturday night at 2AM there were literally people outside our window having screaming contests. Ask for a high floor. 2) Charging $14.95/day for an internet connection is ridiculous. For a hotel that claims to be cutting edge, that's some pretty 2002 thinking. If you stay here and you need to check your email or do a web check-in, just go down to the business centre on the 2nd floor. It's free. I would happily recommend the Yaletown neighbourhood to someone visiting Vancouver, but I don't know if I'd recommend this hotel to most people. I like boutique hotels, and recommend them often, but this isn't one. Nearby: Yaletown's a great neighbourhood to stroll around. You can borrow bikes from the hotel, or rent them at the bottom of Davie Street, and bike along the waterfront...or walk, or rollerblade. It's easy to get to the other side of downtown as well, with all that entails, or to get to Stanley Park & the seawall, etc., etc. Restaurants: the restaurant in the hotel seemed ok (we only had breakfast there) but the hotel bar itself was trying desperately hard to be trendy. If sitting on bean bag chairs and drinking cocktails bathed in purple light is your thing, then this is the bar for you. If not, there's a great brewpub around the corner on Mainland, or lots of nearby places in between those extremes. Same goes for food...you can easily walk to anything from a sports bar to thai to italian to a Rob Feenie restaurant, or take a cab to everything else. Vancouver's limitless when it comes to good food. Also, Yaletown has just as many coffee shops as other Vancouver neighbourhoods (if not more) and there's a great grocery store near the foot of Davie Street.", "Date": "July 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "EU", "Title": "\u201cLovely\u201d", "Author": "journeys4me", "ReviewID": "UR17408349", "Content": "Hotel is just lovely.

Not only did the hotel do a great job accommodating this request - they upgraded my Standard Room reservation to a Business Executive Suite at no extra charge!! Needless to say, my travel partner and I were ecstatic! We also highly enjoyed the secure elevators (which will only access floors using your keypass). Great safety measure in a metropolitan city. Around 20 minutes after checking in to our suite an settling down, the wonderful Meaghan from the front desk was kind enough to provide us with a courtesy call to ensure that all our needs were met. 10 minutes afterwards, the friendliest staff member came to our door to deliver water, ice, earplugs, and offer turndown service.

The design element was consistent throughout, and impressed me (a frequent traveler) very much. The bathrooms were stunning and the stand-up shower was definitely my favourite part of the room (aside from the most comfortable bed in the world). A word of advice to those who are picky with pillows - the Opus has fairly high pillows which can be an issue if you are used to lower ones at home. But the beds themselves are awesome! The lobby itself was also very well decorated - the only issue is that the concierge desk is right next to the open bar concept. When there is a reception there (as there was when we arrived), it can be very loud and hard to check in and hear what the concierge is trying to say.

We had stayed there once about 3 years ago and still remembered it fondly... we'd been looking forward to this visit for several weeks. The Opus didn't dissapoint. It's an exteremly stylish boutique hotel in one of the most fun parts of Vancouver. We felt like rockstars the entire weekend. It's practically next door to some of the best restaurants in town and also quite close to several parks along False Creek. Other things: The Olympics: Vancouver is scrambling to get ready for the 2010 Winter Olympics. A new Canada Line transit station is being built right next to the Opus. This will be extremely convenient once completed, but it's a bit inconvenient for now... Davies street is cut off just past the Opus and you have to walk through scafolding to get to the Roundhouse area. Didn't notice any construction noise however, probably because it's mostly underground. Neighborhood: We love Yaletown! A super trendy neighborhood with great restaurants and cafe's. Often, hip neighborhoods like this in metro areas can be equally snooty and uninviting, but we found Yaletown to still have enough grungieness to make us feel welcome. Internet: So here's one knock against the Opus. For a hotel in this category, I think it's really unacceptable to charge for Internet access. They charge a little over $15 CND per day for wireless. That's just stupid... it should be free. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any open wireless connections to get around the charge, so I just accepted it. Sigh. Travelling with pets: Opus is *extremely* accomodating to guests with pets. We've been there twice now with our two doggies and we've been treated very well both times. One note: Their official policy is that you're not to leave your doggies in your room without you, but they'll look the other way as long as they are well mannered. Also, the Opus is about 2 blocks away from some very nice waterfront parks. The nearby David Lam park was stocked with doggie bags during our visit. This became our morning and evening routine with our pooches. Ice: There are no ice machines in the Opus. However, you can call guest services and they will bring ice to you. That wound up becoming a little annoying on our second day there when we arrived back to the hotel after a long walk and had to wait 15 minutes for them to bring up ice to us.

I think this is the first time in recent memory that the staff actually made me feel like asking a question was a good thing rather then bothering them while they did work. Anytime I had any question or needed anything they were right on top of it. They even had coupons for when I went to the aquarium near by. Area- I had never heard of or been to yaletown where the hotel is located before this visit so I didn't know what to expect. I personally had never been a huge fan of Vancouver before largely because of the problem they have with run down areas and the poor everywhere but I was blown away by this part of town. It reminded me of Soho in new york or the hip and trendy spots in any city. It has tons of nice restaurants, bars, lounges and shops around it. Your also very close to all the sporting venues and if you need a ride they have a BMW 7 series that can drive you where you need to go. OVERALL- I personally am never intending to stay at another hotel when I am in vancouver. As long as there are rooms here I will be staying at this beautiful boutique hotel.", "Date": "January 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff", "Title": "\u201cPErfect memories\u201d", "Author": "LottieCardiff", "ReviewID": "UR11883593", "Content": "If luxury and attention to detail is your thing then go.

I'm not terribly familiar with Vancouver, but it was nice to be able to park at the hotel and walk to lots of restaurants, the sea wall, etc. The only reasons I'd suggest not staying here are temporary and specific. First, they're constructing an underground subway station right next to the Opus (the hole for the station is about a foot from the exterior wall of the hotel, it's literally right next door). My room was on the same side as the construction, so once they started pounding at 7:00 A.M. I was awake whether I liked it or not. The desk clerk said that the current noise level was the worst that it's been. I think construction goes through 2009. Maybe the other side of the hotel isn't as noisy. There was no noise at night. Second, I was there on business with a coworker and we requested separate beds. We were \"upgraded\" to a suite which had a king and a sofa bed, but we were told the sofa bed was a normal mattress and just as comfy. It wasn't, it was as uncomfy as any sofa bed I've slept on.

I live in Vancouver and decided that for New Years I would just stay in the city to celebrate NYE. My booking was made in November over the phone for an executive suite but for whatever reason Opus would not allow me to just book one night so I had to book 2 nights which cost just under $1200. The nightmare began on the 30th. The check-in time was after 3 PM so I came in around 6 PM and approached the front desk. The woman handling the reservations desk had a chip on her shoulder before I walked up. She asked me for my Visa card on which I booked my room on. I told her my Visa did not have enough for both nights and I would pay her a cash deposit. I've stayed at other hotels in Vancouver and around the world and almost every hotel will accommodate cash as deposit. Her response was 'NO' and told me if my credit card didn't have enough for both nights she wouldn't give me the room. At this point I told her that I would give her the full amount in cash and even an extra $200, which would be $1400!!! The answer was 'NO' and you would think by booking one of the expensive suites the front desk would have some respect and try to work the problem out but nope, she left me hanging and started helping someone else. I sat around the hotel in disbelief for 30 mins trying to figure out how I could pay the deposit with my visa. The whole time no hotel staff approached me to try to solve the problem, instead the front desk employees were too busy talking to each other. I finally approached her and asked if she could, for this one time only, let me pay with cash. This time around she made sure other people sitting in the lobby would hear and said 'do you not understand I\u2019m not going to repeat myself...WE DON'T ACCEPT CASH AS DEPOSIT!\u2019 I was shocked. I asked for the manager but the manager wasn't 'in'. I went back and sat down and started calling other hotels in Vancouver to see if I could get a room for NYE but all the other hotels were booked.

It's still close to everything else you'd want to see and do, but you feel a little bit more like a local in this part of town - highly recommend it. But the construction that is going on right outside on Davies Street is very, very annoying - and it is expected to go on until the Olympics (in 2010?). They're gutting the street to put in a subway, so it's no small project. Really too bad, because it comes close to ruining the hotel. Thankfully we are early risers - if you're not, you shouldn't go, because they start promptly at 8am, and it is loud. Maybe it's better on the other side of the hotel though - we were directly above it on the 5th floor.

The bar downstairs was great - not as crowded as I would have thought, but a good time. All the other bars in Yaletown were only 4 blocks away and easily walkable. The hotel has an S430 that will take you whereever you want - you should definitely request it if its available and just tip the driver. If you are up there for the strip clubs, screw Brandi's and go to No. 5 Orange instead - very very good times. I would highly recommend the hotel.", "Date": "May 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cPure Luxury!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3321340", "Content": "I just spent an unforgettable evening at the Opus hotel in my very own hometown, beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia. The Opus is a beautiful, boutiuque located in the heart of Yaletown - the newest and trendiest neighbourhood in Vancouver. It's surrounded by the city's busiest and best restaurants, cafes, and hip retail stores - all within walking distance. The hotel itself manages to strike a balance perfectly betwen minimalist and modern with all the oppulent luxuries you'd expect from a boutique hotel. Our room (a gorgeous suite on the top floor) had a bathroom you could live in - with heated marble tiles, a granite and wood vanity, a rainfall showerhead, and luxurious soaker tub! The amenities were incredible and expansive - from L'Occitane soaps and creams, to Oxia Oxygen. However, it was the little touches that impressed us both - when we came back from dinner the lights in our room were dimmed, the bed was turned down with Beligian chocolates placed on the pillows, and soft music playing. I can't recall the last time I had such an incredible evening! I would can't say enough about the wonderful experience at the Opus and would highly recommend it to tourists and locals alike looking for an escape in the city.", "Date": "April 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, BC", "Title": "\u201cChic & stylish\u201d", "Author": "Cedre", "ReviewID": "UR3301236", "Content": "This is the hippest hotel I have ever stayed at.

Big windows brought in lots of sunlight in the room, and even to the bathroom that was at the other end of the room. The bed was very comfortable, and I had one of my best sleeps there. The rooms are spotless! We went out during the evening and when we returned our beds were turned and they had chocolates on our pillows...so sweet! The lounge downstairs is a very hip hang out and they have amazing martinis.

It is about a $25.00 taxi ride from the Vancouver Airport. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a friendly doorman, who helped with our bags. The check-in process was quick and friendly. My room was a bright colourful blue. Very modern decor. Not like the old Victorian style that you see in other high class hotels. Keep in mind that the rooms are small, REAL SMALL. I'm sure they have bigger rooms, but you'll have to fork out the cash. It does not seem like a hotel you would bring children to(I didn't see any either). The bed was heavenly with soft clean linens and duvet. The bathroom was nice with a waterfall type showerhead. Not one of the water conserving ones you see in most hotels. Wonderful bath products. The in room safe wasn't working but one of the staff members quickly attended and remedied the problem. There is lots of stuff to see and do in the nearby area. Not too far from the downtown area. Had one of the best sleeps in months. Requested a wake up call in the morning. This was the first time I had a real person call and wish me good morning instead of an automated machine.

When Opus was good, it was very very good, and when it was bad, it was not that bad because they recovered well. Good: When I made reservations, they waived the $25 a day parking fee. Bad: I had to ask them to waive it. Good: Excellent directions. easy to find, Great location. Bad: The only visible place to park for reservations is the valet parking spot. We parked in the alley, and the registration clerk immediately asked us to move to the valet parking spot because tow trucks were fast and silent for alley parking. Good: They upgraded us to a suite without asking---and the suite was great. I could have lived in the bathroom, complete with soaking tub, separate shower, and heated floor. Some confusion as to whgether the room was made up---at 4 pm! More on that later. Bad: The bathrobe was small and a bit threadbare. The tub faucets had been installed in reverse so hot water was labeled cold and vice versa. A nice desk, and nice chairs---but dim blubs everywhere. One of the bed lights wasn't plugged in (nor was the clock radio) and when i went to plug them in, I couldn't find the plug,. which was behind a heavy bed. Toll-free calls cost $1.25 plus tax. Everything not nailed down seemed to have aprice tag. Good: Someone came up within two minutes to plug in the fixtures. Globe & Mail paper delivered to your door---even th ebig Saturday edition. Bad: The clock radio went off at 5 a.m. because they hadn't reset it, and the thing was so new-fangled designed that it was near impossible to figure out which button to press to shut it off. Bad: First night turn-down: No pillow cases on the pillows under the pillow covers. The maid failed to latch the door on leaving. Inconvenient to get to your car in the locked, valeted garage--only parking available. Loud street noise on Friday and Saturday nights. Good: The second night was completely different: Latched door after the turndown. Chocolate on the pillows. Water bottles. Bathtub faucet fixed. Pillow cases on the pillows.

He said he was treated like gold and we were treating ourselves...after already spending $$$ on our wedding night at the W in San Fran (Fantastic). Our room was cool, we liked the comfy bed, fireplace and lounge chair. The room was so dark, we could never find anything without turning all the lights on and we lost the remote twice-housekeeping never put it in a place easy to find-we called down to the desk and no one ever came-we left for dinner after 40 min and never saw the remote for a day(baseball playoffs...). We did receive a nice welcome gift but that was about it for the out-of-the -ordinary service we thought we would get. The front desk was confusing-we never knew who to ask for restaurant recommendations-usually you ask the concierge but there was NEVER anyone at the desk so we would ask the door guys(all very nice and their recommendations were good) but asking them was akward because they acted like they had other things to do(earpieces were probably telling them something) and there were things going on in the bar so we never felt like we got the best advice and like I said, at other hotels it is very obvious who you should ask directions and recommendations. They did offer the car and we used it twice-that was very cool. We were not treated badly but for a chic hotel at this price and with the reviews we read, we expected a little more from the front desk area. We loved Vancouver-it's clean and the waterfront is beautiful. We rented bikes and rode around Stanley Park-stopping at the aquarium-very good even though we have been to Monterey Aquarium a few times. We had the best hot chocolate of our lives at the cafe in Stanley park by the Totem Poles. Granville Island is awesome-San Francisco farmer's market is nice but this blows it away. Vancouver Art Gallery is worth the time and Yaletown is fun and very hip-we really enjoyed the restaurants.
