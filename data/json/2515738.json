Terrible for couples.\u201d", "Author": "Tara T", "ReviewID": "UR129000708", "Content": "I booked this hotel for a three night stay for my fiance and I. We had an early morning flight into San Diego and checked in at 10am. We decided to nap and then venture out for lunch. Upon entering our suite, I was a bit scared that someone was sleeping in the bed. The room smelled extremely musty and the comforter was so deformed, it looked like there was a body under it. We figured we could make it work for the three nights, so we laid down and took a nap. Nap, we did not. The room next door had children that were screaming from the time our heads hit the pillow until we finally decided to get up. It was so loud and clear, it sounded as if they were in our room. We left and went to lunch. After that episode, my fiance decided he couldn't stay there the entire 3 days. I called Orbitz, since I booked the room with them and when they notified the hotel that we wanted to change hotels, they were informed by Rosa, \"Guest Service Manager\" that she wasn't going to do that as we had never contacted her to \"give them an opportunity to rectify the situation.\" I called Rosa and she was INCREDIBLY UNPROFESSIONAL. She copped a major attitude and insinuated that I was lying about the loud children. I told her that I felt she was taking it personal and all we wanted was to be let out of our room and find another. She continued to argue with me and flat out told me she wasn't going to let us out of it. I asked if she had a supervisor and, thank God, she did. I still can't believe I had someone in the service industry who spoke like a snotty little brat who was hell bent on getting her way. I asked if her supervisor would call me back. She continued to rant so I eventually hung up on her. Twenty minutes later, Richard, the General Manager, phoned and was quite nice. I simply explained to him, as I had to Rosa that we just wanted something a bit more quiet. He made no qualms about it and said they are more for families. He refunded our money and said he would handle the terrible customer service that Rosa provided. It's sad that my conversation with him couldn't have been my first one. Horrendous customer service leaves such a sour taste in your mouth. Thank goodness for Richard. We ended up at the Sheraton on the Marina and really enjoyed our stay. Maybe a family would enjoy this hotel.

The hotel is located nearby so many things that were convenient like restaurants, Walgreen's was next door, the post office was just down the road, the bus/trolley station is less than a mile walking distance away with bus stops even closer. As for the shuttle, they have 350 rooms and most were full the whole time I was there. Why anyone would think that a hotel could cater to you and shuttle you around when there is so much public transportation nearby blows my mind. For 5.00 a day (less if you get a multiday pass) you can ride the bus/trolleys all day. I did not expect the hotel to shuttle me around. I did find that you should book your return shuttle to the airport a day or two before to make sure you are able to get a time slot you want. I saw the staff take a lot of abuse from people and not once did they lose their cool and they tried their best to be helpful. The demands that some people have are just crazy.

For the amenities, service and comfort I would have expected to pay quite a bit more. Breakfast was amazing--though by definition a continental breakfast is just coffee and roll or pastries this hotel had a full hot breakfast with made-to-order pancakes and eggs plus oatmeal, a variety of (not old!) pastries, bread and bagels (with toasters right there, plus cream cheese and butter), coffee, orange juice, apple juice, and apples/oranges. We actually left quite full each day and for free. The staff was very nice and helpful and went out of their way. The pool area (which had a hot tub) was clean; the pool was heated so even though it was cool during my stay I still swam. The hotel was near many excellent restaurants (loved Georgia's Greek Cuisine and Taste of the Himalayas Indian food) and stores, plus several buses are nearby and it's close to the Old Town transit center. The rooms were clean (no unpleasant odor, something I fear from former smoking hotels!), the bed was comfortable with a nice thick comforter. The room had a fridge, microwave, tub/shower, wifi, a/c unit, hot water machine and instant coffee. We used the free hotel shuttle on February 28th, it was very handy, took us to the airport for free and the shuttle had a 5mile radius which would cover downtown, the zoo (Balboa Park), and Seaworld. I didn't see that mentioned on their website or I would have used it to get an airport pickup. I will definitely stay here next time I visit! For the price I paid I expected much less. The only thing I could think to complain about was that the outside walls were thin and it was quite audible when people were loud outside but we were in a corner room right near stairs which made it more heavily trafficked.

Although it was a great price, I wouldn't stay there again. The staff was friendly and helpful and it's conveniently located, but those were the only saving graces. We checked in on a Saturday and planned to stay through Wednesday. On Saturday, each of my children got stuck in the bathroom because the pocket door would not slide open. We called maintenance a couple of times but this wasn't repaired until Sunday evening. While swimming in the pool, we several times found stray strands of long hair in the water. The room's air conditioner made clicking noises all night. My daughter stepped on a spot in the carpet where it was worn away from the tack strip and got a small cut on her heel. Sunday morning we stopped by the front desk (on our way out for the day) to ask that the air conditioner and carpet be repaired or our room be changed. The front desk staff was apologetic and helpful. When we arrived back at the hotel in the late afternoon, the parking lot was littered with literally hundreds of dead or dying bees, which we didn't notice until our son was stung. We stopped by the front desk and asked if we could cancel the remainder of our stay. The front desk was again very helpful and offered us a free upgrade to a suite by the pool. We accepted. This room was in better condition and actually seemed quite nice. However, there was a wet spot in the corner of one of the two rooms of the suite that smelled bad. Figuring we had complained enough, we didn't mention it. My oldest son slept on the sofa that pulls out into a bed. We checked out Wednesday morning and by Wednesday afternoon my oldest son had a rash on the back of his knees. This turned out to be scabies, which we found out from our pediatrician upon our return home that he most likely contracted them from where he slept on Tuesday night. We certainly can't prove that it came from the hotel, but we are fairly certain. He was the only one who slept on the pullout couch and he was the only one who got scabies (google scabies if you dare - it's creepy). He then passed them on to my other son when we arrived home.

My family and I were supposed to have a somewhat extended stay here and after 1 night, I simply couldn't do it. I did not sleep. This is honestly the worst stay I have ever experienced in a hotel and I don't ask for much-just a safe, clean, quiet, cool place to sleep. This hotel was none of those things. Our room had a sliding door that leads directly to the parking lot-the only thing that keeps you separate is a flimsy bar-not very reassuring. There was a large group outside of our door arguing for a long time early in the evening. Then, my husband and I noticed the room wasn't cooling even after about 2 hours. We called the front desk and they sent a maintenance man (who arrived very quickly by the way-only positive thing I can say about the stay) who overrode the system so that you could set the temperature all the way down to 48 degrees. Guess what, still didn't work! He said if it didn't work after 15 minutes, tell them the following day to switch rooms for the remainder of the stay, though he did warn us that the 3rd floor is very noisy because that's where the air-conditioning generators are located. As if the heat wasn't enough, the noise from above was AWFUL!!! It sounded like the ceiling was going to cave in. Called the front desk and they said they would send someone to check it out. Didn't stop until about 4 am. At that point I went into the front area and killed 2 ROACHES on the cabinets!!! Called front desk and they blamed it on the greenery. Oh, I'm sure it has nothing to do with the huge gap between the door and the floor. Disgusting! Also, while it is close to Seaworld, the other hotel that we ended up switching to in the hotel circle was just as close, and didn't have adult shops, strip clubs, and women of the night everywhere-and it was cheaper before the satisfaction discount was applied! Bottom line-don't do this to yourself. Because of the horrific experience they discounted my stay 50%, leaving me at $65 for a sleepless night, but because I was so exhausted, I was in no mood to argue. I paid $80/night at a wonderful hotel in the hotel circle and could not have been happier to get away from this seedy motel-and I stayed in one of the Suites!!!

It's not new, but was not dirty and as gross as I've read in other reviews. An effort was made to provide some decor and make the best use of the space to the comfort of it's guests. I did not do my research BEFORE booking (I ended up doing it while we were there during \"#ell-night\")--this was a spur of the moment trip to SeaWorld and since we live in LA, I just needed something close to the park for the night. This wasn't even the cheapest hotel available. I paid twice the lowest local rate and expected that there was some ascending quality built into that especially since I booked into the suites side of the hotel-assuming that this would be a even more of an upgrade in quality and privacy which turned out to be a wrong assumption. We arrived in the daytime, and I knew there was something off when we had to cross a back street to an unsecured lot, with unsecured stair access to our room where there were some people laying around in the lot and alley. We returned from the park after dark and on the way from the freeway noticed the GIANT strip club not too far from the hotel. And then the OTHER giant strip club. And the adult shops. We live in LA. We're not prudes. But when a hotel has a family-friendly themepark as part of its name, it better not be across from a t!tty-bar. Or a regular bar that plays live, loud music until 2 am that echos into your balcony area. When that shuts down you can finally have a moment's silence to enjoy the sound of your neighbors doing stuff with the call girls they've invited back to the room through the paper-thing walls. How do you know it's a call girl? It's when the hotel door shuts and a single, clacking pair of heels heads back down to the parking lot. Over and over again. All night long. Toss in a bunch of shady characters milling about in the open hallways earlier in the evening and I would describe our evening in this hotel as waiting out a Zombie-apocolypse. Just turn off the lights, lock the doors and pray you make it to daylight. So, is this hotel dirty? Not in the way that is the cleaning staff's responsiblity. The hotel has 2 very diverse clientel, which is not their fault.

It had to be the WORST hotel we have EVER, and may I emphasis EVER, stayed at! After we had checked in and got our room key we went to our room, arms loaded with our luggage, and found that the clerk had given us the wrong room. She was friendly though and gave us the right room. As we walked into the room there was a terrible odor. It seemed as though the room had never been cleaned. But it looked ok and so we stayed. Later that evening as we were preparing for bed I took my socks off and of course they were black, which was grose but have had that problem before in a hotel. As I went to turn on the light near the bed a horrible odor came from the carpet near the bed. Everytime I turned over in the night I'd smell that horrible smell. I have no ideas what it was. 2 days after we checked in the toilet broke and we had to Manuel flush the toilet until they came to fix it, which was later that day. The very next morning the light over the sink, which is where you have to do your hair, burnt out. So we called the front office and they sent a repair man to replace it a half hour later. Which irritated me because we were trying to get out of the hotel to go to Sea World. But that wasn't even the worst thing. The very next morning, 3 days after we checked in we went to get in the shower to get ready for the day and there was NO HOT WATER!! We contacted the front desk and they informed us that the boiler had gone out and there was no hot water. They told us that they had some rooms available across the street that we could go shower in. So we had to load up all our personal products and trapes across the street to shower. Let me tell you it was a big hassle. When we returned that evening from our daily activities there still was no hot water. The front desk told us it wasn't fixed yet but should be in the morning. Which of course it wasn't so once again we had to load all our personal stuff up and trapes across the street to shower but this day it was raining so that made it ever worse. By this time I had had it with this dump and began to look around the area for another hotel. There was hardly any rooms available and the ones that were available were very expensive. So I couldn't afford to change hotels. Which really made me livid. We asked them if they would move us into two rooms across the street, with hot water, that had adjoining doors but they said they couldn't do that. Much later that evening the water was finally fixed and we were able to have a warm shower that next day. But when I showered the following day there STILL was no hot water. I refused to pay full price for that hotel and told the front desk that I wanted a discount for the inconvience their hotel caused me. They told me that they could give me a 25% discount off two of the days. Which was only a measly $30. I refused that offer and told them I wanted the suite room for the cost of a regular room. The clerk said she'd have to talk to the manager. After some wheeling and dealing they finally agreed to my offer. Which saved me much more than their first offer but even that wasn't worth the problems we endured at this HORRIBLE hotel. I would NEVER, EVER, EVER stay at the Days inn near Sea World again. Not only was our room terrible but the breakfast was horrible too. There was usually only one lady who cooked and served the breakfast. So we usually had to wait for 10 or 15 minutes to get our food. Even then it wasn\u2019t that great tasting The breakfast room also had a absolutely terrible smell. Many mornings I felt like throwing up because it stunk so bad. Even the terrible area it is located in doesn't compare to how rotten that dive of a hotel is. Bums everywhere, nude bars on every corner, and panhandlers on every street don't even come close to explaining what a scummy place this hotel is. Day's Inn should not even want their name associated with this hotel. I would be embarrased to say this hotel was in my chain of hotels.

I say this because I feel I have a way higher \"tolerance\" than most people for sub-standard hotel rooms, and I have travelled ALL over and stayed in lots of questionable hotels. This hotel was BY FAR the worst one I have ever stayed in in my life. I was completely mortified when we walked in to the room. The pix online of this hotel made it look really nice, website boasted of a \"full\" free breakfast, suites, etc. The room was horrendous. We had to walk about a half a block behind the hotel and cross a street (w homeless people everywhere) to get to our room. Our room was very dirty, carpet was dirty, very bare bones furniture. The sink was literally RIGHT in the room with the bed. I was extrememly nervous that there wa bugs/cockroaches in room. I have never ever left a hotel and switched because I have been disappointed and let me tell you I was very close to leaving this hotel. The \"free\" breakfast was a complete JOKE: 1 type of cereal every day (corn flakes) No pastries or donuts, 1 type of eggs every day (scrambled) and pancakes only (I was told they had waffles when I called hotel when I was booking trip), 1 fruit every day only (very small oranges in a bowl), and only 1 type of instant oatmeal (plain), 1 type of juice every day (OJ), No toppings for oatmeal, no fresh fruit cut up, no variety in cereal, no bacon or sausage, no yogurt, etc. Everything was served on styrfoam plates w/ plastic utensils. I know I am coming off as sounding like a Prima Donna which I am not. But I have stayed at plenty of hotels that have had FREE continental breakfasts and they had so much more variety than this hotel. A couple times I had to go to the front desk at night after dark, and I was very nervous walking across street and through parking lot to the front desk area. I could tell even my kids were horrified at the room and the hotel. The pool area was very dirty (towels EVERYWHERE) and the pool itself was dirty. The laundry room was disgusting also.

When asked about the spare key for laundry room, Frontdesk claimed there is only one laundry key and janitor had it at that time so there was no way she could be of any help. If that were of truth, then this property would have broken the fire code thousands of time. Also she kept saying there were other guest calls for service and the janitor was dealing with them. I happen to find out the janitor was not servicing anyone but doing some normal maintenance the whole time. The frontdesk also denied any accountabilities for the water shutdown saying it was not foreseeable. But the truth is that when we arrived two days before which was a Saturday we already noticed there was water leaking at the building basefloor and cones placed around the leakage. My guess is that they didn't shutoff the water to repair because the high occupancy during weekend. They picked the following Monday. So they knew it ahead but because of the bad management they failed to notice guests. When people complained they just denied. b. Janitors incredibly ... how to I put it? crazy?

We found the room to be very basic, but very suitable for our needs, and quite clean. The room had a separate bedroom area which worked really well for our family. Also there was plenty of room for luggage. The shower was ok and in line with what we found throughout our US trip (a bit different from australian showers!)

We had been placed in the back building over the road from the main reception area, so we had a long way to run in the pouring rain. We asked if the bus could come and collect us in the back street but were told that was not possible. We were all drenched by the time we got to reception!! Our departure was very bland - not one member of staff enquired about whether we had enjoyed our stay, or if there had been any problems. We also had a problem with the laundry. We wanted to do some washing but the laundry on our floor had closed even though the sign said it was open for several more hours. We rang the reception and eventually someone agreed to come and unlock the door, after questioning me for some minutes about me being mistaken!!

After-all I do hate to sound petty.... Our trip started off nicely. We chose the hotel on price and location. Our idea is that the hotel is just a place to sleep and as long as we have the necessities we are just fine. I mean who really goes on vacation in San Diego to stay in their rooms? There is SO much to do and the hotel is so conveniently located to all that we wished to see. We checked in, drove to the other side of the hotel to the Suite's area. Attempted parking in the extremely narrow spaces, we thought oh well...We wont be in the parking lot too much... We walked into our room, to be honest we were quite suprised at the size for the money, we had a private patio, we overlooked the pool, and had two rooms. It appeared clean...As we started to unpack for our 5 night stay, a strange odor began to rise. MILDEW like you would not believe. I began to gasp, choke and cough so badly that we opened the windo and doors to try and let some air in. We also turned on the AC to let some air move around. The stench that came from the AC was overwhelming to say the least. I was SO amazed by this smell. I immediately knew that it had been past the \"5 minute rule\" Ya know the rule that you only have 5 minutes to be so unhappy with your room that you immediately check out. I knew we were stuck, as well we thought to ourselves once again that we could deal with it. I went to the conveniently located walgreens and got a candle, fabreze and air sanitizer. The air fresheners helped, while we laughed that people should not have to travel with air fresheners! HAHA OK, so we got up the next morning and went touring San Diego. Came back to our room at around 330, I sprayed the room with febreze once more, nothing had been done by housekeeping. They finally showed at about 430, I met her at the door and said we were fine and just needed a new set of towels. She came in, took the old towels, and garbage. She handed me fresh towels. The next day we got up, toured San Diego again. Came back to the room at around 5pm, again sprayed the room with febreze. I ran a bath, when I finished reached up to find that WE HAD NO TOWELS! I dried myself with the toilet paper they were so nice to provide. I attempted calling the office, no answer...I called with my Cell the direct number, no answer... We were going to dinner and decided to just go to the office and get them ourselves. Acting as if it was a huge disruption to her night she handed us the towels. The next day we went out, we came back to the room at about 430. NO TOWELS AGAIN! We called the front desk via the phone in the room...No answer... Called with my Cell again, after about 10 minutes(yes 10 minutes, I was mad and would have waited forever!) The girl answered, I said \"Hi this is room 246, unfortunately our room was not given towels, can we please have them brought up?\" She replied \"do you need towels?\" I laughed, trying desperately not to scream I said \"Yes, we need towels, each day...\" We waited for a while, then we noticed out the window that the patrons at the pool were pulling towels out of the laundry bag. We decided to go to the pool, relax in the hottub and at the very least, steal some extra towels to keep in the room. Good thing we did, the next day they didnt leave us towels AGAIN! We gave up! Moral of my story, we now will travel with febreze and air sanitizer and our own extra towels!

I believe rooms near the pool (no matter which floor) are quite loud (long pool hours). -> so if you like it quiet, request a room at the far end of the corridor facing Cauley Street. - The pool area is small and not very inviting with old chairs and tables and sometimes even the trash from last days.

I know that hotels in San Diego is very high. but Days Inn suite was little bit lower than others. so I don't want to complain this Inn for Price. I just want to write quality of this Days Inn. (pro) good location low price for (suite). free breakfast (not great, but better than nothing^^just basics) toast,egg,hotcakes,muffin,creal,coffee,apple,orange I saw people swimming so I asummed pool was warm. (bad) old furniture. noise from car street (keep close window helped) terrible view from balcony(but better than nothing) bath tub ( ok for shower, don't want to take bath...dirty...) Days Inn suite makes me feel cheap person... Suite doesn't help me at all. Just gave me little more space. just for night sleep is ok. I'm not sure for recommandation Days Inn, people who looking for just sleep at low price, please, check dolpin motel. It is much smaller than Days Inn. But I,m sure dolpin motel is much cleaner...and lower price. I haven't go there...but sounds ok to me. I will try dolpin motel next time. or other expensive hotel if I can.

I got it for much cheaper than any what any other website was offering it for. Other sites offered it for 189, i got it for 139. And plus I reserved the Suite. I was looking forward to experience this hotel. My previous stays have been at the Hampton Inn in Las Vegas & San Francisco and they were both wonderful stays there, plus their continental breakfast is wonderful. I expected the same here. This place was horrible. In the front dest they made me sign a form stating that if we smoked we would be fined 300 dollars. When we arrive the the room, it stank of cigarretes!! The courtain had a cigar hole burned on to it. There were ash trays everywhere! Why would they make me sign that agreement then? The bathroom/shower was so tiny and the sink was outside. The beds could of been more comfortable. I expected more for being a suite. They consider it a suite because there is an extra wall and couch. They didn't even have soap in the room. I had to go down and ask for hand soap. And the CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST was horrible. They gave me two little pieces of paper and it said I can only choose from two options. The options were: Eggs, Pancakes, Muffin, and I forgot the other one. So I go downstairs expecting the Continental Breakfast buffet I've been to with other hotels, but this was not even close. It a small kitchen/Cafeteria and there was this line coming out the door. Only one lady making the breakfast. Besides her was a table with machines to disperse Orange Juice, Milk and Cereal.So waiting 15 minutes in a line that doesn't move I decided to just get some Orange Juice. I pushed the button, pure water came out. They were out of juice and no one came to refill it. So then I opted for cereal they had on that same table. The options were Fruit Loops and Total. They were out of Fruit Loops. I just decided to leave. It was horrible. We went out to a restaurant for breakfast instead and enjoyed our breakfast. Never again will I stay in a Days Inn. You want a nice hotel with comfortable beds. Nice decor, White sheets and white fluffy comforter, All you can eat continental breakfast.

We came to California for a long-awaited and anticipated vacation with my mother and son. Since we were flying in late, we wanted a place to stay when we got in. We arrived to a very rude front desk attendant, who was giving rude and sarcastic remarks. We were so tired after 12 hours of flying, and then having to rush to the hospital because of a problem my mother encountered on the plane; we couldn't even think straight. By the time we arrived at the hotel, roughly 1:30 AM (4:30 AM on the east coast where we flew in from), neither my son nor I was in the state of mind to do anything but sleep. We received our room key, and drove across the street to our 'suite'. We needed to unload our luggage, so we unloaded the suitcases and walked to the elevator. We walked into the elevator and pressed \"3\", and immediately thought of the amusement ride in MGM studios , Florida called \"Tower of Terror\", where you get into an elevator, and the elevator drops from the top floor. The elevator creaks, groans, and shudders all the way to the third floor. Outside there were prostitutes fighting, yelling and causing a commotion. We thought \"this is going to be a great stay\"! Our room was pretty clean, but dated, and my son said that the pull-out bed (which we had to pull out ourselves) is extremely uncomfortable. The shower was broken when we arrived, and all we could shower with was scalding hot water, so we called the front desk, who sent a repair man. This man came, and repaired the shower, and when my son still did not understand how to change the water temperature, the man walked into the bathroom, slammed his wrench on the toilet, and started explaining how to use the shower in a raised tone of voice. The people were very noisy, and the room next door was constantly receiving phone calls, which we heard. We had a view of a used car lot, and there were vagabonds living in a VW trailer outside the hotel on the street. One night, as my son was going to get some ice, a prostitute walked out of a room, looking extremely high. All around the hotel were strip clubs, flaunting \"Totally N***!!!, XXX\" etc. Needless to say, we did not feel safe getting in at night. The breakfast consisted of two choices out of about 5 things. There were burnt scrambled eggs, small (perhaps 6\" in diameter) pancakes, two-bite-muffins, cold cereal, and on the first day they had no toast for the eggs. After you got your food, there were no seconds. Obviously, we would not be staying at the Days Inn again. It was very over-priced for what we got and what we didn't get.
