I stayed two nights, on arriving in and departing from my two-week stay in Spain.

Takes 10-15 minutes to get there. Fast, easy check-in. Clean, spacious room. Bathroom was correct. The bar staff was friendly and attentive. I had a breakfast discount included in my online reservations, so it was 9 Eur (15 Eur otherwise)--the buffet was fine. The evening meal menu (either at the bar area or in the resto) was a little limited; I have a special diet, but stil managed to fill up well enough. There is a public transit bus stop with three buses that take you down town--easy to find, and 2 Euro each way. And the staff were very helpful. It is not a tourist trap, but if you aren't afraid of a 20 bus ride, you can get to everything easily enough.

Very stark, modern furnishings-but comfortable bed and overstuffed chair. Great room service - food was hot and tasty. I asked for a table and they brought one ASAP. Early am to airport - free shuttle much appreciated, also free continental breakfast in lobby at 0500. Adjacent to freeway, so traffic noise with open window.

When we arrived around 10 pm, there was nothing to eat, only a small bar open. Hardly any English spoken there as well. No cigarettes and no food, not even a sandwich to buy in the hotel (\"go to town\" for food and cigarettes, they suggested in the bar). I thought that airport hotels had basic things like this 24 hours a day. We went to our room just to find that there was room service which had some sandwiches and sallads so we ordered (why could they not have said that in the bar?). The \"international\" TV-channels are in Spanish, German, Arabic, just about any language than English. In the morning (10.30 a m) we went to the bar for a cup of coffee to find it closed and dark but according to a sign it should be open. An angry staff member told us it is closed. I asked why and showed her the sign. She said \"oh really?\" and watched her clock and run away, probably to find the person to open it. Breakfast closed as well but managed to come in anyway for coffee (expensive). To be a a airport hotel which caters for guests arriving around the clock from differenet time zones you might expect more professional English speaking staff, a 24 hour a day open cafe or kiosk and English TV-channels.

We stayed here as we had an overnight layover on our flight. I really wanted our stay to go smoothly and it did for the most part but there were still some problems. The shuttle is hard to find but I don't think this is the fault of the hotel, the airport was busy, not clearly marked, and there was no one to ask at 8pm on a Monday night. I was prepared for this from the reviews but still took me awhile. The \"hotel bus\" sign is small, also not the fault of the hotel. I called the bus (lucky to have a spanish cell) and it came in 25 minutes- I think I had just missed the previous bus. It is important to know that if you are in terminal B (international) just come out, turn right and the bus stop is just passed the taxis. I went all the way left and had to come back. The hotel is very close but the shuttle has to take a longer route due to construction and security issues. Check in was easy, and the room was very nice but the heater was broken. They promptly moved me to another room and moved all of my bags. The huge plus for me was the Fitness Room, which I had booked that had a treadmill in it so I could run while my 8 month baby slept. They have rooms with bikes, eliptical machines, and treadmills but you have to book them in advance and if you want a special machine make sure you ask. Room service was good, easy, and economical. Breakfast was really good, but a little expensive at 15 euros. THe shuttle in the morning was ontime, easy, and empty so I had no problems with that. Half of the hotel is on the highway, and our room was on that side- but I didnt think that noise was bad at all- just sounded like the wind to me. THere was road construction in the middle of the night but I only noticed because I woke up for the baby. The roadworks is also not the fault of the hotel. So overall the stay was good- the fitness machine in the room was great. I would stay here again but I would make sure to ask for the things I wanted and am prepared for everything like the shuttle.
