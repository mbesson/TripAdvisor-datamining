We stayed 5 nights in a small but nice cottage, with own small courtyard, a second small place that features a tub with hot spring water (with a distinct smell of Methane - it's volcanic water)and a typical outside balinese style bathroom.The room was nice, the bathroom also, but it shows that the hotel owner seems to have no money left for renovations. The wood was tarnished and looked shabby.Sevice at the rstaurant was slow and not really outgoing. It was sometimes a bit difficult to communicate as the staff's comand of english was rather poor.Pool is really great and the general setting too. 3 seperate small hot pools outside feature again the hot spring water that is pumped from the ground. It smells like boiled eggs, but it is hot and relaxing.No beach as the hotel is set back from the coast, with a waterway out to the sea. Surrounded by mangroves. Looks nice.In general a nice place, but it urgently needs a good refinishing job.Disturbing is in the early morning the arrival of the staff on their Mopeds - it wakes the whole place - especially when they run up their motor.For the rate you'll find better in Bali - and then with a beach in front too.Still our stay was ok as we moved around a lot and stayed rather little on the hotel grounds.It is far away from just about everything on Bali.", "Date": "Feb 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR772963428", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Indolover"}, {"Content": "farniente parmi les singes ...       piscine priv\u8305e", "Date": "Mar 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR445979111", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "lamourestharmonie"}, {"Content": "su nombre bien lo dice mimpi, sueno   showReview(12948678, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR333260619", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "SEPUPU"}, {"Content": "\u5a13\u2542\u7865\u9289\ue042\u5069\u9289\u7b3a\u5113   showReview(19167551, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR549754282", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9289\u20ac\u9288\u3083\u511e\u9289\u70bd\u5058\u951b\u55d8\u4fef\u5a09?#x201d;   showReview(19166817, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR860413553", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u5a34\u5cf0\ue63b\u9287\u0441\u20ac\u4f79\u4fef\u5a09\u5908\u4f00\u9287\u3083\u4eb1\u9288\u5c7b\u4f28\u9287?#x201d;   showReview(19159923, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR258996637", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608479-d584504-r14941196-Mimpi_Resort_Menjangan-Banyuwedang_Bali.html", "HotelID": "584504", "Price": "$210"}}
