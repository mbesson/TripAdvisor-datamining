I would not recommend this hotel to anybody. The previous comments made were spot on. The only thing good about this hotel is its location in South Kensington, which was very close to everything including restaurants, grocery stores and the Underground. However, there are many hotels in this area so you have a lot to choose from. When we checked in, we were told to come back since the rooms were not ready yet. We asked the front desk staff (looks like it's a poorly run family business) if we could get a map of London. We were told that they didn't have any. I would think that most of their guests are tourists and I would think that they'd be able to at least give you a city map. My husband and I had to go down the street to the Marriot to get a map of London and the concierge at the Marriot was a lot more helpful in terms of suggesting sites of interest in the area. We stayed on the 1st floor and as mentioned in other reviews, the walls are very thin and you can hear footsteps of the room above and people's conversation in adjacent rooms. There's a closet room in the hallway which is left open so feel free to grab a fresh and non-smelly towel. The makeshift window covering wasn't working properly. The beds were too small and pillows too flat. I had to leave a note to ask the cleaning person to change our sheets and to supply us with soap and shampoo. The pressure in the shower is good but don't drop the soap because if you bend down you won't be able to get back up and we're average sized people too. The towels stink like bleach so you better bring your own if you're planning on staying at this hotel. The breakfast was ok. The coffee was basically instant coffee put into a coffee pots. The front desk staff were basically non responsive.

Pro's are - Location, near tube Gloucester Road and in a nice area, lots of good pubs and restaurants within a few mins walk. Room size ok [ compact] and relatively clean. Bed comfortable. Breakfast ok - plenty of cereals, toast, Fruit, etc Con's - Shower in room fairly pathetic water flow - although Hot. No double glazing and rotting window frames Massive problem with damp in corner of room -which I would Guess runs down the whole side of the Hotel.

The closest tube station to the hotel is Gloucester (literally down the street), and shopping on Oxford street, museums, everything, were only a few minutes away so it was a great location. We would return, and a New Zealander in the lobby let us use his laptop, which was nice and I felt comfortable with the people who worked there as well.

I knew the rooms would be small but I didn't mind. I actually stayed here over a two week period, broken up by a brief trip outside of London. During the first part of the stay, I was put into a first floor room. The room was roasting hot (even though this was at the end of September and the weather was starting to cool). The ceiling light above the bed was partly to blame, I think, as it was extremely bright. Unfortunately I had to leave the light on as it was the only one in the room other than a dim Ikea table lamp. The television's cable did not work AT ALL, and they did little to fix it except to wiggle the cable and reset the reception settings for the hotel. It would have been nice to have seen the morning news to find out the weather forecast and Tube delays! The shower would leak onto the floor. For the second part of my stay, I was placed into a room on the 3rd floor. This room was cool, thankfully. Probably because the light above the bed didn't work. The TV worked fine in here. The shower door would not close properly so either you left it partially open or you managed to jam it so that you had to practically break the door to get out. Horrible layout of bathroom - the shower door kept hitting the toilet. The hot water would sometimes run out if you waited too late in the evening to take a shower. The power went out a couple of times during the evening, without any explanation from the staff. Couldn't get the radiator to work one day when it became very chilly outside; the staff member who came up to fix it didn't really know what he was doing. Requested someone to open the room safe more than once as it wasn't open when we entered the room, but no one ever showed up when we called. Staff vary from somewhat helpful to \"I don't care what your problem is.\" You can check out and keep your luggage there, but it will be left in an open area of the lobby and unless you lock it to the bannister or a table, there is no guarantee that it will not walk away as someone won't always be there all the time to watch it. The positives - fantastic, fantastic location near two tube stations and many restaurants, as well as grocery stores, but I wish I had gone to one of the other hotels nearby like base2stay. Neighbourhood is quiet as it's a few blocks away from the noisier main streets. Beds were comfortable, if a bit narrow. Rooms were clean, however there seems to be only one maid for the whole hotel and if the poor woman was busy changing all the rooms for new guests then your room was last on her list. Discovered that she washed our room's dishes in the bathroom sink, without any dishwashing soap. Breakfasts were basic (toast, fruit, juices, tea, coffee, yogurt, horrible croissants), and was a nice way to have a quick bite and save a bit of money before starting the day. Saw people using the wireless internet on their own laptops, but you have to sit in the lobby to do so.

There is no air conditioning. If you plan to stay in the room in the daytime, look for another hotel as this was was just too warm. If you use the room to sleep only then it could be bearable with the window open (hopefully you get a room where a window does open). Now for the except part.... For the first 2 nights we spent it in room 403. The room was small but very clean. In room 402, there were 2 guests who refused to sleep. The first night I was awoken my 2 men having a discussion. It would have been fine if it was a normal conversation. But they seemed to be involved in a heated discussion. They were practically screaming. The walls between the rooms are not very thick. It was as if they were sitting in my room having the discussion. At first I thought they were arguing but they were also laughing so it couldn't have been an argument. Finally around 4 AM they decided to go to sleep after heated discussions among other unmentionable things that would scar any one for life. I complained to the front desk after the first night. But it turned out to be another sleepless second night. They repeated the same actions as night number one. Do these people sleep? A second complaint was made after night number 2. People at the front desk said they were renting the room for 1 month so it was a sensitive matter. Hotel staff should not be giving preferential treatment just because they are renting for a longer period than I was. Does this make me want to stay in the hotel again. Definitely not!!!! Nor would I recommend it to anyone. After further complaints and attempting to check out and finding another place to stay, the hotel staff finally moved us to another room. I would have expected this to have been done after night number one or that they at least speak to the guests in room 402. We did not deserve 2 sleepless nights. If you plan to check into this hotel during the next few weeks, make sure you don't get room 403.", "Date": "June 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cB eware of Room 201!!\u201d", "Author": "3146bj", "ReviewID": "UR7870936", "Content": "Beware of Room 201 and, according to a staff member, Room 301.

We complained after the first night of our 4 night stay and moved to a much cooler and much smaller room. The housekeeper visited us in the new room to apologise, and told us that the problem rooms were only supposed to be used for one night stays! Which really typifies the attitude of the staff in this recently opened hotel. They just do not care about the customers and take no pride in their work or in their hotel. Do not expect assistance in connecting to the WiFi offered in the reception area or in response to any complaint. Generally the facilities are reasonable quality, although some double rooms are tiny and should only be singles, and the breakfasts are adequate, but the whole place is let down by the staff.", "Date": "June 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hermosa Beach, CA", "Title": "\u201cNot bad for the price\u201d", "Author": "Dyan-7", "ReviewID": "UR7769733", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Avni for 3 nights in May. I agree with most postings about this hotel: it is a good location, rooms are not bad for the price. They did try to go for the boutique hotel thing but seemed to have just missed in my opinion. Lobby is nice enough but hallways are narrow with scuffed up walls, and blue lighting on the stairs could have worked, but somehow doesn't (maybe its the carpet). The elevator is small and slow. The internet did not work in the rooms (you have to go downstairs and sit in the lobby to use it). Breakfast is included and a nice additional value but the music playing from the boom box in the buffet area could be a little quieter and perhaps something other than 90's dance music would be more appropriate at 8am. The reception staff was hit and miss - there was one man who was very helpful and willing to make us reservations for dinner. The other 2 weren't terribly willing to go out of their way to help. Maid service was prompt. Rooms themselves are good size, clean and functional although they could use another luggage rack. Last and most importantly, there is NO Air conditioning so the room was extremely hot and stuffy, even when it was about 50 degrees and raining outside. (We were in a room on Floor 2 so perhaps its a bit stuffier than higher floors). . Overall, not a bad value for money in a VERY expensive city but we wouldn't stay here again.", "Date": "June 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Halifax", "Title": "\u201cAvni was Excellent\u201d", "Author": "JO-D_HFX", "ReviewID": "UR7729126", "Content": "Hotel was very conveniently located about a 2-3 minute walk from the Earl's Court tube station. The room was actually bigger than I was expecting so that was a bonus. The room was clean, trendy and the twin beds were comfortable, although I think they're slightly narrower than north american twins but I'm not sure. The breakfast rooms were quite nice and it was a serve yourself situation so you could eat as much as you wanted. There was bread, croissants, jam, cheese, cereal, orange juice, milk, water, coffee/tea, fuit and yogurt. People were sitting in the lobby with their laptops using the wireless internet - it was available their but not in the rooms. The bathroom was very clean with all new fixtures and fittings but it was very tiny. Still it was completely doable as long as you aren't extremely umm wide. Sorry but the reality is that if you have a really wide backside then getting on the toilet and into the shower will be difficult - you can sort of angle yourself in though. The toilet access is compromised by the large heater/towel bar on one side and the shower door on the other. You need to keep the shower door open to be able to get on the toilet and then the towel/heater thing keeps you sitting on a bit of an angle. To bad they didn't raise this rack up off the floor a couple of feet to clear the toilet. Access to the sink is great and really, I am by no means small and I was able to manage very well. I'd happily stay here again so just be prepared. There is a small 2-3 person elevator so you don't need to worry about carrying luggage upstairs, so that was wonderful.", "Date": "June 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cClean, Convenient, Value\u201d", "Author": "Tommac", "ReviewID": "UR7711065", "Content": "Small Room but has everything you need.
