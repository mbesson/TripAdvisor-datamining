{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good hotel and amazing city Very nice modern hotel. Rooms are good for doubles/twins but cramped if a single. bathrooms are small but well appointed.Everything seems to be changed daily if used.Tokyo is amazing. I could recommend so many places but everywhere was unbelievable for us as first time visitors.The only down side is crowds on trains and in popular places for example Ueno Park as it was cherry blossom viewing time.That said places like Imperial Palace Gardens and Meiji Shrine were quiet with few people about.Travelled on the Shinkansen (bullet train). You do not get impression of speed on board but you definately do at station when one goes through non-stop!!I recommend hotel for those who do not mind being a little way from main areas (easily accessible by train station opposite) and have a double/twin room.", "Date": "Apr 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR132630515", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "WorcesterMoray"}, {"Content": "VERY GOOD DEAL The Hotel is located near to the Station, the Kokugikan and Tokyo Edo Museum. A lot of Restaurants, Bars and Sumo-dojos around. The Ryogoku-quarter is a very charming part of the city.Rooms are quite small, but they are clean and have a good standard equipment. At the desk English is hardly understood. It is just a good place to lay your head overnight and explore the city from. And a fair deal.", "Date": "Aug 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR857907832", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "wacki46"}, {"Content": "No frills, but a great value in an interesting neighborhood The Ryogoku Pearl Hotel is located across the street from the JR Train Line Ryogoku station... it has no English language exterior signage, but look for a row of bright red, round paper lanterns adjacent to the main door (and ask a stranger if you're really stuck... that's what I did!) This hotel is an excellent value for those trying to be budget-conscious in this exceedingly expensive city. The rooms, though small, are kind of cute, with fluffy pillow and crisp, fresh bed linens. You are also provided with a freshly pressed kimono for room wear every morning, a nice touch. If you are tall (say, 6' and over) or overweight, you will not love the extremely compact pod bathroom... while innovative in design, it's really intended for someone of typical Japanese proportions (that is to say, on the short side and slim). That said, it does feature a nifty little soaking tub: you do need to sit in it with your knees bent, but even so the water comes up to your shoulders. Very warming on a chilly night. Also, if you have copious amounts of luggage, you may find it hard to find a place to stow it: The rooms are so small that there is really not a single iota of extra space for more than one large suitcase and perhaps a backpack. The desk staff speak very little English, and there is no ATM that accepts American cards within a country mile of the place, so make sure you have plenty of cash. It's on the Oeno subway line which connects you with all underground trains in Tokyo as well as the JR line, which runs to and from Narita Airport (extremely convenient!) It's located in north east Tokyo, and in a neighborhood that is synonymous with Sumo! Across the street from the hotel are two Tokyo landmarks, the famous Edo Tokyo Museum (Edo being the original name of the city) which shows life in Tokyo over hundreds of years, and the big Sumo stadium where all the major sumo wrestling matches take place. I even saw a sumo wrestler-in-training walking down the street! On the road that runs along side the train tracks, there are lots of little local restaurants serving noodles, tempura, tonkatsu and the usual... these are very reasonably priced and tasty (just point to what you want). There's also a European-style bakery on the corner for coffee and croissants if you prefer. Convenience and 100 Yen stores abound, so the neighborhood does really have most everything a tourist would need (except that pesky ATM). The hotel restaurant is good and straightforward, although seems to have somewhat erratic hours. There is free high-speed Internet in the lobby, which is really a wonderful thing. All in all, I'd stay here again. No frills, but a good value and an interesting neighborhood.", "Date": "Jan 16, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR437353606", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Great Location I'm from the orlando area and I stayed in Ryogoku pearl hotel during my stay in Japan for 2 weeks. The pros=Great location,the hotel is across from the Kokugikan which is the sumo stadium. Also the Edo-Tokyo museum and Ryogoku station it takes about 2 minutes to get to the JR line train station.The cons=Non english speaking staff. I had trouble speaking with them only about 2 of them could understand some of what I was saying, very small room. The single person room is the bed and bathroomthat's it. But the pros outweight the cons and there's free highspeed internet in the lobby .It was the best experience I have had in my life and I can't wait to go back next year.", "Date": "Nov 29, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR639406435", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Buono tanto \u732b solo per dormirci   showReview(15573829, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR421133417", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Tout simplements ravis   showReview(13200323, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR783710100", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Gerne wieder   showReview(13200322, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR116227810", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "tr\u732bs bon h\u4e48tel   showReview(11456313, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR949535472", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Bien plac\u8305 pour visiter Tokyo   showReview(11355366, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR189987689", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066459-d559385-r15077615-Ryogoku_Pearl_Hotel-Sumida_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "559385", "Price": "$126"}}
