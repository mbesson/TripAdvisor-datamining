Not so on Saturday, we got in after midnight and the 1st thing we noticed were people roaming the lobby and hallways, even on the 2nd floor when we got off the elevator.

We called the front desk and they assured us they will take care of it, which did not happen.

We booked a King Deluxe room that has an extra sitting area. The price was very reasonable ($113 a night, booked right before we got there) since we were there for the RSNA conference and every other hotel jacks up their prices to be $150+ (Best Western) to $400+ (Hilton). I wasn't willing to pay that much for a regular hotel that required paid valet parking and I would still have to drive or take a shuttle to get to the McCormick center. If you aren't traveling alone, the walk from the hotel to the center was very short and safe enough. As a girl, I would not walk it alone at night but would still feel completely comfortable with walking it in the day. It only took us 10 minutes to walk to the West part of the center. The doors are open even though it was not in use during the conference so it was not hard to get to the Lakeside center. I was also able to park my car right in the courtyard of the hotel which was fully gated and required a key card to get in. I could even see my car from our room window. The first thing I noticed when I walked into the room was the layout. I didn't think having an extra seating area would be anything special for the extra 10$ a night but I liked it! It was large enough for us to sit there and eat comfortably while keeping it separate from our sleeping area. The room had a large mini fridge and a coffee maker. It did not have a microwave but the staff at the front desk was absolutely wonderful and microwaved our left overs for us. We went to Joy Yee restaurant in Chinatown our first night and had soo many leftovers. The food was great and cheap. Chinatown is very close and I did not sense any bad neighborhood vibes from it like other reviewers mentioned. If you're aware and careful, any area is safe. I've yet to be robbed once or had a problem my entire life and I've traveled all over the world (knock on wood). The bed was a regular king size bed which was satisfactory. The TV was flat screen and wonderful for my boyfriend (ESPN...) The bathroom was large and the shower curtain rod is rounded so it makes the large tub even bigger. The shower curtain was a bit short though for when you're taking a shower and you put the curtain inside. I did have to go buy bar soap because the one there contained aloe and I'm allergic to it. What I wasn't expecting the most was the cleaning service. They came early (8:30) but since we were there for the conference, it wasn't a problem. They go away if you lock it and don't open the door too. But what I was surprised about was how clean they made everything! The lady even put a face towel under our items on the bathroom counter top. She threw away our empty drinks on the sitting area table too. The linens were always nice and hair free. The lobby area of the hotel was very modern but also very comfortable to sit around it. They had lots of couches and tables. People were always there working away on their laptops or sitting around reading books. Even with people there all the time, there was also always enough seating that you could find a space.

The cafe (Awake with Pearl) has a gigantic poster of \"The Black Person in the Workplace\" full of semi-activist pro-black remarks, and generally insinuating all black people are mistreated by white people in the workplace. I won't debate whether this is true or not here, but does it REALLY have to be in the wall of a hotel cafe? Is that the ambiance we're going for here? The lady at the register also has her attitude well up front, and generally made us feel extremely unwelcome. The latest and greatest was finding the convenience/gift shop still closed at 5pm and when I asked at what time it was meant to open I got \"Whenever she feels like is...there's no set time\" Un-freaking-believable. Now, I have absolutely no problems in hotels. I spend 95% of my year in hotels, I'm very polite and educated and I know how things work, especially with my brother being a major hotel manager.

This hotel was only 2 miles away and considerable cheaper than the rooms at the Hilton. While very close to downtown, the South Loop Hotel is in an area that is still revitalizing. So there's not much directly around the hotel, but there is a bus stop across the street that takes you right into downtown on State Street. The hotel is also walking distance from Chinatown, but I'd be a bit cautious about walking this distance alone or at night. Despite having to take the bus into downtown, the hotel was very nice. The rooms are spacious with a flat screen TV and a nice bathroom with better than your standard bath tiles and flooring. The lobby was quite nice and the staff was very friendly. One of the best things about this hotel making it an extraordinary deal is the free parking. Free parking this close to downtown Chicago is unheard of! There were only 3 bad points in my stay. The AC did not work very well, but the temperatures during my stay did not warrant blasting the AC so I was still confortable. On my last morning there, the hot water did not work, so no shower for me. Also, the maid service was a bit lax in the bathroom. There was a smudge from some moisterizer that I accidently dropped on the counter my first day in the room and it stayed there during my entire stay. Clearly no one was wiping down the bathroom sink and counter. However, I can't complain to much because, let's face it, I don't wash my bathroom counter every day at home. Would definitely stay here again. It's quite a convenient location for Soldier Field and not too far from downtown.

One definite reason I picked this hotel was because the car parking is free and the car parks (2 of them) were behind very secure steel railings and surveillance cameras covered them 24/7. There is no 'valet' parking. We were checked in by Bob at the reception desk. He was very efficiant and answered our questions with patience and he was very helpful, he gave us a guide book with maps of the buses and EL routes and also told us there were bus stops on State Street just outside the hotel. He said the best transport option for a visitor could be a CTA pass, and he was right too, as this allowed us to hop on and off any bus or EL train for about $14 bucks instead of $2.25 for EVERY trip, whenever you got on again, which meant the CTA ticket paid for itself several times over as we were doing a lot of hopping on and off the public transport system. We got the 3 day pass (you can get 1 day, 3 day or 1 week or longer if needed) from the counter at the Walgreen's store, right where the bus stops at the corner of E.Roosevelt St and State St. There is also a Red Line EL station there and that gets you onto the Chicago EL system using the same ticket all the way, it's great! We quietly thanked Bob many times for telling us about that, it saved us money as car parking charges in downtown Chicago is just horrendous. The room was very good, very clean and fresh and there was plenty of space. There was no coffee maker in the room but we were told by a lady at the desk (who I think was the duty manager) that new ones had just arrived and would be put in the rooms shortly. In the meantime there was a coffee maker in the Business Centre, which was well equipped with several computers and a printer. The bar was busy and there was plenty of seating. The restaurant is clean and roomy and the food is very good. After our road trip through 5 States, we returned to this hotel for our last night before flying home, we had arranged this beforehand with a lady on the front desk. Bob was again on duty and we discovered that our room had been reserved for the wrong date. It looked like we were going to have to find somewhere else instead as the hotel was filling up, which I noticed from the amount of cars in the car park. Bob saved the day and did some juggling around on his computer and he got us booked in after all, with no fuss or bother at all with an upgrade! He remembered us from 2 weeks before and greeted us by name, I was impressed. Just what I like, the whole thing ran as if on rails. Every hotel should have a Bob! And the coffee maker was in the room too!

We should have known better when we overheard them saying that they checked someone else into a room that was occupied as well (before we checked in). They quickly rectified it by switching our room and upgrading us. 3- The restaurant, while the ambiance was nice, left a bit to be desired. They list their hours as opening at 5:00 pm for dinner but at around 5:15 after seeing a few employees standing around and the door being locked we knocked on the door and asked what was going on. They \"forgot to unlock the doors.\" Stay away from the onion soup, was not good AT ALL, but the scallops and rissoto were actually pretty good.

Well, it was better than we had even hoped for. The hotel is located on the corner of Staed and W. 26th, with the bus stop directly across the street. If you take the 29 straight up State, you can easily get off at Roosevelt and walk into the Museum Campus, or get off further north near Van Buren and walk a few blocks to the Sears Tower and the 29 even goes straight to Navy Pier too! We decided to just drive the short distance to the MSI. State street has great shopping, and if you take the 29 up to Lake St, you can walk two blocks east and enjoy the Magnificent Mile! This hotel was very clean, our room was HUGE (be sure to ask if you can get a corner room) and if you ask to be on a higher floor with a north view you can see the city!

Also this hotel provides free wi-fi in the room and around the hotel, most other Downtown hotel you would have to pay for it. I have actually done some research prior to booking, so I kinda know what to experience, most of the reviews are generally okay. I was told by my friend this hotel had a complete revamped, torn down and rebuilt, where as they won't recommend anyone to stay before. The hotel is clean and tidy, and appears to have a steady stream of conference business. Free car parking for those who choose to drive, but parking space are on a first come first serve, and most places in Chicago have parking meters even on a Sunday!! On check-in 15 minutes before the official check-in time, the lady at the desk seems a bit overwhelmed, and asked us to wait, because one of her colleague went for her lunch break, and she had 5 phone calls on hold. After waiting for 10 minutes she eventually managed to check us into the hotel. She was very pleasant and told us how to get to our room. We found the room spacious; it has LCD TV and a refrigerator, good size bathroom and generally cleans. There are lots of area that the hotel could do better for example there was no mention of any of its facilities and amenities at check-in. No in-room service directory. There is a takeaway menu as their room service menu, it is a pizza place about a mile away on S Archer and you have to call and they deliver. There is a bar in the hotel, not sure if its sub-contracted or not, but it seems to serve lunch and dinner. There is a gift shop but it was always closed for the 6 nights we were there. There is a fitness centre we have called the front desk and they told us it opens 24 hours. There is also a coffee shop / caf\u00c3\u00a9 that double up as a place you can buy breakfast/lunch/late snack. I wish they would have told us about this coffee shop, we would have went there instead going outside the hotel to starbucks a few bus stop away. There is also a business centre with free internet and printing. There is a coffee/tea machine, but I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend it, it tasted like sewage water. Overall, a very nice hotel competitive pricing on hotels.com with good public transport to the downtown area. We choose this location because we been to Chicago loads of times before, and would prefer a spacious room. For those who has never been to Chicago before, and does not need a parking space. Perhaps a hotel in downtown area would be a better option.

We were all impressed that the hotel offered free on-site parking and was situated where we could easily access public transportation. Additionally, we found cost of the hotel to be budget-friendly leaving us with more spending money than would other downtown Chicago hotels. The lobby was nicely decorated with Jazz Age paintings and music in the background. The hotel was equipped with a salon, store, gift shop, restaurant and bar. Chicago South Loop has potential for being a premiere hotel in the Chicago area; however, there are a few things that prevents that from happening: (1) Poor Customer Service: When we arrived, we were \"greeted\" by a not-so-friendly and inattentive front desk clerk. He curtly asked for my friend's credit card and other information all while talking on the phone. He never asked if we needed additional information regarding public transit, tours, or the other services provided by the hotel (i.e. salon, store, restaurant and bar, gift shop, etc.). He treated us as if we were an inconvience to him. When I tried to request an additional towel set that evening, he told me to \"come downstairs\" to retrieve the towel set. (2) Quality of the Rooms: While our room was spacious and clean, it was aged. There needs to be major renovations to each of the rooms. The carpet was old and had spots and the linens were dated as well. Even the number plates outside of the rooms were chipped and needed replacing. The lighting was poor and the closets can be expanded to match the size of the room. (3) Promoting the Additional Services: No one told us about all the offerings of the hotel; we had to discover them by walking on the main floor. If Chicago South Loop Hotel wants to generate revenue for these shops, it may want to mention that as a service to customers upon check-in and offer discounts for those who may need them. The highlight of our stay would be Taron, the bellman. He was super courteous and attentive. He walked with us across the street and showed us -- on his phone -- the arrival times for the next bus. He gave us directions to Navy Pier and the Watertower. We gave him our phone number and he asked us (via text) if we got to our desired location. He gave us information regarding Chicago's popular nightspots and eateries. He even helped us search for one of the ladies' car keys. The level of service Taron provided should be a reflection of the service we are expected to receive at the front desk and by every staff member, it should not have been the exception. Overall, if you are looking for an inexpensive place to stay for family and class reunions, this spot is optimal. But if you want a complete hotel experience, then look elsewhere.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Woodbridge, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel; Very Friendly/Helpful Staff\u201d", "Author": "Johnbraggjr", "ReviewID": "UR115509899", "Content": "I stumbled onto this hotel by chance, but am very happy I did.

Oddly enough the room was so big, it made the TV at the end of the room almost too small and too far away. At a $107.00 AAA rate, the price was very reasonable, particularly considering the free parking, which is within a controlled enclosure. ($25.00 to $45.00 for most parking right in the heart of Chicago) This hotel is a little removed from the towntown core but a two block walk to the bus stop and taking the #3 bus for $2.25 gets you right down town. (Cab ride apparently about $10.00) We actually walked back to the hotel from Millenium Park and it took us just over an hour. Felt quite safe, with a noticeable police presence in the area. Enjoyed breakfast at the attached hotel reataurant, having a delicious and fresh spinach omlette, hashbrowns with toast and OJ for $16.00 including tip. The hotel also has a onsight cafe, which offers a decent selection of baked goods and hot options perfect to get your day started. Found it odd that the room didn't have coffee makers, although they do at least have nice sized empty fridges for your use. Only complaint really was the considerable amount of long hair stuck to the shower wall - gross. Having said that though, my co-worker stayed across the hall in an identifical room, and had no such issues.

Is it really that good that people who have never reviewed before go to the effort? Anyway I shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have worried. The answer is that, while it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not that good, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fine budget choice very convenient for McCormick Place. Two of us stayed for 4 nights (should have been 5 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c see below) for \u00c2\u00a31,000 (~$165 per room per night incl of taxes, etc) booked through hotels.com. This compared very favorably with the downtown hotels offered by the convention which circa $220 per night + tax and were a long bus ride away. Our flight was cancelled and the hotel staff were very quick and efficient in the two phone calls I made (one saying we would be late and then the other saying we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be arriving until the next day). Having got there, the 1st room I was given had not been made up. Then I got a room with an iron which had so much stuff melted on the bottom it smelt when turned on. The hotel fixed both issues quickly. So, what do you get? The hotel is pleasant enough but in the middle of nowhere. The room was clean and the wifi worked well. Everything worked. Not the best shower in the world but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had a lot worse. I think the closest non-hotel place for food is the McDonalds adjacent to McCormick Place \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a 10 minute walk. Others have said that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a threatening neighbourhood. One cab driver turned off his location device when delivering us back one night as he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a pick-up in the area. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel the neighbourhood was threatening nor did my female colleague who was quite happy to go running in the morning. I walked a fair amount in the area and we only once took a cab to the convention as it was raining. We never waited more than a few minutes for a cab. The bar is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bottled beer only and apparently not formally connected to the hotel as you cannot charge to the room. The caf\u00c3\u00a9 is a bit of a dive but the one morning we ate there the food was fine. The exercise room has two joggers, two x-trainers and two bikes and a few free weights \u00e2\u20ac\u201c typical exercise room really! So, all in all, a good budget choice.

Not bad. The South Loop Hotel just \"is\"...\u201d", "Author": "Schmengi9", "ReviewID": "UR109691856", "Content": "My friends and I just completed a three-night stay at the Chicago South Loop Hotel, which we booked through HW. On the upside, the hotel lobby is spacious and attractive, and I thought our rooms and the hotel in general were pretty clean and well maintained. On more of the realistic side of things (versus the downside), the Chicago South Loop Hotel is probably just a little shy of what most folks would consider to be a three-star hotel, and it really is not in the South Loop neighborhood of Chicago by my estimation. Location-wise, I would say 26th and State streets is at least a half-mile south of what most would consider the South Loop. The hotel is even south of Chinatown! The free surface parking behind the hotel was a nice amenity for a hotel near central Chicago, but also a necessity considering the location. As you approach the hotel for the first time, you may arrive at the same conclusion my friends and I did: that the hotel is in the middle of absolutely nowhere, which in many respects it is. However, upon closer review, you are about a 10-12 minute walk to the Cermak-Chinatown L station a half-mile to the north, and a short distance by car to I-55 and Lake Shore Drive. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also not a bad place to stay if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in town to attend a White Sox game, with US Cellular Field about a 20 minute walk south and west from the hotel (though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best to walk west on 26th and then south through the Bridgeport residential neighborhood than south along State to 35th past some vacant lots and slightly distressed housing). Once in the hotel, I found our rooms to be fine. Both rooms we had were pretty spacious by hotel standards but plainly decorated, with white walls and an overall lack of interior design and adornment. Most importantly, the rooms were clean and my bed was pretty comfortable. However, the AC units in one of the rooms got a little noisy after prolonged usage and had to be shut off in order to get some sleep. One of our rooms was skipped for service after the first night. Strangely, hotel staff had been in the room, because when we left the first morning, the room had no refrigerator and the room was configured differently, but when we returned in the late afternoon, we the furniture had been moved to make room for a small, seemingly new fridge. However, the beds and bath hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been touched. We called housekeeping after the second night before we left for the day and came back to find both rooms freshened up. No new appliances, though! :o) We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t patronize the hotel lounge, gift shop or diner, so I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on those. I used the fitness room twice during our stay and was generally pleased. The photo online is a little misleading, but the fitness room includes 2 treadmills, 2 elliptical machines, 2 stationary bikes, a multi-purpose weight machine and some free weights. Nothing too elaborate, but enough to allow you to get a little workout in during your stay. As hotels are concerned, you can do a lot better than this hotel in Chicago but you certainly can do a lot worse.

I was there for a baby shower on a Saturday afternoon and when it was over, we started to load the cars with the gifts. The only people who weren't doing anything were the couple expecting and the kids that were at the shower. Everyone else had left except for the people who were helping with the gifts. It only took a few minutes to get everything in the cars and to get the rest of our things so we could go and as we are putting on our coats, a guy (restaurant manager maybe) comes in and starts yell \"You need to leave now!\" The shower actually ended before the time it was suppose to, so we were still under our contracted time when we were cleaning up. I should have known then to cancel my room for that night. I had went out to eat later that evening and when we came back, the front desk area was chaotic. There was a guy at the end of the counter talking to a lady and man behind the counter about the music on his iphone and how she can put music on hers. There was another lady behind the counter on the phone helping the guy in front of me and then the girl I had talked to earlier came from the back. Now my experience at other hotels has been, when a customer comes up to the counter you greet them and either say how can I help you or I will be with you shortly. We got neither. The first thing that was said to us, after 5 minutes, was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is that y\u00e2\u20ac\u2122all? Y\u00e2\u20ac\u2122all been smoking?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I was truly offended. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what made her even say those things. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a customer and that is how I get greeted. UNACCEPTABLE! I ever so nicely, without getting too loud, said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excuse me? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do those things and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that is what you should be saying to a customer.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mind you, nowhere in the area was there a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153weed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd smell. I guess she wanted some weed really bad. Maybe the hotel should start drug testing their employees. We finally get check into our room and it looks like a nice room but not the one I ordered. I requested a King size bed and was clearly stated on my confirmation email. I received a double queen room. I called the front desk and said I wanted the King room and she rudely said they were sold out. Now most other reviews said the area wasn't nice or safe and there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t many places to eat nearby. I don't really agree. I think like any other major city, you shouldn't walk alone at night in unfamiliar places and you should be aware of your surroundings. I do agree however, that all entrances except the front door should be locked after 10pm. When I came back in at midnight, the door on the side was not locked. As far as places nearby to eat, yes there aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t many places within walking distance but you are only a few minutes from downtown. Hop a cab, and go eat or order something.

First, they gave my salad to my fiance with chicken on top, which I did not order. There was no creamy balsalmic dressing on it so I was waiting for them to bring that, and my fiance's salad was still nowhere to be found. Instead, they took my salad back and it took another half an hour for the rest of our food to come, including my correct salad. And not including the cup of soup I ordered. My fiance, however, had been given the wrong salad. Neither of us were given dressing this time either. So while we waited for that, the bartender went back to find out if my fiance could get the salad he ordered instead of the one he was given. He ended up just eating the wrong salad, and I was so hungry that I ate half of mine before we were even given dressing (blue cheese and italian; neither of which were what was supposed to come with my salad in the first place). No soup to be found. We asked for it again. I ended up being pretty hungry once I finished my salad, so while the bartender made up our checks I asked if I just wasn't going to have any soup. I was still hungry and about to work until 4am with a half-empty stomach for 12 hours. As we were leaving, my soup came out and I had to finish it in about 30 seconds. The worst part was that the bartender was apparently supposed to pay for the kitchen's (frequent and bad) mistakes... she comped my fiance's salad and used her tips to pay for it, so we felt bad and gave her the money for his meal anyway. She definitely didn't deserve to be treated the way the kitchen was treating her, and after she spent three hours trying to get them to make our food, she shouldn't have to pay for it herself.

I will be writing a review of that place, too. I enjoyed it & thank Erica for the suggestion! I did duck into the coffee shop. I brought food with me, I always do when I travel, but one morning I really needed an egg sandwich. The woman behind the counter wasn't very pleasant. The place smelled like old grease. I almost left, but I realized I could actually see her prep the food, so that comforted me a bit. Though I traveled alone, there were people I knew staying at the hotel, too. One of my peers checked into her room to find someone had defecated on the floor & well, I won't describe any of the details. My personal experience with my room was that it was cleanish. I've seen better, but sadly I've seen worse! Many of the reviews mention Miss Jackie & she is a sweet lady. Tommy was helpful. I think they care, but are hobbled by things out of their control. Through certain discount sites, you can get a ridiculous rate on a stay here. I was in town for 5 nights, with my personal vehicle for work. I wanted to save money.

I've never had a problem with Priceline when booking hotels. I think they're great. I called in the afternoon before my arrival to confirm my reservation and to inform them that I would be a late check in since my flight was arriving late. When I arrived to the hotel at 1am they didn't have my reservation. I had printed my reservation and receipt and had it with me. The front desk employee told me they were updating their system and it may have been that my reservation was canceled. Sure good thing I had my print out. The employee made a new reservation for me and got me a room about an hour later. He tried calling Priceline for me but was unsuccessful at reaching anyone. So I called them myself, I was on hold for a long time. At 3am, when I was already settled in and ready to go to sleep, I got a call from the front desk asking to come back so that they can get a copy off all my info because it could not wait till the morning. After that I went back to the my room and called Priceline again. It was about 3:30am. I called the front desk while talking to Priceline and the guy at the front desk said they had found my reservation. It was filed in the wrong spot. It was pretty annoying. As far as the hotel goes, the lobby is really nice. But it's almost like a facade. Once you go the hallway and rooms it goes down one star. The rooms could be updated. Things look old which make it look dirty. But for the most part it's a clean hotel. The rooms are big along with the bathroom. Also, it's loud. You hear everyone who walks past your door. And we were next to the ice machine room so we got to hear that too.

It's excellent value for money. My room was very large, with a separate sitting area with comfortable chairs and coffee table, and the sleeping area itself was also large, with a work desk. The room came with free wired internet access (cabling supplied) which was very much appreciated. The bathroom was also good with a large, deep bath. Everything was spotlessly clean. The room was warm and quiet. The staff I came into contact with (Todd on front desk and Sandra (I think) at breakfast were friendly, welcoming and helpful, which does add so much to a hotel stay. The price tells you that this is not a luxury hotel, but I think that you get far more for your money here than the price suggests. There are obviously frills you don't get, but they are really not an issue. There is no coffee maker in the room (although there are water cups), but there is a cafe on the ground floor. Frankly I'd rather have it that way and get the free in-room internet access than pay the extortionate daily internet rate that so many more expensive hotels charge. The hotel is not central and there's not too much around it (although I understand it's handy for the conference centre and Chinatown), but there is a bus (no.29) which leaves for downtown directly opposite the hotel and drops you back off right in front of the hotel. It leaves every 15 mins, costs $2.25 for a single ride and got me from the hotel to the Art Institute in around 15 mins. I found it super-handy and it made not being located in central downtown a complete non-issue. As well as the cafe there is a restaurant and bar. I only used the restaurant for breakfast - warning: breakfast portions are large! I ordered more items than I could eat, thinking they'd be much smaller. All well cooked. Breakfast is ordered a la carte, rather than buffet, and is reasonably priced. I wasn't in a hurry, which was fine, but if you are expecting a dash-in, dash-out buffet option, you should probably leave a bit more time than you would normally. Sandra was an excellent hostess. So, overall it's not a luxury hotel, but it doesn't provide budget-level service or accommodation.

We could hear the L train rarely...it was not that loud. I think if we'd been on the other side of the hotel, we may have had a noisier experience. Another work companion was next door in 504, which was also a very big room. Our room came with an internet wire, but we'd also read the reviews in advance, so brought our own connector cable.

(I had my husband as an escort that day, and our original path did not seem safe for a female alone). One evening I used the soda machine, and pushed the \"diet\" button, and got a regular pepsi. Thinking I was just tired and hit the wrong button, I went back to the room for another $1 bill (lots cheaper than your usual hotel soda machine) and tried again, making sure I hit the \"diet\" button. Again got the regular pepsi. So I took both cans down to the desk, got my $2 refund, and the desk clerk suggested going to the gift shop instead, since I'd be sure I did get the diet cola. However, when I went to the gift shop, their drinks were 20 oz bottles that cost $2 plus tax, and i only had my $2. I left the gift shop to head back to the elevator, and the desk clerk saw me empty handed. He asked why I didn't get my drink, and i explained that i didn't have enough for sales tax.

This is a hotel with such warmth and charm that starts from the minute you speak with the front desk (Diane at the front desk is phenomenal), and all the staff (I was on the elevator with the engineer who services and expects the elevators and we carried such wonderful and warm conversation!) One morning I came out of the room and was greeted by the housekeeping staff who were working on the other side of my floor. I spent almost 10 minutes laughing and appreciating their caring demeanor, concern if all was clean and satisfactory in my room, and answering my questions about going out and finding sites to see. Their information and concern was invaluable! :-) Since I had a car rental (there is free parking here) I had no problem getting around, but my cousin wanted to venture and travel on public transportation.Once again Diane at the front desk took the time to show all options and helpful tidbits that helped my cousin's adventure a joy!

It is called the Chicago South Loop but there isn't much near the hotel. If one wanted to shop and eat out at a restaurant, a 10 minute bus ride is necessary. Luckily the bus stops right in front of the hotel and the EL is not far. The staff at this hotel is top notch. I received excellent service from the moment I checked in. The front desk was a pleasure, and any time that I called or made a stop at the front desk to ask a question or make a request, they were more than willing to help. That was a great first impression and made the stay pleasant. The room itself was pretty spacious and clean! The bathroom was spacious and clean as well! A clean room and bathroom is crucial to my comfort level at a hotel---well done South Loop! Also, there is a nice flat screen tv in the hotel room and the lobby looks great. I love the art work and its nice and big when you walk into the hotel. Now there is room for improvement, I understand that this is a young hotel so I'm not knocking it, I just want to give ideas for how the hotel stay can improve.... First issue---the bed is not the most comfortable. It is a little stiff and it takes some time to get used to and get cozy. I am not a fan of the mattress, if there is any way for the hotel management to improve that, I hope they do. Second----there was no HBO! The hotel has cable but no HBO channel, I have never been to a hotel without HBO so that was a shock to me. Please get the HBO channel. Third---there is no fridge in the room and no minibar. I know that this is a luxury complaint but if the hotel bills itself as a boutique hotel in the chicago south loop, there should at least be a fridge and minibar in the hotel room. Fourth---the business center only has 3 computers. Fair enough that there is free wi-fi in the hotel and you can hook-up a laptop in your room, but I think the business center can stand to have more than 3 computers. I think the hotel room decor can stand to have a few upgrades. It's not horrible by any means, it fine and its not drab. I just think with a good eye of a creative interior designer, the rooms can look just as good as the main lobby. I also saw what looked like slight water damage above one of the windows in my hotel room. Granted that this could have been due to some of the extremely intense and damaging thunderstorms Chicago has been experiencing this summer but I hope the hotel management will keep an eye on this. Overall, I had a decent stay. There were good things and things that needed improvement and I believe that overtime, these issues will be addressed.

When we checked in the lines were long as they had 2 people at the front desk. I waited, no problem. When they finally checked us in & gave us the key we went up to the room and walked in on a shirtless guy sitting there smoking a cigarette! He was really nice & said hello & everything, of course we apologized & got out of there. As we were hightailing it back down to the front desk I said to my husband \"I thought this was a no smoking hotel?\" Bizarre. When we got to the front desk there was still a long line but we stood to the side & got the persons attention who checked us in. Jackie was really nice & apologized profusely. She figured out that the guest renewed his stay but that the computer system didn't update the info. So she thought the room was unoccupied. She was really nice & offered us a complimentary meal in the hotel restaurant. We thanked her & told her it wasn't her fault. She said the wait for another room would be 15-20 minutes as the maid had to clean it. Keep in mind the room was already paid for with the prior reservations I had made. So again we waited. She finally told us our room was ready & when I went to grab my bags my husband said he overheard Todd the general manager telling Jackie she needed to take our room back. I guess he needed it for someone else that had an issue as well & had been waiting. My husband said he gave him a look that could kill. Jackie told Todd that she couldn't take our room back because we were on our way up to it. Can you believe a general manager would say that though? We finally made it to our room after a long line waiting for the elevator. That was a major problem. It seemed like there was only 1 working elevator for the entire hotel, we tried to use another one we found but it wasn't working. Our room was decent, we were glad to finally be in it. The room was spacious, nice bathroom with a huge bathtub. There were brown crumbs or something underneath the sheet on the bed that I had to remove with a handful of Kleenex. We went out to dinner for our anniversary and when we came back the free parking lot was full. We finally found a spot on the street, luckily. The next day upon checkout we went looking for the hotel restaurant so we could use our meal vouchers Jackie gave us the day before, (to make up for the occupied room incident). We smelled the food but couldn't find the restaurant, there was no menu in our room for it by the way. After several passes thru the hotel & several people giving us directions we finally found it. The \"restaurant\" was really like a convenience store/ coffee shop the size of a newspaper stand with 4 stools in it. No wonder we couldn't find it. They were cooking on a hot plate. When we walked up we waited 10 minutes while no one acknowlegded us or said hello. When we finally placed our order & waited for our food, my husband & I couldn't wait to eat & get out of there. They told us there was an empty banquet room across the hall where we could wait for our food & they would bring it over to us. The waitress that brought our food was nice & cordial the food was ok. We hurriedly ate & left. Overall, we thought the hotel wasn't equipped to handle the volume of people that were there. The professionalism wasn't there for the most part. Jackie was professional & extremely nice but mostly everyone else was not. Starting at the top with Todd the general manager, perhaps that's the problem. I was disappointed by the whole experience. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. That was our first & last time staying there. Unfortunately Jackie's sweet personality can't carry the entire hotel.

The price was right and it's hard to find a hotel in Chicago that has free parking. But it comes with a lot of other \"negatives\" that you should be aware of before booking. The hotel is what I would call \"average\". The staff was fine and the rooms were adequate. But room cleanliness was a concern of ours. The bathroom was very clean and new but the room itself and furniture were old. Room also had a bit of a musty ordor. Hard to sleep due to the very noisy AC unit as well as the numerous sirens that you heard all night due to the close proximity to a hospital. Our room was also on the side of the hotel nearest the train tracks which was also very noisy every time a train went by. Location is the biggest problem with this hotel. It is located about 30 minutes by bus or cab from the heart of downtown Chicago. And the neighborhood it is in, as we later found out from some cab drivers we had, is one of the worst in Chicago. One of our cab dirvers told us he never comes out to the hotel unless he has someone like us going to the hotel from downtown. We were also warned numerous times by cab drivers to not walk around the neighborhood, especially at night. It is in an area that has a lot of low income housing (ie projects) and many vacant and boarded up buildings. Although the hotel staff said it was safe to walk to the train station I certainly would not. Your are almost forced to take a cabe or use the bus which stops on the corner -- but be sure to use cabs at night. While the hotel says they have a deli it is pretty sad. Poor food and poor service. They were using 2 coleman gas stoves to cook eggs and had a hot plate and gridle for pancakes. Also almost no place to sit so you are forced to bring anything you purchase back to your room. You are stuck if you are hungry in the AM for somethin to eat as there is nothing else in the neighborhood. Even if there was you probably would not want to walk there for the reasons previously mentioned.

This place is not what they advertise it to be. They call themselves a \"boutique hotel.\" It's not. The rooms and service are the equivalent of any crappy two-star hotel. But that is not the biggest problem. The biggest problem is the location. In short, it is not safe. The hotel is about a 10-15 minute walk from the Chinatown L stop. The area around Chinatown is bustling and colorful and definitely worth exploring. BUT, the hotel is not in Chinatown. As soon as you walk one block from the L towards the hotel, you are in a run-down, ghetto. And it doesn't just look unsafe. It IS unsafe. A man followed me as I walked from the L to the hotel around the corner of State and 23rd St. When I let him pass in front of me, he waited at a bus stop until I passed and then continued to follow me. When I turned to face him to acknowledge that he was following me, he insisted on \"walking with me.\" I got on my cell phone with my boyfriend but that did not deter him. I started to get nervous as we were getting further away from any other people. That's when I hailed a cab to the hotel. There are a lot of people just \"hanging out\" on that corner (which is a bunch of boarded up store fronts and an empty lot) and once you turn on to State, you have a 10 minute walk down a pretty empty street until you get to the hotel. It's a perfect situation for someone to get raped or mugged. That's the worst of it, but that's only the beginning...I'll try to sum up the rest. Service is not exactly rude...more like sedated...It took the guy at the counter over 10 minutes to check me in while a line formed behind me b/c he couldn't find my reservation and although there were other people hanging out behind the counter, they were not helping him...or anyone else. There is no restaurant at (or near) the hotel and also no refrigerators in the room, so dining in is challenging. I brought some food back from Chinatown but had to fill a bucket with ice to keep it cold. The vending machines on several floors had no water left in them...to get drinking water I had to go to the water cooler in their \"state-of-the-art\" fitness room (it's not state-of-the-art). In short, this place is ghetto trying to sell itself as chic. From the disgruntled looks I noticed on the faces of other guests, I assume I'm not the only one that was deceived by the website and expected something completely different for the price.

There are no bars / restaurants in the close vicinity of the hotel, except for a very basic cafeteria on the premises (no sitting, you have to take your food to your room or the common spaces). Only other on-site option is delivery. There's a decent pizza place that does the trick in 20 min or so, but you have to take your stuff from reception. Driving or a cab is required to get to / fro. I've not tested the safety of the neighborhood, but I'd be concerned to leave the hotel on my own at night, walking on the streets. I visit Chicago every few years, so I'm not an expert on this city, but that's the way it feels. ii) Everything else is VERY positive. Big room, comfy beds, big flat screen TV, nice bathroom, free parking, free fast internet. The Front Desk Team is very good and motivated. I checked in very late (2am) and the lady was all smiles. She called me when I was in my room (2' after I had got there) to check if everything was OK, which was. Only glitch was the absence of wi-fi signal in my room (corner room, away from elevator), but there's an Ethernet cable connection in the room too. Hotel is very close to Mc Cormick Place, which was why I was visiting Chicago, so it's convenient and uncrowded in the morning to get there. ii)", "Date": "March 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles", "Title": "\u201cGreat rooms and great guest service!\u201d", "Author": "ATFLosAngeles", "ReviewID": "UR58337576", "Content": "I stayed at the Chicago Southloop for a conference I had over the weekend. The hotel was gorgeous, considering I had a good deal on the room through hotels.com. I expected less because I had a steal on prices but Southloop exceeded my expectations by far. The hotel lobby is gorgeous and the guest service was quick and easy. Actually, I was approached by one of the front desk workers and she gave us a coffee maker. I didn't expect that at all also because again, I felt like I paid a fairly cheap price for such great service. Needless to say, I really enjoyed the service from the South Loop employees. They were pleasant and quite helpful with anything I needed. As for the rooms, they were very spacious. It was very clean and smelled pleasant (some hotels have that stench of dirty laundry...definitely not South Loop). The bathroom was also another plus because it was a rather large bathtub that could easily fit two people. It was definitely a 5 star hotel accommodation for a very affordable price. Also, the greatest part of it all was that they have a business center down stairs equipped with 3 computers, a printer, and a huge copy machine. I found this soooo helpful as I needed to print out my reservation for my flight. It was all free, as long as you had a key for your room--you're able to access the business center. The only downside is that it's a not situated in a place that's close to dining restaurants and such but you can definitely catch a cab for fairly cheap. That's the only thing I can say that's lacking but other than that, I loved that I didn't have to pay for parking and wi-fi was free. I stayed at another hotel in town and it was quite expensive (room & parking) and I had to pay for wi-fi. I definitely missed the South Loop for the perks they offered there but overall, I had a great experience! Checking in and out was so quick and I had no problems at all with guest services. I absolutely recommend this hotel!

We decided to make a week out of it and booked a great package through Travelocity. We had never been to Chicago before, so we were a bit clueless when it came to maneuvering the public transit system (we drive everywhere in Florida) We didn't want to rent a car because quite frankly we were scared to drive in snow and ice. We should have done a bit more research on this aspect on the trip, because we ended up taking the L into downtown, then were told to transfer onto a bus \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a bus going in opposite direction of where we told them we needed to go \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so we promptly got off that bus\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and realized that we were on the corner of Urine and Crime Spree. With 2 suitcases each. In 20 degree weather. Did I mention we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re from Florida? So, yeah. That was a fun walk to a questionable gas station/daytime hooker depot. We called a cab and when we told him where we were going, he was surprised there was even a hotel in that neighborhood. We were getting a little nervous. The cab driver then launched into a tirade on how dangerous a neighborhood it was and how we should make sure we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t walk anywhere and ALWAYS take a cab. And of course, he gave us his card so we could call him back for rides. He dropped us at the hotel and we were relieved to see that it was quite lovely from the outside and beautiful on the inside. The staff that greeted us were so helpful and reassuring. We told them about our trip in and they apologized repeatedly and assured us that the neighborhood was NOT at ALL like the cab driver made it out to be, and the Mayor lived 3 blocks away. We were also pleased to discover that there was a bus stop right outside the door that went straight into downtown all the way to The Navy Pier. The bus ride only takes about 20 minutes. It cost $2.25 per person each way and you need exact change. (quick tip, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staying in the city for more than just a couple of days and you plan on using CTA, you may want to consider getting a bus pass\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it will save you some $$ in the long run) We were very pleased with our room. First of all, it was HUGE with a big flat screen TV. It even had a separate sitting area. The bathroom was great with a GIGANTIC soaking tub with endless amounts of hot water. This was definitely a welcome feature after a long day of sightseeing in the freezing temps. It also had free wireless internet which was a huge plus. The staff was extremely nice and very helpful. Especially Todd at the front desk. He was very helpful in assisting us with restaurant suggestions and points of interest in the city. There is a little caf\u00c3\u00a9 downstairs that served breakfast, lunch and dinner. They will even deliver to your room for a $3 surcharge. The food is delicious and it was great to get coffee and OJ first thing in the morning without having to leave the room. The only things I would change about the hotel is the fact that there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a little kitchenette setup; i.e. mini fridge, microwave or coffeemaker. There is certainly room for it in the sitting area. Since we were staying for 6 days, and frequently ordered out, we found ourselves loosing any food we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t finish due to there being nowhere to keep it cold. Also, there are no snack vending machines which was a little unfortunate since there really are no convenience stores close by. There were 2 soda machines on each floor, but on two separate occasions we went to every single one to find them all completely sold out. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m stating this not so much as a complaint but more to allow a potential guest to prepare and make sure they stock up when the caf\u00c3\u00a9 is open \u00ef\ufffd\u0160 All in all a fantastic experience at a fantastic hotel, and that will definitely be our hotel of choice on our next trip to The Windy City!", "Date": "March 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "west lafayette indiana", "Title": "\u201cWOW waht a great lcoation and value\u201d", "Author": "pierceall", "ReviewID": "UR57952197", "Content": "Recently I had the pleasure to book nights at the South Loop Hotel in Chicago, Illinois Upon arrival the agent Leo and care staff Patrick were personable, stellar and helpfull.

The night desk girl was useless when we asked about a good blues bar and the best way to get uptown with out driving. \"You have to take the bus.\" Well, duh. We tried venturing out but didn't have exact change for the bus (another detail that the desk clerk could have mentioned after we asked her where the ATM is; apparently this is common knowledge, but I don't take public transit often). So we went to the hotel bar which is like any other sports bar. The bartender was pleasant and they had plenty of TVs. The elevator makes scary sounds for only being a year and half old. The rooms are quite large actually, but there's not a whole lot in them. 2 pictures on the walls and they were the exact same picture. Not that I really care about a picture on the wall, but it gives a good idea of the attention to detail in this hotel and the barebones nature of the rooms. No in room information about the hotel, room service, etc. We had a restaurant menu from a restaurant not on the premises and a folder with printouts from the cafe. The printouts themselves were wrinkled and waterstained, unprofessional at best. The cafe was about the size of our room and done cafeteria style with the seating in a room across the hall. I didn't try the food because we waited for a few minutes and it didn't seem like anything was going on. No orders taken, no food coming out, no acknowledgment of us coming in the door. The line didn't budge. We got a couple waters from there later on and I'm not sure the woman said anything legible to us. All in all it was a little disappointing. It seems with a little more effort/investment it could be a great hotel. It was just missing a lot in the details. Like my title I would recommend it only if you just need a place to stay.

Pearl is not an act. She is quite possibly the rudest, most unhappy person I've ever encountered. She must hate what she is doing for a living and hate life and people in general. I ordered biscuits and gravy from the very small menu and asked if they were home-made, Pearl informed me that they were home-made after giving me a look that spoke volumes. The buscuits nor the gravy were home-made, and they were inedible, awful and overpriced, to boot. I have never been treated so poorly as I was in this place, especially by a person that is in the business of \"hospitality\". Perhaps Pearl should consider finding another line of work and the Chicago South Loop Hotel should consider replacing this little room with a small continental breakfast area to serve the guests.

The people who work at this hotel seem to fall into two categories: rude+incompetent and nice+overworked+incompetent. The woman who checked us in when we first arrived was screaming at one of the hotel guests on the phone so loudly that it could be heard throughout the first floor. (She seemed to be trying to convey to them that their pizza had arrived. Why this required screaming we're not sure, but the tone she took with them was more than a little inappropriate.) The internet didn't work. Neither the ethernet nor the Wi-Fi. Their website advertises that they have free internet in ALL rooms. It was one of the main reasons we chose this hotel since we were here on business and needed it for work . We called down to see if they could resolve the issue. The woman at the front desk said, \"I'm not IT and it's a free service.\" At $109/night (still overpriced \"discount\" travelocity rate) we did not think any of the very basic amenities could reasonably be considered \"free\"; I mean, the bed was free too, right? Needless to say she did not resolve the issue, although the next night someone else at the front desk was kind enough to let us test other rooms. Dragging our computers with us from one floor to the next, we tried three separate rooms before we found one where the internet actually worked. We then repacked all of our stuff and switched rooms. When we came back the next evening we were locked out of our new room for some reason and had to go to the front desk to get our keycards reactivated. Apparently this had happened to several other guests as well. So how is the rest of the hotel? One word comes to mind: basic. Industrial-pile carpeting, hard and horribly uncomfortable mattresses that seem to be covered with some sort of plastic underneath very starchy and coarse sheets, lousy water pressure, no place to put your stuff in the bathroom, no full length mirror. We didn't have a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign in our room so housekeeping woke us up at 8:50 am on a Sunday morning.

It is clear that they value your patronage and will go the extra mile to accommodate your needs. I spent 10 very pleasant days in their care and would highly recommend this hotel to all travelers. Parking was plentiful and the hotels location was ideal for the either convention goers or tourists alike. Just a few Minutes drive to the entire trade center and all of the highlights such as the Shead aquarium and the Natural History museum. I highly recommend booking your stay with The South Loop Hotel.

Prices in the $200 and up range are outrageous for this Budget Motel type place. Six months after opening the items I encountered should not have happened. -The room was cold (literally) and uninviting and I had to turn on the motel-type heater at the window to heat it up--a process which took a good 24 hours. --It looks like the owners tried to renovate an old building but ran out of money at the end--and so they scrimped on the finishes and fit-up. --There is no hotel restaurant and no restaurants in the nearby (bad) neighbourhood. The \"breakfast deli\"--the only source of food in the place opened at 7:30 am (the posted hour) with one employee--resulting in a line of 20 people trying to get something to eat--there is no other option.--I instead went to the Convention center and ate there since I was going there anyway. --Don't allow them to give you a room on the side of the hotel facing the \"El\" train line--its really noisy with trains going by multiple times an hour. The rooms look like a cheap motel. For example there is a closet--but no closet doors. There is an ironing board--but no iron. There is a big bathroom --finished with a cheap corian counter and tile and cheap residential style fixtures. There is a jacuzzi tub--but with no jets. There is no clock in the room. The TV was a flat screen but half the channels were unviewable because they were too blurry. The cheap art work was literally screwed though the front of the picture frame to the wall with sheetrock screws--it seems they think you would want to steal it. There is a desk but no notepad or pen. Bottom line the place felt like a cheap motel room--but at extravagant prices. I have stayed in those motels and have nothing against them--but not at these rates and not at a hotel which mis-bills itself as a \"boutique experience\".", "Date": "November 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Missouri", "Title": "\u201cGreat Staff, Great Service!\u201d", "Author": "skateadams", "ReviewID": "UR20043896", "Content": "I had a great stay at the Chicago South Loop Hotel--clean, pleasant, wonderful staff, and excellent service.
