It was my first time in NYC and his second. We both wanted some time in NYC, and decided to book a hotel for 9 nights. That hotel was the Sohotel. It was recommended to me by a fellow New Yorker, and it did not disappoint . The staff were fantastic, and your trip will not be complete without meeting Singh or Junior, amongst others. The location is phenomenal. You are situated in Little Italy/Chinatown. Take a walk and some of the scenery is straight out a movie. Walk a few blocks to Mulberry where you will find a bar of the same name. The Sopranos and many other movies have been shot here. Our room was clean, big enough for our needs (sleeping and washing) and had cable TV and an iPod docking station so you could play your music, nice touch. The rooms were always cleaned and the staff were not intrusive at all. If you want some criticisms, well here they are but they are tiny. I am a very light sleeper, and find it incredibly hard to sleep when there is noise. The windows are very thin and you can hear the traffic at times including the fire sirens and police sirens, but it honestly didn't affect my sleep at all, I slept very well for my entire 9 days, as did my friend, and I kind of liked the noise, as it reminded me of all my favourite movies. That said the original Ghostbusters building from the 1984 film is really close by, and is situated right next to a superb little diner called the square diner. The Pancakes were amazing. Sorry, I am going off on a tangent. You will occasionally hear a bit of noise from some revellers, but hey they are on holiday to, so as long as they are not to loud, I am fine with that. So to conclude, My experience at the hotel was fantastic, and it is worth noting that they have only recently refurbished a lot of their rooms, and it shows. Going in February was always going to be quieter, but I really can't fault this hotel, and I hope you give it a shot to as it is very affordable and in a great location.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cDowntowns Best Kept Secret\u201d", "Author": "Ron P", "ReviewID": "UR124322475", "Content": "My wife and I have traveled to Manhattan many times over the last 15 years and have stayed in a number of places.

The bellhop was eager to help with luggage, etc. Very friendly. I stayed in the single queen room. VERY small but sufficient for my needs. Shower was so tiny that I could hardly move around. My biggest complaint was the heat. I understand that it is winter in New York but I literally could not sleep because of the sweltering heat in my room. I tried to turn the AC on but it didn't work. I don't know if they cut it off in the winter. But I was extremely uncomfortable. The ceiling fan helped a bit but it didn't help nearly enough. (I wasn't the only person experiencing this problem. Overheard other guests at the counter telling the staff about the problem and they seemed to dismiss it as if it shouldn't be an issue because it is cold outside. They didn't seem willing to address the problem and meet guests' needs.) Also, I'm pretty sure that someone came into my room after I exited the hotel to sightsee. I checked in and got settled then headed out and when I returned, there were noticeable differences about my room that weren't there before. Things moved around on the dresser. Ceiling fan turned off (I left it on in order to HOPEFULLY get cool air stirring in the room before I returned).

We booked a room with 2 double beds which was a little cramped but we worked around this and to be fair the room was quite a reasonable size as some NYC hotel rooms can be tiny!! We arrived quite early at 9am and the staff were SOOOO nice and let us check in Early...as we had just flown in early from Las Vegas, I can not tell you just how grateful we were to be allowed to get into the room so early! So a big thanks to the lovely Receptionists! The location of this hotel is just AMAZING it is a 5 minute walk to the nearest Metro Station and is right beside Mulberry Street (little Italy) Which is full of gorgeous restaurants so you are spoilt for choice if looking for a nice place to eat. One night we did walk to Times Square and it only took around 15minutes. There are no elevators in this hotel, but we never found this to be a problem (even though we each had about 3 MASSIVE suitcases full of shopping) as there was always a Porter waiting by the stairs ready to help you with your luggage. Every Porter we encountered was extremely pleasant, smiling and Helpful. There is free WIFI in the Hotel, which we had a little bit of trouble connecting to, but when we did it worked fine. Our room was lovely and clean, with Air Conditioning and a Flat Screen TV....the only downside was that it was VERY noisy. Our room was on the 1st Floor and Faced out onto Broome Street which is quite a busy Street.....now each of us girls are heavy sleepers so the noise never bothered us, but if you are a light sleeper, then maybe request a room facing away from the Street. The beds were lovely and comfy too! The Bathroom was very small and I must say the Shower was horrendous! As a group of 4 girls shower-time is a very important part of our 'getting ready' routine......after one shower there was hardly ever hot water and the pressure wasn't great...now I was OK to put up with it as it is New York and our hotel room price was so cheap....But I know my friends were quite annoyed and put out by just how bad the shower was!

Room size is not this hotel's problem... At all. It is, however, everything else. The website advertises \"cheap\" as a hallmark, to which I will personally attest-- an undoubtedly and unfortunate Freudian slip, dooming our stay from the get-go. Though the hotel is located along the lighting supply retail hub of SoHo, the owners/designer have missed the mark in lighting design in the lobby. I have read reviews describing it as bordello-esque. I see it as kitschy Village-wannabe New Jersey trash: too many themes to even be considered designer chic or eclectic. Note to the management: cute chairs, cute lighting, awful paint palette, ALWAYS REMOVE THE PLASTIC FROM YOUR LAMPSHADES... What are you- Fran Drescher's family from 'The Nanny?' The check-in process was streamlined, though please keep in mind: you pay in FULL at check-in. Buyer beware. They have you by the cojones should you encounter an irreconcilable difference (the plastic covering the lampshades JUST about did it). Staff are helpful enough and a solitary, hard-working bellman will help you with your bags to the best his slim frame can muster. Note: this hotel requires stair climbing (read: no elevators), which is also not a deal breaker for us. Good exercise and easy staircases to climb. Let's discuss the god awful rug runners down the hallways. Management- you've covered your poorly laid laminate floors with the most awful and poorly laid oriental rugs in Chinatown. And you've apparently left them there for 10 years with not so much as one shampoo!?!?! The horror! Folks. If this is SoHo chic, you will find me in the Upper East Side next visit. Moving to the room. Small quantifies size appropriately in most rooms here but not bothersomely so. What bugs me is the management will upgrade you to a room with more beds than you need for free so you're \"more comfortable.\" Actually, no. I'm not more comfortable. You've put me in the same size room crammed with more beds. We sleep together, we are not amoebas, we do not divide into more guests, therefore more beds with less room WILL NOT be convenient. The rooms are bland, poorly designed (as in no esthetics), and unrefined for a self-proclaimed boutique hotel. The television wires hand from the wall as tackily [sic] as the plastic covered chandelier in the lobby. The furniture looks as if it is trying to be antique eclectic (God, I hope) but fails miserably. It's dinged and it's plywood and it's awful looking. That seedy hostel I stayed in in Germany was furnished better. The A/C, bless its heart, rattled worse than my grandmother's dentures. The artwork was hung on a fabulous exposed brick wall. The paintings were hideous and likely from Wal-Mart. It was a disservice and slap in the face to that gorgeous brick wall. The brick wall was glazed to prevent crumbling mortar (I assume). Well, the mortar crumbled... On my bed... Under the bed sheets. Either housekeeping didn't take note of this when they made the bed or they simply didn't care to brush off the abrasive pumice treatment before I got into bed. P.S. The beds are divitted neatly where previous bodies have lain. Management: invest in nicer pillow top mattresses or change out your el-cheapos more often. The bathroom was well appointed and marbled, well, mostly. My problem with the bathroom: nasty dust bunnies clogging the exhaust fan and grout that was in bad need of a toothbrush scrubbing or regrouting all together. Call me a prude, but boutique hotels are known for using neat, obscure toiletries for guests. Not here... As hohum as the artwork. On a bright note, morning coffee was killer. Nicely roasted and great temperature. I'll forgive the cheesy micromini styrofoam cups. They dim in comparison to the plastic lamp shade covers surrounding the coffee service. We didn't get mugged. We didn't get bed bugs. We didn't have to shower with cold water. Some might say this was a success in NY, NY. Pshaw. I know great boutique hotels are out there. The SoHotel (aka the HohumHotel or the SoHostel) is not among their ranks.

I have stayed at many hotels from 3 to 5 stars and I must say this hotel is one of the cleanest hotels I have ever stayed at. We had room service every day which was very nice they also changed our towels everyday but if you are a very eco freindly customer they had an option to ask for towels and sheets not to be changed everyday. Staff- As soon as we entered the hotel we where helped by a bellman. The Front desk also was very nice they even took five minutes to show us a map with all the places to go and how to get to them and let me tell you this was very helpfull as I have been to new york before and have never been to these places. The housekeeping also did a very good job. I give the staff an A++ Overall- I will recommend and stay at this hotel again as it is my new home in NYC. I only recommend to book the larger rooms as they cost a little more per night.

Tips: - the Randolph bar next door does a good Malbec and has a nice vibe for a nightcap - Balthazar in Spring St (nearby) is great for brunch (reservations are a good idea) - Lombardis in Spring St is great for pizza (1st pizzeria in US apparently), if you go late around 10pm there is no waiting time - Congee in Chinatown (on Bowery) is good for cheap tasty chinese (try the shrimp balls) - DelFriscos in Midtown does very good steak (pricey) - Do Empire State before 11am, it was quiet with almost no queues - Do the Alexander McQueen exhibition at the Met - fantastic A decent hotel in a fantastic city.

The rooms are small, especially for european standard, but they are really comfortable, clean and i liked the beds.

We received help with our luggage, advice on where to go (even for a manicure!) and hello's from all. 2) Stylish rooms and decor. Our room was not as tiny as people have mentioned on here. We had a twin room, which size wise was fine for the two of us who only wanted to sleep there anyway. Oh & the bed was super comfy!!! People on here had mentioned some sort of plastic covering on the mattress. True, we did have a cover on the mattress but it was not plastic and in fact we saw these sold in shops as bed bug protectors. 3) Great location. This is probably the best thing and much more important than we estimated. Having Little Italy, Chinatown, Soho, Broadway and a couple of Subways on your doorstep & within a 10 minute walk is outstanding!!! We only ever needed to get the subway when travelling to the really tourist spots, like Times Sq. We felt safe here - even at night & were more than spoilt for choice for food. Quite young & trendy with a few late opening bars too. 4) Tea & coffee - the complimentary tea and coffee in the mornings is a nice touch. On New Years Day they made it available all day & with biscuits, choccies & cereal bars! The bad - 1) The noisy water pipe. In our room we had a noisy water pipe with made noises night and day and was very hot to the touch. We did mention this to reception, who politely offered to change our rooms. However with it being the Xmas season we had little choice left & our options we a windowless room or a room next to the lobby. Considering these we stayed put. By the end of our stay we were used to the noise, however my friend did complain that the pipe had begun to smell. 2) All the stairs. The hotel would obviously benefit from an elevator. The stairs were also quite steep and I doubt I would have been able to carry my luggage down the two flights had the bellboy not have been on hand. 3) The cleaning. The hotel and room were cleaned every day however it appeared that our floor was not swept at all during our stay. I personally would rather my floor be swept than towels changed daily. Dust did begin to gather in large clumps and with hair balls too. We were also left without toilet roll on one of the days after having mentioned this to the cleaning staff. 4) The 'wardobe'. The clothing rack in our twin room only had 6 hangers, which for two girls left us hanging several items per hanger. The very ample (perhaps 8 drawer) chest was too big for the room and we would have rathered further hanging storage instead. All that said, we felt very well taken care of and very welcome at The Sohotel.

Good shower room and storage for clothes and although there was no wardrobe there was a hanging rack with coat hangers which was plenty. We didnt have an issue with this arrangement but some people may have wanted a wardrobe. No safes in the room which is a key feature for the traveler in my opinion but they did offer a safe box to put valubles in which was kept behind reception and the desk was manned 24/7 which was great. There was a choice of when you had your sheets changed which was a nice option for the eco warrior in you. Everything you could want in NY was within a 5 - 20 min walk from the hotel including resturants, bars ,clubs , clothing boutiques and food stores (Whole Foods 4 blocks away).

Four friends in 1 room and the first thing we noticed was the bathroom. Never have I seen such a small bathroom. I'm not the biggest person on the planet, I'm an avarage size, but I practically had to squeeze myself between the bathroom and the wall to get to the toilet. The door opens in to the bathroom so you can't get to the shower without squeezing yourself between wall and sink first to close the door. Two people in the bathroom is simple impossible. Some rooms do have a different bathroom set-up though wich looked an itsybitsy more practicaL. If you are a bit bigger than avarage, don't even think of booking a room here! Luckily, bags and suitcases can be stowed under the bed, otherwise we wouldn't have known were to put them.. there simply is no room at all (one coat rack and one chest of drawers and 30 cm between bed and wall). The hairdryer stopped after 10 seconds.. (overheated? that fast?) but when the frontdesk saw my 'coupe' they immediately gave me a replacement hairdryer from under the desk (so this must happen all the time). This was also the first hotel were we had 4 towels (for the 4 of us) and din't have to ask for extras.. not that important, but a nice touch (as are the bathroom amenities which are really cool-looking.. hey, i'm a girl, I like those details) The room itself was modern and very nice-looking with the brick walls and good bedlinens. The beds were extremely comfortable although quite warm (and it was nearly freezing outside), we only noticed during the second night that there was an extra hidden blanket :) There was some noise from the street (garbage truck, car alarms..) but hey, that's New York. When we returned on the evening of halloween housekeeping had left us a small candybag on the nighttable. Nice little gesture! Location is okay, although we had trouble finding a place to get breakfast nearby. (enough Starbuckses to go around though) Lots and lots of souvenirshops around the corner, some bars and pastryshops and lots of restaurant but not a real deli or coffeehouse. We finally ended up in the Soho Cafe which is not really that far away and has everything.. The free WiFi was incredibly slow and apparently lots of people with kids stayed in the hotel (although it doesn't really come across as an hotel to stay with children. The bellboy (?) was a great help, he carried the suitcases down the stairs (no elevator, but no bif deal) and explained which subway and airtrain to take to the airport. It is not the cheapest hotel so it's even more sad that they made it soooo obvious that they installed as much rooms as possible on one floor..

Well, the little gem on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Little Italy/Chinatown\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd edge of Soho, just steps away from the newly gentrified Bowery, the sohotel, thesohotel.com has pulled it off. If their recent green renovation where they officially sought a green focus, with a sleek look and low price becomes a trend in the hotel industry, the environment and our budgets will all give a sigh of relief and there won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be any bedbugs hitching a ride home on our rollaboards! How do they do it? 1. The lobby is sleek and cool, yet fun due to designer lamps, wi-fi and a big flatscreen. Minimal, hip furnishings on the first and second floors are embellished with a few of what I call \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the latest candy magazines\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (the tabloids). The candy dish at check-in is full of European hard sweets and in addition, there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153eye candy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a stream of young, continental, European (ah-hem) hard bodies checking in. Oh, the sohotel owners are European. That explains some of the following touches. 2. Just off the lobby is a charming vine-bedecked outdoor smoking deck with a cool bench. Complimentary coffee and tea is served each morning in the lobby and there is an ice machine. 3. There is no elevator for the four-story building, but we need to start thinking of this as a PLUS. . . Lots of exercise for guests and staff, yet no carbons were burned by a huge cage needless lifting us. The bellmen are cheerful and helpful. Unfortunate caveat, those with walking limitations will need to stay elsewhere. 3. The rooms are appointed minimally and thoughtfully to prevent our country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent explosion in the bedbug population from considering the sohotel as a tempting trophy house. The sohotel purposefully chose wooden blinds instead of draperies, hip yet minimal bed frames without dust skirts, and bamboo flooring instead of carpets. How great to step out of bed without interfacing with creepy carpeting. Each bed has a fluffy, spotless white Swiss duvet instead of a bedspread. These and their white towels and sheets are each washed on the premises in a special eco-laundry room after each check-out. 4. For your convenience, there are in-room appointments including a satellite-enabled flatscreen TV, alarm clock, hair dryer, a bathroom shelf and Italian travel-sized toiletries (including toothpaste, which is a rare hotel inclusion) bottled water, more candy, extra hooks in the bathroom for wet towels, an ice bucket and did you notice that no phone is mentioned? What a cool way to reduce costs and clutter. We have our cell phones along, anyway. 5. The rooms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 windows actually open and there is a ceiling fan in most of the rooms, so it was a lovely treat to have the option of sleeping with the A/C off. Caveat. . . on the 4th floor, this is not the case. There are skylight windows instead of fans and these and the other windows do not open. 6. For a great dinner, no fuel surcharge or carbon offsets required! Rather than taking a cab somewhere, just go left out the front door and you are steps from Little Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mulberry Street which is full of authentic Italian eateries, most of them with tables spilling onto the street in which cars are forbidden. Or, turn right to head over to the Bowery (Keanu Reeves recently spotted there by yours truly) where Daniel Boulud\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beautiful, affordable, delicious DBGB Kitchen and Bar will tantalize many of your senses. If it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beautiful people that you crave, walk north to Soho and get in line for the Cuban ears of corn at Habana on Prince Street (or try Habana in Malibu when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on the left coast). I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll admit it, I stumbled upon the sohotel when I had a last minute change of plans during a trip to Paris last month and rerouted through New York during, d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122oh!, Fashion Week, where there were not many rooms to be had elsewhere in Manhattan without doing serious damage to the budget. As you can see, I duly fell in love and will return often to the sohotel. If you decide to stay there, enjoy the warm welcome by the staff and direct any of your concerns to the delightful marketing manager, Alain Derderian. In keeping with the charming atmosphere of the hotel, he came outside to make sure my ride was coming as I proceeded to the airport. Green, affordable, immaculate AND charming??

We would have stayed for our last two nights as well, but unfortunately they were all booked up. I think most of the people writing bad reviews on here are either competitors or just extremely nitpicky, because our stay and experience at the hotel was great. I'll start with the negatives of which there were only a few: Our electric went out a few times in the room; they fixed it quickly, but it went off a few more times over the next few hours whenever we plugged something in. Luckily, we saw the fuse box the staff member used to get it back on, and we just did it ourselves the next few times. Hopefully, they have since fixed the problem. The only other \"bad\" thing was the coffee. It just wasn't that good at all. Now for the good! Location is amazing. You are literally a 5 minute walk from all the best neighborhoods in lower Manhattan. Little Italy: 2 blocks, Chinatown: 1/2 a block, Lower East Side / East Village: 3-4 blocks, Broadway and shopping: 4 blocks, the Village 5-10 blocks--- everything is right there!!! We loved the location, and was one of the main reasons we booked here in the first place. The customer service was outstanding. Frank and Ali (hopefully got the names right)were awesome and more than ready to help with our baggage or anything else we needed. I can't think of thier names, but we dealt with the same 2 or 3 ladies at the front desk for our whole stay, and they were extremely friendly and helpful with everything... Like I said before, we would have stayed longer, but they were totally booked up. Another great thing about this hotel was the price. Compared to the neighboring hotels, they are priced very well. When I was walking around looking for another hotel on our last day, the cheapest thing I could find in Soho was running about $500-600 a night! For the location, they really do have the best prices in the area- and this is coming from someone who researches his trips extensively. One more thing----- the rooms are small. But, really- aren't you going to be out doing stuff all day anyway? Who cares if it's small? The bed was extremely comfortable as well. The only other thing I might recommend is that they get a fold-down ironing board behind the door or something. The big one from the front desk barely fits in the room once your bags and everything is set down, but we made it work. Let me state again- we had a great experience at the Sohotel, and are already looking at staying there again in December. The staff, price and location cannot be beat!

The windows are not insulated at all (and I even had a draft one of the windy nights). EAR PLUGS ARE A MUST! If you are a large person, you may not be comfortable in this hotel because the hallways are narrow (if passing, one person, must turn to the side) and the room filled with the beds (which were awesome). I am thin and I had to turn sideways to shuffle past between the beds and dresser. THE GOOD: The lobby and room were very clean and had trendy, updated decor, and a comfortable feel. The beds were the best part--super comfy mattress and top quality linens! There was plenty of hot water, good water pressure, and adequate towels provided and tolietries (extra toilet paper, tooth paste, soap, shampoo, mints, bottled water--though the tap water was good to drink). We stayed five in a room (two queen beds and one twin). There was a half bath just down the hall, which was helpful for our group. The location was in the Bowery, which is just a few steps from Little Italy (tons of great places to eat) and China Town. A few more blocks took us to Broadway, where there was some shopping. The area felt safe, even when we got back one night in the middle of the night. Staff at the hotel were helpful with our questions (provided a subway map, kept our baggage for us on the day we left, gave us some menus for carry-out restaurants, etc.). The wireless Internet worked well. The new flat screen television had a good picture and a good selection of channels (included Spanish and Italian channels).

We were on the fourth floor and there's no elevator so you have to carry your bags up a staircase. No problem, but when we got to the room, we discovered that our radiator wasn't turned on, and it was literally freezing outside. There's no in-room phone to call the desk, so down four flights we went. Desk clerk was apologetic, got the radiator working remotely, and after 45 minutes we could take off our coats in our room without shivering. Later that night when we returned from an evening out at a smokey club we were eager to shower. No hot water, no matter what tricks I tried. I was too exhausted from y day-and-night on the town to get dressed and trek down the stairs. (The shower was working in the morning, for the record.) My bed was snugged up directly against the radiator. The building is very old, and the radiator made such loud noises all night that I honestly laughed at loud at the ridiculousness volume. It felt like we were in a hidden camera show. It was THAT loud. (Imagine the sound of banging a wrench on a metal pipe as hard as you can. I've lived in building with steam hear before, and this was no normal level radiator sound.) Though the noise wasn't constant, it occurred often enough to ensure that we never slept more that a half hour uninterrupted. The top of the bed was burning HOT to the touch; I couldn't safely rest my head there. (I was honestly worried the pillows might combust.) Also, the steam from the radiator formed a huge puddle under the bed and on the edge of my bed. It makes you appreciate the little luxuries like a phone in the room to call the desk, when you have to go down and up four flights to tell the desk that there's a lake of scalding hot water underneath the bed. They apologized and gave us five extra towels to soak up the puddle. The downside of the lively neighborhood is that on a Saturday night you can count on screaming drunk revelers living it up on the streets directly below. We were on the fourth floor, and, at 2 a.m., I could still make out conversations with the window closed. I love NY and the SoHotel's location so much that I might even consider staying there again --probably not though. The lobby was charming. The staff were nice.

If what you hear in the room is noisy for you, this means you are from a suburban area, or sleep lightly, and might be disturbed here.

The hot water for heating system runs through each room via a pipe in the corner. Because of this you can't control the heat so it's always too hot.

I'm not going to mention any other budget hotels in Manhattan incase anyone thinks this is a fake review but there are much better places for less money. If all this sounds a bit unbelievable, try it out for yourself. There should be a lot more negative reviews on trip advisor about this place (we read the others before booking).

If you're looking for one step up from a hostel, this is it. When we were first shown our standard room, it was an INSIDE room, WITHOUT WINDOWS! Can you believe it?! They changed us to a room with a window, which was nice of them, but then we were faced with single-glazed windows (there is a fire station on the next block and on-going construction work on the hotel's facade) and a ridiculously noisy radiator. Everything else that has been written on this site is true: check-in and anything else related to the reception desk takes 30+ minutes, even when you are the only person in the lobby. Our logic of booking the hotel was that it was in a great location and we wouldn't spend much time actually at the hotel, but we both managed to come down with stomach bugs, so we spent whole days cooped up in the tiny room. The maxim 'you get what you pay for' rings true: there is a reason this hotel is so cheap in comparison to most New York hotels!

We were on a very tight budget but knew we wanted to stay in Manhattan, knew we wanted our own private bathroom, and knew we wanted to be near a subway station. This limited our options so the Sohotel seemed like the best choice. In spite of the numerous bad reviews on tripadvisor, we booked it. I went expecting the worst, and was pleasantly surprised. The Sohotel is never going to be considered a beautiful, luxurious hotel, but that's not what it's there for. It's great value for money in a great location, and you'd be hard pressed to find en-suite rooms in Manhattan for anything cheaper. Trust me, we looked. There were bad aspects - scaffolding is still up so we had builders right outside our window (blinds stayed shut the entire trip - don't expect a room with a view!), who were noisy from 7.30am-5pm. The walls of the hotel are also paper thin so you hear people coming back late at night. However, I came armed with ear-plugs so after the first night (when I was so jetlagged I forgot to use them!), this didn't bother me. The 'decor' of the room wasn't stunning, but then why would it be at what we were paying? The good points outweighed this though. 1. Room size - for three girls in one room, we were a bit concerned, however we had 2 double beds, a bathroom, and some space to spare, which was pretty decent. 2. Location - absolutely fantastic. Walk to the right of the hotel, and it's a little bit dodgy, however, walk to the left and the further down the road you go, the nicer it gets. 5-10 minutes walk to the left and you're hitting designer shops, and nice restaurants and bars. A great area to eat out in, and to shop. It's also near lots of different subway stations. If you don't mind walking 5-10 minutes, you can connect to pretty much any line. You can get uptown in about 15-20 minutes. Absolutely ideal. 3. Cleanliness - this was fine. They cleaned the rooms and bathrooms daily, and were constantly changing our towels, which was much better than I was expecting. 4. The staff were also fairly helpful. They offered to carry our bags for us, were quite quick to deal with complaints, and also gave us leaflets about certain touristy things we were interested in, and booked our taxi to the airport. Best for young, budget travellers. All in all, for what you're paying, the Sohotel is great.

This was in spite of the fact that the client had filled out an authorization form required by the hotel and faxed it to them directly as well as sent us a copy that we presented. During our long stay in the lobby, many homeless people came in to watch the tv, sleep on the couches, and lounge in the chairs with their shoes off. The staff did not ask them to leave. They were in some cases openly drunk or belligerent. There were also a set of 3 travelers waiting with us, with some mix up about their room and not being switched to another room. They also seemed to be quite drunk or otherwise. There was definitely a vomit smell coming from various areas. Our room was up 4 or 5 flights of dark, narrow stairs. No elevators. I am not against taking the stairs, but we had a lot of heavy luggage since this was a business trip/presentation. The room itself was so tiny the the dresser drawer would not come all the way open without running into the bed. The furniture was very cute, IKEA type style, which was surprising.

The shower was a stall so small that you could not turn all the way around with our your rear coming out. My husband and I are both quite thin, and both had that experience nonetheless. The shower is also so small that apparently amenities like a place to put your soap and razor can't be included. The option would be to put your soap on the less then clean shower floor, stick your rear out through the curtain in order to have enough room to bend down and get it, etc. There was of course no hair dryer, either. The front desk gave us the one leaking, rusty iron they have to borrow- we had to walk down and back up something like 4 flights of stairs to get it as they would not bring it up. There was no ironing board. We had to use the bed to iron on. We lived in New York City for many years, and actually like good use of small space without unnecessary extras.

The hotel does not have any elevators, so when we did check in, we had to carry our luggage up 2 flights of stairs, good excercise I guess! Not at all accessible for a person with a disabilty. The two horrible experience was being woken up. On Saturday we were woken up at 3:00 AM as the people next door to us blasted the TV and were screaming and having a good time I assume. They were doing everything except sleeping!!!! We had to complain at the front desk and he came down and asked them to quiet down. They turn the volume down...oh let's say 2 notches, still very loud and then someone decided to go take a shower.......the noise of the running water kept us up for an hour, until everyone decided to shut up, stop taking showers and then only we could finally get some sleep. The next horrible experience we had was being woken up at 8:00 AM!!!!! on Monday morning. The hotel decided to do contruction in the room next to ours without giving us any notice or warning. It was not fun being woken up by saws, hammers, drills and every other power tool imaginable thinking the hotel was gonna collapse on us. When we went to complain, we just got a door slammed in our face from the contruction crew. Someone should teach them some manners. The other bad thing, was the toilets clogged easily, needless to say, that was very yuckyyyyyyy and there were stains on the toilet seats. A cleaning lady also walked into our room and appologized as she thought the room was supposed to be empty.

I then spent the next 20 minutes trying to explain to the scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz (No Brain), what I wanted.

The rooms are hostel like, my partners was leaking water from the radiator and mine had clanking heating so not much sleep there. Not that we minded that much, who sleeps when they go to New York anyway!! Those of you who are going to NY shopping for gadgets here's a top tip - the camera / gadgets shops in Time Square have to pay a fortune for renting the shops there so, yes you guessed it they try and pass those costs onto their customers. If you're willing to walk a couple of blocks go to 370 West 51st Street (bet 8th & 9th Ave) and check out a little shop called E.P Electronics. You'll get all the gadgets you need at a fraction of the cost, and not have to go through the hassle of pushey salesmen who get very rude when you don't want to pay for something that you can cheaper over here in their shops.

My sleep would have been infinitely more disturbed by traipsing around in the middle of the night to demand a new room! And other than the music, our stay at the Sohotel was GREAT! Our room which was long and narrow, had high ceilings, wood floors and an exposed brick wall that added to the charm. Furnishings were at a minimum, due to the narrowness of the room, but it easily accomodated 4 women and a weekends worth of shopping and luggage. We had no problem with heat or water pressure. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, even going out to buy us a bag of ice, since they do not have an ice machine. Actually, that would be my biggest complaint about the hotel, but again, that surely didn't ruin our experience. There was a large flat screen TV in the room, and the small bathroom as well as our room were very clean. For walking around the neighborhood, we enjoyed wandering down Mulberry Street which is just a block away, right into the fun of Chinatown.

So if you are looking for a BUDGET hotel,around $200 a night in NYC, for a room that would actually sleep 5 people, with 2 doubles and a twin, I don't know how you could beat the Sohotel. You just need to go with the flow a bit, and have some fun! One word of warnng though. Get a signed quote on your parking ticket from the garage the hotel uses for parking.

The room was TINY. And I do mean TINY. But I didn't come to NYC to sit in a hotel room so no complaints.

The next morning, I tried to take a shower- no water pressure. The water literally trickled down the wall. There were 2 temperatures, scalding or freezing.

A group of us were there for three nights. We each paid for a night with a different credit card. First, we walked into our room (2 double beds and 1 twin) to discover the beds had no blankets on them. Fine. We will let them do their thing and we will just grab a bite to eat and come back. Came back, the room had bee heavily sprayed with some scent and we noticed a roach had been smooshed on the ceiling above one of the beds. Gross! Next morning we discovered that the shower ran intervals where it was extremely cold and extremely hot. Not the most pleasurable experience. We also woke to discover that one girl had been bitten by what we thought were fleas (bc we could see them) all over her neck and torso! We discussed this with the front desk and they immediately changed us to two rooms with a single double bed and gave a refund for that night stay. Next morning, in room #1 they woke up to a freezing cold room and no way to turn on the heater. They then went to take a shower and NEVER got hot warm water. They times it for 20 minutes! Room 2, couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t figure out how to turn on the heat. Shower took about 5 minutes to heat up (not the problem) and then the water pressure became less and less until there was absolutely NO water coming out of the showerhead! Not only was it freezing in the room but now I was wet with conditioner to rinse out of my hair! Come to find out minutes later, the girl who got bit had an allergic reaction and had to pay to rebook her flight so that she could go home to go to the doctor. (So, room 1 girls check out and now we are down to one single room) We are then refunded for the second night because of the problems. We have ONE more night to stay and have received a refund for the first two nights. The last girl and I return to our later that day to discover that the heat is mysteriously turned on in our room...the freezer had just became an unbearable sauna and we still couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t figure out how to adjust the heat. So, of course, we go to the front deck to ask for some help. They are all already so pissed at us they all give us attitude and exclaim that there is a knob on the heater.

You have no knob.\" Duuh! That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we had been telling the front desk! So he goes in another room, brings the knob in and turns off the heat. Then he goes to the front desk to tell them about the knob, comes back up, and tells us that we cant keep the knob because someone else is going to be checking into the other room and then if we want the heat back on we have to go back to the front desk and ask them to turn it on. Lets think about this for a minute...they want us to go down in the middle of the night when we are cold, half asleep, and in our pajamas so that we can wait until their ready to turn on our heat!?!?!? Wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it have been easier to just reassign the other people to another room! Of course, we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak to a manager about this until morning. So we told him what happened and then preceded to tell him that we wanted the difference back from the price of the big room that we had paid for already and the smaller room we had been transferred to because of the fleas. Well, the manager blew up at me! Yelling that we are taking advantage of the situation, he was not going to give us a refund, and that he is the victim here! BS!!

What it lacks in street presence, and the fact that there is a long stairway or two to traverse, it more than makes up for with a great location, a perfectly fine room, easy access to subways, and employees that give far more than most. My 17 year old daughter and I (a female) stayed at the Sohotel for two nights and we were not disappointed. Our room was more than adequate; exactly what I had expected based on comments I'd read online that seemed measured and fair. We felt completely safe, were two blocks from charming Little Italy, and we found the staff very helpful. They will even hold your luggage for you after check out so that you can maximize your time in the city. Make sure you ask where to park your car if you have one, as they have an arrangement with one of the garages nearby. I was unaware of this fact, and when one of the hotel employees heard the outrageous amount of money I was being charged for my car ($50/night!), he insisted on walking to the garage with us, carrying my luggage the 2-3 blocks I must add, to make sure that it was understood that we were staying at the hotel and entitled to the reduced price. This fine young man, walked back to the hotel to stamp my parking stub with the hotel stamp, and stayed with me until he felt certain that all had been worked out. As a huge, and unfortunate, word of caution...the second that he left, the parking attendent tried to charge me the original price suspecting, I suppose, that I was caught between a rock and a hard place seeing as he was holding my car hostage. Make sure that you have the stomach to stick to your guns, or don't come with a car...I had more than one difficulty with parking people... But again, I was so terribly grateful to that young man who did something for me that he certainly did not have to do and what most people surely would not have done.

It's a 40floor walkup in the Lighting district, and is itself above an old lighting store. It is not much to look at, and offers even less in the service department. It is, however, awesome. Although it is not advertised as such, the SoHotel is the oldest hotel in New York City. It's in a part of SoHo that allows for a 5 min walk to old Little Italy, Chinatown, and the aforementioned CBGB site or Joey Ramone place. Broome is not that far south of Houston, and therefore offers a short walk to a NYC Must-see, Katz's Deli (where Harry met Sally, for those of you interested in such things.) The entire neighbourhood around SoHotel is bustling with little shops, diners, patessieries, nightspots, and upscale restaurants (especially Little Italy, which is literally 2 blocks West of the hotel). Subway stations are short walks in any direction...you can get on the brown or the green very easily. The hotel itself is, as I said, not much to look at, but the historical aspect makes it all worth it. It is not only very clean (not a single bug was seen during our 4-days stay), but recent renovations have given it a very old-New-York style. All the inside rooms (vs. the outside rooms, which have windows) have an exposed brick wall that is part of the original building and sports a skylight, to make up for the lack of windows. The dividing walls are paper-thin and the rooms themselves are about 250 sq. feet (if that), but unlike other hostel-style hotels, this one has a private bathroom in every room and full maid service daily. The rooms are nicely appointed with a full bureau and closet, and the beds are comfortable. There is a TV in evcery room, many of them fat-panel LCDs. Finally, I have to mention the front desk service. New York is a city in which service institutions live and die on word-of-mouth, and the SoHotel is obviously wll aware of this and takes every step to ensure your stay is a comfortable one. When we arrived (the 4 of us) with the intention of staying in on e room with 2 double beds, the discovered that they had made a mistake and given us a single. Rather than move us into another room, the Concierge was kind enough to provide us with a SECOND room, completely of his own accord. I can't recommend the SoHotel highly enough; the location, the history, the price and the service all made it a very comfortable place to stay and added to our overall enjoyment of our NYC visit.

The staff is not helpful. The day before we were to leave I asked if they had an alarm I could borrow-since there are no phones in the room a wake up call was not an option. They said 'no', they didn't have one. But, they could give a wake-up knock on the door. I scheduled one for 5:00am. Luckily I woke up on my own at 4:45 (not difficult as the constant sirens and traffic that you hear throughout the night make it difficult to sleep in the first place) because they never came to for the wake-up knock. When I went downstairs to check out no one was there. The phone was ringing, I called out 'hello' but no answer. I waited 15 minutes in the lobby before a man came out from a room behind the front desk rubbing sleep from his eyes. When I asked him about the wake up knock he said, 'I don't see no wake up knock here'. So, then I said to him, we also scheduled a ride to the airport yesterday for 5:30 am to the airport (something they offer for $45. Oh, he didn't have that written down either. Luckily there was another sleeping man that woke up and came out so he was able to drive us for the $45. 2. The place is dingy. The walls are dirty and EVERYTHING squeeks, I guess they've never heard of WD40. The blinds are dirty and broken. 3. The bed is one of the most uncomfortable beds I've ever slept on. And, it is a full, not even a queen. It has a plastic sheet underneath the the sheet-I guess they are worried about guests wetting the bed??? You can feel the springs. 4. It is very noisy. 5. The room is TINY. Barely enough room to walk around. Sink is in bedroom since there is no room in the bathroom for it. The bathroom is so small that you can touch elbow to elbow in the shower, and when you get out of the shower you practically step in the toilet. 6.

Very limited amenities -- I asked for an iron but they didn't have any at the desk so I'm glad I decided to steam my clothes in the shower because I never received one. 8. Management has no sense of customer service. I had a layover and Detroit and after waiting 4 hours (due to delays) for my connection to New York, I found out the airport was shut down and all flights were canceled. I had to stay in Detroit so I called the Sohotel and they said that would be fine. When I paid for the hotel they charged me for one night since I arrived on the 11th and left on the 12th. I checked my credit card statement and they charged me twice. When I called, they said it's because of their cancellation policy and that was that.

Clearly, the USA do not have the same customer protection laws as the UK. On arrival you have to lug your luggage up steep stairs into the reception area. The hotel covers 4 floors with no lifts. No assistance is offered by staff to take your luggage to the upper floors. The website gives the impression of moderm rooms with ample space. In some places you had to walk sideways around the room. Our bathroom was designed more for `hobbits' not human beings. Although most staff were very helpful we had to describe to 3 different people that we had an extra night booked. This had been agreed before we left the UK.. Its stressful being told 3 times you have no room booked for your last night. If you want a quiet hotel DO NOT stay here. There is no double glazing in the rooms and hence road traffic is very audible, even at the back of the hotel on floors 2 and 3 (we tried several during our stay). At least the traffic noise drowned out the heating pipes playing an irritating tune all night long. We had to listen to the Guy's TV in the next room blaring at full volume til 5.30 am. He checked out and we thought yes some sleep. We returned the next night hopeful of a few hours sleep to find on Thurs-Sat our room was directly above a bar/club. The floor actually vibrated to the thud thud of the music until at least 3-4am, and no soundproofing seemed to be in place. What is even more annoying is the Staff were fully aware this was common practice but failed to draw it to our attention. Asking $180 dollars a night is a disgrace for such a room.

I was given a tiny room - which was fine as I wasn't planning on spending much time in it. Although I must say I was a bit surprised that the room didn't even have a telephone! While I was trying to sleep, I noticed something out of the corner of my eye moving. I turned on the light to find a small reddish bug. The hotel is old and a few bugs is to be expected. I got some kleenex and picked it up. Before jumping back into bed however, I pulled the covers back to make sure there wasn't any more. What I discovered was horrifying!! There were a couple dozen bugs crawing under the covers and along the rim of the bed/mattress. I panicked and immediately packed my stuff and went down to the front desk and told the staff who looked absolutely shocked and surprised at my discovery. After the other reviews on this board, it is clear they were putting on a \"good show\" of disbelief! They moved me to another room that I picked apart from top to bottom. While I didn't find any bugs, I didn't sleep either. I kept the light on because I researched bed bugs on my laptop and it said they don't come out when its light. Not immediately, but two days later, red bumps appeared on my arms, hands, neck and feet - the areas that were exposed during the night. They itched like crazy and stayed on me for well over two weeks. I advise anyone who is \"sitting on the fence\" on this hotel to really heed the reviews of this board as they are indeed accurate and truthful. I understand that the price of this hotel is appealing when it is so hard to find any others in Manhattan that come close.

The hot water was always hot/warm depending on what time you took a shower, my top tip is to have one before 830. My only complaint was that the room did not have any windows which ment it felt a bit like a prision cell and you had to make a trip to the window at the end of the hall to have a look at the weather for the day. The hotel was in a good location excellent for resturants and bars and also for shopping and for seeeing the sights of lower manhatten. It also had good transport links with three easy to reach stations. If you are coming from JFK, then you should really get of at Bowery street and not Grand street as the hotel recomends as this station is closer.

Upon arriving at the hotel, I was worried about encountering the unpleasantries I read online - namely loud noise from disco on first floor, roaches under bed, stained and paper-thin towels, and unreliable hot shower. None of these happened to us. We (my partner joined me later in the night after he rushed down from a conference in another state of USA) stayed on the second floor but there was no loud music throughout the 5nights we stayed there. The hygiene level was superb. Room was spic and span. No roaches, or any crawlies, throughout our stay. And that's not just the room, even the lobby and corridor (on the second floor where we stayed) was clean and well-sanitised (every night when I stepped into the hotel and walked up the stairs, I could \"smell dettol\" instantly) And towels were clean, fresh-smelled and decent. Not paper-thin. Only upon my scrutiny did I notice one towel with faint tiny stains; but it was clearly a well-washed, clean towel. And the room attendant was so generous with the towels: we had 4pieces of towel on the first night, she removed 2 used ones the next day and issued another 4 clean peices to us. At the end of our stay, there was a heap of clean towels in our room. Hot showers was a no-issue too. It was end Nov (cold) and getting hot showers was important to me. So particular and paronoid was I over what I read online (unreliable hot showers) that I specifically tested the shower the moment I checked into the room. As it was an old building, it wasn't an electric heater hence would take a while for the hot water to flow out. I didn't get hot waters out at first try, so I went to the reception counter to enquire and after returning back to my room, within minutes, they got a \"technical\" young chap knocking on my door to check it. It was fine, we got nice warm showers throughout our stay. One warning to those who intend to book through travelocity though. We booked 5 nights through travelocity, the booking was confirmed but upon checking-in at the hotel, it was discovered that the hotel's system registered my booking as 1 night stay. All thanks to Marco's (think he is the manager or boss) quick problem-solving on the spot, he got some bookings resorted and found a room available on the 5 nights we were in NY. Jose, who attended to me, was nice and gave me assurance that they'd get the arrangement iron out when he realised the discrepancy in records. From his exclamation \"oh no, it's happening again\", I took it that the hotel's system and travelocity's system do not \"talk to each other\" in sync.

My partner and I were there for five days in November 2005. If you are looking for a decent budget hotel in New York City for a bargain price (in comparison to most other places) then this is the hotel for you. I've stayed in numerous hotels throughout New York that haven't been budget in the past, so i was very dubious, but we were both pleasantly surprised. The room was big and spacious. The sheets and towels were changed everyday. Really it was better than you would expect all round and the location is fantastic. The only problem was that you have to either have a boiling hot or freezing cold shower, and the bathroom is tiny - but really who cares, and what do you expect for the price? I will definetly stay there again in the future, and would recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "December 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cOverall a good value, only if you plan on sleeping after 3-4am\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4240981", "Content": "The Sohotel is where we ended up on our random trip to NYC. Once we arrived at the hotel we were impressed with the value for the money. I was travelling with three other friends and was delighted to see that there were three beds in the room and they made no fuss over visitors or additional guests in the room. We were put on the second floor which was the first floor of the hotel. There was a bar directly below us. We went out for the evenings living up the NYC nightlife and returned to our room nightly around 3am. We weren't aware of a nightclub directly below us prior to checking in, but the bass coming through the floor was so loud that we felt like we were in the club. I'm actually a bass lover, have subwoofers in my car and love going to loud nightclubs, but this bass was boooming, no exaggeration at all. For me and my friends we didn't really care since we weren't sleeping until after the club closed anyways, but for other travellers you will find it virtually impossible to sleep from the bass alone. If your a fan of house music, maybe it'll be paradise for you. I was impressed with the hotel overall for value but I agree with the last reviewer's review, only stay there if you are planning to go out late at night. They should probably adjust the housekeeping times to at least noon to account for people not being able to sleep through the bass. We had to tell housekeeping to go away. We missed our checkout time by about 3 hours, but blamed it on the nightclub below and they didn't charge us any extra. For us it was a good experience but be forewarned about the bass, it's insane!! I only recommend this to people who are only looking for a bed to crash in late at night after hitting up a club. One of my friends thought of the brilliant idea of buying booze for our hotel room, and going back and forth from our room to the club to drink. So if you're looking to do that, then you've found the place!!", "Date": "December 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bow, NH", "Title": "\u201cA Reasonable Bargan\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4160360", "Content": "This is a reaonable 'value' hotel.

This neighborhood, now part of the spreading hipster zone as the East Village spreads downtown, is where many flophouses (or SROs) used to be - it's a few feet from the infamous Bowery. Draw your own conclusions on both of these observations. Room had been partially renovated, but still managed to be cheap and shoddy. And tiny (even by European standards.) Too small for two people, I'd say. Lobby a source of some concern. I would have hesitated to leave anything of value there, so was glad I didn't have to.
