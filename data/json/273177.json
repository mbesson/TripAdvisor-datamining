The room was large, the bathroom was clean and perfectly suitable, and the bed was really comfy. The down side was the fact that the room decor was rather tired looking. It definately needed a new lick of paint! However if what you want is a clean room with your own bathroom, and a good continental breakfast, this hotel was great value. Other things to consider before booking is that because of the value, this hotel caters for large groups of students. We weren't kept awake all night, but there was a steady trickle of feet down the corridor till about one in the morning. The last thing to tell you is the issue of distance to the centre of Amsterdam. We were a bit concerned before our arrival, but we were pleased to find it was so easy. The number 14 tram, takes you from Dam square to right outside the hotel. It takes about 25 minutes, but the journey is rather nice.

So I didn't really know what to expect from hotels that Contiki pick, about whether you should expect good value or good quality, and had nothing to really compare it to. Once I was there I knew straightaway it was a typical budget hotel, more like a hostel- something that budget tour groups or young people on a budget would pick for convenience, nothing more. It was a real backpackers place, sometimes even like a dosshouse, with crowds of young people hanging around the corridors, or in the tiny lobby, just passing time or being rowdy. There weren't many places to really go in the hotel itself, apart from the already mentioned corridors, and the tiny dining room out the back, and I would've thought it would have more space. Basic was the word that immediately screamed out at me. The rooms themselves were plain, dark and again, very basic- nothing actually unpleasant, but nothing special either. There were three beds in the room that me and another girl had been paired up by our tour group to share, and even though three beds were too much when there were only two of us, it was better than the other way around, with there not being enough beds! It was a real typical budget hostel room, and obviously in need of repair and maintenance- the toilet seat was broken while I stayed there, and also the door handle. ANd on the second night, we came back from a night out to find that a pipe above us must have broken, and had leaked all over the other girl's bed. She didn't panic too much, as none of her things had been on it, and as there were three beds she just slept in the other one. But that kind of thing shouldn't have happened in the first place, with proper service and maintenance of the rooms. The bathroom was acceptable, and clean, although the water pressure in the shower was very strong, but maybe that was just my room. The dinner we had with the group on the first night, in the little dining hall at the back, was just alright- a real budget, buffet type of meal, with just bits and pieces of different kinds of food. It wasn't a great meal, but there were no horror stories either. I had no real encounters with the staff either way, apart from one time when I had a few questions for the man behind the desk, about where certain things were in the hotel or the town, and even though he was serious, he was polite and helpful, and I couldn't fault him. I can't remember whether the faults in the room were reported or not, but whether the hotel staff knew about them, or even did anything about them, was unclear. They didn't seem to check the rooms regularly, or to be worried about leaking pipes or broken door handles or door seats, but there were no actual incidents with them, I can't remember anyone being rude or anything. They all seemed to keep to themselves but to be very polite- in my experience, anyway. The part of town we were staying in was very busy but had nothing interesting- it was just tiny little shops and busy streets, nothing touristy at all. But it was just a short journey into the good part of town, with regular trams passing by just outside the hotel- although I was waiting quite a long time on my second morning (in the rain!) and then somehow managed to get on the wrong tram, or to miss Central Station, but that's not the hotel's fault. Having a regular tram service, and a stop just outside, means staying a little way outside town isn't too much of an inconvenience. I also think that people planning a stay in this hotel should know that it is a typical youth hostel, a real young person's place, and especially that Contiki also uses this hotel (at least they did when I went!) and that obviously because of that it WILL be very noisy, with rowdy young people hanging around. So just be aware of that when you're booking it- it's not the kind of place you go to if you want peace and quiet! Overall, I had no unpleasant experiences in the Niewu Slotania, had nothing to complain about, but going by its shabbiness and lack of maintenance, and the crowds of young people hanging around, I would choose a different place to stay if returning to Amsterdam, and would not recommend it for young families, solo travellers, or a romantic break.

I made my booking on a website and ensured myself I was booking a 105 euro room for 3 adults and that there was no extra fee for the 3 person, which there finally was. 3. The room was a lot smaller than advertised. 4.

In the morning I woke up and headed to down the freakishly long hallway and discovered to my surprise that there was a massive leak in the hallway and it seemed as though nobody was worried about it. 6.

I checked into my room and they were sooo tiny my boyfriend and I couldn't walk by eachother without having to move out of the way. There was this tiny closet thing where we were supposed to put our things. The tv sucked! every channel was staticky, but thats not to bad because we were out and about most of the time except at night :( the bathroom was pretty dirty. There was a little space between the floor and the wall where you could see the street!!!!!!! I went down to the front desk and asked if we could upgrade and I was willing to pay. They said no without even looking. So we tried to make the best of it. We decided to go downtown and check it out. The best thing was that there was a tram stop directly infront of the hotel lobby. It took us almost a half hour on the tram to get there. So far away! it really sucked!!!! I definately want to go back to amsterdam but next time I'm going to look for something definately closer to the center and believe peoples reviews.", "Date": "November 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jerusalem, Israel", "Title": "\u201cPlease choose something else, if you only can!

We had to travel by tram for 20-30 minutes every day to get to the sightseeing spots. The neighborhood around this hotel looks like slums. There was some bad (rotten) smell in the corridors. When we entered the room, we found that the sink was almost completely blocked, and the phone wasn't working. We requested to repair the sink and were answered \"tomorrow\". The next morning, we requested the reception lady to call someone to repair the sink problem. At first, she suggested us to try and push through the sink opening with a finger, and than said that the \"repairs person\" has just left and will only be back at the afternoon. Having written a note, she promised to do her best. When we came back at the evening the same day, nothing has changed. I went down to the reception again, to find a rather rude young fellow, who once again suggested to \"push through the sink tube with the finger and leave him alone\". After my boyfriend came down to yell on him, the receptionist sent us the repair person, who finally made the water flow through. Our phone was never repaired. We had to use the public phone in the lobby upstairs, which requires coin insertion even through a \"calling card\" dialing. We were running out of soap, and requested for more supply but in vain. The receptionist said he had no soap anywhere and sent us to the house-cleaning. The house-cleaning lady was really not nice, and said she was only giving soap once per room for the entire stay. We eventually bought our own soap. One receptionist makes a promise (like sink repair) and the other knows nothing about it. Very poor service. When we reported our room problems, we were offered to check out and then \"we will maybe receive another room, and maybe not\". And that's when we've payed in advance by credit card! From what I witnessed with other guests, things going out-of-order (showers, sinks, toilets) are quite of habit there.

We stayed here for two nights in July. We would not recommend this place to anyone. When we requested two twin beds for the room, we had no idea that they were going to give us a bunk bed. That's right, a bunk bed. No luck on changing rooms, we were stuck. The carpet was brown and there was dirt and dust everywhere. Our room had a giant AC exhaust thing outside the window that was extremely loud. The irony was that we didn't have AC in our room. If you closed the window, the room got hotter than hell. It was a lose-lose situation. The hotel apparently bought these condos next door and connected them with a walkway. It's confusing and very sketchy. We didn't feel safe walking to our room even though we were on the hotel's property. There are a bunch of teens and young adults that stay here on group trips, and they don't seem to grasp the notion that other people are staying at the hotel too. Good luck trying to sleep while there's a party raging outside your door. The grouch at the front desk at night is quite a character. While we were in the lobby on the internet, we watched one drunk teen came up to the front desk and tell the clerk that he had lost his key. The guy at the desk said too bad, and wouldn't provide another key unless the kid had the requisite $70 fee. Well the kid's wallet was locked in his room, so the guy at the front desk actually made him sleep on a couch in the lobby. Can you believe that? It's understandable that you might be frustrated by all the kids stumbling in drunk or high throughout all hours of the night - even we were a bit annoyed - but making a client sleep outside the room he paid for is inexcusable. It's a pain to access the city center from the hotel by public transit, especially after hours. It takes about a half hour to get to where you need to go, and it's very easy to get lost along the way. You could take a cab back from city center as we did one night, but expect to pay 40 Euros for the fare. In addition, there is pretty much nothing to do around the area. The hotel does have free WiFi and a computer station for its guests. Unfortunately, there are some confusing instructions that you have to go through first in order to configure your device for the WiFi, and the computers that they have are running Windows 95. No joke. We were fed up after two nights and left for the QBIC Hotel instead, which was a far better value and a much more enjoyable stay. The only reason why I give this hotel a rating of 2 instead of a 1 is because one of the employees was able to give us good directions to the other hotel by public transit.

Needless to say he didn't check Tripadvisor before booking! I checked Tripadvisor as soon as we found out where we were going and did get a little worried about all the bad reviews. However I am fairly easy to please so went with an open mind, thinking maybe people were just being picky. I have never written a bad review about a hotel before as I normally see the good in everything. However I urge you to take this review on board before you go there! It was very easy to find with the tram/bus stop just outside so transport really wasn't a problem. Reception seemed clean and fairly welcoming. Our room although basic was clean, the view was not nice looking out over a busy road, but this didn't bother me as you don't spend that much time in your room anyway. Getting into Amsterdam centre couldn't have been easier on the tram or the bus which are very regular and the trip takes about 20 mins. With the stop just over the road. The area isn't brilliant, it has a couple of takeaway places and some shops over the road, but as it's so easy to get anywhere else this didn't matter to us. Once we had got back to the hotel from exploring that's when the problems started........ There were kids everywhere - I'm only 27 so not old but these kids were no older than 18. They were extremely noisy - but again I thought I could put up with that as they're on holiday too. Going up to our room the whole corridor stank and I mean STANK of smoke - cigarette smoke and marujana (sp?) smoke. Once in our room I thought we were away from it all. The bed was extremely uncomfortable it was ridiculously soft....... Got to sleep after a long day, and was woken at 2am by the fire alarm....smoke was billowing through our door and I thought the whole hotel was on fire! There was a lot of noise from people running up and down the corridor. I jumped out of bed and into the corridor but there were just loads of people no fire luckily! Although there were signs all over the hotel stating it was non smoking and anyone found to be smoking or smoking drugs would be told to leave it didn't seem to stop anyone! We had a small alcove opposite our hotel room door which we guessed people were smoking in to hide away from the staff if anyone looked down the corridor. Which explains the billows of smoke coming through our door! On our first night the fire alarm went off 3 times! I barely got any sleep at all! We decided to give it another night hoping the first night was a one off, and we were there for 4 nights. I couldn't wait to get out of the hotel in the morning - it was so stuffy and my nose was really blocked due to breathing in so much smoke throughout the night. The second night the fire alarm went off another 2 times. I persuaded my boyf not to find another hotel as I didn't want him having to waste his money. However I really couldn't wait to get home. Breakfast was a good spread, if you could get to it! Due to the amount of kids trying to get as much as they could it was a struggle to get anything yourself, and things were constantly running out. They don't have a bar in the hotel or any mini bar or anything in the room - They seem to have a bar downstairs, but use it as some sort of storeroom so it's not open. They do have vending machines on the first floor, during the day and at night this is the only place you can get refreshment. It would have been nice to have a kettle in the room to make myself coffee in the morning. Amsterdam is a lovely place and I would recommend anyone going there, however my surprise trip was def ruined by the hotel. I don't think this was a one off, this place is def a youth hostel and should be advertised as such. If you are going to amsterdam as a young person in a group and looking to smoke etc then this place is perfect for you! If you are going for a nice weekend away as a couple to see the sights DO NOT use this hotel. I don't think I have described very well how bad this hotel is - I have never had a holiday ruined by a hotel until this one. I literally barely got any sleep for 4 nights.

So we arrive in amsterdam 14 of us and get the taxis to the hotel no problems about 20 mins from airport. We arrive at the hotel and are told that we cannot check in until 2:00pm, fair enough we are only 10 minutes outside the center of amsterdam (or so we are led to believe) so we decided to go for a walk some asian guy outside the hotel points out the direction to walk in, looking round the immediate area it looks rough and is predominantly turkish, all the women are in hijabs, anyway we walk for 20 minutes and Im thinking where are the canals and great architecture? its basically all pre fab concrete buildings and the turkish area is big. Eventually we spotted a bar and went in. The lady behind the counter seemed surpised to see us and was quite happy to help us out and made us welcome. So we asked for directions to the main area of the city, Dam square is a good place to start, she told us another 15 minutes on a tram. Nice. After eventually getting to the middle of amsterdam we spent a couple of hiours there and managed to get back to our hotel to check in, taxis ranged between 20 - 45 euros to where we were. We went to book in and gave our booking reference, the guy behind the counter said he had no record of it even though we had paid 230 euros deposit, he said we should have had the confirmation sheet, upon producing this he still denied we had paid any deposit so basically we lost our deposit and all had to pay an extra 15 euros each per person taking our original price from 80 euros for two nights to 95, I have never met such unhelpful people in my life.

After complaining all he said was \" if you dont like it dont visit Amsterdam\" \"try a country-side hotel\" I will never go there again. I think I will go to the centre of Holland in future and use the hotels there instead (staff much friendlier and hotels a lot quieter) Amsterdam Tourist Board should take this hotel off there list as it does them no justice , Amsterdam has much more to offer than this sort of accommodation Dont say you have not been warned!!!!!!!

The rooms are fine (although there was no air conditioning). I had no major complaints about my stay here at all. No, it's not a \"project\" type location either.

It was a good thing i spoke Dutch , since the receptionists English was very poor and abrubted. Upon arrival, our room was not ready yet, and we were given alternate one, promising that our original room would be bigger and ready at 3 PM. The room we were given was claustrophibic, walls white, same with the sheets, NOT as displayed on all the photo's placed on the website. There was a TV, but it had poor signal, the make up mirror was nowhere to be found, the bathroom was to small for an infant to fit in, and half of the ceiling was lowered, overall NOT a very welcoming room. But the worst and most profanic thing about the room was that the windows had a measurement of less than 1m2 and the foundation of the windows was home built. Of course we went back to the reception at 3 PM and asked for our original room where we payed for. however, we got told that our room would be even smaller. It didnt leave us with a good feeling about Dutch hospitality and we would advise evryone to avoid this hotel at all times , since no one would like to spend 50 pounds a night on a room worth of 1 star.", "Date": "June 17, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Nieuw Slotania Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d273177-Reviews-Nieuw_Slotania_Hotel-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$104 - $247*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Slotermeerlaan 133</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1063</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "273177", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/2c/ef/2cefa3aab5786a74d6668826a1ebbb353large.jpg"}}
