{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Quiet Haven in Central Ubud We spent three nights in this lovely small hotel staying in a standard room. The room was very nice with its own private small garden and a large bathroom. The hotel has a great pool. Its fantastic value for money and in a good location for all the tourist activities.

We also did a dinner and Balinese dancing evening which was very reasonable, and included return transport.We had the 2 bedroom villa, with private pool, and have never had a room as beautiful anywhere-the only downside was it could be a bit shaded, and so we headed for the main pool in the afternoon, but there was hardly ever anyone there so this was not a problem.It is so quiet, that you don't actully realise it is a hotel.Nothing but prise for the Barong-we will return as soon as we can!", "Date": "Oct 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR607580674", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "iainmic"}, {"Content": "Tranquil Charm in the Hustle of the Shopper        Sunken Shower Area", "Date": "Jul 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR417385402", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "AngelenoTraveler"}, {"Content": "Loved The Barong Loved this little hotel. Ideally located on the monkey forest rd in the middle, a short walk one way to the monkey forest and a short walk the other way to the markets. Greeted with a cool towel and fruit cocktail then lef away to your room, which is through the jungle like gardens to your room. We were in a superior room past the pool and they were lovely, very large and the bathrooms were huge! It is a small hotel with only maybe 12 rooms? so you feel like you are the only ones staying there - we had the pool and the restaurant at breakfast to ourselves so service was great! Lovely little treats in your room each day/night - cookies, peanuts, fresh fruit etc.Free tour through the rice paddys in a very flash 4WD to see the white herons. The herons were not terribly exciting but the drive through the local village and fields was amazing.Great little hotel, that goes out of their way to make your stay pleasant.", "Date": "Jul 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR259977420", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "JacquieHead"}, {"Content": "great stay       A great place for a private dip", "Date": "Apr 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR259169849", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "bannedspencer"}, {"Content": "Peace and tranquillity in the heart of Ubud       Reception Area", "Date": "Jan 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR805035236", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "peroxyd"}, {"Content": "\u59e3\u5ea2\u6ad3\u9351\u70d8\ue122\u9287\u5d83\u4f28\u9287\u693c\u4ee7\u951b?#x201d;   showReview(22855138, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR708409304", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Que du bonheur       chambre", "Date": "Jul 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR780826923", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "btz75"}, {"Content": "\u6fb6\u0443\ue62e\u6e1a\u57ae\u57c4\u9287\ue046\u73db\u9366\u822c\u4f04\u9289\ue042\u5069\u9289\u7b3a\u5113\u9289\u6d96\u5110\u9289\ue0a0\u4ef9\u9287?#x201d;   showReview(19160037, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR925308496", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9288\u5e7f\u506a\u9289\u51a6\u5120\u9287\u3129\u6d36\u9365\u53c9\u76b8\u9287\u5c78\u68ca   showReview(19159849, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR377270318", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9288\ufe3a\u5122\u9289\u5908\u4ef9\u9427\u638b\u4ecc\u9288\u5c7b\u5020   showReview(19157981, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 23, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR780814690", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9288\ue042\u5063\u9288\u5e7f\u512d\u9287\u0441\u4eda   showReview(19157169, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 27, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR578062073", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9288\ufe3a\u5122\u9289\u5908\u5049\u9287\ue1bb\u8151\u8e47\u51ae\u5134\u9287\ue1bd\u67df...   showReview(19926314, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 2, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR582651445", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u951b\u6393\u7866\u951b\u64b4\u68e9\u7039\u630e\u7866\u923c\u5fcb\u4eb0\u95ae\u3125\u773f...   showReview(19925570, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 29, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR391328586", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9289\ue76c\u5142\u9288\ue15c\u5157\u9289\u66d8\u5050\u9289\ue0fe\u5063\u9289\u581f\u90e8...   showReview(19922879, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 14, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR116866102", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297701-d629636-r21503586-Barong_Resort_and_Spa-Ubud_Bali.html", "HotelID": "629636", "Price": "$184"}}
