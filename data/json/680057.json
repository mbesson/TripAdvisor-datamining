That was much too expensive for a room that small ! It was cosy and had a nice wooden floor and I had one of the rooms with an alcove, which iwas nice. Eight under my room was the smoke area of the restaurant. It gets very, very noisy when people are ot there, so I wouldnt recoment that room in the summer . breakfast was so and so. The first day the salami was definitely on the old side Staff is friendly, there is no Lobby, Dustballs under the bed", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zurich, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location\u201d", "Author": "bkker", "ReviewID": "UR125270753", "Content": "The location of Hotel Mitte Berlin is perfect for a city trip. It is located at Alte Sch\u00f6nhauser Strasse, a street packed with shops and restaurants. It is in walking distance of Alexanderplatz, Hackeschen H\u00f6fen and also Prenzlauer Berg may be reached in few minutes by foot. The value for money is unbeatable. For comparable hotels in this location you mostly have to pay double price. Staff is friendly and helpful. There is no reception in the hotel but the staff in the restaurant is also responsible for the hotel management and does a very good job. The rooms are basic and spotlessly clean. Event though they are located directly above the tube station, the noise is hardly hearable. Overall, Hotel Mitte Berlin is one of the most convincing city trip hotel ever visited.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warsaw", "Title": "\u201cThe location is great but...\u201d", "Author": "KaHaWarsaw", "ReviewID": "UR124428146", "Content": "The hotel is located near Alexander Platz, a great starting point for all your sightseeing and shopping as well as a hub in public transport. I went to Berlin on a shopping spree and wanted to spend just one night at some hotel. And 1 night at Hotel Mitte was enough. I will not be a returning customer. It was just so very cold in my room and the bathroom stench was simply unbearable! The breakfast was very basic (it was nicely served, though). There's no proper reception and it's the waiter that checks you in. The advantages are: the price and multilingual staff (I heard Portuegese, Turkish and, ofc, German and English).", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Loughton", "Title": "\u201cbasic, but good location\u201d", "Author": "gillianweatherburn", "ReviewID": "UR109229216", "Content": "We stayed here for 3 nights in early May.The rooms were basic, but clean, and the bathroom small but adequate.Breakfast was simple chese and ham with fresh bread and coffee.

We arrived very early in the morning and were shown straight to our room after a cup of tea. The only downside of the stay was we had booked a double room several months before but when we arrived we were told there were no doubles left and were given a single room with a double bed, with no discount. Maybe if it had been any time except New Year it would have been different - we weren't too bothered as we didn't plan to spend much time in our room but I think an offer of a discount would have been appropriate. Breakfasts were basic but very good. Selection of cold meats and cheese, boiled egg, bread rolls and a bowl of fruit salad, jam and honey. As much tea and coffee as you could drink, but fruit juice was extra. Breakfast was served to you at your table, no buffet. The big plus to the breakfast is that they serve them up to 12:00 so no rush in the morning. The hotel no longer allows smoking either in the rooms or the bar/restaurant area, but did have an outside heated gazebo where you could smoke. The staff were faultless, very friendly and helpful providing an excellent service. As I said earlier we had a very small room, but having a look at the room next door this was extremely spacious and if I stayed there again I would make sure I had one of the bigger rooms. The room was warm and very clean. The shower didn't leak and was nice and modern, plenty of hot water - but in true hotel tradition the bath towel was very very small - take your own! No tea making facilities or telephone. TV on the wall. We didn't notice any over the top noise outside and we stayed over New Year and were in the front of the hotel so don't really understand other comments about the noise. Downstairs is a bar/restaurant, seemed very popular. We ate there a couple of times and the food was rather good. Good selection of drinks. A lot of local trade not just tourists. Again the staff were excellent. Right outside the underground station so getting around Berlin was very easy and tram\\train station just around the corner. I would recommend this hotel, not a 4 or 5* but a nice decent clean place to stay. I would stay there again.", "Date": "January 5, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Mitte Berlin", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d680057-Reviews-Hotel_Mitte_Berlin-Berlin.html", "Price": "$91 - $117*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "680057", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/a6/f4/a6f44491bb16229532b7355c05eb7fff1large.jpg"}}
