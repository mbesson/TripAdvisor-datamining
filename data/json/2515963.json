Recommendation was spot on. We really enjoyed the hotel, the room was a waterfront king and was a great size and wonderful view. The room itself really was well equipped with everything you could need apart from one small detail - I'd love to be able to make a cup of tea/coffee in the room. Here you have to go downstairs to make it or if it's in the evening pay $30 for 2 cups of tea to be delivered to your room. Staff were very helpful from front desk, concierge through to restaurant. If you'd like restaurant recommendations do ask the concierge. They picked out three brilliant restaurants that don't make it near the top on trip advisor but they were outstanding (the ones locals go to). Location is great too on the waterfront. Spa I didn't really feel was that good, massage really just ok. The same hotel group owns a japanese bathhouse (which is great) so I'd recommend that over the in-house spa.

I can't say enough good things about this wonderful hotel in a fantastic location. It is across the street from the Ferry Building.

The service at the hotel is fantastic, the rooms beauitiful, and the breakfast at the Americana Restaurant was great! Get an upgrade with a water view high floor, it is worth every penny. On the 5th and 7th floor they have a beautiful deck where you can enjoy the beauty of the City and the Bay. I am a travel agent that travels extensively and I highly recommend this hotel. My only regret is that I did not get a chance to use the spa. It was a quick business trip. If you want a Hotel that dots all the t's! You will love the Hotel Vitale!

What I didn't like about the hotel is that the quality of the furniture and fixtures are not up to the standards of other hotels at this price point (e.g. the shower head, desk chair, etc.). Especially annoying was the cheap shower curtain -- reminiscent of what broke college students splurge on at Target.

Hotel Vitale ranks up there with some of the nicer places we've stayed and it was made even more enjoyable by the fantastic location. Right off the Embarcaderro on Mission street this hotel could not be more centrally located for a quick trip of San Francisco's highlights. On Saturday we woke up to see people assembling a street market just a few strides from our place in front of the ferry building. Most if not all the vendors from the Ferry Building set up shop on the pier. We strolled over and treated ourselves to a wonderful coffee from Blue Bottle Coffee Company before having one of the best breakfasts we could have ever wanted from Mijita, a little Mexican Cocina. Fantastic homemade tamales and multiple other choices. FANTASTIC! After taking a little walk we went back to get some fantastic cheese and a wonderful roasted beef primerib from Prather Ranch Meat company. While this review should be primarily about Hotel Vitale and the wonderfully accomodating, kind and professional staff, the food that was in such close proximity was part of the whole experience. Per the concierge's recommendations we had a great dinner at the Slanted Door, nuevo Vietnamese meets West Cuisine that was just phenomenal. They found a perfect place for us with our 1 year old and were exceedingly gracious despite the decorations he insisted on making on the floor. Extra tip for the bus boy. The concierge also recommended a great place on the waterfront where we ate the following night called Epic Roasthouse. We have eaten in some of the finest steak houses in the world and this place ranks right up there with the best. We had a 32 Oz. ribeye for two prepared with a coffee rub that left us craving that steak for a week. The last night of our stay at the hotel we had an unfortunate incident where a couple who had come in that afternoon and obviously drank way too much ETOH woke us up at 2:30 with banging doors and yelling obcenities. The hotel walls are very well insulated and so it made it difficult to know where the noise was originating from. A peak out the door finally made me realize they were next door. We called the front desk and immediately the response was, \"Please describe where the noise is coming from in relation to your room. We're very sorry for this sir and we will be taking care of it shortly.\" And within about 5 minutes the noise stopped and we were able to get back to bed soundly. What a nice way of handling a difficult situation. I was very impressed. For me this was my first pleasure trip to San Francisco and all my prior visits have either been fly in fly out or stay at a hotel near the airport. I decided to combine this business trip with a litle R & R and the experience made me wish I'd done this long before. My wife has stayed in SF over a dozen times and she said that Hotel Vitale ranked as the best experience for her as well.

After check in, at about 4:15, we proceeded to the bar and lounge for a cocktail and a snack. The room was so crowded we at first could not find a table. When finally seated the noise was so loud and the crush of people so uncomfortable, with people leaning on our table, taking chairs from our table, and generally being unruly, that we had to leave before we even finished what we had ordered. After a long walk on the Embarcadero we returned at about 8:30 to find that the crowd was larger and louder, and a band or DJ had been added to the noise. Unable to enter the lounge we looked for a comfortable place in the lobby, but people had spilled out onto the lobby couches also. The noise in the lobby was as unbearable as it had been earlier in the lounge. I spoke with the front desk about the lack of a place to relax and sit down and it was laughed off with \"It's Friday night and we are always crowded\"! On return to our room we continued to be \"serenaded\" by the DJ for the next couple hours.

Meant to write a review sooner but never got around to it until now. The hotel, the flagship property of the Joie de Vivre group (an overly cheerful name for a hotel chain, I must confess), is located reasonably centrally, by the Ferry building. Although the views from some of the rooms are rather nice, I wasn\u2019t crazy about the location. Aside from the Ferry building (which houses a large market \u2013 mostly, though not exclusively, food related), there didn\u2019t seem to be much of interest on the Embarcadero for quite a while. Also, although very close to Market Street (one of San Francisco\u2019s main thoroughfares), you have to walk for a good 15 minutes before you get to the shopping area. In my view, both the Four Seasons and the St. Regis, located further down Market Street are better situated. As to the Vitale itself, although designed in a subtle and elegant style, it is starting to show signs of wear. This was evident in both some of the communal areas and the rooms. The Amarericano Bar, in particular, was in dire need of a revamp, with many of its leather lounge chairs sporting unsightly tears. Also, some of the furniture in both rooms we had booked was stained and the carpet had started to fluff visibly. Only ate in-house for breakfast, which was perfectly nice throughout our stay, with a good selection a la carte (no buffet). Also, when the weather allowed it, Americano would host an al fresco aperitif which, although we never managed to attend, seemed quite pleasant. I should also mention that there are two Michelin starred restaurant within a block of the hotel: Boulevard and One Market (I can recommend the latter for the food, which really was rather good and of decent value; as to the atmosphere, the place is so large and busy, and the service so swift, it feels like being in a highly sophisticated fast-food joint). Service was good throughout, though not memorable. To be fair to the hotel, our stay wasn\u2019t very expensive, with an average nightly rate of slightly less than $300 (for Deluxe Waterfront rooms), hence the relatively generous rating. However, if I were to return to San Francisco, I would probably upgrade to a better property. The recently opened St. Regis, in particular, seemed rather impressive; the Four Seasons and Ritz-Carlton decidedly less so - both seemed in need of a make-over too.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spokane, Washington", "Title": "\u201cLuxurious\u201d", "Author": "JimnKrisM0m", "ReviewID": "UR122598671", "Content": "This hotel is right on the Wharf, across from the Ferry Marketplace.

I don\u2019t mind paying for a hotel room in an expensive city, but this hotel is managed as a cheap motel. Upon arrival, after leaving the car with the valet, there was no bellhop to assist with the luggage so we carried it ourselves. I can handle that.

The front desk agreed to call our taxi for the rehearsal dinner, but upon arriving downstairs, learned that a taxi had never been called and no one really cared that we had been misled. We ended up being late to our event and had to take 2 taxi's.... The ceremony was held off site, but the reception was on site.

We had four rooms. One for me and husband, one for our 21 year old son, one for my sister, and one for my parents who required a handicap accessible room. We had originally planned to stay at the Mark Hopkins and made reservations there for the four rooms. The Mark Hopkins offered a large, almost 700 square foot room, handicap accessible room with two walls of views of the Bay. The other three rooms were view rooms but not as grand as the accessible room. The total price, believe it or not, for the four rooms at the Mark Hopkins was less than the price for four rooms at Vitale, but my parents opted for the Vitale because of its proximity to the Ferry Building and the Bay Bridge. My parents wanted a \"view\" room so they could spend the afternoon in their room enjoying the splendid views before our evening engagement in San Francisco. We checked in a bit before 3:00. All of the rooms but the accessible room were ready to be occupied. My parents agreed to sit with us in our room until theirs was ready, which the woman at the front desk told us would be \"in about 15 minutes\". Just before 4:00 I went to my parents room and found housekeeping still working. At that time we were told it would be a minimum of a half hour before the room was ready. Let's remember that check-in is at 3:00. Since it is dark by about 5:00, my parent's plan of enjoying their \"view\" room was not to be. We went to dinner and returned to the Vitale to have a car drive us to our evening engagement. While waiting for the car to arrive, I pushed my mother in her wheelchair to the Vitale lobby restroom. We had an unfortunately terrible experience in the restroom related to patrons of the Americano restaurant in the Vitale lobby. This story is already MUCH too long. I am not usually one to point out short comings of an establishment, but the treatment we received at the Vitale is the worst we have received anywhere at anytime. The hotel was quite attractive, and the rooms were well equipped and pleasant enough, but the service and attention were exceptionally poor. I believe the hotel should have offered my parents a discount or perhaps even a refund of the cost of their room given the unfortunate set of circumstances.

We don't get to travel as often as we'd like being in the hospitality industry ourselves, but we know the difference between those who are just \"doing their job\" and those committed to excellence. At every staff level we encountered, the service was friendly, efficient and most of all helpful. Our flight into SF put us there several hours before check in would begin, so we inquired before leaving home about the possibility to drop off our bags and go have fun until we were ready to check in. From that initial one on one contact to the moment we left the property for the last time after checking out, we were treated with the utmost of respect, congeniality and an obvious desire by all staff to fully serve our needs. When we arrived assuming just to drop off our bags, we were offered multiple room options, the opportunity to check in and a confident assurance that the process would take but a few moments and our worries for the next three days would be left behind. That is exactly what happened and our entire trip was one of relaxed, leisurely paced fun and everyone at Hotel Vitale helped us achieve that. Our suite, #330 was nicely decorated in comfortable tones and high quality features. We live in a rural area where one can hear a pin drop and despite our suite being just a few floors above a busy intersection, we slept soundly each night and suffered from no inside or outside distractions. We experienced no noise above what one should expect while the heart of an urban area. In fact, far less. The beds and linens were very high quality and on the days we didn't want service our privacy was fully respected. The suite was amply sized for our needs and a comfortable respite to return to each night after long days and evenings mostly walking everywhere we enjoyed. The few instances of assistance we asked for were given enthusiastically, efficiently and with a sincerity that was a real comfort. The quality of all the hardware and plumbing fixtures was outstanding and the only observation I have to make is the lack of true, high efficiency in terms of water conservation. We choose lodging partly based on their stated commitment to providing an eco-friendly experience and are both personally and professionally aware of what is available in this regard. Noticing the lack of a \"lathering\" valve or water volume adjustment on the shower head may be this treehugger being a bit harsh, but the shower head is the most used water device in a hotel. I fully understand and can appreciate that in the effort to meet some traveler's expectation of luxury it can be a difficult tradeoff and Hotel Vitale's other \"green' efforts were more than obvious, so no harm, no foul. While not an imposition to us or a major impact, the lack of separation and noise mitigation of the bar/lounge from the main reception area could be improved upon. The contradiction between the serene, muted understatement of the hotel itself and the loud din of the bar/lounge area was noticeable nearly every time we entered or exited between 4pm and midnight. While no guest rooms are on the ground floor, one must pass the noise source in order to go up to one's room. We had no idea business groups could enjoy themselves to such an extent and for so long each evening, but it did inhibit our efforts to patronize what appears to be a very nice restaurant and lounge more often than we did. Our days were filled with easy, convenient jaunts from the hotel and its proximity to the Ferry Building, a San Francisco gem is not to be understated. Every mode of public transportation available is within minutes of Hotel Vitale and we took full advantage of that fact.

Street car lines were easy to find right on your doorstep as well as double-decker bus tours with pick-ups just a 30 second walk away on Stuart Street. There is also a 5th Floor terrace that is a nice place to sit after dinner and watch the night life below. The greeting from the desk staff was warm, friendly and sincere and we were in our suite at the earliest chance. Now I should say this hotel has some wonderful rooms that are out of our price range and these rooms were on the higher levels were views were unobstructed. Our room which was by no means inferior in quality and did have a pretty good view of the Ferry Building as well as the street but did leave the view a little lacking. The room itself was very tastefully done in a modern Feng Shui in colours of Pale Blue & Beige. The bathroom was tastefully done in similar soothing pallets. Dimmed lighting added a nice touch when a soothing quiet bath was needed. House-keeping was excellent and we always returned to a clean and fresh room. The mini bar was well stocked but as usual over-priced. We didn't eat at the Hotel due to special dietary needs, so for breakfast we ambled over to the market where we found a Gluten Free vendor that met our \"breakfast & lunch on the go\" needs. Peets Coffee was the place for a wicked cup of Joe to kick start your day, in our case we people watched while drinking our coffee. The smells that wafted through the market place every morning were intoxicating, from the fresh breads, cheeses, fish and every type of produce possible. In closing I have to say we did spend minimal time in the hotel because we were off sight seeing and doing the tourist thing but when we came back from a long busy day the staff were always smiling, the room was always clean and the beds were the most comforting and luxurious we have ever slept in.

Great price, too, somewhere around $175 a night. The room was absolutely beautiful, we were essentially in a corner room with windows on two sides- one of the sides looked onto a turf-covered terrace, connecting to another terrace on the next floor up which had lounge chairs and amazing views of the Ferry Building and the waterfront... we could see all the way to Alcatraz! Room had an iPod player, a nice TV, and a fantastic bathroom. The beds were outrageously comfortable. And the location! Our first night we could walk to the Giants game (about a mile down the Embarcadero--nice walk and seemed perfectly safe, lots of other people walking even on the way back to the hotel) and on Saturday morning we walked right across the street to the Ferry Building to the Farmer's Market and got breakfast there... I would not have missed this for the world, it was great fun. Walked to Union Square, to Chinatown, to North Beach, and very briefly to Fisherman's Wharf. Again, great location! We will definitely stay there again if we ever get to go back to San Francisco.

After a fantastic stay at the Four Seasons in Seattle, we had pretty high expectations for this next leg of our journey. My disappointment started from the moment we pulled up to unload our luggage. We were driving the classic \"mommy\" mini-van and had two kids in the back. There were three valet/bell staff in front engaged in conversation with one another that could not be bothered to open our doors or help with our luggage. After two requests from my friend that they assist (as I hauled the suitcases out of the minivan), we were finally helped. I had already unloaded all the bags. I asked if I \"had to\" check in if we were going sightseeing and they said that we needed to in order to leave the bags. I went to the front desk and gave our last name and they asked for my ID. I have a different last name from my husband and daughter (hardly uncommon these days I would think) and they told me that they could not check me in without my husband's \"permission.\" Thankfully they agreed to hold our luggage without us checking in and luckily my husband's meetings started later than originally anticipated so he came by to \"permit\" us in. I am just glad that I did not have a child that needed to nap or a diaper that needed changing. When we returned later in the day after a long day of sightseeing, I had the same lukewarm experience with the bell staff. The hotel room was beautiful, we had a fantastic view of the bay, ferry building, bridge, etc. The bed was not the most comfortable and my husband had a backache both mornings (he had been at the Four Seasons and Westin previously that both have great beds). The bath products were not replaced after the first night despite the fact that we had used 100% of the conditioner among three people.

We kept some of our luggage at the hotel while we went north for the week and when we came back we were greated like old friends.

I was most looking forward to this hotel based on the reviews and also the price I doled out to stay here (~$250/night). Upon arrival I was greeted by the modern lobby, as previously mentioned. The location was great as it was close to BART and also the Embarcadero so my commute time to points of interest was short. When checking in, I had to wait 30 minutes for 'my room' while other couples/VIP's who checked in after me were whisked away to their room immediately. I dismissed this as bad luck since it happens to all of us at one point or another during travel. Unfortunately, that was just the first negative experience.... The room I ended up getting was facing the 'garden' which was basically the bottom level of an astro-turf courtyard. So, despite my wait, I got to settle for one of the interior facing rooms with nothing to see :/. The room ended up being very simple and plain. That's not necessarily bad, but for 250 bucks I expected a decent view and at the very least decent amenities within the room. Not so much... The bed was decent and there was good lighting. Unfortunately, the room had a bizarre desk/mini-fridge combo that was literally 1 ft away from the 19\" wall mounted flat screen tv. While this may not seem bad, imagine trying to watch the game where you only have one seating option literally a foot away from the action. It was not ergonomic and it looked like they had designed the room with little thought to living there. The bathroom was well appointed (although it had little water pressure....3rd floor). They also had a nice set of terraces for people to sit on in order to enjoy the bay. In regards to customer service, this place did not project 'boutique hotel'. I ordered takeout (alot of great restaurants in the area) only to realize I didn't have any silverware. I called in to room service request silverware and a plate. It took 1 hour! After I saw my food going cold after 30 minutes I placed a follow up call and was rudely told that with +100 rooms that they couldn't tell me when I would receive my plate/fork. Unbelievable. To make matters worse, with a late flight out of SFO, I asked that they hold my luggage after checkout. I enjoyed the city during the day and came back and inquired if they could help me since I had to change before departure. The front desk would only offer me their bathroom in the lobby. I pleaded to use their spa/locker or even an empty room but they refused. So there I was in their lobby bathroom changing into a suit...Not exactly easy or hygienic. In closing, based on the price point, the poor room layout and the horrible service it leads me to believe this hotel is not worth it. I'm glad other patrons have had a positive experience so I'll leave you with this.... if you have to pay $250/night for a hotel room it should be a sure thing.

We selected it because of its amazing location right on the edge of the Bay next to the Bay Bridge and all of the amazing landmarks in that area such as the Ferry Building. We stayed in a fantastic Waterfront room with an amazing view from our sitting area right next to the window. The room came with a great bathroom and we loved the contemporary decor. The hotel provided us with some great ambient music CDs to play when we were relaxing in our beautiful room. Having said all of that, there are a few caveats: If you are staying on the waterfront side of the hotel the street noise from the Embarcadero and the hotel's restaurant (which was really good, incidentally) can be a bit much. My husband and I are light sleepers and on vacation we like to nap before having a late dinner. We found this a bit difficult as the Embarcadero tends to be favoured by motorcyclists and people with loud car stereos at around the time that we normally napped. Also, the room we stayed in had a great shower but lacked a bathtub. You have to book an Urban Studio or one of the suites to get a bathtub. After an open-air tour around the bay and over to the ocean cost of San Fran we came back to the hotel chilled to the bone one day and it would have been really great to have a nice hot tub at that moment, but this is a common complaint I have with contemporary hotels, who think that providing a big rainshower-type shower is fine. Maybe for most travelers this is OK but I can't go more than a few days without craving a nice bath! Overall this hotel was great.

We had a King room facing the Embarcadero / Bay / Ferry Building and the views out the windows were captivating. Especially being with our baby and not being able to get out and walk around the City as much as we used to it was very nice to be in the room and still feel part of the City by people watching out the windows and seeing the boats and barges come and go in the Bay. I had never really spent much time in this area of the City before but was impressed, much better than Union Square. We had nice walks along the Embarcadero, and ate great food from the market shop across the street at the Ferry Building. We ordered room service for some 'snacks' later in the evening and the service was prompt and food was fresh. Prices were reasonable from the restaurant downstairs and afterwards we wished we had ordered full dinner in. Every employee was very friendly and welcoming, everyone seemed to genuinely make us feel comfortable. And despite being a very busy weekend at the hotel we didn't run into any problems. We managed to have a very memorable weekend both romantic and fun (with our baby), we certainly want to go back for another stay. One tip if you are driving your own car would be to park in one of the public garages nearby, we paid $29 for a 24 hour period where the hotel valet services is $45.

The other concierges were helpful and knowledgable too. The Embarcadero location is terrific for walking, across the street from the Ferry Bldg. (yum) and close to great restaurants and shopping for tourists. BART and the Bay Bridge are right there, and I can't think of a better location to stay if you enjoy boutique hotels with style and substance. I lived in San Francisco, and there's no hotels in the Marina or Pacific Heights in this category. In fact there are really no good hotels in either neighborhood. SF is a compact city and easy to get around. But the proximity to everywhere you want to go is the best from the Embarcadero if you enjoy exploring the city, connecting to buses or bart and even exploring Mission Bay and the housing development there.

On arrival, the staff was friendly and professional; it remained so throughout our visit. Although we did not require extensive assistance from the concierge, he provided us very accurate and helpful information on getting around in the city. The hotel is in an ideal location for using San Francisco's excellent public transportation. In fact, one can get from the airport to the hotel (and back) very easily by using the BART and getting off at the Embarcadero Station. The price for this trip is merely $8.10 per person. The walk to the hotel from the BART station takes a little over 5 minutes. Across the street from the hotel is the Ferry Market Building which is a major hub for public transportation to all points in the city. You can buy a pass and get unlimited rides for $6.00 a day. (The passes are sold in the Ferry Market Building.) The hotel bills itself as a \"spa\" hotel and offers various services on its top floor. The prices are what one would expect for the same services in any major metropolitan area. We had reserved a slightly more expensive room with an \"ocean view\" and were not disappointed. The room was large enough to move to accommodate us, our luggage, and could have slept 2 more people on a sleeper sofa in the room. The bathroom was large but did not have a tub. Instead, it had a \"rain shower\" that was comfortable and efficient. At night, we initially had some concerns about the music playing downstairs, but all was quiet by around 10:00 p.m. The beds were very comfortable and the hotel is certainly not stingy about supplying pillows! The restaurant is a tad expensive. We did, however have breakfast there twice and, although there are cheaper places to eat, we must admit that the food was very good. Try the eggs scrambled with truffles - they are delicious. There is a small business center on the second floor of the hotel that has three computers with free internet access for guests. Very handy for checking email, reservations, etc. if you do not want to drag a laptop with you on your trip. The exterior of the hotel is not glamorous - but it is very functional and the staff at the front door very friendly and helpful. Obviously, this hotel cannot compete with the big guys in town as a major convention center, but it appears to work remarkably well for smaller business group meetings and seems to do a brisk business with business travelers. All in all, this was a pleasant surprise and a nice departure from \"industrial hotels\" such as the Hyatt and the Hilton. What I truly appreciate about this hotel is that it does not pretend to be anything but a pleasant and convenient place to live, relax, and perhaps get refreshed with its spa facilities while on a short visit to San Francisco.", "Date": "December 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, Decent Location, Beware the Noise\u201d", "Author": "JSNYCTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR50889239", "Content": "I checked into this hotel last week while on business.

All in, it was fine, but the noise (as others have pointed out) can be an issue. Upon check-in, I asked for a quiet room. They informed me they would do the best the could, but the hotel was sold out and were limited in what they could do. Fair enough. They ended up putting me on a low floor on the Mission Street side (not the noisy Embarcadero) and close to the elevator. Not ideal, but it was the best they could do. The problem simply is that it's noisy wherever you are. Even with double-paned windows on the side street (if you want to call Mission a side street), it's noisy. If I were there for pleasure, it would've been more of an issue. Unless you're up early for business (as I was), you might want to think twice.

All staff were friendly and helpful, and we made good use of the concierge for transport queries and other recommendations. The hotel is right next to the bay, on the edge of the financial district. 15 mins (mainly flat!) walk to Union Square. Start of cable car on Market St is just around the corner. Didn't eat at the hotel (or use the bar, which was always packed.) Only slight negatives were that although the room was on the 5th floor, it was noisy from very early (05.00 ish) in the morning, with road noise, trolley buses etc. Probably didn't wake me up, but made it difficult getting back to sleep. There was very limited cupboard / storage space in the room: no doubt loads of guests are just there for one or two nights, but I'm sure we weren't the first people to have stayed at the beginning of a 2 week trip, and wanting to unpack! Although a \"turndown\" service was mentioned , we didn't get this during our stay. We got a 3 day MUNI Pass (18$) which you can use on cable car, street cars, BART and the trolleybuses.

The port cochere where you enter the lobby is now home to 20 flies mating. I didn't enjoy waiting 10 minutes for the valet to get my car. But I really didn't enjoy listening to the remaining 2 valets (one of which seemed to be the lead) share stories about the hot girls they wanted to bed and showing each other pictures of these girls on their iPhones. There's a feeling like you'd better not touch anything in the room or else a charge would apply to your account....for instance, a personal oxygen can placed in the bathroom discreetly advises you that there will be a $16 charge. If you turn on the TV, you have to dig through the 7 major menu sections of pay content ($20 for a movie) before you can get out to the local news (last option on the menu) and I never did find CNN, MSNBC, or MTV...rooms don't seem to have full cable. And then there's the lovely matter of the small card folded discretely in the envelope with the extra room key which states that they are honored to charge your room account an extra dollar to support some local state funded/run park...unless you get down to the front desk and opt out of their scheme. Very sneaky, very tacky...and this on top of a nearly $300 per night rate. Felt very much like a poor person was nickle and diming me to death and that I should pay attention to every piece of written matter in my room lest I inadvertently miss a fee clause in my interaction with it and be levied a surcharge for not bringing my lawyer with me to protect me from the hotel's sad revenue generating sneakiness. This last bit with the $1 that you had to opt-out really ruined my sense that the hotel was a hospitality experience...felt like I was just there to be pumped. Also, don't get the Bay view rooms...they're mostly views of a building across the street and there's a 20-something's lounge on that whole side of the building whose music and drunken expense account partyers you can hear until 1AM. Vitale is located at one of the lowest elevations in San Fran...the sewer drains outside the building often smell of stale sewer. Unfortunately or coincidentally, my bathroom smelled of the same stale sewer, but this may have been a mold problem from the cutout in the glass shower wall intended for turning on the shower, which however also allows a good rain shower on the whole toilet by the end of your shower....go potty before you shower or you'll need to towel off again after using the toilet...which explains the funky smell in there.

It would be fair to say I know the area very well. I stayed at the Vitale a couple of times three years ago, once in an \"inner courtyard\" room (not so great) and once in a Superior King room overlooking the Embarcadero and bay (very nice). Happened to hit on an unbelieveable rate one day for the Panoramic Suite - nearly 40% off. The Panoramic Suite I would call \"the round room\". These rooms are on the corner of the hotel overlooking Embarcadero and the Bay Bridge, with the infamous bathtub in the bedroom itself. First off, I don't know how you can beat this location while visiting San Francisco unless you are big into shopping and the theater, in which case a room in the Union Square area would be better. The Vitale is right on Embarcadero, and about 1/4 of a block from the Ferry Building which is sort of our local temple of foodie worship. On Saturdays there is a large Farmer's Market as well. A room on the \"water\" side of the hotel makes for some pretty great people watching up and down Embarcadero. No television required. First the good - the room is large, spacious, with very tall ceilings and beautiful picture windows. One would not feel cramped here even after a four or five day stay. The bed is soft and very comfortable - linens luscious. The bathtub in the room, while a very simple tub without the fancy jets etc., is to DIE FOR. I walk by the Vitale all the time and wondered about the privacy issue and when you're up in the room looking out you realize .... no one's looking up from the street! No one cares - they are busy admiring the view of the bay. Once I got in the tub, I followed suit. As noted here in other reviews, shower in the bath is an overhead rainfall type with simple and clean partial glass enclosure. Very classy. Room service - blindingly fast. Breakfast arrived in under 15 minutes. Now the negatives. The noise from the street is pretty intense. Unless you're from NYC or live in the city, this might get to you after a while. This is NOT a quiet and peaceful location. Expect bus and intersection noise to be a factor as early as 6:00 a.m. There was no in room coffee, and I had to call room service for two wine glasses. The toilet was one of the water saver models and simply didn't work. I would stay at the Vitale again but next time would opt for a city view room or there's a side of the hotel that overlooks a small park.

I'll give you a quick summary. First, we booked the week of our stay, requesting a Deluxe City View, which is one step up from a standard room. Since we contacted the hotel directly by phone, we expressed our concerns about noise and they honored that request with a higher-up room facing south (which meant that we had a partial Bay View and could see some of the bridge). The rate was heavily discounted because of the season. After booking, we found a better rate on travelzoo.com and the hotel honored it. The front desk staff, both at check in, and the concierge, are totally on top of their game. At check in the manager on duty who handled our check-in noted our request for a quiet room and gave us the best thing he had, and we were pleased. During our stay, the concierge gave us great advice on nearly restaurants. The housekeeping service pays attention to small details. For example, we brought some bottled water, and they took the extra effort to put it on ice for us. The hotel is clean, modern and updated. It offers free wi-fi in the rooms (at a slower bit rate; faster datastreams cost $10). I'd say it's nicer than a W, but hip in a similar vein. There are multiple roof-top patios with great views -- don't miss them. Things to note: Request a higher floor to avoid noise. Bay View rooms are noisier due to the Embarcadero. City View Rooms don't have much view. Best option is to request north or south facing rooms. The bar is loud and very \"happening\". Don't expect a lot of big hotel amenities --- the gym is small, there is no pool, and there is no cafe (although there is a restaurant, and plenty of food at the Ferry Building across the street.) Parking is really tough in the area. The hotel charges $45 + tax, but you can find nearby garages for less (we kept our car at the Rincon Center a block away). Remember, parking meters start at 7am-6pm, M-Sat. Sunday is free. The Ferry Building across the street has lots to see and eat, but can be overwhelming on Saturdays.

Our flight was 8 hours late, so we arrived exhausted. At the front desk we asked if the room was quiet, and was assured that it was. Well, when we opened the door to the room, we were assalted by the bass from the bar downstairs...not even close to quiet. We called downstairs and they showed us a room in the back corner, where it was quiet, but dirty, broken closet doors. The third room we were shown was right on Mission street, and the valet assured us that it would be quite noisy in the morning. Choosing sleep, we opted for the quiet room. The next morning we asked for a better room and for $60 extra (making the room charge over $400) we were moved to a room on a higher floor, remarkably cleaner and with a great view of the Bay. Our take on this hotel is that if you pay the big dollars, the rooms are quiet and clean. If you choose a more inexpensive room, expect it to be noisy and not as clean as you would like it to be. San Francisco is very expensive, but there has to be a hotel where if you pay $300/night, you can expect a clean room and a good nights sleep. Unfortunately, Hotel Vitale is not it.

It's in all the guide books etc but just appears totally unfussy and just what you need in SF; relaxing, friendly, comfy. The location gets some stick but I think it's perfect. Firstly, getting there from the airport is so easy. You can of course take a cab but I would advise anyone travelling light or in a small group to take the BART from the Intl Airport to Embarcedaro station (then just 5mins walk down the hill). It's a fraction of the cost and takes just as long as a taxi. It's also at the far end of the Embarcadero from Fisherman's Wharf - meaning there is amazing walk along the bay (passed some great sites: Coit Tower and the Alcatraz departure quay) to the tourist hell (but a must!) that is FW. It's also smack across the street from the Ferry Building. This is a gem - worth getting up early (courtesy of jetlag) and wondering over to for coffee from Peets - while watching the commuters come of the ferries. That has to be one the single most enjoyable things to do. The Ferry Building also has some the best restaurants in the area (Taylors/Slanted Door) and of course the actual ferries to Tiburon etc. The hotel is at the bottom of the hill from SF proper (think Union Square, shops etc) but this is easy to solve via the cable car, street cars or a healthy walk up the hill (20mins?). So the actual hotel...is great. The rooms as large, super clean, soothing and quiet. There is some fuss made over the city and bay views. But to be honest how much time are you spending looking out of the window? We had a city view room - which actually meant staring at an empty office block. But if you want a view - they've got it. The bed was astonishingly comfy. The bathroom was stocked with Fresh toiletries which will forever evoke memories of SF. The only issue was with the bathroom door. A slider, with poor closure. So depending on who you are travelling with.....you may want to run the taps.... The facilities aren't extensive, but just enough to sort on-line check in (business centre) and run a few miles (gym) - but shouldn't you be walking everywhere? The terraces are a huge asset, over looking the bay and Ferry Building. Although when we did sit out on them, security came up and asked if we were staying at the hotel - is that a good thing? The vibe the hotel tries to creates one of serenity and calm; all lavender aromas and earth tones. It totally works. And after a days of sightseeing, walking and burning the credit card...the minute you step into the lift playing soothing music and images....it's all miles away. The staff leave you alone - unless you need them. Which is the only way it should be. One note, the inhouse restaurant (Americano) gets crazy...it's a hot ticket in SF. So if you want a quiet meal, or drink on the patio - head over to the FB.", "Date": "May 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glen Ellen, California", "Title": "\u201cFantastic, hip, special place!\u201d", "Author": "What_is_the_loon", "ReviewID": "UR16381181", "Content": "We stayed at the Hotel Vitale for the weekend, staying in a Panoramic Suite.

Yank Sing, the best Dim Sum in the City is around the corner. Again, the Ferry Plaza has incredible food too. The Slanted Door is infamous and Taylor's hamburgers are a must. Don't scoff, you must try one...Western Bacon Blue Ring is the best hangover cure around. There is a wine shop, cheese shop and a couple of deli style markets that are full time in the plaza. On the weekends, befitting to the epicurian loving locals that flood the market, these places are very busy. You don't need to get into the car during the day, everything is there within walking distance. At night, it is quiet, but it is easy to get a cab to go out to party if that is your scene. We arrived early Friday night and found the patio outside packed with the beautiful people. We assumed right away it was a private party. It ended up that it was just another Friday night at the stylin' bar downstairs. Cool... We didn't hang, but it would have been a great time forsure. We also didn't eat at the hotel restaurant, although the menu did look great. We did have fantastic, fast room service at three in the morning. We had massages together that were outstanding. Before that we did the outdoor bath that was nice. In hindsight though, we spent enough time in our amazing bathtub that we probably could have skipped it. The tub is on the rooftop and is completely private. It was very relaxing with killer strawberries, rose petals and a very relaxing atmosphere. The room was gorgeous. The bathtub is huge with amazing products. In the bathroom there is a dual shower, one with the rain showerhead and the other traditional. The toilet is in a separate private room.

Our room (a king size, bay view) featured soothing colors, natural materials, and even smelled good (not that usual stale hotel smell). The bed had a pristine, white duvet cover.

The hotel also has 2 roof decks for guest use and a fun restaurant in the lobby - it has an indoor lounge and outdoor terrace that seem to be extremely popular with young businesspeople.

The free internet service moved at a crawl, whether you were wireless or plugged in. There was also a paid option. But for the amount the room cost, and how little internet costs, they really should provide genuinely high speed connections for free (as they advertise).

We chose it for New Year's Eve specifically because it has a rooftop location overlooking the fireworks on the Embarcadero. We also chose it because we were travelling with 4 kids, and we needed 2 queen beds per room. Vitale fit the bill, plus it had good reviews. The bad: 1. Our check in did not go smoothly. We had asked for rooms near each other, if not connecting. When we arrived, the girl at the front desk was completely clueless, first telling us that nothing like that was available, snapping at me when I asked if we could upgrade to make it available, and finally giving us precisely what we had asked for and arranged for in advance. It was very odd. 2. To make matters worse, once our kids went to their room, they discovered that someone else was already in that room. Nice shock for our children. I tried calling from our room to tell them the problem, but no one answered the phone - twice. I then went down to the front desk to tell them, and there was no apology - again strange. Just a response that \"there must have been a computer glich.\" Duh. The kids ended up being on an entirely different floor from us - and no compensation for the aggravation, etc. 3. The rooms are SMALL!!!! The smallest on our California trip (we stayed in 5 different places). That might be standard for California, but the last time - many many moons ago - we stayed at the Clift and our room was enormous. So if you want roominess, you may want to look elsewhere. 4. Location was perfect for us, but may not work for most tourist's needs. It's right across from the Embarcadero and the market, which is fun. It's near the financial district, but it's not at all naer Union Square, etc. But we love walking, and we walked a ton. The good: 1. Other than that one person at check-in, service was very nice. They had a lot to deal with considering it was New Year's and the hotel was mobbed, as was the outside areas. They did a great job of keeping the hotel festive but not insane - e.g. noise had to stop by 1:00 a.m. 2. There is no better place from where to watch the fireworks. The roof was absolutely great, for teens and adults alike. 3. The rooms are very nice, beds are comfortable, finishes are nice (TV, faucets, etc.). 4. Valet parking was exremely prompt. 5.

I arrived at Oakland International and rode Bart to get to the hotel. I was checked into the room less than one hour after stepping off the plane. Bart cost $6.55 including the $3.00 for the bus transfer from airport to Colosseum Bart Station. The hotel was about three blocks from the Embarcadero Bart Station and is in a modern building. Walking in, the doorman opened the sturdy wooden front door for me and I found my self at the front desk. Check in took about 5 minutes. Halls were moderately dim but tastefully decorated. Rooms are well marked. I was in a King room on the 2nd floor (242) facing Steuart St. The room has commercial grade carpet, a long desk, one office chair, one lounge chair and the king bed. There is an in-room bar and snack tray with unmarked prices that I did not sample. The television is a flat panel above the desk and is about 24 inches with a standard remote and cable. There is a closet that had two bathrobes (soft linen, comfy). A small alcove hid the iron and ironing board. The internet access was both wired and wireless. Either choice was free, just agree to pay $0.00 online, and you were in with pretty speedy web access. I chose wired access as the wireless was unencrypted. There was a much appreciated row of power plugs at the desk level for computer, cell phone etc. The night stand had a stereo-clock radio-MP3-CD player with a docking station probably for an Ipod and a remote control. There was a selection of 5 CD's of music. It mysteriously came on twice by itself during my evening there and required a few minutes of twiddling to turn off. It was on when I came back from dinner, but that time probably from the turn-down service. The bed was comfortable with 4 enormous down pillows. The linens were fine, but the bed was curiously short sheeted--nothing that couldn't be remedied by undoing the meticulous job the maid did before my arrival. Towels were many in the bathroom that had a combination tub shower with shower curtain, sink with reasonably sized counter and toilet. The floor and walls were tiled. There was a can of 90% oxygen in the bathroom. The price for breaking the seal was $69.95! Walls and windows did not keep out the traffic noises either on the street or in the hallway, but I did not hear any neighbors. Twice after 10 PM, I heard trucks doing trash dumpster collecting. Both occasions were loud and lasted about 5-10 minutes. There was a small business center down the hall with three computer stations and a printer, no charge. The fitness center contained three or four machines with individual small TV's. Breakfast in the restaurant was quite good. The prices ranged from about $9 to $19. There was no free option. Check out was painless. My breakfast charge did not make it to the final bill by my checkout, but the clerk promised to email the final bill to me.

Our king bed was extremely comfortable and the room came with a flat screen tv/bose sound system and soothing cd's were left by the bed. There were two sets of Robes and slippers awaiting us and the turn down service at night always left a supply of complimentary water with chocolates on the pillow and an update of the next day's weather. The hotel had a media room with complimentary use of computers for the guests. There was always complimentary fresh coffee waiting for us in the lobby in the morning. The workout room was very clean and a nice size and we enjoyed massages at the spa. We enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant downstairs and their outdoor dining with the firepit was a nice touch. The location of the hotel to the ferry building and the sunrises from the balcony were fabulous. The concierge Jackie was extremely helpful in getting us into a romantic restaurant at the last minute and we have to give a special THANKS to Lucky Sanabria who took the time to notice the wine we were drinking at the \"Wine'd Down Hour\" that the hotel offered and sent a complimentary bottle to our room. This would have to be my favorite hotel and we travel a lot.

The room was spacious, extremely well kept and clean. Bathroom was large with GREAT amenities---all \"Fresh\" brand products. We loved the sleek decorations of the hotel and the lavender smell all thoughout. Hotel is in great area of san fran, lots of good restaurants are close by in walking distance which is nice. Great views of the bay bridge. We got couples massages which were amazing, probably the best massage I've ever gotten (and I've gotten alot). We also took advantage of the roof top deep soak tub which was a great experience. They decorated the tub with rose petals, candles, gave you hot tea/water/ chilled fruit and cucumbers. The hotel also has 2 other rooftop areas where you can go and hang out which is nice and open to the whole hotel. The only downside I would say is the valet ---- very slow in getting your car even when you call ahead the day before to put a request in.

Although I enjoyed the Fairmont, I was ready to experience something different for our 30th wedding anniversary, and the location of the hotel, more than anything else, intrigued me. And I am happy to report that the decision was a good one. Unlike myself who has visited San Francisco regularly over the past 28 years after living there for three years in the late 1970s, my husband had not been back since 1993. But even I was surprised at the transformation of the Embarcadero district. We loved the Port of San Francisco (POSF) Farmers' Market on Saturday morning and all the shops inside the POSF building. The morning coffee and a croissant on Saturday morning overlooking the bay and with a view of the Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge was priceless! There are many new restaurants in the area that are highly rated. Thursday night when we first arrived at the hotel, we were told that there was 1 to 1.5 hours wait at all these places so I recommend an advance reservation. The hotel is very new with clean, modern design. Liked the way it has the business center and fitness center on each floor. The view from our hotel room on the 2nd floor was beautiful. The clock tower of the POSF and a section of Bay Bridge were so close, I felt as if I could reach out and touch them. The turn down service was excellent and the Concierge was helpful with our dinner reservations. We walked from the hotel to Pier 39 and then to the Ghiradelli Square before riding a cable car into downtown.

This incident occurred on November 10, 2006. The hotel worker in question still works at Vitale, where he continues his racist behaviors towards Black guests under the support of Hotel managers. By Ngugi Wa Thiong'o I checked into Hotel Vitale on Thursday, 9th November in room 640. The following morning, Friday 10th, I went for a brunch and a walk at the water front and then came back into the hotel, at around 1pm, lunch time, took a newspaper, San Francisco Chronicle, at Concierge's desk and went into a nice porch in the Americano, the hotel's restraunt, where I sat and read while also enjoying a nice view of the ferry and waterfront from the window. I was all alone in the porch. A white man, about 5' 4\", dressed in a gray suit stood in front of me. \"This place is for guests of the hotel. You have to leave, \" he said. At first I was intrigued by his words: how did he arrive at the conclusion that I was Not a guest of the hotel? So I asked him: \"How do you know that I am not a guest of the hotel?\" \"You have to leave.

Are you staying at the hotel?'

What is your name?\" I now asked remembering that the man had not even identified himself. \"It is not necessary,\" He replied curtly. \"Just leave.\" \"This is sheer harassment. You find me reading a newspaper peacefully. You don't identify yourself. You don't ask if I am a guest. And you refuse to identify yourself. And now you afraid of going to the Reception desk? Why?

I also get there and ask the staff to check whether or not I was the occupant of room 640. Even before any of the aghast staff had said anything, the man had started apologizing. But I kept on asking him: How could he do what he did? Find me reading a newspaper that the Concierge had given me, and proceed with such emotional violence on my person? The lobby manager, a David (?) recognized me as the Random House guest, and started apologizing for the behaviour of the man, whom I assumed by now to be the Restaurant Manager, and who by then had had left the scene. No explanation about his conduct. The Lobby manager went to get the Hotel Manager who came down and apologized for what he termed as some misunderstanding. \"But it was not a misunderstanding,\" I said. \"I was quietly reading a newspaper when he accosted me.\" \"Okay, for his behaviour. David will get you a room,\" \"But I have got a room. Room 640. I checked in last night.\" \"Oh! I am sorry! Is there anything we can do to make up?\" \"You need to talk to your man, not me.\" \"Yes, I shall, but are you sure there is nothing we can do to make up? A massage? A whiskey?\" It was clear to me that even the Hotel Manager did not understand the depth of the emotional violence on me by a member of his staff.

Surprisingly EVERYONE WAS SATISFIED!! The location was absolutely perfect for getting around the Embarcadero on foot.

If it\u2019s raining or you just don\u2019t feel like straying too far from the comfort of the hotel, the on-site restaurant Americano is an excellent choice for great food, too. In fact rolling out of bed and grabbing a decent breakfast in the area is quite difficult so I would strongly recommend doing so at Americano. Just make sure you get there before they stop serving it (at 10:30AM). Americano is also a great location for lunch & dinner. Anyone looking to have an intimate conversation or trying to bring together a group of people should know that this place gets LOUD, crowded, and \u201csceney\u201d as the night gets going. Apparently reservations are strongly recommended too, as this is a quite the HIP LOCALE for locals as well. So don\u2019t be surprised to come down from your room on any given night and find a virtual night-club scene going on. And those who are waiting to get in tend to linger in the lobby. This was not a nuisance to me as a guest, but it could be to some. Also the noise didn\u2019t affect my stay there at all either, so no worries there. The room was beautiful\u2026 stunning really. Even the concave window added to the uniqueness of the room. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and the staff turned on soothing ambient music with the Turn-Down service each night, leaving a little quote or poem on our pillow. And now the reason I chose our Urban Studio room\u2026 THE DEEP SOAKING TUB! Wow! So worth the experience!

The staff were all helpful and incredibly courteous. I asked for a toothbrush, and they called me two minutes later to say the valet was outside my door but wouldn't knock because I had a \"do not disturb\" sign on the outside. I opened the door and found him with 2 toothbrushes. I stayed in one of the panoramic suites and found the room to be well appointed with a bit of a modern touch. I loved the rainfall shower and the bathroom in general, and the soaking tub is great for a romantic getaway (I've taken probably 3 baths in the last 10 years of my life, two of which were at Hotel Vitale).

Around 10 minutes after we got into our room, (the luggage was brought up immediately following), a bellhop arrived with a bottle of sparkling wine, glasses, a plate with strawberries, grapes, dates, a fresh apricot and apple and a card that said how much the hotel appreciated our staying there. We (of course!) drank and ate, and then wandered out to the ferry building and down the Embarcadero. We returned a few hours later to find a vase filled with fresh flowers, roses and stargazer lilies (I think...I'm no flower expert but they smell really good) and a handwritten hallmark card wishing us a happy anniversary and signed from the housekeeping staff. We felt incredibly well taken care of and are so impressed at how far everyone went out of their way to make us feel special.

The noise was disturbing, so we called downstairs to request a room on a higher floor. We were told that there were no other rooms similar to the one we had booked, but the front desk was suggesting that we take a room without a view and that we would be credited for the difference in price. We decided at that point that we did not want to stay at the hotel anyway....it just seemed like it might not fit our style.

As other reviewers have mentioned, there is quite the bar scene outside. And if you are young, single and beautiful, it's a great place to be. If you are older, tired and sleep lightly, a third floor room above the bar is a very bad idea. You can practically hear individual conversations, with the window closed and the drapes pulled. However, the front desk staff were very gracious and moved us to another room, on a higher floor. Kudo's to them. Unfortunately, we left behind a more deluxe bathroom, the waters given to us at turndown, one less chair and no paper in the morning. I guess they forgot they moved us. I can't help but wonder how often people request a move from the third or fourth floors. To be fair, it was a Thursday night and the weather had been absolutely beautiful. However, hotel staff told us that this happens every Thursday/Friday/Saturday night. If you are going to stay here and you want a deluxe water view room, ask for a room above the 5th floor.

There we enjoyed fresh roasted coffee, breakfast pastries and sights of all kinds of interesting products. December was amazing ...

We had travelled from fiji to Auckland, sat in Auckland airport all day then had a 12 hour flight to San Francisco. We breezed through US immigration and our cases were there as we approached the carousel. Outside a cab was ready to take us to the Vitale, we arrived there within an hour of touching down, to be greated by a member of staff who clearly had more important customers than us, she simply told us that our room wasn't ready and that nothing could be guarenteed before 3.00pm, it was currently 12.30. After a long journey I expected a better welcome, afterall the hotel know which flight you're on and when to expect you. For a hotel which is aspiring to great things this attitude is something fundamental which needs to be addressed. In a country which is well known for it's customer focussed service we were a bit disappointed to be greeted by this attitude. I asked if we could wait with a drink in reception, the answer was no! Luckily another staff member intervened and, although he didn't tell us anything different his manner was more acceptable. We were offered a room a the 4th floor or, an hour later, our room on the 7th floor would ready, we waited the extra hour in the bar. Room was ok, a partial bridge view although I was expecting a habour front room, it was comfortable enough and the bed linen was excellent, the room wasn't as big as I was expecting either. After a long day we opted for room service in the evening which was very good. We ate in the Americano on our last evening which was buzzing with an afterwork crowd, the restuarant too was busy, the wine list was good and the food was very good. We ate in One Market the evening before and to be honest even though it is more expensive would probably opt to eat there again rather than the Americano, there's nothing wrong with the Americano just that One Market just gave that little bit more for your Dollar. We would stay there again as the hotel, bar and restuarant are all very good lively places, it's just a shame that in the last place of our Honeymoon we were greeted by such an abrasive staff member, maybe she should look for a career which isn't customer facing.", "Date": "January 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cPerfect!\u201d", "Author": "dasbar", "ReviewID": "UR6571187", "Content": "Stayed at the Vitale with my husband for 5 nights over the New Year period and loved it!

On New Year's Eve a bottle of champagne was put in everyone's room (a nice touch!!). It was also my birthday and there was a cake waiting in the room on arrival! The room we were allocated was fairly small (though this wasn't a problem for us) but the bathroom was large. Tastefully decorated and very clean.

We decided on staying at Hotel Vitale since my parents had stayed there and were really treated well on a prior trip to SF. We booked four rooms for the entire weekend far in advance for the trip. The hotel is very chic and has a great atmosphere, but after checking in we realized that we were put in rooms that looked onto another fold in the building directly next to the entire air conditioning unit for the hotel. We were unsure about whether we would need an additional room for our stay and at check-in the receptionists mentioned that it would be easy to book another room. However when we asked whether any other rooms were available with a better view, we were told that the hotel was completely full. As my entire family was arriving at different times, we figured that we would check back when everyone arrived to see if the hotel was able to accomodate our request. When my parents arrived, the hotel checked them into one of the rooms we had already checked in to and noted that it would be impossible to switch any of the rooms. After finally checking into all the rooms and a little more convincing, the hotel was able to locate nicer rooms for our stay. Despite the hassle, it was nice to switch rooms. All in all, the hotel is very nice, with a pretty hip bar connected to the lobby. The hotel is in perfect location to check out the Ferry building, walk to Union Square, or explore Chinatown. The rooms are nice and the beds are extremely comfortable. Additionally, the hotel has a very relaxed feeling and the staff is extremely polite. Without the headache upon check in my entire family enjoyed the stay. The only other issue was the bellman's insistance that we take a hotel car instead of hailing a cab. We needed two cabs and we only going about 10 blocks, but the bellman seemed hesitant to hailing a cab with the sedans parked in the entrance way. The best offer the cars could manage was $20 per car. After hailing our own cabs, the fare was $6. There seemed to be some collusion between the hotel and the car company.

My partner and I decided to stay in the city for her birthday, and I wanted to find a hotel that wasn't the standard cookie-cutter major-chain type (although I am a rewards member of many). I don't even remember how I landed on the Hotel Vitale site, but I was instantly hooked. Reason: The Ferry Building. If you are a foodie, you KNOW already you're going to SF, you KNOW where you want to be on a Saturday morning, and this hotel is right across the street, poised in perfect striking distance. So I browsed the site, and was amazed that this little hidden gem was to be found. I booked one of the better rooms with a TERRIFIC view (room 606) and spa shower, and took the plunge with an open mind and high hopes. The Hotel Vitale did not disappoint. From the moment we got there, the modern elegance of the property was wonderful. My partner was a little recalcitrant at first (as she put it, she could not think of a hotel that, on first sight, was LESS \"her type\") but when we got to the room... I had advised the hotel that it was my partner's birthday. When we got in (very late Fri night), there awaited a bottle of champagne on ice...and not Cook's or something cheap, either! It was a very impressive bottle of Chandon Brut. accompanied by a personalized card for me from the manager, as well as a personalized card for my partner (from the housekeeping staff at turndown). We were worried about the minbar, because we intended to purchase food at the farmer's market/Ferry Building on Sat, and nosh on it throughout the weekend. Not to worry -- the minibar was NOT one of those electronic-sensor ones that charges your room if you just breathe on something...we were able to remove items to make room for our purchases, and then replace them when we were done. Housekeeping seemed to dig this immediately, as nothing was moved or touched in that regard. We ended up purchasing a lot of nibbles at the farmer's market/ ferry building, and spent one night watching in-room movies while having a luxurious feast in a room that did it justice. These superior rooms do have a closet type armoire with a couple of drawers, as well as a small curtained off area for the ironing board and iron. The closet included two robes, and two COMPLIMENTARY pairs of slippers. Our bellman quickly rustled up two additional suitcase racks and set them up, so space was not a problem. The window-seat couch had a cashmere throw, and the bedding --- well, it was the best sleep of our lives, and I didn't want to leave... We received a card inviting us to a free yoga session if we so desired. There are complimentary \"Fresh\" toiletries as well as overpriced 'honor bar' ones, which didn't impress us enough to try them. The in-room honor bar also includes Dean & Deluca treats, Scharffenberger chocolates, airplane booze, etc., and a clever \"intimacy kit\" package of *ahem* items in case you forgot something... They will give you either the NY Times, SF Chronicle or both, if you just ask. The papers arrive in a clever canvas sack hanging on your door daily. If you're worried about clanging maid carts or ice machines, forget it. This hotel is very retro euro-styled, in that you call down to the front desk for ice. The hotel is QUIET. We were overlooking the Embarcadero, right over the outdoor bar area, and noise never bothered us even late-night. We WERE able to open our windows to some degree. The concierge was wonderful. If you ask, he will give you a canvas hotel logo shopping bag for your purchases at the ferry building. Something people haven't mentioned -- go around the back corner from the hotel bar, and you're at an F-line trolley stop, which gets you on board before the huddled masses at the Embarcadero/Ferry building sites. So if you are using the F-line, it is literally door-to-door service, you need to walk maybe 1/2 block. We did not dine at Americano, but enjoyed several drinks outdoors. We did not use the spa, but the rooftop space looks wonderful. This hotel is not by any real means kid-friendly in and of itself, but they do have a nice kid's program for family travelers called \"Kids are VIP\", where the child will have a personalized ID card on a lanyard given to him/her on check-in, and the child is the one who handles all the check-in procedures, and they will make a kid feel special and important. I think the ONLY con about this hotel is that there are no bathtubs in the super-deluxe view rooms (you have to go to the highest-end room for that). I am a shower fiend (and the spa shower is GREAT but can be slippery after product use-- they do not have stall mats) and was quite happy with the rainforest-style shower. Would I go again?

This was our first trip to SF. We are both 48 years young and live in Denver. Overall we had a very good experience at the Vitale. Plusses - The hotel was very quiet. There were rare execeptions, such as the reving of a motorcycle on the Embarcadero at midnight, or a room service cart being tipped-over, but these exceptions were very few and far between. The rooms on either side of us were occupied during our stay, and we never heard any noise from our neighbors. We never heard any \"normal\" traffic from the Embarcadero (or Market or Mission streets). Being new, the hotel was also very clean. As most reviewers have noted, the beds are extremely comfortable. The room thermostat worked efficiently. The computer room on the second floor had three computers, all of which were connected to a printer. VERY fast internet connection. I visited the computer room several times and there was always at least one available machine. Maid service seemed to visit the room twice per day. LOCATION! We loved the location on the Embarcadero. The Ferry Building is right across the street, and many restaurants are also within a block or two. TIP: for those wanting a cheap but good breakfast, there is a food court in the office building directly south of the hotel, across Steuart Street. We ate breakfast at Yes Burger and Malts (yes (no pun), they serve breakfast until 10:30am). However, this food court is closed on the weekend. Another Tip: some of the restaurants in this area, and in the Financial District, are closed on Sunday. Plan accordingly. The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful. The hotel offers a limo service to SFO for $45. Our taxi ride from SFO was $42. Question: do they offer this limo service from SFO to the hotel? This might be a good question to ask before arriving, as the limo was obviously much more comfortable than the taxi, for about the same price. The view from our room was as advertised: the Bay Bridge, the bay, and the Ferry Building were all right there. The Bay Bridge, lit at night, was quite nice. I did not want to close the drapes at night. That being said, the drapes when closed do block out all light. There are plenty of electical outlets just above the desk. Very handy for cell phone chargers and laptops. Minuses - As previous reviewers have noted, there are no dressers or other drawers in the room. Only a closet (approx 3-feet wide), but with plenty of hangers. (There is a small drawer below the closet.) One must definitely live out of one's suitcase. Other comments - The roof-top areas at this hotel are amazing. I did not see too many guests using it, and we under-utilized it. Besides tables and chairs, they have propane heating devices on the roof areas to keep one warm and, as above, the views are quite nice. I suspect a hotel employee would be best to start one of the propane heaters. I wish we had taken advantage and used the roof more, and the heaters at least once. The windows in the rooms cannot be opened. The mini-bar and sale of toiletries have been comment on by other reviewers. While silly and overpriced, this was a non-issue to us. We never opened the mini-bar. The plasma TV was quite nice. Besides the usual local channels, ESPN, CNN, Fox, USA, TBS, TNT, etc, there were pay-per-view movies available, including first-run and adult themes.... \"Free\" tolitries included the standard shampoo, lotion, etc. There was a hair dryer in the bathroom (located in a bag underneath the sink). Check-out time is noon. We asked for and received a 1:00 check out. We did not visit the Americano Restaurant. On weekday evenings it seemed to be very crowded. I have read and heard they do good business from the fincancial district crowd after work days. This seems to be true. The chimes on the Ferry Building clock tower begin ringing at 8:00am, and every thirty minutes thereafter. I understand there is complimentary coffee in the lobby at certain times, but I did not even bother. Each morning I walked across the street to the Ferry Building and went to Peet's Coffee. This short walk was also very enjoyable; seeing the city come to life. The aforementioned food court also has several places to buy coffee. This is a pricey hotel, but the plusses, especially the location, make it worth the price, in our opinion. We noted hordes of tourists in the Union Square and Wharf areas. To not have to deal constantly with these crowds seems to be worth any premium. We enjoyed out stay and would gladly return to the Vitale.", "Date": "August 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "latham ny", "Title": "\u201cForm and Function and function loses\u201d", "Author": "FAMILY44444", "ReviewID": "UR5562863", "Content": "Not bad, but not geat either. I basically agree with the post from 8/2, but I reach a different conclusion: the hotel definately is a cut above the norm, but its just not practical. Theres no coffee in the room, for example, and the coffee in the lobby was out 3 of the 5 times i wanted a cup (between 7 and 8). The ice bucket is edgy, but about one third the size of the normal plastic one you get everywhere else. For this price, the place should have a frige and not require us to empty the honor bar to store milk and water (in addition to the lack of coffee, theres also no continental breakfast). On the positive side, the location is great. While its not AT anything, its close to everything. All of San Franciscos transportation (BART, streetcar, cablecars, and buses -- good luck figuring it out!) come together at Market and Embarcad.ero, so is very easy to get anywhere. We didn't rent a car, and that seemed to be the right decision -- getting around on public transit was easy and fun.

When making the reservation, I mentioned to the hotel that this was a very special birthday celebration. They delivered free of charge, a bottle of champagne, plus a small Scharfenberger cake and birthday card to our room both nights. What a nice surprise! The staff was very friendly, attentive, and responsive. Pricey, yes, but for those special occasions, well worth it when compared with other high end places in SF. We felt very pampered and well taken care of. The only complaint I have is about the service at the Americano cafe in the hotel. We went there for breakfast and the food was very good, but service was slow and indifferent - a big change from the hotel staff. We decided not to go back since there are so many great restaurants in walking distance from the hotel.

Waking up to the view (assuming you had the remote control, electric blinds open) was a treat. Weather was SF classic. The rooms are contemporary but comfortable--we both slept well. The perks like Bose CD player and Ipod dock (Bose), flat screen TV (with HD), rainforest shower head are super. Room service was very good and prompt and brunch at the restaurant was good. Plenty of food at Ferry Building across the street as well. Apparently, hotel restaurant is real hang out on Friday nights but settled down at reasonable hour. I agree with other comments. While their room service coffee is very good, I would prefer the convenience and savings of in room coffee. I also agree, a little too much marketing given the room rate--bath amenities, room service coffee, etc. However, a wonderfully relaxing and comforable weekend with attentive staff.

I chose Vitale after reading reviews and getting personal recommendations from other Trip Advisor members. For those planning a trip ANYWHERE, remember that there are \"Local Experts\" available on the forums who can give you personalized recommendations based on what type of trip you are going on, be it a business trip, shopping adventure, romantic get-away or family vacation. My needs and wants may not be the same as yours so use this website to it's fullest extent! That said, here is a rundown of our vacation: We arrived at Vitale in one piece after a hair-raising shuttle van ride from the airport and were greeted warmly by the bellman, Stephen. He took care of our numerous HEAVY suitcases while we made our way to the front desk. The check-in process went smoothly and everyone was very polite and attentive. Stephen escorted us to our room on the fourth floor. I neglected to write down the room number (411 maybe?) but as you exit the elevators, it is right in front of you to the right of the corner room. It was a \"partial water view\" facing Mission St. One of the first things you notice upon exiting the elevators is the fresh lemony smell. As another reviewer mentioned, it does not have the usual \"hotel smell\" and the entire hotel is non-smoking. Stephen brought our luggage in and showed us around the room. At first glance we felt it was a rather small room but when you consider the premium on space in SF I would guess that it was average sized. It actually came to feel very cozy when we would come back from a long day of sightseeing. And after all, it's not like we were spending much time in the room! A reviewer from a while back commented on the lack of storage space and I was afraid that might be an issue but we found the corner closet and the wardrobe with a deep drawer underneath to be more than adequate for 3 days worth of clothing for 2. As most everyone has said, the bed was fabulously comfortable. The flat screen TV mounted on the wall keeps from using up precious space. At first I was disappointed that \"partial water view\" means that if you look straight out the window you DO NOT see water. However, when lying in bed or lounging on the chaise by the window, you have a great view of the Bay Bridge. I spent an hour or so just sitting there watching the traffic on the bridge and even spent a rainy afternoon writing out Christmas cards while looking out at the Bay. The bathroom was nicely appointed but again is not enormous. We would have liked to peek into a room with a \"rainforest shower\" to see if they are bigger but never did ask. The complimentary soap and shampoo are lemony and are so good that I stashed each day's refills in my bag for future travels. I was tempted to try the additional items offered for sale but they were too pricey for me. The nightstands are cool and you get a CD player/alarm clock combo. At turndown housekeeping put on a mellow, jazzy Christmas CD that we enjoyed returning to. Other nice touches are the complimentary slippers that you get to take home to remember your stay, decadent bathrobes (sorry they are not free but are available for purchase) and bottles of water and a weather forecast left at turndown. Another small but appreciated touch was a light in the shower. Some showers feel so dark! Every time we passed through the lobby, Stephen greeted us warmly by name, making us feel like true guests instead of just a number. The hotel has a courtesy car which will bring you anywhere within a mile of the hotel but be aware that you must find your own way back. Oh, and the Vitale's driver is NOT your typical SF driver! He was courteous and drove sanely. We left for dinner one rainy evening and the valet gave us loaner umbrellas. Be sure to check out the rooftop patio areas both during the day and at night. Unfortunately for us, a front passed through while we were there so it was too cool and windy to stay out there for long. There is also a small business center on the second floor where you can get on the internet. Back to the public transportation issue, the F-line trolley stop (takes you to Fisherman's Wharf) is just behind Vitale and the BART station is a short walk up Market so you can get just about anywhere once you know the routes. Being from a small Southern town we were not familiar with public transportation but a friendly native gave us the basics. We did not eat at the hotel restaurant, choosing instead to try some of the \"Bests\" while in SF. Check out my reviews of Yank Sing, Scoma's and John's Grill for details of these amazing establishments! We did the obligatory Alcatraz tour which was pretty cool and spent a bit of time browsing the shops at Pier 39. For us, the location was superb. After seeing the Fisherman's Wharf area, I'm glad we decided not to stay there. It may be close to the action but it was just too \"touristy\". Since our travel goal was sightseeing and not shopping we had no desire to go to Union Square. The only negatives I can think of are, as mentioned by other guests, no in-room coffeemaker (and the coffee in the lobby goes fast!) and the high valet fee. We rented a car Sat evening to drive to Tahoe Sunday and had to park it overnight. Again, I know there is a lack of space in SF so even parking is a premium but $46 per night seems extremely high. The only other problem was that Vitale set such a high standard that the hotels in Tahoe and Reno seemed like dumps by comparison! We would like to visit SF again one summer and can\u2019t imagine staying anywhere else but Hotel Vitale!", "Date": "July 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, New York", "Title": "\u201cRussian Roulette\u201d", "Author": "john23", "ReviewID": "UR5464259", "Content": "I booked a lengthy stay and requested a quiet room.

This went on all night. After 2 sleepless nights, I complained. The management said I could move but that \"check in is at 3pm\". They knew the problem right away--the room was next to electrical equipment and the elevator. They knew exactly what they were doing when they put me there. I have to think it was because I purchased through Expedia, because when I confirmed the reservation they said \"Oh, I see you used Expedia.\" Anyway, most of the rooms abut the Embarcadero, which is a six lane highway. This is not a quiet hotel. The room service is limited and expensive. A simple order of a 16 oz. container of coffee is $19--after mandatory tip, service charges and tax. There is almost no storage space--no drawers for clothing, just some hanging space. The neighborhood is the financial district, which is dead on the weekend.

They said it was \"policy\" - stated no where - because room service \"is supposed to be exclusive.\" After explaning not being intrigued by anything on the room menu, being really tired and promising NOT to do this again, they let me take my dinner); lighting in the closet area is very limited (forgive me, maybe some tap lights?); reception desk VERY efficient but not welcoming (compared to a sleek W hotel, where staff is as efficient + outstandingly friendly); if you're a TV person, location of the flat screen is akward - odd angel from bed & RIGHT above the work station (couldn't have on for a noise distriction as it's right in your face). I would return, this was a unique experience in a not-too-touristy area. The bar at the restaurant was hopping, & had an excellent $6 glass of pinot grigio. Now that I know \"the rules,\" perhaps that won't cloud my impression. I reviewed a number of SF restaurants. My fav was BluePointe.

When Reception discovered we were on our honeymoon they immediately offered us a complimentary bottle of Champagne.

Somehow, by the time we got up to our room a chilled bottle of Champage and a box of liqueur chocolates were waiting for us - which made us feel very special indeed.

He explained that the hotel was fully booked for that night, but promised that he would provide us with a room with a view for our final night.

The energy of the financial district is felt every morning as the town comes to life. Wonderful little coffee shops and restaurants for breakfast right across the street in the Ferry building. On Saturday morning a Farmers Market occurs here which is not to be missed. We found the staff and personnel at the Hotel to be \" World Class \" in every detail. I can't for the life of me figure out why this hotel doesn't get more press as it is truly one of the best kept secrets in S.F. Easy access to the Wharf via the F line right in front of hotel. $1.50 and 10 minutes and you're right down in the heart of the action but just far enough away not to be plagued by the tourist trap hotels and all the commotion that goes with them. We took several of the guided tours through Gray Line with pick up provided at the front door of the hotel each morning by Gray line. Not to be missed are the Napa - Sonoma wine country tour and the Monterey - Carmel tour. Do yourself a favor and take the city tour combined with Muir Woods and Sausalito. When you get to Sausalito, leave the bus and have a nice dinner in Sausalito ( Scomas restaurant on the water is our personal favorite ) and take the ferry back over to San Francisco ( brings you back to the Ferry Building right across the street from the Vitale ). I promise you that it will be something you will remember forever. For that really special dinner one night we highly recommend the Cliff House restaurant. Make a reservation as it's way across town ( $ 22.50 cab ride each way ) on the other shore, but you will not believe the setting or the quality of the food. They have a web-site which will give you a peek at what we mean. Outstanding !! I recommend an early reservation as you will want to take a lot of photos here while it's light out. Be sure to make a point of getting over to Ghiradelli Square and having one or two of their delighfully sinful Hot Fudge sundaes and see how chocolate is actually made. The Franciscan Inn at Pier 41 serves a whole Dungeness crab for dinner that is to die for !!! Right next door is the Boudin bakery which offers a tour of how sour dough bread is made and also has great food for lunch.

Problem solved and though it involved some time and back and forth discussion, the staff remained friendly and eager to make us happy. By the way, the views of the Bay and the Bay Bridge were spectacular at night. Our first evening we had dinner at the Slanted Door restaurant right across the street in the Ferry Building. We had tried to secure a reservation on our own more than two weeks in advance, but were unable to do so. A quick call the hotel concierge and we promptly had reservations there within 15 minutes of the time we requested. Good job! The next morning we took the F Trolley to Pier 39. The trolley stop is directly on the north side of the hotel. Cost was $1.50 per person. After seeing the sea lions, we took a ferry out to Alcatraz. You must reserve tickets well in advance (in our case, we did this two months in advance) at the BlueGold Fleet website. Lunch at Ghiradelli Square overlooking the water, The Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz was quite lovely. Then on to the the obligatory cable car ride (after an hour long wait). Walked through Union Square and then back to the hotel through Chinatown. Dinner that evening was at Hawthorne Lane (quite good), a short 15 minute walk from the hotel. We ate twice in the hotel's restaurant, breakfast both times. A bit on the pricey side, but the food was well prepared and the wait staff was very attentive. In the evenings, the bar is a very lively gathering spot, not only for hotel guests, but for a dialed up crowd of young professionals. The morning of our departure, the hotel arranged to have their towncar transport us and all our baggage to a corporate Hertz location way the heck on the other side of town (we were going on to Napa and wanted to head out over the Golden Gate Bridge which is why we chose this location). It almost seemed as if we were having a private car tour as we went up and down and all around numerous San Francisco neighborhoods before being deposited directly in front of our destination. Total cost - $30 plus tip. Hard to beat that. All in all, we really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Vitale. Great location with beautiful views, sleek contemporary look to all the public areas and well-appointed rooms and bathrooms. I do agree with one reviewer's note about lack of drawer and closet space, but as we were only there two short nights, we managed quite well right out of our suitcases with little inconvenience. Every staff member was eager to please and we were always greeted promptly with a smile.

After walking around a bustling city all day, we looked forward to returning to the hotel. The lobby, elevators and room were peaceful and calming. The terraces were extremely nice - we watched the Blue Angels from one. We booked on Expedia had a Deluxe City View room. We ended up with a handicapped room which was fine with us - large shower instead of a tub in the spacious bathroom. The room was very nice with luxurious touches like a flat screen tv, cd player, superior bed & bedding, excellent desk chair, wireless internet, etc. However, like others, we noticed the lack of drawer space in the room & surfaces in the bathroom to hang the nice robe and to put our toiletries on. The closet was not big enough to store our clothes and the suitcases together. Luckily most of our clothes were hanging anyway so it wasn't that inconvenient. We were in town for a wedding and returned at 1am the morning to find our toilet was not working properly. Housekeeping came up and could not fix it, so we were moved (fairly quickly) to another room to sleep. We definitely preferred the city view room to the superior room. Our toilet was fixed the next morning. Be prepared for steep charges on room service (18% + $3 delivery charge and 8.5% TAX). The restaurant is very good but also pricey - we spent $100 in two days for breakfast. During the week, there are plenty of deli's, etc nearby to get breakfast on Mission.

Overall, we had a pretty good experience. There were a couple of snags though - first, I had called the morning before our arrival and notified the staff that it was my husband's birthday. I asked that a bottle of champagne be placed in our room in advance of our arrival. When we checked in we were given a handicapped accessible room (neither of us are handicapped). The room would be nice for someone who was handicapped, but for us it just wasn't comforable. The bathroom was awkwardly arranged- the shower consisted of a shower spout and drain on the floor (no tub or even a shower stall). This is not what I call romantic. Additionally, the sink was set significantly lower to accomodate wheelchairs (not particularly comfortable for those not in wheelchairs). More importantly, the champagne was not in the room. My husband called the front desk and told them the room was not acceptable. The clerk said they would send someone up to our room to collect our bags and move us to another room. We waited 20 plus minutes before someone met us to give us the keys to our new room. This was not pleasant given we had just arrived on a late flight from NYC (we were tired and jet lagged). It also kind of killed the romantic surprise I had planned for my husband. The room they gave us was nice and the champagne was waiting for us, but we weren't given a room with a view. I would have thought given the problems at check-in they would have upgraded our room. In any event, our overall stay was pleasant. The hotel is in a great location (right on the Embacadero and near the Ferry Building). The hotel also has a decent gym and also offers free passes to the YMCA located a block away. Room service was quite tasty and the staff was fairly friendly. However, we encountered one other problem during our stay. The night before our check-out I placed my heels outside of the room for the complimentary overnight shoe shine. Unfortunately, the shoes were not returned to me the next day. I didn't realize it until two days later when I was going out for an upscale dinner in the wine country. As it turns out the hotel staff said they did not return the shoes to us because we had the privacy tag on our door on the morning of our check-out. I'm not sure why they didn't leave the shoes outside of our room or take them to the front desk to give to us at check-out, but nonetheless after a brief negotiation, the hotel agreed to overnight Fed-Ex the shoes to our hotel in Sonoma. They arrived without incident. I would recommend this hotel to others but with the caveat of asking for a room with a view and ensuring it's not the handicapped accesible room. Also, make sure to pick up your shoes before you check-out. One last piece of advice, Visa has a deal that if you pay with your Visa card, you get 20% off the room rate.

It is located in a beautiful new section of town on Embarcadero and Mission, by Pier 1 and directly across the street from the historic Ferry Building (BTW - every Saturday there is a wonderful Farmers Market there where you can enjoy simply amazing fresh produce, flowers, herbs and food). The hotel is designed using the principles of simplicity, functionality and beauty. Everything is exactly as it should be... Very \"Feng Shui\". The beds are super comfortable (down comforters/pillows and silky sheets), the furniture is beautiful, functional, artfully crafted and simple. The rooms have wonderfully comfortable robes and slippers in the closet. The showers were awesome, as were the complimentary SugarBath products. Our room also had a plasma/lcd flat screen TV at the foot of our bed. The views from the high rooms on the bay side of the hotel are fabulous. We stayed on the 8th (top) floor and had a panoramic view of the Bay Bridge and the sunrise. Awesome to wake up to... Many (if not all) of the floors have terraces that you can go and sit out on to overlook the city. The hallways always had fresh flowers and candles for ambience. As far as the hotel bar/restaurant, we had a drink there and enjoyed it. The staff was quite courteous and were very attentive. I will also note that if you are looking for a \"scene\" the hotel bar could be it. After work the bar gets a good crowd, which is nice. By the way, one of the top 10 restaurants in the city (\"Boulevard\") is also directly across the street from the hotel. We had a great meal there. The hotel's proximity to everything is good. You have the SF buses 1 block away, light rail on the corner, limo service directly from the hotel and cable cars around the corner. If you like to walk, Fishermans Wharf (pier 39) is a 20 minute walk along the bay (a nice walk). A note about SF - This is a nice area to stay in - close proximity without the crowds (and everything that goes along with that) of staying directly on the wharf. The wharf is super-commercial. I prefer really being one with the city as opposed to being part of all of the tourist traps. Then I am free to enjoy some peace as well. My wife and I have stayed at many hotels, and we would absolutely not hesitate to recommed this one. We had a wonderful stay and were really bummed when vacation was over.

Its strongest advantage is its location on the corner of Mission and the Embarcadero, which gives easy access to central SF as well as the harbour. Close to the Bay Bridge, it sits opposite the Ferry Terminal, with wonderfully airy views across to the water if you get one of the appropriate rooms. The roof terraces offer some spectacular views of the surrounding area (see photos), but no shade is provided for the seating areas up there. The tramway departs alongside the hotel - downtown one way, Fisherman's Wharf the other - and it is a short stroll to the California-Van Ness cable car route. The Ferry Building itself is a great nearby resource for fresh foodstuffs and a variety of meals and snacks \u2013 but it does not open until 10am most mornings - as well as the ferry to Sausalito. The Embarcadero Centre is a useful nearby shopping mall. ROOMS The modest exterior of the hotel has been the subject of architectural debate, but it is pleasant enough. The hotel lobby is somewhat cavernous and lacking in character, but the reception staff are young, bright and friendly. The bedrooms are modern and comfortable, with some stylish fittings. The artwork ranges, disappointingly, from the rather twee to the harshly modern. The flatscreen TV is a bonus, but we did not encounter the DVD player or IPod dock enjoyed by other reviewers (fortunately we brought our own). The bathrobes, slippers, and bathroom products are exceptional. Wardrobe space is rather limited, but the turndown service is well up to US preoccupations with this (for us) obscure ritual. Room service was impeccable and the housekeeping team a total delight. OTHER SERVICES The spa service is terrific but rather limited. Contra another reviewer, the massage (from Sharon) was the best ever. The restaurant provides food of high quality, drawing upon the resources of the Farmers\u2019 Market at the Ferry Terminal. We were deterred from evening dining by the noisy bar scene, but there are excellent restaurants a few yards away such as Boulevard, Shanghai 1930, and Slanted Door.

Also, when I called to order room service, and when I got my wake up call, they called me by the wrong last name (after complaining several times, I eventually just got used to it). My dry cleaning which was picked up at 8am was supposed to be back by 7pm the same night, unfortunately they \"forgot\" about it and had to overnight it for me. A staff member showed up at my door with milk and coffee which I had supposedly ordered (I didn't). When the service does fall through - they make a very vailiant effort to correct the problem, which I respect. But - there shouldn't be SO many problems. And, it's not just my dumb luck - I've talked to several other colleagues who have stayed at this hotel who have had issues.

A brand-new Joie de Vivre Hotel in San Francisco. -- What a refreshing experience! The atmosphere is naturally sophisticated and cozy. Urban yet natural. It's a boutique hotel with deluxe full services. --An A+ on my list! This place has a privileged and unique location, right across form the new Ferry Building ( where the new Farmer's Market is ) on the Embarcadero Area. A five minute cab ride from Union Square, ( the shopping district ). Their water front rooms and circular suites have unbeatable views of the water and the Bay Bridge. ( You can actually see three San Francisco landmarks from their terraces! ) Their restaurant \"Americano\" is innovative, delicious and fresh. Very California, very San Francisco! We loved the ambiance of the bar and the crowd. It was refreshing to stay in a place that feels very San Francisco, but in a very unique and refreshing way. If you stay for more than one night and want to try other restaurants, the famous and established \"Boulevard\" is right across the street, and having lunch at the Ferry Building is a must!

We have always had great experiences with the hotels run by Joie de Vivre Hospitality, so we decided to give the new Hotel Vitale a try. Because the hotel was offering specials for its grand opening, we decided to splurge on a Deluxe Waterfront King Room, which was $259 for the night (normally $309). We were checked in fairly quickly, but unfortunately did not get a room on one of the higher floors, which would have afforded more expansive views of the water and Bay Bridge. As with other JDV hotels, the room was of a smart design with the most comfortable bed and bedding you could imagine. The room was smaller than I had imagined but adequate, and I was disappointed to find no bathtub. The room description online indicated that the bathroom was a \"spa style\" bathroom with a \"rain\" shower head. The rain shower head was great, but I expected there would be a tub as well. The other downside of the room was the traffic noise that could be heard from the street. The obvious trade off of facing the busy Embarcadero St. is the view of the bay, etc., but light sleepers might be annoyed by the traffic noise. The Embarcadero typically quiets down in the late evening hours, but the occasional bus and truck could be heard throughout the night. My favorite part of the hotel (besides the incredible bed) was its location. If I were a tourist, I would prefer this location right across the street from the Ferry Building as opposed to those hotels found in Union Square. It's easy to get to either Union Square or Fisherman's Wharf from this hotel via various forms of mass transportation or simply by walking if you don't mind a 20 to 30 minute walk. There are numerous fine dining restaurants within the immediate vicinity of the hotel, including Boulevard....one of the city's best restaurants. And if you're a baseball fan, it's conveniently located within a mile of SBC park. Overall, I would recommend this hotel if you can afford it. The service from the staff was excellent....quick to respond when you need it; invisible when you don't.", "Date": "April 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNothing Spectacular\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3351517", "Content": "I have to say, I was not terribly impressed with the Hotel Vitale by any means. We've definitely experienced worse, but by no means do I think this place is anything spectacular - or worthy of four stars. If you're just looking for a reasonably clean hotel, and aren't looking for 4 Seasons level service - this place should fit the bill. If you want some more dirt, read on... Decor alone - high marks for sure. Great linens, and overall comfy, understated elegance. Nice touch was the lavendar sprigs they put on each door for bedtime. Location - across from the Embarcadero and all was great, but overall it is a pretty desolate area on the weekends with no where in walking distance to grab a coffee, etc. Overall, from a service standpoint, I think it was marginal at best and bound to slide more if this is just the honeymoon phase... We booked for Friday and Saturday night (4/8 and 4/9). My husband had called ahead the day before we had arrived and requested a cot for our 11 year old daughter. The person he spoke with indicated it would not be a problem and told him to mention it upon check-in. We checked in around 8:30pm on Friday and mentioned the cot to the reception desk. They had indicated it would not be a problem and would be arranged by the time we returned from dinner. We got back to the hotel at 11:30 - exhausted and ready to hit the hay, suprise - no cot! Because we were so exhausted and because we're really not complainers, we decided to squeeze into the king bed - which I have to say, was quite comfy with great linens, duvet, etc. We opted not to park our rental car at the hotel - just under $50 a day or so (there is a parking garage about a block away for 1/2 that)- and instead took cabs. Never once was there someone ready and waiting to hail a cab as you would come to expect from 4 star hotel. Day 2 - we returned to our hotel (having spent the entire day sightseeing, shopping, etc) at 10:30pm only to have our keys not work. Having read the other review where somone's room was given to someone else, I have to say, we were a little concerned. We went back down to reception, got our new keys (no sincere apologies or explanation) and got back into our room - luckily, all our stuff was there! Day 3 - we waited in line to check out (because they had incorrectly billed us for valet parking which we'd passed on) for about 15 minutes. The best part is the people at the desk were answering phones and accepting reservations while they were trying to check people out. On a Sunday morning, I cannot for the life of my understand how they would be busying themselves with reservations while there are people trying to check out!", "Date": "April 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Encino, California", "Title": "\u201cI'm picky, but this place was great\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3337317", "Content": "I left after a terrible experience at a hotel down the street and found this great hotel.
