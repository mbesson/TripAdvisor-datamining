I wish I would have driven a little further. The people that work there are the rudest I have encountered in the Hotel business. The non-smoking room smelled like someone just finished smoking a pack. They charged me a higher price than they told me on the phone. Their bedding made me itch. The location is no good either. There is nothing to walk to except the park.

We've been doing it for 2 years. We used to live in the city and feel it's a real gem for it's location and price. It's sometimes noisy but it's obvious since it's on a busy street  next to a bus stop. The best thing is that we've gotten to know the manager  his wife.

I recently spent 5 nights at this hotel, and after reading the reviews on this website, I had pretty low expectations. If it wasn't for the price and the fact that it's the only location within walking distance from my relatives, I would have skipped it, but I'm glad I didn't. From the moment I checked in, I was pleasantly surprised by the hospitality of the staff. I arrived early and the man at the desk went up to have the maids finish my room immediately. It was clean, comfortable, and I never needed anything. Even my relatives commented on how they wanted to stay there instead of their own homes!The staff is also very diligent about keeping up a positive image, which I appreciated. For example, my sister had acciendtally taken my room key, and I told her to drop it off at the front desk until I got back, which she did. Later she tried to pick it up again so that she could get some things she had left in my room the night before, and they wouldn't return it to her because a) she was not listed as staying in the room and b) she had her boyfriend with her, and as I was told when I came in a few hours later for the key, they don't run that kind of hotel. I know I was happy to hear that they are strict about their policies. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone needing a cheap, clean place to stay. It's not Ritz Carlton, but it definitely does its job well!", "Date": "Apr 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR915028442", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "dimples83"}, {"Content": "Horrible I have a three month old and was walking with her in a baby carrier when the belt harness suddenly came loose. I stepped inside the office of the motel to ask the woman if I could put my baby down on her chair while I fixed the carrier. She told me I couldn't and it wasn't her job to help me out. When I said I hope she doesn't do business like this, she swore at me. I couldn't believe it!

Before making the reservation, I called the motel directly to inquire about room availability since this weekend is Fleet Week - quite a busy time. Was told there was availability, but the price quoted was higher than the online price. Decided to go with the online price (which was discounted because it required paying in advance). Completed the booking within minutes of speaking with the motel reservation agent. Upon returning from work on Tuesday, I had received a message from the motel that they were overbooked. When I spoke to the motel's agent, he explained that they could transfer our reservation to another motel, the Presidio Inn and Suites, about 5 miles away. Initially, I appreciated the effort to help, but when I checked Trip Advisor for reviews, there was nothing above a 1 on the first page of reviews, and a 2 overall. It was also too far away from where we needed to be. I became worried about a bait and switch tactic, so I called the agent again and let him know that The Presidio Inn would not work for us. I explained the situation... that I had called the motel before booking to make sure there was availability and that the overbooking situation had apparently occurred after my reservation, and asked if there was anything he could do. He said he would check with the hotel desk person and call me back the following day.... didn't happen, so I called the online booking agency and cancelled through them on Wednesday. The motel rep I had been speaking with finally called me back Friday and said he needed to know if we were keeping our reservation at the Presidio Inn.... 2 days after I had cancelled the reservation with the booking agency. Beware - communication between the online reservation agency and The Geary Parkway is sorely lacking, and paid in advance does not guarantee your reservation at this establishment. You may find yourself without accommodations, as we are. I am waiting to see if my bank card account is reimbursed.", "Date": "Oct 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR924510627", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "TinkandBotangle"}, {"Content": "Spotless!!! convenient This was the cleanest hotel I've ever stayed in.
