About a 15 min walk to the Musee d'orsay. This a very central hotel. A great tip if you are taking the Eurostar into Paris. You must have a taxi reserved because you can't get a taxi unless you call one for love nor money. The taxi lines are horrible. Oh and Gare du Nord is a seedy area. Keep a tight eye on your belongings at all times. from Gare du Nord a taxi is only about 25 euros with a tip etc. But do beware of gypsies while walking around Paris. We weren't dressed like tourists and we got approached 2 times with the brass \"Gold\" ring. Just walk away. Back to the hotel check-in was friendly , our room was 101 and it was larger than we expected it to be for such a small hotel. There is a closet with a safe when you first open the door to your room then you go through another small door to your bedroom. there's a desk, minifridge, and tv (the only english channels are Fashion TV, BBC and Stocks/finances) There is amazing air conditioning a lifesaver during the 40 degree heat wave. It was very quiet except for the Garbage pick-up in the early morning but that was it. The toilet is separate from the shower and sink which is a very good idea but that is French plumbing. The room was very clean and the decor was old world French but it was all brand new. For breakfast we just went to the little bakery 4 doors down from the hotel and It's amazing and cheap and they also sell fruit and salad, quiche, pastries, bread chocolate etc. but you must try the broiche swisse freshly baked in the morning. It tastes amazing but you more than burn it off while walking around all day. For a dining experience all it's own I highly recommend Guy Savoy which is amazing food and service and Chez Flottes on the rue cambon for an excellent roast chicken and order the giant bowl of vegetables. Laduree macarons are amazing. I love the Salted caramel so much. My favourite department store was Le Bon Marche because it was much quieter and not filled with tourists. Also don't attempt to go to Versailles in the summer because it is a nightmare!!! a fire trap waiting to happen!!!

There was no problem booking the room online. Upon arriving at the hotel we were greeted by name; a truly charming way to begin the visit and were directed to our room via the Euro-tiny elevator.

Overall, I enjoyed my stay, though it was not perfect. Good: Location, staff Not so good: small rooms, no other facilities, price, noise I paid an average of 179 Euro (about USD $240) per night in April 2009. I had three nights at 203 Euro, and three more (I think Saturday, Sunday, and Monday) at 155 Euro per night. I would not classify this hotel as a bargain by any means, but considering the location and Paris hotel rates, the tariff is certainly not too far out of line. Were I not addicted to TripAdvisor, I would likely have never considered this property. The Relais Ste Honore is a nice, tiny hotel in a nigh-perfect location. The staff (of which I never saw more than two at once, and most often one) was quite helpful, and were just as pleased to speak in English as to haltingly converse in my bad French. I think perhaps this is the best-located hotel in which I've ever stayed. Many major tourist sights are quite near. The Place Concorde, Tuileries Gardens, Louvre, Orangerie, and Musee D'Orsay are literally a few minutes walk, and places like Ile de La Cite and Place de L'Opera are not much further. The Metro (Tuileries stop, Line 1) is moments away as well. There are many restaurants, cafes, brasseries, and bars nearby. Paris tip: In a cafe or bar, order and pay for your drinks at the bar as table service will run quite a bit more for the same drinks. Watch out for bottled water prices; order \"d'eau en carafe\" for fine-tasting tap water. The hotel is small. The rooms are small, the lobby is small, the elevator is small, and the hallways are very small. As it happens, those areas comprise the entirety of the property. This hotel has no restaurant, no fitness center, no breakfast room, and (worst) no bar. I'm not complaining, as mostly I don't care about that stuff much (except the bar, of course); I just want to be clear and set the proper expectations. A room service breafast is available (I did not partake) for I think 13 Euros, and needs to be requested the night before. The hotel has complimentary wi-fi access in the lobby, but as others have noted, there is an open wi-fi network called \"THOMSEN\" that I was able to hook into and use at my leisure in room. Of course, that could change at any time. I saw a computer in the lobby, and I presume it's for guest use although I did not ask about it, nor see anyone ever using it. The room (I had 302-fourth floor) was small, but did not feel overly cramped (well, once I moved one of the chairs out of the way, anyway). The wardrobe was just large enough to hold my bags, but more than a couple of bags would present a problem. Though cute, the room is rather plain (probably better that way, considering the size), with the best feature being the painted wooden beams in the ceiling. The wardrobe was a little beaten up, but not too bad, and the room was clean. There was a strong perfume smell in the room when I checked in, but I aired it out and let the desk know, and did not have the problem again. The bathroom is actually of good size, with nice hot water and good water pressure. The separate water closet is also decently-sized. I wish the bars of soap had been larger, though. The minibar (it's kind of in the way, unfortunately) is decently-stocked, and priced in I thought a fair manner. But better, there is a small grocery across the street for stocking the minibar or having a snack or drink in the room. There is a TV, and it has a few English channels (CNN, SKY I think, but I turned it on only once). I was disturbed several times by noise. My room overlooked the side street (Rue Soutirade, I think). The restaurant's patrons congregated and conversed beneath my window, and there also was some loud music playing until quite late on a couple of evenings. Closing the windows helped, but not by much. But the windows couldn't help the noise of garbage pickup, or of the little grocery setting up shop for the day. After hearing this for a few days, I accomodated and was only woken up for a few minutes each day before nodding off again. These sounds should not present a problem for early risers. I also was disturbed by noise in the minuscule hallway (from housekeeping, the hallway telephone, and an odd elevator squeak) and water flowing through my neighbor's pipes. I didn't complain to the staff simply because I could not see what they could do for me, and overall, the disturbances tended to be short in duration, and even though I was disturbed by noise, it was not a stay-ruining experience.", "Date": "April 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWonderful and Charming, The Perfect Choice for a Special Stay\u201d", "Author": "lovetotravel1704", "ReviewID": "UR28377286", "Content": "We stayed at Le Relais Saint-Honore for 4 nights in a double room from Wednesday 15 to Sunday 19 April 2009.

The room layout is...different, with the toilet on one side of the room and the bathroom on the other? The reception staff noted when we left in the mroning and then instructed housekeeping to clean the room which was nice knowing that we would not be disturbed early on in the day. There is no resaturant/breakfast room but the hotel offers a room service breakfast. we chose not to have this and went out for breakfast at one of the many cafes and tabac's. A coffee, orange juice, croissant and toast is not bad in this part of the city for 9 euros? The hotel is in a great location in the heart of the 1er Arr, a stones throw from the Louvre, Jardin des Tuilleries etc.. and a short walk from the river and the 5/6 Arr on the south bank. The metro is nearby, although we walked most places. The lobby/reception area has a nice comfy sofa which the receptionist was more than happy to let us chill out on for half an hour on our day of departure - despite checking out earlier in the day - before the journey to the airport. The only minor issue is that there was a bit of noise (flowing water noise) from a down pipe in the wall cavity at one point during the night. A bit of a disturbance to the nights sleep, but nothing to make our Parisian experience a bad one!!

The beds were very comfy and the flat-screened TV gave us access to a few English (and other language) channels. We stayed facing a side street and we never heard outside noise unless we opened the windows. It took some time getting used to having the toilet in a room separate from the sink and shower. The lobby was small but inviting and had an internet ready computer, which was great for double-checking airport and attraction information. The elevator was small, but given that my mother and I packed lightly, maneuvering in it and in our hotel room was trouble-free. We ordered the breakfast on the first day, one of each type plus drinks (which cost additional). My mother really enjoyed breakfast in bed, particularly, given that the food was presented on pretty china. But, we opted to stock-up on breakfast and snack foods at the store across the street and the bakery two doors down in order to have extra cash to splurge on other meals and items.

This was the third of three hotels we stayed at during this trip. The hotel was very charming and clean. My husband and I were comfortable with the size of this room, there was plenty of storage for our luggage. There was a good sized closet so we could unpack everything we had. There is a safe in the room if needed. They even supplied robes and slippers. The toilet was in one small room and the shower and sink were in another room. This was not an issue for us. I felt the shower/sink room was a good size. If you are a larger person then the room with the toilet might be a little tight for you. The bed was comfortable and daily cleaning service was very detailed oriented. The room as nicely decorated and the area was quiet at night. My favorite thing about this hotel was the location, it was minutes from the Louve, Tullerie Garden, & the Seine. We were also able to walk to Notre Dame and the Mus\u00c3\u00a9e d'Orsay. This might be far for some people but we also walked to the Catacombs, which was worth the walk. Although when you exit the Catacombs it is a little confusing to where you ended up, so you will want to take a taxi back to the hotel. There is a small grocery store across from the hotel so you can stock up on snacks and drinks. There are shops all around this area and we felt safe walking around in the evening. There were very good restaurants in all directions. One thing that was annoying at times was you could hear people coming up & down the steps from our room. That could be a little noisy from time to time. We had room 301. Everyone at the front desk were wonderful and helpful people. They were so polite, informative and even helped with our luggage.
