I paid a lot more for the room just having an ensuite, I was on the ground floor, spent the night being woken by the insanely loud thump thump of people coming and going on the stairs, talking and opening doors. Babies crying, even someone unzipping their bag. In the morning I was informed I was unable to check out a day early, after explaining my dissatisfaction. I came to Amsterdam to relax, not to be involved in a hostel situation, which can be achieved for a fraction if the price elsewhere. The tv was tiny, and up high, just like at hospitals, the room is tiny, the shower is cold and uninviting, after braving the stoney floored shower, which was a significant extra codt not to have to share, the hot water woukd not run, the wifi has to be constantly re accessed with passwords, decor is beyond dated, and the bed is horrendous. Extremely disappointed, and this has ruined my short trip over.

She was extremely pleasant and helpful. I arrived via train way before the check in time. She told me I could store my luggage in the luggage room till check in time, especially if I wanted to go sightseeing and not waste my time. I asked her if there was a bathroom I could use to freshen up and she told me, YES by all means it is on the 2nd floor. I was sooooo happy. There was a shower there that I could use and feel new and refreshed after a long train ride. What a nice lady no wonder she has such a great business. Also, there was a gent there at the reception named Sunjay and he was one of the most friendly polite desk clerks I have ever met in my life. He arranged my taxi to the airport as well as gave me the best tips for the attractions. He also helped me use the internet. A very kind man he was. The breakfast room was bright, clean and very roomy. They had about 3 ladies working in there making sure everything was in good order. The rooms were extremely small and the beds were very old and no bed frames they were on the floor and when you sat on the bed it was very lumpy and uncomfortable. However, the shower and the sink in the room was good. Also it is on a nice street so you can open the window and get fresh air. The BEST thing about the hotel was that it had an elevator in good working order and it has a neat and clean curb appeal. Also near the bus line and a nice park.; I felt very safe in the area. Other than the uncomfortable bed the place was nice. Although there is a very high step to get into the place they should have an extra step there so you dont have to step up so high.but this is part of being in Amsterdam, goes with the territory. The owner and her staff do a great job and I would go back there just because of the customer service I got from everyone there. I got lost in the city and when I called for directions back to the hotel they gave me excellent directions. Maybe by the next time I go they will have new mattresses in the rooms. All in all a great stay and a very safe and secure property I would reccommend this to travelers on a tight budget.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swindon, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat place\u201d", "Author": "Mame21", "ReviewID": "UR124964208", "Content": "Stayed at the hotel for two nights with a large party of girls.

There was a sign at the front desk offering a late check out for 8 euros, we booked in for this, check out was at 11am, and we paid until 12. At 11am a man opened our door, without knocking, my friend and I were only in our underwear, and screamed that we were late checking out. From our bed, shocked, we said we had paid for a late check out, the man wouldn't leave the room for at least 10 minutes, it was awful. We obviously got straight up after he left and started to pack our bags, at 12 on the dot he again opened our door without knocking and said we had to leave very aggressively, my friend asked why he was being so rude and he told him to [...] off?!

The grout in the shower creeped me out and it had a cheap plastic curtain from the Bates Motel. We were on the ground floor with walk-out sliding doors and floor to ceiling windows which would have been nice had we spent any time there during the day but they did not have light blocking curtains so you were awakened by the sun very early. They only had duvets on the beds so your choice was to sweat under the duvet or be too cold without the duvet, no top sheets. There was a door in our room that we assumed led to an adjoining room that was locked from the other side. Wrong!! One morning we were awoken early by housekeeping, a man, asking us, three single women in our pajamas, if he could come through and get to the other room (turned out to be storage) so he could get linens! No clock/alarm in the room. On the positive side the breakfast was included in the room rate and was quite good. The breakfast room was very pleasant. Make sure you get the breakfast included when you make you arrangements or else it is not included and you will have to pay for it or go elsewhere.

I did a lot of research and was surprised at how pricey a simple B&B was - but I didn't want to stay somewhere unsafe/sketchy just to pay less money either. Eventually I came across the Asterisk through Trip Advisor and decided that it sounded okay for the price. Overall I enjoyed the Asterisk - it is a no-frills hotel, and I stayed in the no-frills budget rooms in the annex building located a couple of doors over from the main building. The check-in service was great and prompt, and everyone was really nice and friendly. We went back a few times to ask questions and they were relatively helpful, although we couldn't figure out how to use the trams (legally) and they weren't much help in that department. Be warned that you are expected to pay for your room as soon as you walk in the door! The rooms aren't particularly huge, nor are they decorated. The budget rooms have a sink in your room which is nice, plus a shared bathroom between 4 rooms - but I never once ran across someone else using the bathroom so that wasn't a problem. I believe there is a breakfast buffet of some sort but it wasn't clearly spelled out as to whether it was free or cost 10 euros so we skipped it. In terms of complaints, I had a couple. The staircase leading up to the rooms in the annex building really was insane. I thought people were exaggerating about its narrowness, but no - it was almost like climbing a ladder. I had fun with it - but if you're older or have difficulty with stairs this is probably a scary prospect. Also, to get into my room you had to get into it by entering through another door which led to two different room doors (mine and another). All 3 of these doors were INSANELY loud and squeaky - luckily neither of us seemed to come in very late so we didn't get woken up in the middle of the night. The pros to this place - the location is really nice. It's quiet and peaceful, and right by a few of the attractions including the (fun) Heinekin Museum, The Rijksmuseum, and the Van Gogh Museum. Really though, Amsterdam is an extremely walkable town. If you've never been, I'd recommend the 12 euro shuttle, but once you're a bit more familiar with the town you'll find walking (or shuttling) to Central Station and taking a train is way cheaper and more efficient. Also, you happen to be right near the Pancake Carousel - which I highly recommend. The Poffertjes are the best!

The only downsides I had with my experience there was the fact that two buildings down from Hotel Asterisk there is some very noisy construction going on. The jack hammers and chainsaws started around 7:30 am and continued through out the day. If I wasn't on holiday this of course wouldn't be an issue but it's nice to sleep in on occasion, right? Other than this the single room that I stayed in was very clean but had a dormitory-esque feel to it. Nothing flashy, just the basics.

Our room was in a building a couple of doors up the street, which was a little obscure but not a problem. The hotel itself is situated just outside the centre of the city, but it is only a short walk into central Amsterdam.

The hotel is divided into 2 building, the main building has a lift, but the one we stayed in didnt. Tthe stairs were the steepest ive ever seen, dangerous in fact! I'm asmathic and we were staying on the 2nd floor and each time i climbed it i nearly coughed up a lung!, the stairs are difficult to climb and to bring luggage up and down. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the rooms are serviced daily.Rooms are clean but we booked a double room and we got a room with 2 single beds pushed side by side, with very bad mattress' that never stayed on the bed.Above our room we had an apartment and could here the going on's of the residents, ie showers been taken, walking across the floor and even the going on;s in the bedroom which i really didnt wanna hear!!! Trams near by bring u to the dam square and other local attractions. The strip of tickets can be bought cheaply from the hotel reception. Breakfast was decent typical dutch food, meat, bread, cheese, cereal and fruit. I had booked the hotel through my travel agent but if i had the choice i wouldnt stay there again unless i was guaranteed to be in the building with the lift!!!

The breakfast facilities are good and as the area is away from the touristy Dam Square, you can get food nearby at reasonale prices. Van Woustraat contains many cheap places to eat. There is a wonderful market nearby on Albert Cuypstraat. There is only one other hotel on the same street, the rest is residential. There are very few cars at night.

Since we wouldn't be spending much time in the room, we looked for something not too expensive. We also wanted a room close to the museums so we could go to one before checking out in the morning. Our room was relatively large and clean. There were a few chairs, a table, a desk, and storage furniture to put your clothes away. The windows were large, could be opened, and afforded a view of the courtyard. The room was quiet and equipped with a television and telephone. Ours was called a deluxe, twin room. The \"twin\" refers to the two twin beds pushed together. The \"deluxe\" part probably referred to the room's large size and the shower (I think some rooms had only a tub.) The room was basic -- nothing fancy or attractive. The walls were cement-like -- reminiscent of those in dorm rooms. The mattresses were not very firm, but O.K. for one night. The sheets were heavy and smelled fresh. The bathroom was immaculate with well-working fixtures and nice tile. There was complimentary soap, shampoo, and shower gel. There was good security. (A card had to be used for the outside door, a door to the area of our floor that the room was in, and the room's door.) The breakfast room was very attractive. The breakfast was typically Dutch -- nothing special (cereals, breads, cheese, and meats), but the coffee was good. The staff was very helpful and friendly. A plus for this hotel was its use of the Connexxion hotel shuttle service, which is very convenient, and though it seems pricey, saves money and/or aggravation when compared to cab/train or tram/train. The person at the desk booked our return ride when we checked in and printed out a confirmation on the computer printer. Our ride to the hotel was the typical hotel shuttle ride with other travelers stopping at other hotels, but the ride to the airport was a private luxury van ride with a friendly, talkative driver. Another plus was proximity to the museums and the canal bus. My main complaint was that we stayed in the annex, which smelled of smoke, as did our room. I am not sure whether there are designated non-smoking rooms (Amsterdam has many smokers.)

The rooms are on the small side, but this is fairly common in Amsterdam. Even with the small size they had ample closet space, and good table/shelf space. If you pay with cash breakfast is included. Breakfast is mainly breads and rolls, butter, cheese, lunch meat, coffee and juice. It wasn't the best breakfast and we started skipping the hotel food and going out into the city after the second or third day.
