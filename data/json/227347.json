A friend of mine and I decided to go to Key West for a long weekend on a whim and I booked this hotel as a rewards stay because it was one of the few available that did not have bed bug reports. WOW, what a nice surprise. We stayed in a two bedroom king suite and it was amazing! True, it is a Travelodge and a little bit older property and could use a little maintenance and some paint, but the rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. Our suite was HUGE with two bedrooms with separate baths, living room with tv, two patios (one facing the gulf and one facing Key West), full kitchen and washer and dryer. The appliances were a little older and beat up, but they worked just fine. We stayed here for three nights and then were checking out to go to a \"nicer\" hotel for the rest of our trip and I have to admit we didn't want to leave the Travelodge! It's a little far from Key West, but the pool and hot tub are great, parking is free and the view of the gulf is fantastic. The staff was so amazingly friendly - especially since I was staying on a rewards stay and not paying, I have been treated really rudely by other Wyndam chain hotels in the past when staying on a rewards stay.

We really did not mind what part of the island we stayed at. We used Priceline and spent $80 a night. The hotel is located on the far end of the island (near the bridge to Stock Island). It is only a 15 minute scooter drive or maybe 10 minute car ride to the \"action\" part of Key West. We didn't mind though. If you are looking to be in an area where you are only biking or walking, I wouldn't recommend here. We had a scooter so to us, it did not matter. You are very close to grocery stores and the chain stores from the Travelodge. The staff, especially Erin (manager) and Ann-Marie are super friendly. We originally had a bit of trouble in our original room. Nothing too major, but I called the front desk and both Erin and Ann-Marie were more than accommodating and understanding! We were upgraded to a suite since they did not have any other rooms left. Both rooms were very clean and had all of the necessities you need (hairdryer, iron, safe, bath and body works shampoos/soaps). The economy room had a bed, tv, nightstand, table and chair. These rooms do not have views of the ocean. The suite was just great! We couldn't have been more pleased! Our ocean view room had a full washer/dryer, oven, refrigerator, microwave...etc with all of the items you would need (like dishes, silverware...etc). It had a bedroom, many closets, kitchen, dining area, and bathroom. We were very pleased. The pool area at the hotel lacked anything fancy. I found that it needed to be cleaned more than it was. It was very warm and also had a hot tub. Continental breakfast was nice and was included. It is a small area and can get busy though. It included your basic items like cereal, apples, oatmeal, pastries, muffins, bagels, coffee, juices, and a waffle maker. It was overall very nice and clean. The lobby included a computer you could use for free, however, it was old and could not open a lot of webpages. The elevator at the hotel was probably one of the slower elevators I have experienced. This is somewhat annoying! Overall, I would recommend this hotel. Especially if you are familiar with the island! For the suite, I would give it 5 stars.

We picked this hotel simply because it had appeared on Expedia at a discounted rate whilst we were up in Fort Lauderdale the day before we left to head down there. Key West is expensive (relative to the Florida mainland) for hotels, so the Travelodge suddenly became excellent value and gained our custom. They were resurfacing the car park when we were there, so parking was limited (and this may have been why they were offering the discounted rate), but for the three nights we stayed, parking wasn't a problem. The room was nothing special; small and functional describes it well. Then again, what are you looking for? We were just wanting somewhere to put our heads down at night - we were out every day sightseeing, so function was more important than form. It was also clean, which is something I do think is important. Breakfast was not substantial, but it was free, and it'll keep you going for a few hours. As pointed out on an earlier review, the elevator has no AC. That's true, and it was also glass and fixed to the outside of the hotel which didn't help to keep the climate down. But then we didn't spend much time in the elevator! The hotel is quite a way from the main attractions of Key West, and walking to Duvall Street is not really an option. That said, I thought that was a good thing. It can get quite noisy in that part of town at night.

We were not to pleased about this as the main street was right outside and we felt like there would be constant traffic noise. We asked if there were any others available on the 4th floor, the highest, but they only have suites on second and third. The third floor suites were not ready to check in but we opt to wait, since we only had time to kill. I must say by the time that we got back, our suite was ready and I was pleasantly surprised. We stayed in #305. I probably would have liked something a little more centered but this was still a nice view. There is a large patio from the living room to the bedroom. However, I must say even being on the 3rd floor the patio doors are so thin that you do pick up alot of traffic noise. The room was very spacious and well done. You had a full size kitchen with washer & dryer, a dining area, living room. I really liked the seperation of the bedroom, vanity and bathroom. Plenty of closet space, you really could just live there. My only minor complaint is that they need to update their coffee machine, as it only makes one cup at a time. For a room that large, there most likely will be more than one person staying there. The fridge was a household size and they provided dishes for cooking. We found the continental breakfast just okay. The pool was a nice size, well kept and the jacuzzi was hot with large towels to dry off with. I have ten years of hotel experience and I must say that this could be a very nice property and I see that they were making improvements. However, they need to start with their front desk staff afterall, first impressions are lasting impressions. I did not see anyone dress professionally but sloppy. I understand this is Florida and it does get hot, but they seem to come to work like they just fell out of bed. You couldn't tell who actually worked there or if they were a guest.

I was told that the hotel in Key West cancelled the reservation themselves and they would look into the problem and get back to us. We did not hear back from anyone and had to call again twice to finally be told that the hotel in Key West stated that our credit card had been 'declined'. I immediately called our credit card company and they looked into our records but no charge had ever been declined by them in fact when a charge decline is made, a record is kept on the electronic account and the customer is notified via mail neither of which occurred. Our charge card company also told us that no query was ever made by Travelodge and no 'hold' was ever put against our account for this charge as is the usual practice.
