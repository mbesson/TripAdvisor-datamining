Discovery Inn has cute little cottage like rooms, you have your own private parking stall, it's almost like a home away from home. The rooms are always clean, the setting is far enough off the main road that you don't get all the road traffic sounds. I really enjoy my stays at Discovery Inn, and I highly recommend them to people who like nice places to stay.", "Date": "August 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cThe Discovery Inn should be shut down.\u201d", "Author": "easyrider08", "ReviewID": "UR19055883", "Content": "I wish I had read these reviews before I booked my room. I can't understand how anyone would rate this motel as a good experience. The morning of the day I was to arrive at the Inn, Mina contacted me and said that she did not have a room for my group of 4 adults. I said that I had contacted the Inn a week ago and that my reservation had been confirmed. She replied that since I had not talked to her directly, I did not have a room. She then informed me that I could have 2 rooms for my party of 4. I asked that she charge me the price of one room because the Inn had made an error. She replied that I would be charged for 2 rooms. She then said that she could give me a room with a king size bed and charge me for a cot. She said that 3 of us could sleep in a king size bed. I said that was unacceptable and later she called back with a room with 2 queen size beds. Arriving at the Inn late that evening, I was more than disappointed. Don't be fooled by the photos on the Inn's website. The photos have obviously been enhanced. Rather than a beautiful Ca. sky in the background, picture the industrial section of Napa. Click hybrid on the map on the Inn's site and you will see the true surroundings of the motel. This is not the Napa that is alluded to on their site. I wish I had been more thorough before I had booked my stay. The Inn is an old Ca. motel that has been \"spruced up\" on the outside. Before checking in, I peeked through a window and saw that the original furnishings were still there. It looked old and run down, definitely not worth the price being charged. Don't be fooled by the website's description of the tasteful remodeling. Having seen the room I promptly called Mina and cancelled my stay. She was extremely rude(as she had been earlier that day) and replied that she would charge me for the room. In retrospect, I should have not asked for her to honor my reservation that morning. Mina did charge me $180 for the room that I did not stay in. After seeing the accommodations and reading the negative reviews on this site, I am glad that I did not stay at the Discovery Inn.", "Date": "August 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fresno, CA", "Title": "\u201cAn excellent Napa value and location\u201d", "Author": "teddyk", "ReviewID": "UR14971105", "Content": "We found the spacious and well appointed room and location to be excellent and appreciated the hospitality and suggestions provided by the staff.", "Date": "April 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "san diego", "Title": "\u201cWorst Hotel Experience I've ever had\u201d", "Author": "daniella415", "ReviewID": "UR10294791", "Content": "Hairs on bed, towels, bathroom walls.

If going to Napa, book your accommodation well in advance so that you do not have to stay in a place like this. Myself and my wife having motorcycled across the States we can confidently say that this was by far the worst accommodation we have had the misfortune to experience. After complaining about the room we were initially allotted the owner agreed to relocate us to a better room, which it was but not worth the $150 pn (more like $40) the excessive use of air freshner was also a little suspicious.

The owner/manager was exceptionally rude, he actually told us (myself, my husband and my 6-month old son) that we better not have a party or he would call the cops. The room we were in (supposedly the largest available) was tiny, dark, far from inviting, and had this strange musty kind of smell. When my husband walked back up to the office to see about the crib that the owner said he would send to the room, the owner glared and told him that we should have brought our own and that they didn't have one. So my husband very politely asked for a few more blankets & pillows, and told the owner that our son could sleep on the bed with me and he would just sleep on the floor. The owner told him no, that he wouldn't give him any more, because more blankets would mean more people. We finally managed to get one of the \"housekeepers\" (I use the term very loosely) to give us a pillow and a blanket that looked like they belonged to a homeless shelter. Then we made the mistake of moving a nightstand so that my husband could sleep right along the edge of the bed that my son would be on, for extra safety, and to our extreme horror we found a half-empty bag of what looked like crystal meth, and some hypodermic needles. Needless to say, we left right then and there without even inquiring about getting our money back, and drove for 45 minutes to Solano County to find somewhere clean and decent to stay.", "Date": "February 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oakland, Ca", "Title": "\u201cYikes!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4236660", "Content": "I am 56 years old and have traveled extensively.
