Very nice, modern decor, though the \"art\" on the walls was questionable. The room was very quiet and it's a nice touch that the windows open. The toiletries were DELICIOUS. Maintenance is an issue: Hanging strip of gasket on the shower door, cracked tiles in the bathroom, broken harp on a lamp, weak batteries on the television. The hallways needed a vacuuming and freshening of decor. Coffeemaker instructions suggested we use Evian from the minibar and that the $10 charge would be added to the bill. We chanced it with tap water. The concierge was very helpful in suggesting a moderately-priced restaurant for dinner (Bella Bacinos), which was a great pick. The staff in general was friendly and helpful.

It was in a great location for the weekend festivities, and it is in a nice area convenient to many attractions. The room was just okay. It was nothing special, although it did have a nice view of the city. My husband felt that it was small- he called to ask if there was an upgrade available and we were told we would have to pay $100 more per night- we're Fairmont President's Club members and we were of the impression that if an upgrade is available, we are to be upgraded upon request. But we wanted to get going, so we didn't push. The room itself was clean, but showing signs of wear. The hallways had torn wallpaper and everything just looked kind of like it could use some attention. When housekeeping came, they left dirty dishes inside the room and these weren't taken until we put them out in the hallway. Some girls next door to us came home about 3AM on St. Patricks Day and it sounded like they were in the room with us. VERY thin walls! (They were not loud or acting crazy- they were just talking in regular voices.) We've had wonderful Fairmont experiences before and this one just doesn't measure up. Its just a basic hotel. There's no pool. The only option for dining is an Asian restaurant that has only Asian cuisine, but other foods are available if you get room service. ??? (Typically, Fairmont dining is pretty fantastic.) I think there are better options in the area- especially for the price we paid.

It's a bit far away to write this review but I thought I would drop a line since I had a great experience. We booked through Expedia.ca. I had written a comment to ask if we could get an upgrade since this is a special trip. I went with my Aunt who had never travelled outside of Toronto since she moved from HK 40 years ago and it was her first time taking the plane and visiting the US. The hotel gave us a big suite with 2 separate beds and we had a beautiful view. We stayed here for 4 nights and the service is fantastic. We forgot our slippers and called room service late at night and they came very quickly. The rooms are what you see on the Website's pictures. And the hotel is very generous with the toiletries like shower cap, soap, shampoo, conditioner, shoe mit. If you need toothpaste, they will also bring it up. Only downside is it's a bit of a walk to Magnificent Mile - a good 10 minutes. It's windy and very sunny so be sure to bring a scarf a light jacket at night. But it's close to the Millenium Park and the bean. There's a grocery store close to the hotel so we grabbed some snacks there. We also walked almost everywhere but took a cab to a nice restaurant further away. I highly recommend this hotel, the staff at the front desk are nice, accommodating and there's no attitude or snottiness. I booked early so I think you should do that if you want to secure a good price. We had a room on a high floor and never heard any noise from the the rooms next door. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurants and preferred venturing to cafes on Magnificent Mile and other streets in that area.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Devizes, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDecent stop over and good location\u201d", "Author": "Madp0lka", "ReviewID": "UR126116062", "Content": "Had two nights here in a March when the temperature hit 80 degrees!

It now needs more care than it is getting. More on that later. First the positives. It is well located for downtown activities such as Michigan Ave, the Navey Peer, Millennium Park and down town businesses. I had a standard room with a king bed. The room was large by hotel standards. There was mini fridge, but it was stuffed with liquer, beer and pops. One nice touch was a sofa by the window. I was on the 35th floor and the views of the Chicago skyline were amazing. The staff was very courteous and helpful. I stayed at the Fairmont because there was a conference there. The conference facilities are nice and once again the staff was outstanding, in particular George. Thank you George for your kind words. I only had room service once, and the Chicago style pizza was as good as it gets. A few negatives that move this from a 4 star to a 3 star in my book. The paint on the room door was pealing and dirty. The inside corners of most surfaces were dirty. If you are a neat freak this might bother you, if not no big deal. The doors do bang shut, so bring ear plugs. If you join the Presidents Club (free to do so) you get wireless Internet free of charge. You can join online at their website. Overall, this is a good place. I do not know what their regular rates are, but we paid $149 per night.

I wasn't convienced the person serving me knew a lot about wine but he was nice. The bar itself is a little dark for my taste and few people were congregated there so it seemed lonely. Overall the lobby and bar scene was at best low energy and dull. I prefer more energy, excitement (and people). The door staff was super, they got the cars fast and were very polite and helpful. Housekeeping was good but not intutitive like I prefer. For example, I like to sleep on the left side of the bed so I moved the alarm clock to the left night stand.

I also selected it due to my Fairmont Presidents' Club Membership (highly recommend this - it's free and you get free wi-fi, among other benefits) and the great rates being offered. While this doesn't rate as my favorite Fairmont (the Scottsdale Princess and the Kea Lani in Maui beat this hands-down) it still boasted the nice amenities I expect from the brand. We were invisibly upgraded to a high-floor, view room, which was quite nice to discover upon our arrival. The room was not huge, but very comfortable, with a sofa and a desk in addition to the two queen beds. The beds and bedding were comfortable. The bathroom, while large, was not the best for two friends to share, as only one could use it at a time (as opposed to having the sink area separate from the shower area). But there was a handy little shelf outside the bathroom so one could be applying make-up or drying hair while the other was showering. The one room negative was that the walls were quite thin and we could hear conversations in the next room. We also could hear an alarm clock go off and ring for what seemed like forever, as the previous room guest probably set it and then checked out. Lack of privacy is not something I expect from a higher tier hotel. The hotel lobby is sparse, with a bar that only seemed to be staffed now and then. The public areas of the hotel felt neither welcoming nor off-putting. They were unremarkable. The very best part of the stay was that the staff at the desk and door were extremely friendly and helpful. They allowed us a very late check-out (5:30 pm on the day of our departure) without batting an eye, which reminded me why I like Fairmont. They were very accommodating. The hotel is walking distance to the Art Institute of Chicago, and there's a great little cafe along the way, the Toni Patisserie. We loved it and ate there both mornings. Very reasonable and friendly, with to-die-for pastries. The cafe is also along the route to the Willis Tower, which is also walkable, albeit a bit far when it's 29 degrees and the wind is blowing. There is no walkable night-life from this hotel. We took cabs to restaurants and clubs, which were easy and quick. Most cab fares to downtown restaurants, House of Blues, etc., ran about $9 for the two of us. There is a very handy drugstore directly across the street for snacks, drinks and forgotten items. I would stay here again if I had a similar itinerary, but next time I may want to spend more time in the shopping district, in which case I would choose a hotel closer to that area.

After getting to my room, I settled in and went to take a shower. Low and behold, the shower knob, no matter which way it was turned, did not produce any water. Now, I understand water issues and fix it issues, but I was disturbed to think that the cleaning staff had not alerted building management to this issue. Seems like it would be difficult to clean a shower if there was no water. Instead, they just set the bathroom like it was perfectly clean and ready to go. As I looked around the room more, there were stains on all of the furniture. It seriously looks like they got genuine \"retro\" furniture - maybe from an old frat house, I don't know. It was too gross to sit on. Before I had time to take photos, the staff brought me a key to a different room. While the new room was much bigger, at 5AM, after 3 hours of sleep since the shower debacle, I found out why no one was in that room. The elevators were literally located on the other side of the bed headboard. All I could hear were the elevators going up and down, which sounded more like a motorcross race. Ugh...

Some friends stayed in nicer, upgraded rooms, so please keep that in mind as you read my review. I found the Fairmont to be a standard 4 star hotel. I enjoyed my stay, but I was not overly impressed by the room or the service I received. I have stayed in 4 star hotels that had better service and more luxurious decor/rooms. What I liked most about the room was that it was big. I have heard that rooms in most hotels in Chicago tend to run small, so I was glad that my room was a nice size. I also enjoyed the espresso coffee maker and coffee that came with the room. What I liked most about the bathroom was the fact that the toilet was separated from the rest of the bathroom by a door. I also liked the fact that there was a separate shower and tub as I hate standing in the tub to take a shower. What I didn't like about the bathroom was the fact that it seemed as though housekeeping didn't clean the toilet area very well. I have to admit that I am a bit of a clean freak, so please bear that in mind, but with that being said, the toilet just seemed dirty to me. The location of the hotel is also nice. We walked to Millennium Park, and we walked from the hotel to downtown and the Magnificent Mile area. Please note that I love to walk, so the hotel seemed to be close to everything. Overall, the Fairmont is a decent 4 star hotel. If you want a nice place to stay, then I recommend it. If you want luxury, then don't book the standard room.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cNot up to Fairmont Standards\u201d", "Author": "Matthieu25", "ReviewID": "UR122672048", "Content": "As I start all reviews, please take a look and see how many hotels I've reviewed, I'm not a jaded one time traveler. I travel often and feel I have a good base to write a good overall review. I'd also like to say I love Fairmont Hotels, I've stayed in several and do prefer them to other 5 star properties (Usually) Before my stay I checked the TA reviews as I often do and was surprised by the amount of negative reviews. But I do take negative reviews with a grain of salt of the person writing the review has only written one review. This stay at Fairmont Chicago was surprising to say the very least. Upon arrival the valet was very prompt taking our luggage and parking our car. The lobby is really outstanding, it's very new and modern. The service was lacking, usually if you are a Presidents Club - Premier you're really rolled out the red carpet. This did not happen, honestly the man checking us in didn't even acknowledge it. At no point did he ask of we would like to upgrade to Gold or if we wanted any reservations for dinner or the spa. The elevators are quick (which I love) We booked a \"Parkview Suite\" on the 34th floor. The room was HUGE (living, dining, separate bedroom and large bath) as stated in other reviews the rooms are missing something. I don't know if it was because it was a suite but the room had a cold empty feel. The room did have the usual great bedding and comfortable bed in room coffee full mini bar. It appears that when the last renovation took place it was done quickly and no attention to detail. The paint was chipping in several areas, the bathroom door was out and out dirty the sprinkler head in the bathroom was falling out of the ceiling the pocket door for the water closet did not close. The bath did have an updated sink, mirror, tile and shower which were very nice and on par with other Fairmonts. Another huge disappointment was the lack of plugs and odd places for the light switches. In the bedroom there were two useable plugs and they were across the room one behind a heavy bench the other under the window so if you wanted to charge your phone by the bed you couldn't. Our room was right next to the elevators and unlike other reviews we had no issue, it just sounded like the wind blowing (and they don't have a bell that dings) As a Presidents club member their workout gear is usually waiting in the room again that was not the case, turndown service was sporadic of the 4 nights only turned down twice. ( I can close my own drapes but if you're going to do it be consistent) During the times we were turned down we received bottled water and a piece of paper with the next days forecast (at other locations these are nicely printed, here is was a very old copy of a copy with the info hand written) My biggest point of frustration was we decided to add a day to our stay. This in my opinion should not be complicated, yet the front desk seemed as if it was the biggest request ever made. First we were told sure that wouldn't be a problem, then received a call that our current suite was booked and would have to move to a standard room we said fine, then we were told we could stay in the room and then another call to see if we were checking out and then received a voicemail stating we wouldn't have to change rooms. To me it appears as if the right hand isnt speaking to the left. On top of all that once we returned to the hotel at 8pm we reached our room on the 34th floor to find our keys didn't work. We then got to stand in a line for 15 minutes so we could get our keys re-activated. At all the other Fairmonts I've stayed I like to view our Guest Folio via the tv. This location does not offer the option. The concierge was great, was able to give great transportation tips and suggest good restaurants. (Shaws Crab House, Gaylord Indian) The hotel restarant for dinner was OUTSTANDING, the food, service and even the decor excellent. It is really top notch and again on par with other Fairmonts. Sadly the breakfast was a total joke. Im sorry but $16 bucks for 2 eggs is a joke. They may claim that the pricing is comparable with other hotels but I still think to price gouge your customers who just paid for hotel room with you is not right. We do have some great tips, the hotel does not make you aware but they are connected with the Chicago pedway system. You can walk from the hotel all the way to Macys State Street (aka Marshall Fields) without setting foot outside. It is a little confusing and poorly marked but sooooo convenient with the harsh Chicago winters. After seeing the breakfast prices at the hotel we were able to take the pedway to \"Wildberry\" the breakfast is truly EXCELLENT (ate there all 4 days), everything is fresh and the prices are in line with what they should be. As stated the pedway came in handy, you can also take it to the train station and a mall on State Street. Granted if you look at a map they are only a block or two from Michigan Ave, but to get to the good shopping you must take a taxi or bus. You can walk to State street for shopping but Mich Ave is far better. Overall would I recommend this hotel? No. This is a nice hotel but does not live up to Fairmont high standards I've received at the other properties. I would have felt very cheated and most likely addressed these issues with the manager if I'd paid full price but they offered a good winter deal.. For the price I'd as you can read in my other reviews recommend the Four Seasons or Ritz if for a 4 star I'd go with the Intercontinental. Those are are very central and very high quality. If you have a chance to ever stay with Fairmont from my past travels I'd recommend them 100% (except this one) Happy Travels!

Our room was on a high floor, looking out over the lake and the park. Simply beautiful Chicago landscape. We found the staff to be about average and did not encounter any issues or stressful sitiuations. The hotel is located just a walk away from everything you could possibly want to do in Chicago... shop, eat and sight-see. Right next to Millenium park it was fun to hang out and people watch. Just a 20 minute walk to the Magnificent Mile for shopping. You can take a cab and it doesn't cost too much. Also if you have a chance, go check out the architectural tour by ferry.

The Fairmont Millenium is a nice hotel - quite chic in the lobby. Unfortunately, it's just missing something. It doesn't have the same feel as other Fairmonts. I believe a big piece has to do with the service, and I'll recount some experiences below. Nothing terrible but not in line with the caliber a Fairmont is supposed to be. Overall, it's a clean space in an OK area. The Millenium Park is right there and a nice place to walk. You can also play tennis on the nearby public courts. So here are some of the negative service experiences: 1. Check-in - 2 people, both on the phone, so had to wait nearly 10 minutes for someone to help us. 2. Arrived at our room to find keys didn't work. Had to go back down, wait AGAIN, only to find that we were given the wrong room number (714 instead of 602). 3. Went out front to get a cab. Doorman asked if I needed a cab, I said yes, he blew his whistle, walked away and began a conversation with another employee. Cab never came and he seemed more interested in his conversation so I walked down to the street to grab one. 4. Called the concierge to ask about the Adidas Fit gear. Was placed on hold. Kept phone on speakerphone while I shaved, brushed my teeth, etc., and he never came back on the line. 5. When I did get someone in te line, I asked if they had sweatpants (it was 34\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 out), was told yes, they sent up shorts. 6. When I went to check at the concierge desk, woman was on phone with what I assume was a disgruntled guest, as I could hear the person's tone - while she was just rolling her eyes. 7. I had two packages arrive suing my stay. Was not alerted about either and when I found where to get them, it took about 15-20 minutes to get them. Overall, these are mostly small things. In and of themselves I wouldn't complain, but the overall customer service experience here is poor. It's akin to what I had expected at the Hilton I chose not to stay at.

Overall, I don't stay at Fairmonts much, so I wouldn't choose it over the other brands that I typically stay at, but if you do like Fairmonts (or don't care about points), then you'll enjoy your stay.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat people, great service, but confusing layout and decor\u201d", "Author": "Charla", "ReviewID": "UR118561016", "Content": "The people at this hotel are wonderful, e.g.: Attending a business meeting, arrive for Day 1 (banquet room) breakfast in search of caffeine - the carbonated kind. I make a joke to one of the banquet waiters about not everyone drinking coffee and tea in the AM and -voila- minutes later he shows up at the my side with a glass of Diet Coke. Stellar! Further, my guest room was nice enough - high-threadcount sheets, dressing area, bathrobes, marble bathroom with WC, big tub and separate shower, etc. Plus, I got free WIFI because I'd followed others' advice on TripAdvisor and joined the (free) FAIRMONT PRESIDENT's CLUB before I checked in. My room had a great view of Millennium Park. And it's only two or three short blocks to the Art Institute if you have free time. And there's a CVS nearby if you want a quick, inexpensive snack. It's this hotel's overall environment that left me scratching my head. (I wish this didn't matter as much to me as it does.) Our sessions met on three different, non-contiguous-levels of the hotel. So in effect, after a session concluded, everyon'es goal was to race to the elevators or escalators to travel to the next session (reminded me of high school) asap. Although the elevators were smooth and quick and many banks of escalators connected the levels, so much focus on vertical travel eliminated the opportunity for the informal mixing and socializing that usually goes on between sessions. There's also a gaping decor disconnect among the areas of the hotel. The meeting rooms are in the grand Fairmont style - lots of moldings, heavy fabrics, swagged drapery and high ceilings with pillars. The lobby (which has a really cool light feature at the check-in desk) had clearly been \"updated\" to present a contemporary appearance. But my guest room itself was so stripped-down modern that I'd swear it was a way to limit costs during a remodel without it being obvious. Overall, all this made me wonder what the building was going to be when it grew up. Honestly, on most business trips all I'm looking for is a clean room with functioning plumbing. At a hotel brand like as the Fairmont, however, I automatically expect more. (This is the same chain that operates the St. Francis on Union Square in SF, ladies and gentlemen!) The people are great, but the people can only do so much. However, if you plan on having a Hilton/Marriot-like experience and get a great room rate, (and you, preferably, aren't using their meeting rooms,) I'm confident you'll go home happy.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAverage\u201d", "Author": "GaTxNy", "ReviewID": "UR118319178", "Content": "I was here for work so didn't have a say in where I stayed.

We arrived around midnight (one o'clock our time) after traveling 4 hours to watch my son play football in the rain for 3 hours and then another hour to the hotel to find out they had overbooked the hotel and did not have the non smoking room available that my confirmed reservations called for. After arguing for several minutes we were told there was nothing they could do but they would try and find us another hotel if we wanted but because it was Labor Day weekend it might be hard to get another reservation. Because it was late we agreed to check out the room before deciding whether to stay. The Manager went with us to the room and when we stepped out of the elevator into the hallway the smell was so bad I thought I was going to be sick. It was a mixture of marijuana and some other horrible smell. There was also food setting out in the hallway that smelled horrible as well. When we entered our room you could definitely tell it was a smoking room but we were only staying long enough to sleep and leave so we took the room. The only thing they agreed to compensate us for was a free breakfast (which they offer online anyway) We did not take the free breakfast because we didn't get up early enough and I could have cared less about the breakfast. We booked through Magellan Vacations (which was recommended on Trip Advisor) which is a luxury hotel reservation service and they are available 24/7 so I decided to call them and complain as well. They were very friendly and immediately called the hotel while I was on hold but it did absolutely no good and because of the Holiday weekend they would have to wait until Tuesday before they could call anyone. They did follow up on Monday and insured me they would call me on Tuesday however I had to call them back on Thursday. I was told the Hotel was not willing to compensate me in any way except giving me a free upgrade next time we were in Chicago. I have only been to Chicago twice and if I return I will definitely not be staying at the Fairmont so I refused the offer. Also observed another upset customer when we walked up to the check in counter and then 2 young girls were trying to check in and were being told the same as us.

She gave us a large sized room that had all the amenities you could wish for. However, it was gloomy and souless, the contemporary furnishings adding nothing to a feeling of comfort or cozyness. We did have a bay window which was a nice feature but did not allow any more daylight into the room which remained gloomy despite the daily brilliant sunshine outside. The bathroom was large and well fitted but with no magnifying shave/make up mirror. The WC was in a tiny separate cubicle within the bathroom and was a squeeze to use. Toiletries were good quality. A 42\" HD TV, swish coffee maker and complimentary mineral water ticked the right boxes too. And yet..... Public areas were stark and gloomy and the bedroom corridor, at least on our floor, was shabby and in need of a make over. We never ate in the hotel. It looked over priced for what was on offer and a menu with the pre-fix 'fusion' never works in our experience. We were concerned that the location was going to be out on a limb but were pleased to find that once we'd got the lay of the land, it was a good, central position for all that (fabulous) Chicago has to offer.

Columbus Drive. The Hotel is one block from Michigan Ave. and one block from the Chicago Riverwalk. From doormen, to bellmen, to front desk, to concierge to restaurant and room service staff, it is the people who make this Hotel such a success. The Lobby design with its coffee and wine bar in the center is a gathering place for informal meetings. I encountered an unusual transportation issue and the two concierge people went out of their way to help solve the dilemma. The classy restaurant, Aria is far above the usual hotel restaurant fare. I took advantage of eating a lunch and dinner in the restaurant and both times was wowed with the service and quality of the food. Aria seemed to be the perfect place for a business lunch or romantic dinner, but did not seem very rambunctious kid friendly. The restaurant is expensive too-expect to spend about $35.00 for lunch without alcohol. A Hotel adjacent to the Fairmont has a restaurant that children would enjoy and I noticed that the room service menu at the Fairmont also had a children's menu. My room both coming and going was both spacious and comfortable. I did not have a view of Lake Michigan but believe those rooms are available. The rooms were clean although I thought that the bathroom floors could have used a little more TLC, especially behind the doors. The bathroom I had on the 9th floor had maintenance issues-loose light sockets that needed attended to. There was also an item left behind by a previous guest on the floor and overlooked by housekeeping. There were obvious scuff marks in the hallways where luggage had hit the woodwork. The pillows in both rooms had a slightly musty smell and probably needed replacing. I realize that I may be getting a bit picky but for these reasons I cannot give this hotel a 5th star. The Hotel has a spa which I used and was happy with. There is a complete gift shop on site off the lobby. All in all, I was very pleased with the Fairmont.

From the moment you walk into the place, the lobby is simply amazing. There is a wonderful wine and cheese bar in the center called ENO that serves great wine flights with cheese. Off to the right when you walk in is the check-in desk with a very creative light feature that looks like a waterfall. The elevators are very difficult to find, but it's on the opposite side of the check-in desk behind the stairs. The staff wasn't too helpful about where to find the elevators. We were on the 31st floor overlooking the Chicago River (looking north). From other reviews, the south side facing rooms have great views of the lake and Millennium Park. The rooms are very comfortable and decorated very well. The beds were comfortable and the TV was really big! There is a separate tub and shower, and the toilet is in its own little room. The bathroom was really laid out well. The only thing is that it's pretty dark in there - there was a light fixture that needed to be replaced, as you can see in the posted pictures. My only complaints about the room is that 1) the doors are very thin because you can hear what's going on in the hallway. 2) There is no privacy from the windows! Be sure to close your shades because people can look in on you and you can look in on other people. I could clearly see people in the condo building across the way. The concierge was very helpful in the lobby and recommended some pretty good hotels. The location is pretty central to everything as well. It's a quick walk to Millennium Park, the river, and the Magnificent Mile. In fact, we took a boat tour and it started raining. Since we didn't have umbrellas, we walked from the pier to the hotel on an underground street level that kept us dry the entire time.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bronx, New York", "Title": "\u201cPaid extra for the large room with a view and would do it again.\u201d", "Author": "louisjam", "ReviewID": "UR116574421", "Content": "I was attending the Lollapalooza concert in Grant Park and needed a room to sleep and rejuvenate.

Bathroom floor and most walls were done in marble, which feels refreshingly cool to the touch. Robes were available and comfy. I splurged on room service for breakfast one day. It cost $41.00 with fees and (included) tip for two poached eggs, bacon, hash browns, croissant, pot of coffee, juice, but was quite an enjoyable indulgence.

Good location in downtown Chicago. It is located to the side of Millennium Park. About a 15/20 minute walk to Navy Pier and a short walk to shopping the Magnificent Mile. Valet parking is $51 per day but the good news is that you can leave it valet parked until 6 PM day of check out. So you can check out of room, check your bags at the bellmen and enjoy some more of the city on your last day. Room - we were in room 1703 on the PURE floor. I have an allergy to feathers so they upgraded me to this floor. Nice view from this room. Look out between two buildings to Lake Michigan, Buckingham Fountain and Shed Aquarium. The room had a small clock (with hands) that was not digital. You had to reach out and touch it for the light to come on to read it at night. I like being able to look and see time, especially in the middle of the night. The hair dyer they provided was a small plug in one. I am used to having a full size one in a luxury hotel. Room size was good. Had long couch against window, king bed, end tables, desk with chair and TV. Bathroom had a separate shower from tub and separate room for toilet. Also had a separate area from the bathroom with large mirror, outlets and ledge. This was great as an place for me to do makeup and hair while my husband was taking a shower, steaming up the bathroom. I also found myself hitting my foot on a wheel that seemed to stick out a little from under the bed. The above complaints are little and would not stop me from staying again. I just wanted to note them to reviewers. As a side note I have stayed in a few PURE rooms now at different hotels. From what I can tell they are feather free and have a PURE (air purifier) machine in them. So far, I have booked a standard room and noted my allergy to feathers and have always been upgraded for free. My husband and I also got to enjoy the wine bar located in on the main floor in the center. We liked the great selection of wine by the glass and bottle. The best part was that you were able to sample a taste before you committed to a glass. My husband sampled 3 different wines before he decided on his. I sampled two. Another nice option was wonderful cheese plates and chocolate options. We had just had diner so we did not order but others did and it all looked good. Only negative was the loud sounds coming from the lobby due to the fact the bar was open and in the center of the lobby. The concierge Timothy was nice and very helpful.

I arrived at the hotel at Noon (three hours before check in). The check in clerk excused himself because he \"had to check something.\" The front office manager came to the desk and apologized that the Fairmont had oversold that night and could not accommodate us; instead, the Fairmont would pay for our night's stay at another hotel \"just a few blocks away.\" The Fairmont manager ostensibly called the other hotel in our presence to confirm the reservation. We had to retrieve our car from the valet and drive to the other hotel, which was much farther than a few blocks away, a far inferior hotel, and most inconvenient to the places we would be going while in Chicago. When we arrived at the second hotel, the hotel personnel had no idea who we were, had no reservation for us, and had no availability except a smoking room, which of course was completely unacceptable. When that hotel called the Fairmont manager, she claimed that she had sent us to the wrong hotel and the hotel where she had booked us was miles away. My husband told her this was unacceptable and he booked us at a Marriott. We were only able to get a room there because of my husband's frequent traveler status with the Marriott. In the meantime, I was nearly late for my afternoon meetings in Chicago, was deprived of any time for lunch, and was forced to go to my meetings almost late, hungry, and a bit disheveled because I had no time to freshen up in my hotel room as I had originally planned. I am absolutely astonished at how the Fairmont treated us like we were trash from the street (despite the fact that I was dressed in a suit--not that that should matter). Since we were so early to check in, I can only conclude that we were singled out to be booted from the hotel because we booked through Expedia, but if the hotel intended to refuse us service, why didn't the hotel have the common courtesy to let me know in advance so that I could make other arrangements? And why did your manager lie to us about the second hotel? Incidentally, while the Fairmont manager told us that all hotel expenses--including parking--would be paid by the Fairmont, we were in fact stuck with the parking bill of $52 at the Marriott.", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chattanooga, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cGreat service, great location.\u201d", "Author": "pasdad", "ReviewID": "UR109385987", "Content": "Great service, great location.

From the fascinating check-in area (waterfall lights that sparkle in the wall and across the floor) to the wine bar in the center of the lobby surrounded by what look like gold vines, to the sharp vibe of the sushi bar and Aria - you know you're not in Kansas anymore.

However, the retrofit of the bathroom (nice tiled stone stall shower, separate tub and separate toilet area) appears nice at first, but it eliminated the closet. What was left of the closet was so small, that there was not enough room to hang clothes for 2 people for 4 days. Also, the water pressure in the shower was practically nonexistent. The sink and tub both had sufficient water pressure, but the restrictors used in the shower head made it nearly impossible to rinse shampoo or conditioner from my hair. I ended up using the showers in the spa area...the pressure wasn't fantastic there either, but the showers there were equipped with a hand-held wand that made it easier to get the shampoo and conditioner rinsed. This wasn't really a problem as I used the fitness center each morning and the dressing room was well equipped and had lockers with electronic locks. As a President's Club member, one is not charged for the use of the fitness center.

Also, Saturday morning, we went to the fitness center at 7:30 (opening time for the weekend) and waited (with about a dozen other people) for someone to show up to open the gym. After numerous calls to the concierge and front desk, we were finally told that their security can not enter that area as it is operated by an outside company. By 8:00, the manager of the front desk agreed to send us over to the Lakeshore Athletic Club (short walk indoors - fantastic facility) and would comp the entrance fees.

The worst part of our stay were the REALLY drunk guests and the elevator that shook and stopped for a full 5 minutes. It was really frightening. Also, a big minus - there weren't any Water Vending machines and no $5 water bottle option in the room. Which prompted me to go down to the bar of the restaurant, Aria, to buy a bottle of water.

No room service before 6am, which means if you want fresh hot coffee with MILK (not the packaged creamer left in your room,) you are out of luck. And the guy who informed of this at 5am, just told me to wait another hour. At the Ritz, someone would have come up to brew it for me! The maid service was mediocre, as evidenced by the empty Starbucks cup, with straw, that sat on the counter for two days.

The premises is reasonable well located on the north side of Millennium Park, a short stroll from Navy Pier and about 15-20 walk from the main buzz of Michigan Avenue. From check in to departure, the staff are efficient, courteous and friendly, without being superficial and ingratiating. The conference facilities are absolutely world class, and the support staff seem to anticipate everything in advance to prevent the predictable and not so predictable issues that can thwart best laid plans. But for my money, the highlight was the room itself. Although it seemed reasonable conventional, within minutes of closing the door I realised that this place was different. As mentioned, the hotel seems fixated upon clean cleanliness, and have employed an array of measures to ensure that every room remains fresh, bright, well ventilated and alive, including hypoallergenic bedding, air purifiers in every room and hallway, windows that actually open, and so on. I cannot ever recall staying in a CBD hotel that felt - and actually was - so fresh. None of the congestion and dry eyes one expects, but rather a restful nights sleep in immaculate surrounds. I look forward to attending more conferences at the Fairmont Chicago and highly recommend the hotel to both travellers and conventioners alike.

I am a huge fan of the Fairmont hotel group and almost did not stay in this one due to the reviews of others. I was worried about service and location, and I have to say that I am glad that I stayed here. Service was excellent---from the valet to checkout. We were upgraded to a Junior Suite for an extra $39 and it was fabulous! (I highly recommend the upgrade if you get that option.) We had incredibe views of the city from both rooms, could see the Navy Pier and even watched the fireworks on July 4th from our bed with room service! How's that for beating the crowds? You will walk alot in Chicago to see everything, or you can just take a taxi. I thought this hotel was a perfect location, especially to Navy Pier and the Chicago Riverwalk. We also walked to The Mag Mile and to dinner. The suite was fantastic and had everything that you could need! The bed, as always, was incredibly comfortable. The only thing that was substandard was the water pressure in the shower, but we did not let this distract us from an awesome stay. The suite also had a large tub for bathing, as well. The lobby was beautiful and the Concierge (Tim) was excellent. We booked 2 tours with him (the Architectural Boat Tour & a bus tour that he recommended). --When we returned to our room that night, Tim had sent us complimentary local beer and popcorn, which was very unexpected and such a nice gesture! There is also a gift shop located in the hotel, with snacks, water, toiletries and gifts. This was a helpful stop for us, as well. I wish we would have known it was here instead of waiting in a long line at the CVS across the street. In summary, this was an excellent stay with no complaints!

It is immaculately clean, tastefully decorated, and has good views of the Millennium Park from the less expensive non-lakeview side. We could also see the fireworks from Navy Pier. We had three king bed rooms and one suite which was ideally suited for night-time gatherings to play word games. Service at the conceirge desk was excellent no matter who was there. Our only significant complaint is that the hotel did not assign us a suite with two double beds as was shown on our confirmation order nor did it have in the suite a roll-a-way bed as had also been ordered. Our three grandchildren are not complainers which was why we did not learn of this mistake until our third day. In the meantime, two of them were sleeping in the king-sized bed and the third was sleeping without a pillow or bedding on the sofa in the living room. When this was called to the attention of the reservations desk they sent up a roll-a-way with bedding and removed the $20 charge for it. The desk clerk was very polite but had to check with his manager (behind the scenes) before making this adjustment. I think they owed us a bit more than this considering the care I had taken to get the reservation correctly recorded and the promise I had made to our grandchildren that each of them would have his or her own bed. Two other comments are minor: (1) we were not told at check-in that a less expensive breakfast than what was provided in the restaurant was available in the lobby and (2) signage to help one find the business center was lacking. Still, we very much enjoyed our stay at the Fairmont and would stay there again.

Wrong they had the wrong rates in the computer, thank goodness we had our confirmation from their website because they had pushed the price up from $139 a night to $169. We got that straightened out and I can say that we were pleased with our room. Because of the location of the hotel we had to catch a cab everywhere. Not a big deal, but that does add up. The doormen were GREAT. They did a much better job of taking care of our needs and all they did was called for a taxi each time we left and gave them the address of where we were going. We had massages down at the spa. It was an OK spa, but nothing to write home about. They had no whirlpool and the sauna was over heated. Again, I've paid much less for services and they were much better than what the Fairmont had to offer. Our real trouble started when it was time to check out. I gave them more than half of the bill in cash. I wanted to put the rest on a Visa gift card I had received. They couldn't get the card to work. They at first thought it was their system, but their IT person was no where to be found. I was then told that they would send me an email and we could take care of the balance in a day or two, but they would not put the balance on my best friends charge card. Well two days letter she calls me smoking hot because they had put the balance on her card. It took one whole day for me to get them straightened out. They never were able to use the Visa gift card. They then proceeded to act as if they were doing me a big favor by reversing my friends credit card charges and sending me a fax to show that the charges had indeed been reversed. I sent a message to their customer service, and I have had no response. I will be writing to corporate. Oh and the business man that was there with a group of 60 mentioned breakfast.

For example, he got locked out of our room 2 times, once having to wait for 15 minutes in the hallway after going to the spa. The other time was when he was getting ready for our wedding ceremony, so that was stressful because he lost some time. The keycard just would stop working. Then a fuse blew, so we had no power while trying to get ready. It happened to me also, coming back from the spa, and I called on the hallway phone to get help. Luckily, right after that, an employee who was randomly walking by asked me if I had been waiting long--as if she knew this was a problem. I said no, and she called down to check. Apparently, no one had even called Security to get me back into my room! She had a set of keys and let me in, thank god. Then, on our wedding night, my husband wanted to order from room service. It was a little after 10:30pm. We were told that room service was closed for the night--even though all the literature in the room brags about \"24 hour dining.\" That fact was never communicated to us when we checked in. I feel like the quality of service and amenities are slipping. We later heard something about a lot of employees getting laid off, so maybe that's why people weren't too intersted in providing good service.

Overall, the experience was okay. Unless I need the stay credit, I don't think I'll stay at this hotel next time I go to Chicago. Drive-up: Taxi pulled up to the hotel. No doorman in sight. It was 3 pm. Perhaps all occupied with other guests. Don't know. Good thing I only had the one carry-on. Check-in: Line-up was not very long, but it took a while. No check-in packet was prepared ahead of time with my info, etc. on it. First time I experienced this at a Fairmont. Person was pleasant enough, though. Room: Used an upgrade coupon and supposed got an upgraded view room. Well, the view was still primarily the building next door, though I did catch a glimpse of the park. Furnishing looked fresh and new. Maybe a bit too \"new,\" in the sense that it doesn't have the typical Fairmont flaire, but felt more like the normal upscale business hotel. Like perhaps a nicer version of a Westin. Pretty small room, though. Checked the floor map thing on the door, and it seemed to me that this FPC Plt was in one of the smaller rooms on the floor. Well, I was alone, so it's not that big a deal. But certainly the upgrade cert was wasted. Never was offered a further upgrade (not even for money), electronic or otherwise. Bathroom was good-sized. Surprisingly, not even mouthwash in the room. That's a first for me too. Housekeepers are friendly and nice. Coffeemaker is the Nespresso thing. Pretty cool. Large flat screen tv, probably too large, considering how small the room itself was. Closet was absolutely TINY. The Lobby Bar: Indifferent service. Very indifferent service. Breakfast at Aria's: Greeted with great apathy. But waiter was fine. Food was okay. Not great, but it's only pancakes and stuff. Never mind. I think I'd rather go to the Hyatt next door and pig out for the same price. Overall, not a bad experience. But really, there was a reason why I switched from a lot of business class hotel chains to Fairmont. The Chicago Fairmont would not justify such a switch in my mind. It's all about expectations, I suppose. Properties like San Francisco, Washington, heck, even the old Frontenacs and Chateau Lauriers, they have a certain character.

Last year, it was Washington D.C., which was AMAZING. This year, we picked Chicago, and it was a bit of a letdown. It did have a little to do with staying at the Fairmont. My inner voice said Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton, but my little heart said give Fairmont another try since they have such a great loyalty program. The exterior of the hotel is very impressive, with it's tall buildings and amazing views of the lake and city. Location was a little inconvenient, so we did end up taking a lot of taxis, especially for dinner. About a 15 minute walk to Michigan Ave, where the shopping is truly to die for. Navy Pier about a 10 minute walk. Check-in was brusque, a bit too sterile. However, I'm glad to say that we were given a very high floor room (two floors from the top) with picturesque views and the elusive King bed. Toiletries were the Fairmont standard Miller Harris stuff, shampoo, conditioner, soap and lotion. Bathroom huge, marble, walk in shower and separate tub. Comfortable bed and linens, overall very clean. Did call and ask about a DVD player for the room, and the charge was $150 for 4 days? That didn't sound right. Breakfast at Aria was fantastic, didn't order the buffet but did order off the menu and selection was great, price was cheaper than I've experienced. Our waitress at breakfast was for sure one of the sweetest people I've met on my travels, her name was Loli or something like that. She really brightened up our day. Went to quite a few famous places for dinner, not impressed with this \"Foodie's City.\" Quite disliked Moto, dropped $600 and found the food to be different, even innovative but quality, presentation, taste was even downright hideous for some dishes, chef must have been heavy-handed with the salt this particular evening, anyway it just didn't live up to the hype. Ironic that Aria, the restaurant in the hotel, was even better for dinner. Service was good, food was excellent! Would recommend one dinner here early in your stay in case it should be repeated for lack of a better choice. One of my favorite things about staying at a Fairmont and if you are a President's Member, which is FREE by the way, is the complimentary use of the gym. Gyms at the Fairmont are typically huge, and connected to a spa. Which means you have access to a steam room, sauna, showers and great amenities. I spent most of my getting ready time here after a workout. Their gym is a little on the smaller side, with an aerobics/yoga room. Approximately 3 treadmills, 3 Precor machines, 4 bikes, a few weight lifting machines and a row of dumbbells. Not to worry, there was never more than 2-3 other people using at the same time as you throughout the day. The biggest complaint I have about this place are the room walls. There may as well not be any. Someone just shuffling above you, you can hear it. Toilet flushes in any room nearby, you hear it. The ice machine is down the hall, like all the way down the hall, and you hear it. Earplugs are a MUST if you stay here. However, those coveted earplugs would not have worked our last night at this Old Dame. Not 1, not 2, but THREE weddings on one night. Besides the obvious, what the heck? You would think they would put aside 1...maybe 2 floors for non-wedding guests. You know, so you can get a good night's rest.

I've never been to Chicago before but I'm not sure it's a 5-star hotel, more of a good 4-star. Nevertheless the room was comfortable, large (suite) and what you'd expect from a quality brand. The bed was very comfy, we had two LCD TV's, one in the bedroom one in the lounge. Breakfasts were good (not included in package) but not as good as the Omni in San Francisco! The restaurant was quiet for breakfast probably due to the hotel's mainly business clients, and the front desk staff are a bit humourless at times - don't blame them! The Bell staff were very helpful though with our 12 tonnes of kiddy luggage! Two negatives now:- first the tap in the bathroom went dry and then sludge came out on our last morning - the hotel claimed that this was due to external factors beyond there control, but then again didn't feel it necessary to warn people. Luckily we had a second tap in the lounge, but other guests from normal sized rooms complained a lot and got upgraded. The A/C also switched off unexpectedly on our last morning - again ok for us as we were leaving anyway but others were annoyed. Second complaint - as we were heading off to the airport we were advised that we couldn't book a large taxi for all our stuff (very odd claim I thought), and one could simply be flagged down. Of course when it came to it, it took much longer than expected and then there was confusing between us and other guests as to who's taxi was who's. As we had lots of luggage we didn't mind giving up the smaller ones and wait for a larger one - all in all a bit of a shambles. I would consider staying here again but would definitely check out other 4 and 5 star hotels as well. Under normal circumstances this would be a good bet for a stay in Chicago - great location a few minutes from Millenium Park, near the lakeshore. For families, there's a pharmacy opposite as well for any essentials. Note the hotel staff also claim that due to the economic circumstances no room service is provided after 10pm - although the night staff were helpful in getting milk to us for the kids in the morning.", "Date": "August 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "jbphotography", "Title": "\u201cTerrible service, nice room, great location, terrible service ..\u201d", "Author": "jbphotography", "ReviewID": "UR37034180", "Content": "slowest wifi on the planet. literally. terrible room service food.

Since it was our anniversary and I was able to get a deluxe-view king for about $50 more under Fairmont's Friends and Family promotion (you need an employee id code to get rate--widely available on web)and since Fairmont is generally considered to be a Premium brand a cut above those listed above, we went for it. Pros = Beautiful facility. Our room's view was a knockout, Milennium Park. a slice of the lake, Field Museum and Soldier Field! Bathroom was cool--separate marble shower with huge \"rain\" showerhead and one of those big round backlit magnifying mirrors that lets you see zits and blackheads at about 10x. Room was also very clean and quiet. Cons = Poor A/C --it was a hot humid weekend. Though the a/c was set on high cool and 64* -- the room never got below 73* I know that is a fine temperature for most--but I cannot sleep unless temp is below 70. I've come to believe that a lot of hotels have some sort of non publicized low end governor and they decide how cool your room will be allowed to get. I want it my way and at a Premium hotel--should be able to get it. I reported it the first morning after the first night and they promised to send an engineer up.--We were out all day so I've no idea if anyone looked at it as they weren't considerate enough to leave me a message. At any rate the second night was the same as the first---hot and humid! First night we went to see \"Jersey Boys\" (great, highlight of the trip!) and returned to our room at about 10:30 and decided to order up a snack (hotel directory advises 24hr in room dining) after studying extensive menu and making our selections we called to place our order only to be informed \"in room dining has closed for the night\" !! Here we are in Chicago at a supposed world class upscale hotel and we couldn't get any room service at 10:45 PM !!! I guarantee you I could have scared up a cheeseburger or club sandwich or something at the Holiday Inn in the little Indiana city I live in. Geeez. Location --most reviews call the location good. It is unquestionably in a good, but business oriented neighborhood--other than the CVS across the street, it is about 3 city blocks to any shopping/dining/entertainment venues- (dining choices are severely limited at the Fairmont) so for my purposes, the location is average to poor. Concierge service: I sought the advice of the concierge on two separate minor matters---but each time the concierge desk was overwhelmed and people were waiting 3-4 deep, not how I wanted to spend my time--so I did without their counsel.

The rooms were big, with comfortable beds and a new, large LCD TV but an odd lack dresser space, we had zero space to unpack our clothes.

Arrival and check in no problem with excellent service from the time I originally made the reservation until we checked out. Rooms were great size for a Chicago hotel. Decor very simplistic with a Euro style flair. I liked the shower stall with door as I always hate at hotels having water pool all over from shower curtains. Nice large bathrooms with Miller Harris toiletries (my daughter's hated the shampoo but I'm thinking it was the low flow from the waterfall showerhead). There was a closet with in room safe however drawers were almost non existent (our room had a padded bench with two pull out drawers and there was one nightstand drawer and that was it). I did like the padded window seat for catching a glimpse of the lake (blocked mostly by buildings though). Bedding was very crisp and comfy and I always love hotels where they have bathrobes. We used our $100 credit for breakfast. It covered one breakfast for three adults and one child and with tip was $98 so certainly not the amount I normally spend on breakfast. The other two days we walked to the AON Center next door and there is a Starbucks, and Au Bon Pain, and another little cafe for breakfast. Didn't try out the bar but definately liked the vibe of it. We pretty much did museums on our trip mixed with a little shopping. Had to take cabs most every place. We did decide the first day to walk to the Field Museum but.....probably wouldn't again. Didn't realize at first but it was about 2 1/2 miles to get there. Within walking distance we found a Giordano's for fantastic stuffed pizza and it's also walking distance to State Street shopping. First time I've stayed this far south and it was a good locale since we only needed one trip up the Mag Mile for shopping the first evening. Just wish I could have found more evening restaurants around the area which is what I felt was lacking. If you sign up for President's Club (it's free) you get free internet service. Utilized it but had a heck of a time as the connection from the nearby Hyatt kept overtaking the signal from the Fairmont and I kept losing connection. So in all, a very nice stay. For what I paid for the place it would be a five but if I paid over $200 per night I'd probably give it a 3. So I'll average it out. As mentioned, service was a 5.

The check-in process was quick and painless but the front desk staff was almost disinterested in the whole procedure. That is fine when I am traveling on business, but on leisure trips I would appreciate a warmer greeting. The hotel was hosting a convention at the same time as our stay, but other than seeing some signage/attendees in the lobby, we wouldn't have noticed. This is probably due to the separation of the conference areas from the guest rooms and the 8 speedy elevators. We stayed in a Parkview Suite so we had a large room with a great view of Millenium Park. The anteroom was well appointed with a sofa, coffee table, desk, mini-bar with sink and coffee maker, and dining area. The bedroom appeared to be the same as a standard Fairmont room, but maybe slightly larger. The bathroom also appeared to be similar to a standard Fairmont room, and once again, possibly slightly larger. The upscale modern decor is pleasing but not overtly luxurious, and several small touches such as a shoe shine station (with extra collar tabs), are peppered throughout. We booked a few evening activities through the concierge and everything was perfectly handled. The hotel restaurant, Aria, couldn't find our reservation but they oddly new my name and remembered that the hotel had called to make a reservation for us. They had no problem seating us and the dinner (both food and service) was lovely. Minor complaints: The pillows could be better. I'm not sure if they remembered our preference for non-down bedding from our last visit, but seriously, these things barely felt like pillows. I'll suffer through some congestion if I can get better neck support. Also, the valet parking attendants seem overly eager to take your car (and charge you $49). And as I mentioned above, the front desk experience could be improved. Best feature: After our first stay, I gave a brief review in the comments section of the Fairmont President's Club (membership is free) website. I received a phone call from the Director of Rooms the same day asking to discuss our experience. After this stay, I left a comment essentially thanking the hotel staff for a great stay, but still received a warm, friendly phone call from the Director of Rooms asking if he could do anything to improve our next stay.

The bed was comfortable and the room was pretty well lit for reading or working.

Unlike many others in the Fairmont chain this hotel isn't a heritage or historic landmark and so has a more modern feel. The design is somewhat retro 70's chic and at times it tries a little too hard, such as the flashing white lights inbedded in the floor at the front desk. The location only a few short blocks to the Jay Pritzker Pavillion which is in Millennium Park makes for comfortable morning walks and should you feel up to it the celebrated Buckingham Fountain, Field Museum, Soldier Field and Adler Planetarium are all not much farther. The other direction will take you to the Chicago River and riverwalk with lots of restaurant choices. In terms of getting to the hotel, I rode the Blue line CTA train right to Clark & Lake and then walked the approx 5 minutes to the Fairmont and at $2.00 one way the CTA in from O'Hare many times cheaper than the airport mini-van transfers at $27.00 one way. My room was a deluxe king room, #3104 with a decent view looking towards Millennium Park though it isn't an unobstructed view as other tall towers nearby limit the view to some degree. The retro look was carried over within this guest room as the wooden chaise lounge chair and green cusion had a 60's/70's Euro design feel but were comfortable enough. The large flat screen TV was a little modern appliance set amongst the retro design and wasn't enclosed in a cabinet as some hotels use. The large king bed was fairly standard for a luxury chain but the where the room really excelled was the bathroom which had separate large tub & large walk in shower with a great rainfall shower head that made for a relaxing start to the day. I'd always wondered whether they were as good as all the hype I'd heard and for the most part would agree they are miles better than the regular shower head. Fairmont sells them on their shopping website but at $470 will pass and keep my old shower head. The one small annoyance during the 2 night stay was after relaxing in the big tub I turned the button but the recessed plug didn't pop up to let the water drain and without any fingernails couldn't get any grip to pull it up for after a few minutes gave up. I noticed housekeeping looked like they were equally as unsucessful as maintenance must've been in because there was a new and different plug installed when I returned to the room late in the day, though nobody had bothered to actually clean the tub in the process. When I made the booking months earlier I received an email saying Fairmont & Aveda were working together to offer guests for a nominal fee a travel liquid pack and so I asked for one to be put in the room upon my arrival. After checking in I noticed it wasn't there and on my way out to dinner I mentioned it to the concierge in the lobby and it was in my room upon my return and never showed on the hotel bil at check out so it must've been made complimentary as goodwill gesture which was appreciated. The travel package was a gift for a niece and I hopes she likes it as I wouldn't have ordered it for myself as it really wasn't anything that would replace my more utilitarian travel liquids pack that doesn't have any facial cream or eyebrow lotion. I did have a pre-meal drink in the Aria lounge, which is again very retro in look and feel. Note the lounge in the middle of the round lobby is only a wine bar, not all cocktails. The only other service I used on site was the business center which offered the first 30 minute internet use for guests and so took advantage to do my airline online check in and print my boarding pass, saving loads of time at O'Hare on Labour Day long weekend. There were only four terminals so be prepared for them to be full at times. The staff I encountered were all fairly young but had good attitude with friendly but polite manners and I was more than happy in the quiet refined retro luxury surroundings. The Fairmont Chicago delivered everything I'd hope and a little more and so I would return again. Price is always a consideration and were this hotel to be on sale I'd easily stay here over others in the Magnificent Mile area as I liked the Fairmont's location more. Would I pay $400+ per night? Probably not but I've seen it on sale at times as low as $149-$179 and at that range think it a good value.", "Date": "September 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ontario", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "cidalianicole", "ReviewID": "UR19206758", "Content": "I stayed at the Fairmont Chicago for 3 nights Aug 1-4 with 3 friends.

We did not eat at the hotel or purchase anything from the gift shop, but I can tell you that it was expensive for the most part. The only thing that seemed reasonable to me was the sushi restaurant.

This is a very expensive place to stay, folks, and we're used to paying for the luxury hotels (i.e., Ritz). Fairmont needs to provide better signage here because it's confusing, and do better in customer service for guests staying, especially for business. Parking is horrendous, and the best thing to do is suck it up and pay for valet, realizing that it's going to cost you. Aria's breakfast buffet had hot turned cold food every day, and there were problems in the kitchen with staffing on 1 day where the restaurant apologized and breakfast ala carte items were free. We're used to staying at the Renaissance, which has a better location, but without a view of the Lake. For the over $100 price difference, it wasn't worth the room. The accommodations at the website are not what you get unless you pay for THOSE exact rooms. However, if you want the best for spa treatments, go to their MySpa. Holy cow - it's wonderful. It's not just new; the whole atmosphere is relaxing and I enjoyed 2 treatments on 2 separate occasions. If traveling to Chicago again, I'd stay at the Renaissance and go to MySpa for massages.

The room was slightly disappointing. Not sure whether our room had been renovated. It certainly didn't look like any of the photos on here. I expected a more oppulent look. It was just basic Marriott or Westin decor. Window treatments were boring gray panels with no cornice. I wish I had taken pictures to post! There was not a single picture on the walls. The ipod dock is on the desk lamp. I read other reviews of thin walls. The only time we found this true was in the late afternoon while trying to take a quick nap before dinner. I don't know where the music was coming from, but it and it's bass were so loud that it was disturbing. That same afternoon a plate of sugar cookies arrived. We signed up for President's Club before arrival, so not sure if everyone receives them. You must be present to get them. Couldn't find anywhere to stash our clothes except in the bedside tables. Upon packing to leave, realized there were drawers in the ottoman at the end of the bed. Did find the espresso machine while searching for drawers and that was a highlight of the trip! A wobbly, funky table and a floor lamp were in front of the window. The room seemed large, but it was because there were no occasional chairs there. The only chair was a desk chair. We couldn't decide if the bed was comfortable. On the first night it was not. It got better as we got more tired from exploring the city.

Along with that comes problems - and I respect that - but my opinion is that I preferred the hotel before, when it had that 'classic hotel' look and the staff was seasoned and experienced and totally accommodating to the guest. The check-in was ardious, the room I had reserved months before, and even confirmed the night before I arrived, was not available. A guaranteed smoking room was now a 'we cannot guarantee all requests' - which puts the Fairmont in the same long list of hotels that claim the same thing. In fact, most everything now ranks them as just as good as the hotel down the street. It's a shame - they stood out and ranked higher prior to the changes. Pros: Location is superb. Housekeeping, doormen, bellhops - all the service is 100%. Cons: Problematic wireless internet access. I never was able to connect inside the hotel, even on my iPhone. The front desk repeatedly referred me to tech help, which repeatedly referred me back to the front desk. The layout of the room I stayed in was ill-conceived, with the brand new plasma tv unable to face the bed. Absolutely stupid design. So here are the two things you want in a hotel room after your long day - the internet and television - and neither were right. Room service was prompt, the food was below average.

We booked a room with a king. They confirmed this at check-in, yet put us in a room with two doubles. We called them to correct the mistake, and they were not all that nice. They sent someone up twenty minutes later (we were tired, had dinner reservations, and were looking to relax right away).

It had older carpet, a so/so view of the city, and old, peeling plastic on the desk tops. Again, not what I expected for the Fairmont. Then, there was the pool. We love swimming when we stay at hotels, and so I asked them specifically about the pool when we booked the room. They said we could use the one next door at the health club. After dinner, we walk the ten minutes (indoors) between the hotel and the health club, only to learn it was an addition $25 to use the pool, something they certainly hadn't told us. At this point, we complained. They acted interested, but weren't too quick to actually help out. An hour later, they called saying they could comp us the price of the health club. This was 20 min before the pool closed, so we politely refused. They then offered to send a free breakfast, which come 11:30 the next morning, never came. Finally, at checkout we mentioned the mishap. They did give a free lunch at the hotel restaurant (Aria), which was delicious. But quite honestly we really would have preferred that we get treated a bit nicer throughout the whole experience, and correct the actual problem. If this were a lower class hotel, I would have been fine with the stay... I don't expect too much from ordinary places. But from the Fairmont in Chicago, I expected to be treated really well.

This hotel's five-star rating needs a downgrade! When I visited this hotel 14 years ago, The Fairmont was among the classiest brands. No more. My 29th floor room was expansive, but dark -- only one small window and one light was not working. The upholstery was frayed, the bathtub faucet produced only a trickle of water, and the room's door didn't close unless you pulled on it in a certain way. Worse, the management has filled the room with price lists and displays of things to sell you, with one set of snacks even in a large tacky plastic case on the dresser. It was like sleeping in an old vending machine, but when I looked for a pen to take a phone message, there was none to be found. Other reviewers remarked that this hotel \"needs updating,\" but I think some of the original design choices are also to blame. For instance, someone decided to place a series of heavy doors in strange configurations. I couldn't sit on the toilet without leaving the door to the toilet cubby open -- the space wouldn't accommodate my legs. (I am not unusually tall.) There are so many great hotels in Chicago that deserve five stars, that the Fairmont shouldn't be able to compete. See my profile for better ideas.

Check-in could not have been more quick or efficient. I even commented to my husband in the elevator up to our room that I have never checked-in to a hotel so quickly! When making the reservation on-line I wrote in the \"special request\" box that we would love a fantastic view for our quick romantic get away, not knowing if anybody ever reads them or if it makes any difference. Well, they read them, and the woman who checked us in read it back to me (which sort of embarrassed me) and then gave us a free up-grade to the 30th floor with a wonderful view of Lake Michigan. The room was beautiful, as you can see from our pictures. It looked brand new and was spotless. The room was spacious, had a large flat screen TV, and was just overall lovely. The bed and pillows were comfortable as was the temperature in the room. Our bathrobes were cozy, the water pressure great. Anything you can think of was just what you would expect from a five star. The only thing that was not perfect was the coffee maker. It was some sort of fancy espresso deal and we think it was broken. We had very bad cups of coffee. But that wasn't enough to ruin our good time. Location is perfect! It is just north of Millenium Park. That means that you can park in the Millenium Park Parking Garage for $20.00 a day (instead of the outlandish prices charged at hotels) and walk just under two blocks to the hotel. The hotel is just a few blocks from Macy's (formerly Marshall Fields) and is a short walk to the river. We went out Thanksgiving evening and had a fabulous walk north of the river to see the Christmas lights and then found a little pub to enjoy a few drinks in. Wonderful time. The next day we walked to the Christkindlmarkt (which is lots of fun...you should go if you're in town around Christmas) and saw the Macy's window displays. Chicago is just so great anyway, but we had a fantastic getaway! And the Fairmont was icing on the cake and was a nice home base for our activities. Check out was smooth...but we were charged $20 for items that we never took out of the mini-bar. I found this when we returned home. No big deal.

Overall we were very pleased with the hotel, its staff, and the room itself. My wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employer paid for the room so it would be really obnoxious for me to complain about anything. However, for the integrity of this review I will pretend I paid the going rate when evaluating my hotel stay. The room was above average in terms of space and the bathroom area was exceptional. The bed was very comfortable and the quality of the pillows and sheets was very good. The room came with a minibar we did not use. It had separate shower and tub parts as well as a separate area for the toilet. The tub was very large as well. The bathroom had two vanity areas, one with a makeup mirror. We particularly liked the quality of the complimentary shampoos and lotions. There were complimentary bathrobes as well. The television had a large selection of channels to choose from. Our room had a nice view of Millennium Park. Other rooms had nice views of the Navy Pier. The lobby area was spacious. There were 7 elevators and they were very quick. The staff of the hotel was its greatest asset. Everyone was very friendly and constantly offering to help. While we were walking through the front doors my wife commented to me how thirsty she was. The doorman overheard her comment and immediately got her a free bottle of water. There were also free water bottles when we were waiting to be checked in. The hotel is located in a very good section of Chicago close to the river. It is just a short walk from Michigan Avenue a.k.a. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Magnificent Mile.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There was a Walgreens 5 minutes away where we loaded up on snacks and drinks. We recommend Bob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bike Hike located a short walk up Michigan Avenue. They provided a nice guided tour of Northern Chicago. Our stay was not perfect though. Probably the most disappointing aspect of the hotel is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reduced fee\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd use of the athletic facility next door. The hotel itself does not have a pool or gym, but they have an arrangement with a top quality athletic club next to the hotel. However, to use the facility costs $20.00 a day! If the Fairmont wishes to call itself a five-star hotel and charge guests $200+ a night, guests should not be charged to use a gym or swim in a pool. Even lesser quality Best Westerns or Holiday Inns will often have free use of a gym, pool, or hot tub. Also, although we were offered free bottles of water by the staff, in the room there was a bottle of water next to the minibar. To drink that water would result in a $10.00 charge to your hotel bill, yes, $10.00! That is simply insulting. Although we usually avoid staying in fancy hotels to save money, this hotel definitely stood out and met almost all of our expectations. We would stay here again. Marc T.

They supplied enough towels (so many hotels are stingy with towels) the bath supplies were nice, and the toliet was in an enclosed area with a sliding door. There were marble tops and floors in the bathroom but once again it seemed a little worn. There was a vanity with lights outside the bathroom...it was very 80's but a nice touch if updated. We had no use for the closet since we were there just one night but it was huge. Room service was very good, very quick and polite. We ordered 2 sandwiches one with fries, one with salad. We also ordered chicken fingers from the kids menu with fruit salad. It was great!!!! Very efficient, the gentleman who brought our food set up a table in the room and we rather enjoyed the dinner and experience. It cost about $50 which in the Chicago Michigan Avenue area at this is a good price for in-room dining for three. The fruit salad was out of this world not 3 pieces of melon thrown on the plate it had blueberries, rasberries, blackberries, cantalope and honeydew. The salad was also good not just a few pieces of iceburg....it had a european blend with carrots, tomatoes and cucumbers. The breakfast buffet was adequate. Not worth the $25 per person. Our daughter was free, but the buffet was not replenished and consisted of 2 types of eggs, sausage, bacon, fruit, yogurt and pastries...there was also some lox, capers, tomatoes and onions.

My name was always used and you felt the guest's experience was very important. Doormen taking the time to check cabs for left items when each guest departed a cab. When I pointed this out to one of the doormen his answer was \"This is your home while your in Chicago. I wouldn't want your time here to be ruined by a lost phone.\" I appreciate that, since it has happend before. This hotel also has a great lobby lounge, which is the perfect meeting place for socializing. The staff here is also quick and polite. Although I did not eat at the restaurant I have heard that it is very good too. The only drawback is the valet parking charge of $45 per day.

I had printed out the info from the Fairmont website before hand. The front desk clerk & then weekend manager at first said that you had to spend exactly $50.00 dollars for it to be applied. After I explained to her how absurd that would be she then proceed to rudely tell me it only applied per night, i.e. from check in to midnight was one night. Which made it impossible to have breakfast & dinner on the same day or breakfast on the day of checkout. It took 20 minutes to get it even partly right. They seemed to be perturbed that we would question their billing. The worst part of the ordeal was the attitude of the Manager on duty that at first refused to even credit any charges and then still left over $60.00 that should have been credited back. It was not the money that made us mad(we had 2 dinners elsewhere that each cost $250.00+ that weekend), it was the rudeness & ineptness of the manager that made me dig my heels in. I feel it was fraud to offer the promotion & not follow thru. For some reason the manager tried to set up her own rules & not follow the corporate policies.

As a member of the Fairmont President's Club, I was upgraded to a suite with a lake view. The hotel is situated a few blocks from Lakeshore Drive and a few condo towers block some of the view, but I loved looking out at the lake nonetheless. The lobby is very plush... if you squint, it looks like a Four Seasons. My suite was extremely well-maintained with new carpeting and wallpaper, but the style was a little like an early 90s Ritz-Carlton and somewhat underfurnished. The bed was not bad, not amazing. No plasma TVs here. The bathroom was large and mostly marble, but the shower stall was covered in cheap yellow bathroom tile... a weird choice but since the hotel dates back to the late 80s, probably original to the room. Another great thing... for a hotel of this size (almost 700 rooms), I never had to wait for an elevator. It does make a difference when you stay several days. On the weekend when I arrived, the hotel was full of families staying at the great weekend rate ($199). Alas, the one next door woke me at 6:15 AM with their screaming toddlers, who apparently were encouraged to be as loud and obnoxious as they could be by their parents for the next three hours. Finally had to call the front desk to complain. After the rude family checked out, however, the suite was very quiet. As the week progressed, the hotel filled up with a very nice, well-dressed international convention crowd. It made for a much nicer stay. Free internet access can be had in the business center for 30 minutes... a nice touch, considering the last Westin I stayed at charged me a dollar a minute to go online. Valet parking is $45 a night, with in and out privileges. You can probably do a little better in the numerous garages nearby, but not that much better. Had one breakfast in the hotel's very nice restaurant Aria... excellent service by a female server named Michael. The rest of the time, walked over to a little Italian place next to the Hotel 71 on the river (ask the concierge). It has a fantastic location, if they let you dine outside. If not, there's a Corner Bakery next door with outdoor dining. Weather permitting, I found it's a great city to dine outdoors in. The Fairmont is located on the south side of the river adjacent to the large Lakeshore East development of tall condo towers. There are very few restaurants nearby, and even fewer shops... but the setting is far less touristy than anything on Michigan Avenue, which is a relatively short walk away. The good news is you can easily walk to the amazing Art Institute and new Millennium Park a few blocks south. The latter features a stunning outdoor mirrored sculpture that was a highlight of my trip. They just started building (this week) a 900 foot high condo/hotel tower across the street called Aqua (which will apparently house another Fairmont Hotel) which may block the already partially obscured lake view. Also, the Blue Cross building across the street is also adding 24 stories to its height... so there may be some noise issues soon while staying at the Fairmont. But Chicago is in the middle of a building boom, so what can you do? All in all, the Fairmont was an excellent place to stay in a surprisingly great city. I had a wonderful time, in no small part to my spacious suite in the very well run hotel. Fairmonts (in my experience) aren't quite at the level of a Four Seasons or Ritz-Carlton, but when you can get one for a great price, they are a really tempting alternative. A few Chicago tips from my stay... the burger place at the Sheraton a few blocks away has really tasty burgers and a riverfront location with tables outside. There's also a tavern/restaurant called (I believe) Lizzie O'Neil's next door where they have a sidewalk dining under the trees and next to the river as well. I recommend the tuna sandwich. If you want to see the night scene on Rush Street (at the north end of Michican Avenue), the Tavern on Rush has pretty good food and the best sidewalk dining in the area. If you're lucky (or unlucky, in my opinion), you may even get to see a solo Jerry Springer walk by your table checking out the loud, happy people drinking and eating there. There's a charming outdoor dining area at the Art Institute with good food, really friendly service (which I didn't always find in Chicago) and amazing ambience under the leafy trees and adjacent to the large fountain. Definitely take the architectural river tour of Chicago's skyscrapers. Go to chicagoline.com for details (there are several of these tours, but this company does a smart, classy job with extremely well-informed guides and even gives you free lemonade and cookies). Good pizza can be found two blocks from the hotel at Giordano's (a chain in Chicago). Really good prices, surprisingly good food. One last thought: I have NEVER been to a city (and this includes New York and Beijing) where I have encountered ruder drivers. The cabbies will actively try to run you down (not kidding) if you enter a crosswalk in front of them, and local drivers are almost as aggressive. It's an unpleasant local trait that the city really needs to work on.

The furniture in the lounge of my suite was in a uniform grey cloth, while the bathroom and bedroom were an early '90s-style symphony in beige. And this, I think, is the key problem here - what looked modern and stylish ten or fifteen years ago now looks like \"posh Holiday Inn\", and is sorely in need of an update, but Chicago's well publicised shortage of hotel rooms means that management have no incentive to spend money on refurbishing. The characterlessness was only enhanced by the icy efficiency of the desk staff, who did little to make me feel welcome, or alleviate my rather shaky state of mind after a long, trans-atlantic flight. Like the room, they were impeccably presented and faultlessly efficient, but simply lacking in any charm. And so it goes on: the restaurant too, whilst serving perfectly good food, is utterly lacking in any soul. Perhaps it was simply my expectations that were out of line (I still have very happy memories of the Fairmont in Banff, where I spent 10 days of my honeymoon), as I'm sure that, by its own standards, the hotel is doing nothing wrong.

The hotel restaurant is well worth a visit (but a little overpriced). the hotel is well situated for trips down the Mag mile and Millenium Park. The concierge services are excellent. For those who want to have use of a fitness centre, this hotel is adjacent to one of the best in the Ciy - however, beware that there is a daily charge of $20 to use the facitilities, which certainly adds significantly to the overall cost of a city break, if like me, you're a frequent Gym attender. We both loved the City and our stay at the Fairmount and will definitley re-visit.", "Date": "April 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNice and clean\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4993594", "Content": "Paid about $700 incl. 2 night stay + United direct flights for two to Chicago this Easter on site59.

The bathroom was kind of dingy, and the lighting and fabrics had seen better days. The location also leaves something to be desired - it's a good 10-15 minutes walk away from the action north of the river (and it's a cold walk in February!). The views of Lake Michigan were quite nice, but there was also quite a bit of ongoing construction to look at in the same direction. On the upside, we had a terrific dinner at the (then brand-new) restaurant, Aria, which featured a fine selection of food and wine and above-average service. With so many other hotels to choose from in the area, I don't think I'd go back to the Fairmont at current prices, at least until it undergoes a major reno.

Aria restaurant is in the hotel. Good fusion, not amazing . adequate service. 2. Suite was large and well laid out. 3. Hallways and common spaces were up-to-date and well kept. Cons: 1. Rooms are terribly outdated, even the suites. We're talking major facelift required to bring it to 5-star level. 2. No coffee makers in rooms or suites. This is apparently due to the (possibly outdated) wiring system within the property. 3. No in room safes!!! 4. Exercise facilites are next door in a Chicago Health Club. 5. Wireless internet did not work in suite even after phone consultation. Summary: Staff was great. Room decor lacking. Location OKAY.

The service was likewise exceptional with a very courteous staff. Again, what you would expect at a property such as this. The guest rooms are a great size and the views are spectacular. I stayed in a one bedroom suite (2101) and the room's configuration is exactly what would would and should expect from a Fairmont property. First class. Bedroom furnishings were nice although some pieces (like a bedroom table) outdated and a little worn. The bed was very comfortable. The living room furnishings are a completely different story. No less than 4 stains in the carpet which looks at least 3 years old itself. Not horrible stains or ones which would want to make you always wear shoes or slippers but bad enough to make you wonder how a Fairmont property could allow this to happen. The sofa was worn, stained and sun-bleached. The arms on the two chairs (part of the living room grouping) were tattered and disgustingly dirty. These were dirty enough to make you want to avoid them. While it would certainly be costly for the Fairmont to refurbish its guest room furniture, you would think that it would simply consider such a project as the cost of doing business--particularly when numerous Trip Advisor consumers have reported the same complaints for an extended period of time. Many people put the Fairmont in the same category as a Ritz-Carlton or a Four Seasons hotel. NEITHER of those two chains would EVER, EVER permit this type of wear and tear.
