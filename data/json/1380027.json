Five Boutique Hotel is great for nice and warm stay. Where the staff is always ready to help. I liked it a lot because the price was excellent for what we had in this hotel, silence at night, clean, cozy, a small view to Istanbul, away from crowds. Also near Taksim (20 min walk),or 4 min walk to Osmanbey metro station, where you can go to Taksim in the next stop. Overall the hotel is nice price vs. stay. Excellent internet connection, and you are always asked for the service. And the manager is an excellent helping man and ready to hear any comments, Mr. Yasar Cetin. Thank you for the stay and hope to see you soon :)", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cMarvellous\u201d", "Author": "Penny M M", "ReviewID": "UR125155821", "Content": "This is a great little hotel on an unassuming street close enough to Taksim Sq but away from the hustle and bustle. First things first- Staff were friendly and helpful but unobtrusive. Organic boutique? We weren't really bothered about the organic side of things, we just wanted a reasonably priced, non-shabby place to stay. We were in Istanbul to see the sights, not to spend day and night inside. Having said this, it RAINED LIKE HELL when we were there and there were some days when we just stayed in bed..and it was LOVELY. I would recommend that you take one of the top rooms because you can pop on the balcony and see over the city. I shared a topfloor room with my friend and our other companion had the adjacent room so we could amble between the two - it was like our own mini apartmen and felt very private (I think they call this the family floor?). Larger room had a kingsized bed, both rooms very clean and pretty sleek in decor. (I cannot vouch for other rooms in the hotel because we didnt see them). Bathrooms were nice (Spotless, good shower, bath, organic toiletries) The rainy days we spent in very comfy bed watching telly and drinking tea. Totally relaxing. The breakfast (in the cafe downstairs) was traditional cold foods set out on tables like a small buffet (Muesli, natural yogurt, honey, dried fruit, fresh fruit, cheeses, meat, bread etc). You can request cooked food such as eggs which they'll prepare as you wish. There is a small TV to catch up on the news (I noticed that when we went down to breakfast, the staff would change the channel to BBC for us, much to the dismay of the Germans already sat there) The one negative thing I would say is that the lift smells a bit sewage-y - I'm guessing they cant do anything about this, it must be the position of the liftshaft. Anyway, it's no big deal. Other than that, I dont really have a bad word to say about this place :)", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai", "Title": "\u201camazing hotel\u201d", "Author": "jlo86", "ReviewID": "UR122501468", "Content": "if you want a little ,nice, romantic and not expensive hotel in center of the Istanbul this is a great hotel. it is clean ,it is friendly ,it is beautiful. we were for new years eve ,and city was crowded ,but hotel was our oasis of peace I highly recommend this hotel.

I booked Connected 2 Family Rooms for five nights at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Five Boutique Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and what a disappointment !!!! - Upon arrival to the hotel on Thursday July 21st we have been greeted by the front office manager and he told me that he have one small problem that one of my two rooms are not ready as the leady who was staying at the room will not leave until midnight. After some argument and convincing him that I booked the rooms from the mid of April (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3 months before), he went and talk to the lady and convinced her to move to another room. - After waiting for around 30 minutes for the room to be ready, the front office manager came again and told that he has another small problem that the AC in one of the rooms is not working and they faced some technical problem and it will be solved by tomorrow, you can imagine the situation with 3 kids tired and hungry, and after a long discussion, arguments and promises that the hotel is fully booked and this is a temporary situation and the AC will be fixed by tomorrow. I agreed to check in and put the luggage in the larger room (the one with no AC) and me, my wife and the three kids spend the night in the smaller room, two of us slept on the bed, one on the sofa bed and the other two we put blankets and slept on the floor. - Our two rooms was on the 7th floor and the tiny elevator goes only to the fifth floor and the remaining two floors you have to use the stairs, but no problem we are in holiday and you have always to think positive and not to let small thing ruin your family vacation. - The second morning and after having our organic breakfast which is in all the means not sufficient and has no verity specially for the little ones, I sat with front office manager and after thanking me for my understanding, I explained to him that we spent a horrible night and I will not allow it to happened again, he kept promising me that this AC thing will be fixed by afternoon. - I told him that today is my wedding anniversary and I heard about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Al Jamal restaurant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as a very decent restaurant and requested him to help me doing a booking for me and my wife and he did thankfully. - I went with my family for a tour to the Aya Sofya, Sultan Ahmet mosque and Topkapi Sarayi and after my kids had their dinner we went to hotel around 8:00 pm to change and to go with my wife to celebrate our anniversary, when we reached the hotel I asked for the front office manager and I have been told by bell boy that he went home and he is sorry to tell me that the maintenance people didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show up and the AC didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fixed but he promised that will be fix by tomorrow !!! - You can imagine my feeling and my reaction, I started to lose my temper and threating to call the police in the face of the poor bill boy (who hardly speak English), the bell boy after he was refusing to call his boss and when he heard the word police he grape his mobile and call the boss who was excusing that it is the maintenance company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problem not his and it will solve by tomorrow, I made myself clear that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to put my family for another night of misery and threating to call to police unless to be paid back for the remaining four nights, the Boss finally agreed and gave his instruction to the bill boy to write me a debit note for the refund of the four nights to be paid to me on Monday because they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have money at the hotel and the bank closed for Saturday and Sunday. - It is 9:30 pm now I found myself and my family with no accommodation in busy city like Istanbul at the busiest time of year, I told my wife and kids to pack our stuff until I find another hotel, it took me more than 3 hours and checking 25 hotels all of them fully booked, have one room or only for a night or two. Finally and through one of the travel agent I found two rooms at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Central Palace Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which was a way way better comparing to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Five Boutique Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I went back to the hotel, took my family and the luggage, of course I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get any help from any one to get the luggage down through the stairs and the tiny elevator, everybody was looking at me as a bad news and glade to get rid of me. - I checked at the Central Palace Hotel around 1:00 am, I was tired, frustrated and angry from the worst three hours . - Thank you \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Five Boutique Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for ruin my anniversary, for ruin two days of my 5 days\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vacation and most of all for the tension I found myself in looking for a hotel at the middle of the night. - I went on Monday and I found my money with the reception with no word of apology or any kind of compensation above of that the reception before giving me the money he requested to sign a disclaimer that I will not decline the payment paid by the credit card and not request any financial damage (which I did) but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m writing this review for anyone who is planning to stay there to think again !!! it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth it !!!!! After telling my personal experience, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s critique and evaluate the hotel in logical way: - Location: the hotel The hotel located on a side street, the street has a very sharp slop, so you have to watch out if you have kids with stroller, the hotel is 10-15 minutes walking to Taxim square and Istiktal Street. - The rooms: the rooms I booked was in the 7th floor, one is convenient in size, but the second one was an attic kind of room, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m 170 cm in tall I can walk only o the middle of the room then I have to bend. - The breakfast: The breakfast was limited and no much choice specially for kids, coffee and tea taste horrible. - Cleanness: I can say it was OK. - Value of money: overrated, overpriced hotel because of the mambo jumbo of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Organic Designation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - Is the Hotel is Four star ???? absolutely not a Two or maybe Three star. - Last advice: there are many hotels in the area with better location closer to Taxim Square, Istiktal Street and the Metro station, with much better amenities and services with the same range of rate.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ankara, Turkey", "Title": "\u201ccomme ci comme \u00c3\u00a7a\u201d", "Author": "EmreC", "ReviewID": "UR116208708", "Content": "At least it was clean.

Although I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not written reviews before, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had a fair amount of experience of varying hotels and levels of service. My first night was in a small room and I was told that I would be moved to a larger room for the subsequent nights of my stay. Whilst out the next day, without my notification, my possessions & valuables were moved to the alternative room, which I felt was a little too forward of the hotel. One night my girlfriend stayed with me at the hotel and to my surprise I was informed that a charge of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30 would be incurred for this \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I feel this was a product of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greed and was not in character of a personalised service fitting a boutique hotel or any other hotel for that matter. The second time my girlfriend stayed with me at the hotel, we spoke to the night manager and he assured us that the fee for having a guest stay the night would be waved however this was not to be, which left me with a sense of distrust towards the staff. On my last day, a porter knocked on the door and I asked his business, he said he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d come to check the mini bar before I check out. As I was not descent I asked him to come back later yet he still proceeded to open my door with his key, this was to be repeated a second time which was I feel is quite a very basic courtesy and an infringement on privacy. Also, I discovered that the taxi rank the hotel use for their guests pay for the hotels custom, so I feel that guests would a better deal if they were to find their own taxi rather than request one via the hotel. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only lift smells of sewage which judging by other reviews seems to be the case for some time now. One final point I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to make, Mr Yilmaz Cetin was the General Manager during my stay and during checking out, I mentioned that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be writing a review of my experience to which he responded with the statement, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for each bad review the hotel receives, I assure you we will receive 10 very good reviews\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, read whatever you will into that. My experience of boutique hotels to date have been very satisfying and I prefer the intimacy of boutique hotels to larger corporate hotels. In general my stay was not a terrible one, however, Five Boutique Hotel I feel did not offer the kind of bespoke level of service I would expect of boutique hotels and are certainly not fitting of a four star hotel.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cCharming Boutique Hotel in the hearth of Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "ugurdy", "ReviewID": "UR106302475", "Content": "First of all, the location is amazing! you can walk almost anywhere near her or transportation to the Old Istanbul such as Sultanahmet, Palaces etc. As you can see in its name, it is a boutique hotel and surprisingly unique complex in Turkey as Organic Hotel!

I have Turkish parents and have been to Turkey quite a bit, yet this was the first time with my husband so we opted to stay in a hotel rather than with family. Having been to Istanbul many times, I am quite familiar with localities of the tourist attractions and where the \"it\" place to be is. Hence why I chose this hotel. We were swinging between the Ramada which is up the road, and Five Boutique but what appealed to me about Five B, is the price and that it is independantly owned. I have found in the past, independantly owned hotels are far more hospitable than those of a large chain. I was spot on with this hotel! The receptionists greeted us with smiles at our arrival which was past 11pm and helped us up to our room, and never failed to greet us as we saw them each morning/night as we left/returned to the hotel. The Standard room was large enough to move about comfortably and the bathroom was modern and clean. The room is equipped with a split system heater/airconditioner which worked with ease. The hotel also has free wifi which is a bonus. We opted not to have breakfast at the hotel as I wanted to show my husband how Turks do it the traditional way and we ate outside. In terms of location, it's close to public transport and short work from Taksim Square which is a must to visit - heaps of retail and cafe/restaurants. The only doubt I had was regarding the hotel was the negative comments on Trip Advisor about the smell in the lift. I don't fully agree with the harsh comments as the smell was not so bad that it was intolerable. The lift also has a automatic air freshener which releases perfume periodically which obviously was put in place because of complaints. We spoke to the manager just to get some insight as to why this happens and he explained that as it is such an old building the sewage system is under the building. To fix the problem would mean that they would have to demolish the whole hotel and reinstall the sewage and rebuild. Seriously, people need to get over it, it's not like you are sleeping in the elevator.

First, it is a very small and (looks like) family-driven hotel. It is probably an old apartment building that has been refitted like a hotel not long ago. That's OK, gives some caracther. PROS: - The hotel seems new, so that's good. Very clean and proper. - Small size, it is different from the typical big Western chain. - Staff is corteous (though English is quite bad, but that's Turkey and nobody speaks anything but Turkish). So it is OK. - Location is very convenient. If you have never been to IST: Sulaimaniye is the old-town where most touristic stuff is, but at evening-night is DEAD. So better stay in the North shore (Istanbul is huge btw). Taksim is Istanbul's Times Square, so you better stay there. There are many hotels in Istiktal Street (next to Taksim) BUT the area is unbelievably noisy and crowded 24/7. The hotel is 10 minutes-walk from there, in a tiny street perpendicular to a big boulevard (next to Hilton) in a nice & good residential area. - Price was good for location/quality. MINUS: - This is not a 4-star hotel. Let's say 2 or 3. - Breakfast is anything but organics, but it is just a typical breakfast (not that bad, but why place the organic?). - The hotel is new so everything works OK. But u can see that the finishes in the room are not the best, so I feel in a few years it will be not the best place to be. - Room is OK but pretty uninspiring. I would recommend it based on the relation price/location/quality and the fact that whilst it is very very central and well-located, it is also in a very quiet area so you can feel more like living in Istanbul and not only visiting (and sleep well at night with no noise from the busy Istanbul streets and avenues).", "Date": "October 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cairo, Egypt", "Title": "\u201csimple hotel; excellent location\u201d", "Author": "Cairo_traveler", "ReviewID": "UR81220896", "Content": "you really have everything you need in this small, cozy hotel which is superbly located. walking distance from Taksim and walking distance from Osmanbey Metro station and shops.", "Date": "September 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Socal", "Title": "\u201cOver rated, not so organic, needs to be more hygienic, food is terrible, staff very nosy\u201d", "Author": "sk124", "ReviewID": "UR76943586", "Content": "Long review, but worth reading before considering this place... Stayed here for 4 nights. First impression and first night was okay, it felt clean, staff was friendly, but by the 2nd night, you start to realize a little bit more about the place. The hotel always smelled like a public washroom, especially the elevator and hallways. The bathrooms, even in the superior (best room in the hotel) were terrible, mould in the corner of showers, and rooms are not consistent. You can pay 54 euros for a single room and that's more than enough, I would recommend you NOT to pay the 100+ euros for the superior or deluxe since it is essentially the same thing. I stayed in all three types of rooms, the single deluxe and superior and found some rooms has things others didn't no consistency. Like a simple thing like a reading lamp was available in the single, but not in a superior. Did they run out of furniture? Even general maintenance is lacking, light bulbs need to be replaced, air conditioner is loud and noisy (good luck sleeping with that on). As for cleanliness, bedsheets always had the \"slept in\" already feel to them, which is terrible when they should be crisp and smell fresh upon first use. I can still smell this hotel days later, just thinking about that place irritates me. It is a decent place for one night since it is very modern and not a hole in the wall, but if they clean it better it could be so much more. Organic breakfast was charming the first day, but then got tiring and just unappealing. Same things wrapped and reused the next day, stale breads, and let me mention the FLIES all over the tomatoes, cucumbers, and cheeses.. we skipped this free breakfast and found better options outside worth paying for.. even the tea is terrible, coffee was diluted.. couldnt get a decent hot drink in this place... Organic shampoos and soaps a nice addition, they are trying hard I give them credit but they are luring you in with the false pretense that it's all organic. I know this because I saw a staff member filling \"organic shampoo bottles\" with some other soap... nice try buddy.. As for staff, they are all very helpuful, but extremely nosy and intrusive. They ask too many questions, and this doesn't pass for curiosity it's downright pathetic. I came back to my room late one night with my wife around 1am, and she went upstairs first, one of the hotel staff approached me and said it costs extra to have \"guests\". On top of that the room KEYS NEVER WORKED the entire stay so every time you want to enter your room, a hotel staff has to take you up now at 1am in the morning and i'm tipsy with my wife, we just want to get into our room privately. This hotel is very concerned about being payed right away, two times a day they come into the room to check the minibar, which is irritating when I'm with my wife getting down to business.. or trying to. I wouldn't stay here ever again, thought we would try a little boutique hotel but next time it's the Hilton across the street..

I am originally from Turkey, and I know Istanbul fairly well, and I made the mistake to read the reviews on this website and booked a room in this hotel. We booked this hotel with a large group of friends (inluding some family and bf) for the close proximity to Taksim and the metro. I wanted to make sure that I could show people a good time, since it was their first trip to Turkey. Boy what a disappointment. First of all, the hotel is located in the Red Light District of Istanbul. So expect to see lots of travestis after midnight in the area (if you decide to walk to the hotel). Second, the hotel management is comfortable admitting people with Russian hookers overnight (we actually ran into some when we were checking out, and boy it was a scene). Lastly, the hotel decided to charge us 30 euros for the hotel shuttle, which is absolutely ridiculous, and the only reason we accepted it was because he assured us that this would be the best service we get. However, the hotel shuttle ended up being super late and we almost missed the flight. Turns up the concierge is friends with the shuttle driver and that's why he was trying to rip us off, and he didn't even offer us to pay back the 65 liras we gave him after the shuttle being so late. Not only that, the shuttle driver YELLED at us, because we were demanding for some of our money back. SO UNPROFESSIONAL. If you really want to save money, seriously get a cab (which will cost you around 40 liras), or take the Havas Shuttle which is 10 liras per person in front of Taksim Square (they're super professional). Lastly, if you are looking for a great experience, try The Marmara Pera. Can't beat the location, and if you book it through tripadvisor or another website like that, you can get the same deal, but a much better/professional experience.

The hotel is situated in a trendy and upmarket location - Osmanbey where the metro station is a 10 minute walk and Nisantasi - a very chic and upmarket shopping and fine dining precinct is only a 5 minute walk. The area is very peaceful, but nevertheless you are able to arrive at all other destinations with ease. We managed to visit quite a few wonderful places all with the use of the Osmanbey Metro (Levent, Cihangir, Istinye Park, Kadikoy) just to name a few. Of course if you prefer to be in the madness and chaos of Beyoglu where Istiklal Street is, Five Boutique is an altogether different experience and much more pleasurable! The Hotel itself was only recently constructed and is quite tastefully furnished with quality furniture and room sizes being quite generous in proportion to other larger chain-type hotel rooms. Our room on the 2nd floor 212 was opulent in design with a bay window type terrace, floorboards throughout, airconditioning, quality light fittings and furnishings. A peaceful nights rest was always guaranteed despite the location of the window looking onto the street. The breakfast each morning comprised of organic type cereals, organic tomatoes/cucumbers, olives, cured meats, different type cheeses and wonderful homemade preserves which you could eat by the spoonful (sour cherry, strawberry, fig, rose petal and orange). Breads of a different variety with imbedded chese, olives, plain, wholemeal were plentiful and well as declicious savoury puffs or cakes with sultanas or cocoa. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful and will go out of their way to assist with any request. I requested the use of a laptop to secure airline seats for our return journey to Sydney and I was provided with a laptop and printer immediately and all with a smile. It would be true to say that Five Boutique is like staying in your home away from home, a unique family type atmosphere which you do not have when you stay in the larger chain type hotels.

We were attending a medical congress which was at the congress centre just five minutes' walk away, so the location was completely ideal for this. We had had a short holiday before the congress for which we'd stayed in one of the big American hotel chains down in the old city in a tiny upper floor room. Of the two experiences I much preferred this hotel, in that the service was friendly and much more personal and you didn't get the sense of endless tour parties coming in and out day after day like a conveyor belt,in contrast this was a more personalised exprience. I also felt very comfortable with the genuine warmth and honesty of the staff in all the advice and help they gave us. Of course travellers are all different and some may prefer the bland standardisation of the big hotel chains. If all you want is a holiday experience consisting of booking in to a massive hotel, eating three meals a day there amid the musicans and designer shops and going on some tours then stay in the old city. But if you want the freedom to come and go as you please from the base of a large and comfortable room with a great balcony, and the back-up of some friendly local staff as you explore Istanbul then I would choose this hotel every time. One last point, the hotel is quite well plced for public transport. You can get to Taksim by taking a bus from the main road about 1 minute from the hotel, it takes about 5 mins by bus or 15 mins to walk to Taksim, or 10 mins if you walk up to Osmanbey Metro station and get the subway 1 stop. From Taksim in addition to the subway you also have the new funicular to get down to the trams and Ferries at Kabatas (I'd highly recommend taking the ferry to Uskador on the Asian side for the raw atsmosphere of a non-touristy area).

The free wi-fi was accessible in our room-up on the 5th floor, which was nice. Strangely enough they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a public laptop nor a data cable for my husband who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s laptop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wifi facility was not working (but they did have ports in each room to use for the internet).The breakfast was awful-they keep talking about how everything is organic but I thought it all tasted bad! We were never asked for tea-we had to go up and ask the waiter for it. The hot part (eggs, sausages and egg-toast) of the breakfast was always ice cold-and we stayed here 3 days. The bread was not nice, and there was one fruit or none available in the buffet. My husband said that the jams were great as was the cereal but I had nothing to eat as all the rest was very bad. They were lazy about refreshing the buffet, and the waiter understood limited English. He also made us herbal tea (that was extra) without telling us it was not included in the buffet.The receptionist was helpful but always busy so it was hard to take any help. The rooms were clean but housekeeping didn't wash my used tea-cups all 3 days we were there.The location is not great at all-It's a long walk to Taksim-about 15 minutes. The location is safe enough but after a long day, it's tiring to walk 15 minutes to this place. The other metro is at Osmanbey which was again a 10-12 minute walk. Only Nisantasi is closer-about 7-10 minutes. 20 minutes to Istikal Caddessi (shopping and restaurant area). It is not close to any nightclubs, nor is it close to shopping or any historical sites. The only thing it's close to is all the Airline offices! One can catch an airport bus from Taksim Square but if you're more than 1 person, it's cheaper to get a taxi as the bus costs 17 TL/ person while the taxi costs about 38 TL.", "Date": "October 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel for the Value\u201d", "Author": "Ekens", "ReviewID": "UR46367001", "Content": "Eken family-Chicago We stayed at the Five Boutique Hotel for a week and had a wonderful time.Hotel is located on the side street, few buildings from from the Cumhuriyet Caddesi.

Our standard room was small, but ,light colored furniture made it bright and airy. It had plenty of closet space. Everything in the room was very clean and worked perfectly. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Our great appreciation goes to them.Breakfast room was delightful. It had an atrium feeling to it. Turkish and continental style food was plentiful. Service was excellent. There is a subway station (Osmanbey) few blocks away. It takes you to a big Shopping \"Mall-Metro City\". Metro station is located conveniently in the Mall. There is an excellent food court , Migros Supermarket and lots of stores. Chic Nisantasi district with designer boutiques and cafes are 10 minute walk away.We also highly recommend our favorite fast food restaurant SARAY, with their authentic Turkish food , at bargain prices.

It definitely doesn't deserve the fist place. The hotel is ok, new, clean, with a very special smell - probably some cleaning product, but not peasant at all. We booked a simple room witch is small. You should book a bigger one if you intend to stay more than 2 days. The good things are the free pick-up at the airport and the free wi-fi in the rooms. The service is friendly but that doesn't mean necessarily good. The neighborhood is very commercial. There is a subway station nearby who can be practical depending where you are going. For cultural sightseeing it is not the best address. Taxis aren't so easy to communicate with in Istanbul and there aren't nice restaurant nearby.

I've stayed in some very scummy hotels here in the past, and this was a huge improvement. The price was excellent, and staying for three nights meant that we got a free transfer from the airport. The check-in was painless, and the staff friendly. The lift was tiny, but since I was only on the second floor, I didn't use it again as the stairs are very convenient. The hotel seems fairly new, but may start to look a bit worn quite quickly as the room furniture was all flatpack and some of it was already showing signs of wear. However, everything was very clean, and the bathroom was very pleasant with excellent plumbing and a nice shower enclosure. The organic toiletries were a nice touch and made it seem more personal than the big chain hotels. The bed was huge and very comfortable and the room was quiet at night. Aircon worked well, and wi-fi was free - excellent. Minibar was well stocked and had a nice range of organic juices as well as the usual coke and sprite. Breakfast was served downstairs and was plentiful and varied and very fresh. There was a small convenience store over the road, and bus-stops and taxis at the top of the street. Take a hotel business card with you though as the cab-drivers don't yet know where it is and they'll need the address. I'd consider staying here as a tourist - the price was a bargain, there are some nice restaurants in the vicinity, and it is a lot quieter than the madness near Seraglio Point.", "Date": "September 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sicily, Italy", "Title": "\u201cHow disappointing!\u201d", "Author": "Elix1", "ReviewID": "UR41388382", "Content": "We booked this hotel after reading the positive comments on this website and decided to book for 4 nights.

The room was nice and spacious but dirty. The bathroom was kept in a bad manner with hair all over the shower and 2 towels on the floor hidden under the tub.

Also they do not change towels and sheets; even if you ask to have it changed by putting them on the floor. The breakfast is ok.

The complimentary airport pick-up service was a stress-free way to begin our vacation. The staff at the hotel greeted us kindly upon arrival, and continued to be kind and helpful during our stay. The room itself was roomy, and included a balcony (no view) where my husband could smoke. The room was remarkably quiet -- we heard no noise from other rooms or from the street. The bed was very comfortable, the linens and bath towels were terrific, the air conditioning responsive. The hotel offered in-room wi-fi, which we used. Each morning we had a fabulous breakfast -- cheese and olives, vegetables, hard-boiled eggs, bread (with a toaster available), many interesting preserves and jams (fig, rose, strawberry, etc.), cereals, dried fruits, juice, yogurt -- that got me through the day. It was Ramadan, and I wasn't interested in eating publicly during the daytime out of respect for those who were fasting. Reading another reviewer's difficulty with keys, I can only report the opposite experience. When I returned later than my husband one night, and found that he (a sound sleeper) didn't answer the door when I knocked, I went to the front desk to ask that someone let me into the room. I was given a second key for the two nights that remained. I was asked to be sure to return it, so perhaps there has been difficulty with stolen keys in the past. I only know that I was accommodated. The location is about 10 blocks north of Taksim Square, a nice walk in the morning. If we didn't want to walk, we took buses that stop at the top of the street. We could get anywhere that we wanted to go from Taksim, either by bus, Metro or tram. What I liked best about the Five Boutique was the feeling that it was a home (except a lot cleaner than my own...). The staff felt like family (for a little while on the last two or three nights of our stay, I discussed English usage with one member of the staff, and got answers to questions I had about Turkish), and I was as comfortable as I am in my own home.", "Date": "September 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maine", "Title": "\u201cBest convention hotel ...period.\u201d", "Author": "StevanMaine", "ReviewID": "UR41306485", "Content": "Chosen for proximity to convention center, it did indeed turn out to be the absolurte closest. But then things got even better, the wonderful airy breakfast and breakfast room and best breakfast I've had in a number of countries added up. Then there was the fantastic staff who arranged a reception on no notice that was stunning. Staff were as attentive as at the Ritz where I have thought they provided the best in attention. Having a tour guide on the staff means they can take care of any request. Then if you stay for more than 3 days there is the free transfer to and from the airport which in Istanbul is wonderful as the driver can be implicitly trusted. Note that HIlton charges 80 Lira for the same transfer. Soundproofing was great, neighborhood quiet. Tiny convenience store across the street and great haircutter two shops up the street. And then you are as well exactly only 1 block from the Mehter band at the MIlitary museum up the street 1 block every day at 3 except 2 days a week.
