I sayd \"NO, it's enought!!!!\". The wi fi is not good in all the rooms, sometimes it loose the connection. The breakfast is very hearty, but the quality is medium (industrial stuff). Good just the fresh fruit and the yogurt. After some days it sicks. The cleaness of the rooms are insufficient: I found hairs in to the bath tub.They made the beds every days but not always clean the rooms and the bathroom. Positive: they gibe a bottle of wate and a pot of tea every day. the curtains of the rooms are insufficient, so if you don't like the sun in the rooms during the morning it is not confortable.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest, Romania", "Title": "\u201cVery clean hotel - good value for money\u201d", "Author": "Mhn22", "ReviewID": "UR94530287", "Content": "The hotel is conveniently placed - close to Aksaray square - so that the main places of interest are within walking distance.

The tram, which is only a five min. walk from the hotel, will take you to Sultanahmet in fifteen mins. As the weather was surprisingly warm and mild during our stay, we walked to the city centre on several occasions,which only took us about twenty mins. at a leisurely pace. the hotel itself is small and cosy. There is an elevator, which you can take from the first floor. The lobby area is nicely decorated and there is a guest computer with free Internet access. We stayed in a tripple room on the sixths floor,which had a nice view of the sea. Even though it faced a busy shopping street, we didn't have much problem sleeping at night. The interior of the room was plane, and though it was not particularly spacious, it served the purpose. It was also cleaned regularly. What I found lacked in this otherwise fine hotel was a friendly attitude of the reception staff. Sami was the one exception: he was very sociable and friendly. The rest were rather cold and at times indifferent. Another thing that somewhat spoiled my impression of the hotel was an incident involving the 'free' airport transfer that is advertised on the hotel website. As it turned out,though the one way transfer was indeed free, we were expected to fork out 45 euros (later reduced to 25) for our return transfer. I refused to do so, as my family did not require a return transfer. The hotel manager had to be called in,who reluctantly agreed to honour the offer advertised on his hotel's website. All in all, the hotel was a great bargain for the price we paid (as we had booked over six months in advance), but the dodgy transfer offer and the attitude of some of the staff (which probably had something to do with my refusal to pay for the 'free' offer) were the only disappointments in what was otherwise a nice stay.

The staff are not so friendly (besides one guy there called Simeh who also speaks perfect English).They keep nagging day and night to take you to places, which they claim are must-sees, which gave me a feeling they are getting commission. Actually, they were nagging so much for us to go to a place called SULTANA, and they mislead us with their description of it and asked us maybe 15 times in 2 days to pay before the place gets packed. When we arrived, the place was almost completely empty and the food quality was terrible and was not a buffet nor had \"sheesha\" as claimed. The location of the hotel is very good, close to all the touristic areas, the internet availability sure adds a lot. The rooms are incredibly small.

The room was clean and had a balcony, a nice feature as sometimes hotel rooms can feel like prison cells. The breakfast was good - fruit, cereal, drinks, cakes, cheese, meats, etc. The breakfast room was on the top floor so you can see South towards the Marmara. The staff in the breakfast room were very efficient - every table was remade as soon as the diners left not like some hotels where you can never find a table that hasn't been used. All of the tables were immaculate and you would think noone ever came to breakfast. My only compaint is that one of the towels was dirty - it had maybe not been checked properly and left by a previous guest - but you know, these things happen. Oh and the rooms have thin walls so sound can travel. Semii is very helpful and is American Turkish so no language barriers. There are lots of shops around and the tram stop is a few minutes walk.
