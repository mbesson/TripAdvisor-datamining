Their billing is quite unscrupulous. On 3/30/12, my wife made a hotel reservation for the Silverado Resort in the amount of $450.26 through Kayak for a two-night stay with her credit card. The entire stay for the hotel was paid in full from 4/6 through 4/8. When we checked in 4/6, I left my credit card at the front desk to cover incidentals for the stay. On 4/10/12, I noticed the hotel had charged me a second time for the stay. This time, the charge was $451.68. After seeing the 2nd charge, I immediately called the hotel to let them know there was an error. The front desk rep (Terry) said that the resort cannot refund my money until they are paid by Kayak. I informed Terry that the transfer of payments set forth in the agreements Silverado has with 3rd parties, such as Kayak, are covered under the Terms & Conditions with those particular parties. My wife paid through a 3rd party with payment protected under the agreement with Kayak. I educated Terry on the fact that these backend payment transactions are settled through the Resort's relationships with 3rd parties and do not involve the hotel guest with the exception of incidentals. She abruptly told me that I'd have to settle this with the book keeping dept. I left a message on 4/12 & 4/13 and I'm still waiting to hear back. After calling again on 4/13 to ask for a status, Terry answered the phone with a \"YES!\", instead of \"Thank you for calling Silverado\". I Googled the hotel manager (Nikolay Tevekeliyski | Director of Guest Experience) and left a voicemail for him at his office. I have yet to hear back. From the threads on TripAdvisor, I see that the only way to get a response from the hotel is to post a comment here. So here it is. I'm still waiting Silverado. On Friday (4/13), I said that if I don't hear back by close of business, I'll do a merchant-chargeback. The deadline has come and passed.

One caveat before I go into details. I'm not a golfer, so maybe the golf is so good it makes up for all the rest of it. Below I detail the pros and cons. Pros: --spacious suite with full living room, kitchen and bedroom with a very comfortable bed --quiet evenings so a good night's sleep --very pretty grounds, if that kind of thing is important to you. Cons: --fairly distant from any other sites, so unless you want to drive back toward Napa, you're stuck here. --the free wireless was so slow sometimes it wasn't even viable. --the $20 \"resort fee\" gives you some basics (internet, parking, paper). But, calling it a resort fee makes it impossible for many conference attendees to expense it. --there was tempered glass in a window next to the door with no curtain so you can see shadows of people in their room. As a woman traveling alone, that makes me uncomfortable. --the small window in the bathroom didn't shut. I don't think a person could get thru it, but it still made me feel uncomfortable. --my TV only got 5 channels and after 3 visits they still couldn't get it fixed. --the wood burning fireplace only burns fake logs and they don't replace them once you have burned them. --the bath was so small the door hits the toilet. --when they picked up my room service tray, they threw the uneaten food into my waste can, which created a smelly room -- are you kidding me? --the room service menu was supposedly 'out of date' and the newer options they gave me were higher priced. Scam? --my final bill had 2 meals in their restaurant on it that weren't mine. Hopefully everyone checks their bills when they leave. That was nearly $100 in charges that were not mine. --a small issue, but something that is basic at all hotels: they never replenished my toiletries, and I was there for 3 nights. --as others have mentioned, the decor is old fashioned. Bottom line is that this is an overpriced resort that is resting on the laurels of looking like an upscale luxury venue, but just doesn't live up to it.

I will say that the room was clean & decorated nicely. It burns me that because it's the famous Napa Valley, so many places get away with charging rates for rooms that in any other town would go for at least 30% less. And the $20/day resort fee was a joke. We got ours refunded because we didn't get the newspaper (we stayed on a Saturday night), there was zero chance to use the tennis courts (it was raining) and since we were only staying the one night, we had no intention of using the fitness center.

When we arrived at 6:00 p.m. we were told we would have to wait 10 minutes so they can make sure our room was \"fresh\". After waiting we were given our keys and was told to park in an area that was relatively far from our unit even though there was parking available right in front. When we walked into the room we were shocked to see how small it was. It was barely big enough to fit a king size bed and nothing more. The bathroom was also very small with a toilet that most adults would have a hard time fitting on. The shower/tub combination had a showerhead which was about 5 1/2 feet high so an average height adult would have to do a lot of bending to use. We contacted the front desk and explained we were not happy with the room as it was very small and was on hold for several minutes when I just hung up the phone and went back to the lobby. As there were several steps to the lobby and I had knee surgery just a couple of weeks previous I had my wife talk to the front desk clerk. She came out several minutes later and told me they could put us in another room that was not much bigger. I then went in to talk to the hotel manager and was told by her that all the rooms were privately owned and individually decorated. I explained to her that wasn't my concern, that the size was my concern. After showing me an attitude and having me wait several more minutes while she made sure the room was \"made up\" she came to me with the key and told me that she is giving me a \"complimentary upgrade\" which occured approximately 1 hour after we initially checked in.

As others have pointed out the service at the hotel is excellent and the hotel and surrounding areas were beautiful. My one concern was the room layout which was odd. There was no window in the room, the entrance to the room was a sliding glass door. If you closed the curtains for privacy there was no way to see out. If you left the curtains open to be able to see out, then anyone passing by could see EVERYTHING in the room. The room should have a curtain that is solid for the bottom 2/3rd but mesh for the top 1/3rd so that when it is closed people can't see into the room, but you can still see the sky and let some natural light in. The other problem with the room was that the sink was outside with the beds and so the bathroom was very small and just had the toilet and the shower. This made getting ready in the morning awkward as the bathroom was too small to get dressed in. The only other slight negative is that the wifi was REALLY slow at times. However overall this is a wonder hotel and the excellent service really made up for any short comings of the room layout.

I was very relieved when we got there - we had a great experience! We travel quite a bit and although this was not a new, modern resort it had everything we needed and the grounds were beautiful. Our Room: We had the one bedroom Fireplace Suite with a golf course view (2nd floor). The room was recently redecorated and VERY nice. Large sliding windows with curtains you could easily close. The view of the golf course was amazing. The sunrise was beautiful coming up over the mountain. We had a nice kitchen with refrigerator, and everything we needed. We enjoyed our wine in the dining area and also had a nice living room with a plasma TV (overlooking the course). The king bed was very comfortable and I loved the bathroom with the \"heater\". Mornings are cold in Napa. Dining: We purchased the package that included breakfast. We received two $25.00 gift certificates every day we were there. There is a wonderful breakfast buffet on the weekends with an omelet bar and a regular breakfast menu on weekdays. The food was great. We did not have lunch or dinner at the resort - we were too busy driving around to the different vineyards and towns north of Napa. Spa: We had a pedicure and a massage. The women in the salon were very nice to visit with and did a great job. No problems at all - it was nice. We had a great 50 minute massage (should have purchased 90 minutes). It went too fast! The spa was clean and nice. It wasn't the most modern spa I have ever been to, but it was nice and clean. Great staff. Golf: My husband said that the golf was amazing. The greens were in good shape. The staff was very helpful. He did say that he preferred the North course, but the South course was still nice! We watched Johnny Miller as he taught a golf class one morning. Overall, the resort is very nice. If you are looking for something similar to the Four Seasons, you will not find it in Napa. This place is older, but it has character and we did not have any problems with the staff. There were a few conventions going on while we were there, but they did not let it interfere with our activities. You check into the main \"lodge\" and then drive to your room. We had covered parking right in front of our room. We walked to breakfast every day in the main lodge. Remember that this is the ONLY resort in Napa that includes two golf courses on site.

The room types and locations are not becoming of a resort which pitches itself way upmarket and it's not a good choice for an event. OK, I arrived very early, but it was annoying to have to wait several hours for \"my\" room when colleagues who arrived later were immediately given rooms - in this day and age, is it really impossible to allocate rooms on arrival, especially for a large group (there appeared to be no room hierarchy, colleagues had random types of rooms)? I think I must have had the most basic type of room, but it was clean, the floor (I had a ground-floor room) in basin area and bathoom (which did have a tub, with shower over) was tiled, everything worked and the only slightly worn looking area was the carpet in the bed area - but it wasn't stained etc. I think a crucial thing here is to get a nice size and location of room. I was in the 700's area and each building has 4 suites and 4 singles split on two floors. The singles look towards the garages and then the road. The room, for a \"resort\" was surprisingly small - the king bed pretty well filled it. The patio area was very small with a high fence and would really only have been suitable as a smoking area, and not as a nice place to sit outside. You always hope on these trips you're going to get a nice room but my heart sank when I walked into the room and even the bellman seemed embarassed about it. I was surprised the shampoo/conditioner etc was only replaced as it ran out - by the end of my stay I was using a sliver of soap! It would be OK to leave the part used ones, but once the originals have been opened, new items should be provided. Decent sized bottles of water in the room would have been nice too. A significant issue (to me) was that the ground floor standard rooms has all of the block's a/c units located right outside the door. When the unit for the suites was running the noise inside my room was similar to being on a plane, and it went on and off all night. The distance to and from the main building was a nuisance - it was a 10 minute walk, or you could call a shuttle but that would take 10mins to arrive. This made it very awkward if you needed to go back to your room if needed. It would have been nice, especially when there's a big conference on, to have shuttles running back and to sweeping people up as the walked in, and to have had shuttles available as we finished the day's sessions.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tracy, California", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Service.

And we were there for a corporate conference spending lots of money on conference rooms, receptions and the like. The concierge offered to handle a rent-a-car from Hertz in town for us, delivered to the hotel. Okay, maybe we are getting back on track here, right? Car delivered with no problem, hotel staff is very nice. I dropped the car off at the concierge for pick-up when we checked out, like I was told to do by the concierge and the Hertz representative. Well, one WEEK later, I get a call from Hertz asking if I still needed to extend the rental. WHAT? Apparently, the concierge had never called Hertz to return the car. It's. A. CAR. How do you not know that it's there? Other bad things: it took me 2 days and having to ask someone on the staff before I could find a computer to check my email. There are no signs to them. I saw one of our neighbors waiting for over an hour for the shuttle van from the condos to the main hotel. Many of our fellow conference guests complained about their \"old\" and \"dingy\" rooms. Most were unhappy about several things - the condition of the plumbing, kitchenette, etc. Our banquet meal in the main ballroom was virtually inedible (even as banquet meals go). On our \"big night\", I ate mashed potatoes and broccolli because the meat was horrible. We had to steal a wine bottle to get because they only poured a sliver of wine at the start of each course and never came back. Good things: the staff are very nice people. They try. The crab cake appetizer was very good at the banquet, especially with the horseradish sauce. The bartender in the lobby makes a great martini.

We were the \"master\" charge for the entire party - all the room & food charges were going to us. (I use the past tense, but I am writing this from my bed now...sleepless from my 2nd crappy day here.) The first room they put us in was terrible: tiny, dark, run-down and the musty shag carpet smelled up the room. At our request, they moved us to another room (for an additional $50, they warned) which was larger, but also very run down. \"70's motel-like\" is a good descriptor. The bellboy told us \"I''ll try and pull some strings with my manager and get you into a better room (wink wink).\" We waited... He came back and said \"Sorry, my manager would only agree to an upgrade for another $75.\" (Remember, we've brought in 13 people here, 3 nights, mid-week....our beer budget is 10 times that!). Now late for dinner, tired of moving and the petty response for 'the manager', we declined. The bellboy then asked us to fill out an \"unforgettable moments!\" form for him to show to his boss. (We felt bad for the kid, and uncomfortably on the spot about it, so we filled it out.) He also seemed un-subtly angling for a big tip, which we gave him for the same reasons. The carpet in our room is old, dirty, spotted and quite tattered in placed. The bathroom is Super 8 Motel-esque with the sink in the 'hall'. We have exactly enough towels to shower, but not a single one more.The carpet is basement-like enough to warrant putting towels on it when you stand at the sink. The sheets are nice, the bed is surprisingly firm, but the rest of the bedding is worn and cheapo. We had to call for additional pillows. The 6:45 wake-up call on morning 1 was missed (luckily we'd barely slept anyway!). Annoyed, I called to make note in our record, which they said they did and called 'the manager' again. (Who is this 'manager' anyway?) When I called in the evening to MAKE SURE our wake up call morning 2 was not missed, the increasingly rude operator said \"I don't see anything noted here and I wasn't here this morning - so it's not my problem.\" She was downright aggressive with me on the phone. Morning 2 we got a hang-up call at 6:30, a hang-up call at 6:42 and a wake-up call at yes, 6:45. In the bar night 1 someone in our party had to go back and forth to get drinks because the waitress never bothered asking us if we wanted anything else. When we asked if she could put two tables together she said with a point, \"there's the table\" -- she had no plans to move anything. The 13 of us sat around the one table in a circle, balancing our drinks in our laps or on the floor. Avoiding doing any work seemed to be her main priority. Our bill might have been twice as large had she only 'waitressed' a bit. Dinner at the Grill was a few notches above airplane food (and about $100 per person + 18% tip included). Our (warm-ish) champagne, which they ran out of after 1 bottle, was $80 (almost 4x retail of $24. 2x is acceptable). They also ran out of our wine after 1 bottle and the port after one glass (which they served in a cognac glass filled to the brim). The wait-staff was befuddled and inattentive....except for a finely-dressed young man who only showed up as we were walking out the door to talk about all the great wines they had there. We were the kind of group who might have ordered $2000 worth of wine had anyone paid a little attention to us at the table. The business meeting itself was...okay. The hotel was confused ahead of time, messing the plans up enough so that our travel agent voiced her concerns about it. The fees for some things were silly - like a basic projector for the small meeting @ $350 a day, which we declined. The person in charge of business meetings at the hotel rushed in once in the morning, never to be seen again. Coffee arrived on time. Lunch, unfortunately, was at the same place as dinner the evening before - same menu. The spouses avoided the in-house spa and food like the plague and instead went off-site for a day of heavy spending that could have been Silverado's had they offered anything remotely passable. If you're having a business meeting that you hope to be anything close to sophisticated or impressive, Silverado will be a disappointment.

First of all, they are not hotel rooms at all. they're more like old apartments that have been divided up into as many rooms as possible just to maximize profit. we were nearly a mile from the main property in what appeared to be a private community of condos built sometime well before I was even born. after following the shuttle van to the \"room\" i said to my boyfriend \"it looks like people live here...like these are apartments.\" at which time the bellman got out of the shuttle and approached our vehicle to tell us that this was our room and our parking spot, but the owner was parked there right now so we could just park in the parking lot across the street. we were both confused to say the least. he didn't take us to our room or take our bags, he just left us there to find our way. when we opened the door to the room i was stunned. it was so tiny i could literally reach everything except for the bathroom without leaving the bed. my bedroom at home is nearly twice as big as the entire hotel room we stayed in, including closet, bathroom and patio (which gave us a beautiful view of the back of a carport). there were four air conditioning units right outside our door, which was right under the staircase and next to the room our \"landlord\" was staying in (weird to say the least). it was loud, the shower wasn't clean and basically, we paid a ton of money to sleep in a small walk-in closet. i cancelled our reservations for the next night immediately, which turned out to be the one and only thing we were satisfied with the entire night - the fact that they cancelled our reservation without charging for the rest of it. we still had to pay nearly $300 for the one night which is by far, the biggest waste of money I have ever experienced.The worst part is, when we went to Calistoga and St Helena the next day, everyone we spoke to about it didn't seem surprised in the least. the website and all information the Silverado presents is a total misrepresentation of what it actually is. buyer beware!", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExtremely disappointing!\u201d", "Author": "1879fulham", "ReviewID": "UR118829656", "Content": "Unfortunately had 3 nights at this hotel last week as a delegate attending a conference.Arrived at 2.30 pm on the Sunday and was immediately told that check-in was from 4pm. A member of the reception staff said that he would try and 'fast track' the cleaning of my room so that it would be ready before this time. He took my number and said he would call me to let me know. Not having heard further from him i approached the reception at 4.01 pm for an update and amazingly was told that my room was now miracously ready. I was not alone in this respect as there were by now about a dozen or so other guests hanging around waiting to be allocated their rooms as well. I was eventually allocated room 618 which was right on the perimeter of the resort (about 15 minutes walk from the reception or a 5 minute drive). When I arrived at the room I found a very very tired bland room full of 1970's furnishings which should have been discarded many years ago. The view wasn't particularly inspiring either. The main road to one side and a view of the driving range. Unpacking my bag I thought I would check the wi-fi. Guess what this wasn't operating. Phoning the front desk they put me in contact with their offsite IT provider. To be fair they were pretty helpful although it was a bit surreal to be told to walk around the room with my iPad in the air to see whether I could get a signal. Anyway after wasting an hour or so with no success they suggested that I try again the following day to see whether I could get a signal. I did and I didn't! With this I phoned up the front desk and requested a room change. They said they would try to accommodate my request but the hotel was busy. Eventually I was allocated a room nearer the main hotel (5 minutes walk) but was only allowed to move in from 4.00 pm that day. The room (222) was better than the previous room I was given but when you are paying a significant daily rate plus resort charges and taxes then let's just say I was still very underwhelmed! I did now however have wi-fi so things were on the up. I spoke to a number of the other delegates attenting the conference and feedback was mixed. Some said their rooms were great, with comptempory furnishings and great views but the vast majority held my view that the rooms were just not good enough. Apparently many of the rooms rented out have owners and therefore it really is pot luck with regards to room allocation. I was originally due to stay 4 nights at this hotel but ended up just staying the 3 so that could get back to San Francisco and enjoy some comfort. I have been to a number of these conventions in the past (which are held all over the states) and I have to say that this resort hotel was the worst and most impractical place I have ever stayed at.

At the front desk I was greeted by Rose I think it was, who was really nice; I explained that it was our honeymoon when she asked what the occassion was, and she apologised that she would be unable to upgrade us, but gave us loads of great coupons to get free wine tastings at some of the higher class wineries. Once we had checked in we got back into the car and drove round to where our cottage was, it wasn't far, and easily walkable, but if you don't fancy walking then call the reception and they'll send one of the staff round in the golf cart, expect to pay gratuity though. The room was lovely, spacious enough with plenty of storage, and a nice shower/bath combo. The minibar was very full of drinks and snacks which are extortionate as ever, but I just took these out (this isn't a weight sensitive one thankfully) and put our drinks and snacks in instead, just swapping them when we left. The room had air conditioning as you'd expect, but it is a little loud for people who aren't used to it so we switched it off at night, but that's not a problem really as it was plenty cool enough at night. We ate at the bar the first night, just a burger and fries; well I say just a burger and fries, it was absolutely delicious! They bar staff are really friendly and attentive, we felt right at home straight away. The only other time we ate there was at the grill restaurant. Again this was very good, with an excellent front of house host called Matt, and the waiter was also very good. The food was pretty good, I had a lovely steak, and my wife had fried chicken, which she said was a little greasy but still enjoyed. It was fairly expensive again though, as you would expect really. They also have a gourmet restaurant, but we didn't try it. Overall I think I would stay there again, it had a lovely atmosphere, and was generally very comfortable. The walls are a little thin in the cottages though, and you can hear people if they are a little noisy, but this didn't really affect us. It is a great base for exploring the wider area, we had a car and took advantage of it travelling away from Napa, and the main routes were very easily accessed. I can highly recommend Lake Berryessa for scenery and if you want a paddle. The town is a $15 cab ride away. I also hightly recommend the Del Dotto wine caves tour which is just down the road from Silverado, it's a very unique tour with fabulous wine and a really good host team, especially a chap named Ryan.

The heirloom salad with the fresh mozzarella was the best we had at any of the many resorts we stayed during our vacation. The Kobe hamburger was the best hamburger I've ever eaten. Same for the fish tacos. A downside that has been mentioned in some of the reviews is the shortage of staffing.

The concierge was terrific every morning but not sure there was somebody around in the evening.

However, on this third consecutive annual visit, we came away feeling like the resort had changed signficantly, and not in a good way. In general, the attitude of the staff was \"everything is on our schedule....that's how it is.\" The importance of building that schedule around customer needs and expectations has been lost at Silverado. Perhaps it is a sign of difficult economic times, but the Silverado also appears to be doing everything possible to extract every last dime from anyone willing to spend it, even if the quality of the guest experience suffers as a result. For example, they charge $130 per person for a round of golf....the courses are beautiful, and ordinarily, I would say worth the price....but it took over five hours to play over the weekend, and they actually had a wedding ceremony being performed on the course during playing hours, complete with amplification and music....not the kind of golfing experience we were seeking. During our stay, I actually called and asked to speak to a manager. When I spoke to this person, and shared the many disappointments of our stay (poor food quality, room type assigned to us was not as promised, pathetic Internet connectivity, terrible golfing experience, indifferent staff attitude), I was thanked for my feedback and that was that. The Napa Valley is a wonderful place for recreation and/or relaxation. No need to endure the high prices and disappointing experience at Silverado Resort.

But, the spa was absolutely divine. I loved my time in the saunas, you receive a locker, key, comfy robe and sandals to borrow. The gym is gratis with your stay at the hotel, it is well equipped & there are classes you can partake in as well. I've been to other fine hotel gyms and this one rocks!

My experience at this place was top notch. My wife and I enjoyed Silverado Resort so much that we extended our stay for two days instead of going back to san Fran. The hotel honoured our priceline rate for the additional two days even though the posted rate was much higher since the additional days were Friday and Saturday nights. Bring your clubs!! The North course is fantastic (the south looks great too) and a bargain at twilight for $60. Apparently a group led by Johnny Miller has purchased this resort. It had great looking tennis courts as well and lots of them with what appeared to be free instruction. The grounds surrounding this resort are impeccably groomed and give you a nice laid back feeling. This would be a great place to do a vacation with another couple. You can all go wine tasting during the day or the boys can golf while the ladies go to the spa, which mine said was outstanding. We went cheap and had the basic hotel room which was essentially the 2nd bedroom of the two bedroom suites that they rent, separated by a locked door. It might have been noisy had someone else been staying in the other side of the suite who was not considerate but we didn't have that problem as the space next to us was empty. We ate at the restaurant more times than we expected to because it was so good and also because it was convenient as it was a bit of a drive into Napa. The front desk staff gave us a complimentary drink upon our check in and were always very friendly and accommodating. Our server at Breakfast was excellent (as were all servers) and gave us many good recommendations for wineries to visit as well. See below. The hotel was located perfectly for us as we did not have to fight the traffic of Napa everyday. It made the entire trip seem very \"countryesque\" as were were very rarely in a city setting. Our trip was all about the wineries and wine tastings (23 winery tastings in 4.5 days!!). The hotel is situated just off the Silverado Trail giving very short trips to many excellent wineries. Just head north on Silverado Trail and start tasting. Natalie at Reynolds Family Winery, the gang at Robert Sinski, mustache dude at Whitehall Lane Winery and Kelvin at Domaine Carneros were some of our favourites and all no more than a 15-20 minute drive away (ask them about the couple from Canada that were \"power tasting\" back in July). Darioush winery was impressive to look at but too pretentious for us. Avoid it. Another few minutes up the Silverado Trail are the wineries of the famed Stag's Leap district. Many other famous wineries such as Caymus, Opus One and Chateau Monteline are just a short drive further over towards St. Helena. Definitely avoid driving through St. Helena on the weekends as traffic can get very busy and frustrating. Jump over to Silverado Trail to avoid the crowds. We would stay at Silverado Resort again in a heartbeat. Those who knocked this resort are likely the ones who will never be satisfied no matter what or the ones who have unrealistic expectations. Remember, those who did not enjoy their stay are way more likely to post a review than those who enjoyed. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be scared off by the reviews of this place.

I can honestly say this is the worst hotel room I've ever stayed in. I'm generally a Westin, Hilton, Marriott or boutique hotel or resort. So some of the resources not available at Siverado are completely forgiven by me as I understand they are smaller than some operators. That said, if I was broke and going to be homeless the day after my stay at Siverado, I'd expect my last night in a hotel to be about as bad as this place. First, the room wasn't on the main property. It required leaving the resort, driving down the road, past the golf course and into an apartment complex with a carport. Parking was unclear. It's tandem and I didn't feel like blocking someone in and getting a call in the middle of the night to move my car, so I parked in someone's spot hoping I wouldn't get towed. The car port was the kind you see in old apartment complexes. Nice patch of oil and dirt in the spots. The room was small (and I mean smaller than NY rooms). So small I couldn't walk around one side of the bed and at the end of the bed was a giant air conditioner sticking out of the wall. No, not a TV, that was jammed down in a cabinet beneath the height of the bed. Mid-pile shag carpet was everywhere. Including part of the bathroom. Seriously? Who puts carpet in the bathroom anymore? Oh and the over-scented perfume they used to try to cover up who-knows-what-mess was enough to almost cause me to vomit. Bedding was cheap polyester. You know the kind. Like a Motel 6 (though I have stayed at nicer Motel 6 rooms). I should have known something was wrong when I checked in. The frontdesk girl left without saying where she was going for about 10 minutes. When she returned she muttered something about trying to find a better room for me and that I wasn't getting what I ordered. Once I got to the room I immediately called to find out what the heck was going on because I was in an absolute dump. Especially at nearly $300 for a night. I don't have any enemies that I'm aware of, but if I did, I couldn't possibly tell them to stay here. Do yourself a favor and do not stay at this place. While the pretty images of the mansion and the golf course may fool you, you'll have to put your head down at the end of the night in the room and I can assure you you'll feel completely fleeced for having done so. Especially now that you've been warned. Oh and the pillows? My girlfriend woke up the next morning with a bruised back of here head from the quickcrete-soft pillows. I have no idea what was in these things, but they weren't soft! Oh and one more thing--there's a resort fee for internet and parking and some portion of the spa facilities.

But let me assure that the staff, service, and the room at Silverado literally made the trip. I'm usually a fan of the W/Starwood Hotel's, but I felt the Silverado was certainly a place I would return to in a heartbeat. Plus, the ambiance is elegant and the landscape and views- stunning! My husband decided to surprise me by planning a trip for us and our good friends to Napa for my 32nd brithday. We booked the Silverado one night before our stay and ended up staying here by default since everything else was booked solid. We arrived at 10 a.m. and headed out via Napa Winery Shuttle (call Norm- he's got the best deal around) who picked us up in front of Silverado. We literally jumped right out of the car and into the wine tour bus and never had the chance to check-in. After six fantastic wineries and perhaps too much fun, we landed back at SIlverado only to realize I had left my purse at a winery 30 mins away! A staff member (Bryan the bartender) overhead my sob story, and how I needed to get a cab to get to my purse ASAP, and had another member of the staff drive my husband to get the purse. Upon returning, we and our friends checked in with the front desk and learned we had been upgraded to a one bedroom suite. We were really well taken care of throughout our stay which was really nice. Now the room. It was so beautiful. We had a view of the golf course and the rolling hills, and a full living room, fireplace, and kitchen, we also had an enormous deck that spanned from the living room to the bedroom overlooking the gorgeous green course. It was absolutely perfect and very romantic. The next time I stay in Napa, I'm definitely returning to SIlverado. I would have loved to have eaten at the Silverado restaurant which looked quite upscale and also had lovely views. Perhaps next time. On this trip, we drank way too much wine and ended up ordering pizza at 11:00 p.m. that was delivered to our suite (SIlverado connects you directly to the pizza place!!). Favorite winery of the day - Hagafen (a kosher vineyard with a nice outdoor patio, very casual and great wine!!). Vissatui- way too crowded and crazy. Rubicon (AKA Coppola) had lovely views and a nice space outside to sit. Andretti- great staff who took excellent care of us! Domain Chandon was our last stop and it was a lot of fun- very hip and modern with tons of great artwork for sale.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tucson, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGraet Experience!\u201d", "Author": "AZJames", "ReviewID": "UR114917801", "Content": "We booked this resort on Priceline this June 2011 for two nights.

I stayed in a single room (227) that was located real close to the golf shop and restaurant. Overall, I would recommend the property - while the room was a bit dated, it was comfortable and the service and people across the resort were excellent. As usual - The Good, The OK, and The Bad/Ugly The Good - Welcome/check-in. I arrived late on a Monday night in a downpour. Was greeted with a smile, and had the concierge/bell-hop Mack show me to my room and give me some background on the property. Very nice welcome, and I appreciated the escort to my room. - Service. From Rob in the business center, across the front desk, to the gym staff everyone was willing to help. I also chatted with a golf course employee who gave me the fascinating history of the club. - Meeting arrangements and food. We held a small team meeting and the staff did a nice job fulfilling our requests, and the food and snacks were well done and always full. - Room service. Upon arrival I was hungry. Room service came to the rescue in 20ish minutes with exactly what I ordered. The tuna tartare and cobb salad are highly recommended. - Gym. The fitness facilities (also had pool, tennis) were nice and adequate. Opening at 06:00, the gym offers enough machine for most. Water and towels were appreciated. - Free WiFi across the property. That worked! Well done. - Evening bar area. I suppose February is not the busiest month, so we were happy to see some folks in the bar area in the evening. Brian the bartender did a nice job and was fun to speak with. The OK - The bed. My bed was squeaky - very squeaky. While I was tired it didn't cause me much bother, but I'm certain my neighbors may have not appreciated when I rolled over at night. It was pretty loud! - The room overall. It was fine and comfortable. There was nothing outstanding, and nothing too out of whack. I did find the in-wall heating system a bit disappointing, as I has to set manually and then it ran at that setting all night. The shower was large and clean. The location. I was fine with the location, as we did some wine tasting and the furthest tasting we did was only about 25 minutes north. Yes, we needed a car service, but who wouldn't if you're going to enjoy wine. The Bad/Ugly - Nothing. Regrettably, I was unable to play gold, but the courses looked decent (flat and wide) from afar. Overall, I'd give this place a look - however note that this is NOT a hotel, but rather a group of apartments/condominiums that cut across the resort which appeared to be quite a large piece of land.
