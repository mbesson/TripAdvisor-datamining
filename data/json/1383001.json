I later noticed that when it's near check-in time, a sign with the logo and name in English is put out at the entrance. Staff was wonderful, ready to help when needed. We arrived at the hotel way too early for check-in and they kept our bags in a designated room. Like many rooms in New York City, the room was small. For example, the chair for the desk was right against the bed. When not using the desk, though, there was a spot for the chair which didn't impinge on space. There was also an easy chair in the room. The bed was as high as Mount Everest so had to actually climb onto it. Once in the bed, it was extremely comfortable. All the lamps had easy to use buttons so no fumbling in the dark. One lamp had 2 extra outlets attached to the base. Wifi was free. Grand Station for the B and D lines was a 3 minute walk. Bowery Station for the J and Z lines was a 5 minute walk. Both of these were just off Chrystie Street. Breakfast was from 7-10 AM and had the usual stuff. The tables were spread throughout the floor. My favourites were the ones by the window. Chinatown is very busy outside on the sidewalk. The chinese buses depart from about a block away. Have patience when walking. Everyone on the sidewalk was polite but it was crowded.

Only con I encountered: if on your check-out date you need a taxi to the airport, do NOT accept the receptionist offer (which is indeed a sort of rental with driver, and not a taxi service): it costs you 60$ while with a normal cab you would pay 45$ (fixed price of ANY New York taxi on any ride between JFK and Manhattan). When the last day I asked to call me a taxi at the reception, I was told that the service would cost me 60$. Being really late, I accepted without questions, but when I got home I found out that with a normal taxi I would have paid 45$! There's nothing illegal, of course: 1) I was told in advance the price and I accepted (although I had explicitly asked for a taxi, they said \"yes\" and instead I was sent a \"for hire vehicle\" with no taximeter, no taxi sign on top of the vehicle or on the doors, in short a different - and more expensive - service) and 2) I was given a normal receipt, with the name of this normally registered company.

When I initially started looking for places to stay I had a difficult time finding anything that was within our price range. Boutique hotels had boutique prices. The corporate hotels were charging boutique prices as well. Then I decided to check out the Comfort Inns in NYC since we've had positive experiences with them before. While still pricey (but hey, it's NYC) I came across this Comfort Inn at Manhattan Bridge. Of course I turned to Trip Advisor to get the scoop and was impressed with what I saw. So I booked the hotel and I'm so glad I did. The this Comfort Inn is located right in China Town. While on the smaller side it was huge on value, location, cleanliness, and service. We got into the city earlier than our check in time but the gentleman at the front desk was more than happy to hold our bags till check in. We were greeted with a warm smile and much welcome. In fact every employee we dealt with was beyond friendly. When we did get into our room we were highly impressed with how clean and well kept it was. I mentioned before it was on the smaller side but it was still bigger than our bedroom at home, so we actually felt quite comfortable and cozy there. The bathroom was pristine and I have to mention that the shower was great. The water was the perfect pressure and the hot water adjusted well. (I often find hotel showers to have either weak pressure or way too hard of a pressure. And sometimes the hot water can be spotty in temperature adjusts. - I know, a minute detail but I think worth mentioning) I will admit I was nervous when we got to our room because it was smack dab in front of the elevator. After the first night my worries were laid to rest. We never once heard the comings and goings of other patrons. In fact we were wowed at how quiet the hotel was. We didn't even hear the common hustle and bustle of the NYC streets. While complimentary breakfast was offered we didn't take advantage of it because vacation means sleeping in for us and sleeping in means just beginning to stir at 10 (which is when the breakfast ended) The location was great. We were only a short walk to the subway and a lot of times we just walked instead of taking the subway because the weather was great and there was so much to see around us. The neighborhood was safe even late at night when we were coming home from the bar. Never once felt threatened or weary. We loved this place and were happy to have stayed there. We definitely got our money's worth and look forward to staying there again in the future. While it wasn't anything super fancy or posh it was clean, well kept (the furniture looked brand new), friendly, and perfectly located for us. Oh and it had free wifi that worked like a charm!

Our first two nights were spent in a corner room overlooking Manhattan Bridge which was a magnificent view. On the second stay our room overlooked some neighbouring roofs which weren't very attractive, but everything else about the place was so good it didn't matter. The air conditioning worked (although the maids turned it off whilst we were out for the day as our stay was in during the horrendous heatwave), so by the time we got back the room was hot again and took a little while to cool down. The bathrooms were well equipped and nicely decorated. The beds were a little unusual being quite high off the floor, but comfortable nonetheless. Internet access was free, the single lift spacious and quick (and had been certified a couple of months before we arrived) and the free breakfast was convenient and enjoyable, especially the waffles which we don't have in New Zealand. The staff were all friendly and very helpful. The place does stand out from the untidy buildings around it that are typical of China Town, but it was a great base to experience New York with easy access by either walking or the subway. China Town was a wonderful experience, especially getting to see the families spending time together in the adjacent park, Grandparents, parents and grandchildren all spending time together, teenagers playing basketball or handball. Not something we're used to seeing back home. No gangs, no patches, no wayward youths, no boy racers, but the occasional homeless person going through the bins looking for food. The streets were a little smelly in the extreme heat, especially when the rubbish bags were out on the footpaths, but we quickly got used to it.

The hotel feels very new and I am sure it must be. Rooms Rooms of course aren't massive but I must say the room was bigger than I would have expetected. Very, very cleaning - excellent maids obviously. Really big, high bed so you profit from the views (ask for a room with a view!), very comfortable indeed. The bathroom was modern, like a wet room, clean and very well designed. Breakfast Breakfast was what you would expect in American hotels - selection included donuts, bagels, breads, honey, jams (jelly), peanut butter spreads and best of all a pancake maker so you could make yourself a hot, fresh pancake. Coffee is served all day in the breakfast area - nice to be able to take one out with you in the morning as you head out. Service We were so pleased arriving at the hotel to be greeted by such a lovely Receptionist. She couldn't have been more helpful - similarly the staff who kept the breakfast area filled and clean and thethe maids who were just brilliant. Location The location is why you may get a good price as it is in Chinatown and here is the one minus - food and rubbish does tend to pile up on streets in the area - sometimes there can be a slight odour in the air! But once you are through the hotel doors you could be anywhere.. And as for the subway, this is only 2 minutes from the hotel (Grand St station). With a change you can be in Times Sq.. probably 15 mins so so. Cost if you don't know is $2.25 per ticket or $8 for 4 if you block pay. Summary So in summary, would I return? Certainly. Would I be happy to recommend to friends, family and business colleagues? Yes, without hesitation. Choice Hotels in the USA are typically good and this is probably above even other Comfort Inns in the USA.

Saying that, it's right next to Soho and the LES, which you can reach by walking, or a short hop in a cab; you're near to all the restaurants and nightlife you could wish for.

While not as glamorous as Midtown, the area is an excellent starting point to explore the whole of Manhattan. The hotel lies central to areas like South Street Seaport, Financial District, Greenwich Village, Brooklyn Heights and Union Square which can by easily reached by subway. Midtown and Upper Manhattan also take relatively short metro rides to reach. Chinatown itself is a busy, hectic and sometimes smelly place, but all in all very safe and packed with cheap restaurants which serve great food for not much money. Trick is to go where the locals go and not let the exterior and interior of those places put you off. A ten minute walk will also get you to SoHo where you'll find great shops and good restaurants (must-go for pizza-lovers: Lombardi's). I'd advise everyone to not let the location put you off whilst deciding whether to book at this hotel. Chinatown is safe, central and cheap! Our room itself was very good. It wasn't too big but certainly not tiny either. The room was cleaned very well on a daily-base and the private bathroom was spacious and modern. The flatscreen TV also worked really well.

The complimentary breakfast exists of muffins, donuts, bread, bagels, waffels, eggs and cereal. While not extremely varied, it gives you a good base to explore the city till lunchtime. The breakfast area was a bit small, but we never had to wait for a place to sit even though the hotel was fully booked on almost all our nights. The service by the hotel employees is the only thing I can think of to complain about. Except for one nice door-guy who opened the door for us and wished us a good day, we were never really recognised by any of the staff and were only greeted after we greeted them. Some of the door-guys were often found to be on their cell-phones or on the free-internet computers instead of next to the door.
