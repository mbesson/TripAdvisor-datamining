The location was convenient to Chinatown and fairly convenient to the MRT transit system. The lobby was beautiful. The staff was friendly and helpful. There was a free english language newspaper delivered to our door every morning. The room was serviced twice daily and kept exceptionally clean. THE BAD: The room was expensive and they add a 10% service charge which probably doesn't go to the person who cares for your room. Wi-Fi was $8/hour or $35/day extra! Breakfasts were $18.00. A liter of water is $10.00! The dining room was closed for dinner. The wooden furniture in our room was old and beat up. There were several clubs and bars directly across the street that were very noisy. The windows had an extra layer of plastic glued over the glass in an attempt to cut down the noise from the bars and clubs across the street. The plastic was old and difficult to see through. There was a comfortable love seat and chair, but no reading lamp. You had to move the lamp from the desk back and forth between the seating area and the desk.

We asked the reception if we could upgrade to a bigger room, or even the suite, but he was rather offhandish, and said that they had a 98% occupancy rate. We also requested for wi-fi and were told we had to pay. Seriously? For the rates we pay for this hotel, you ask us to pay for the wi-fi? Ridiculous. The toilet seat was broken too. The room is big, but the cupboards and arrangement of the bed makes it very constrained. At the end, they also claimed that one towel was missing, and made us pay for it.

The price for a nights accommodation were very reasonable for Singapore but the accommodation was really poor. The first room we were allocated was tiny, dark dreary and very smelly. The air conditioning sounded more like an engine running and in all the room was totally unsuitable. When this was pointed out to the staff we were able to pay \u00a330 for an upgraded room which was marginally better. However the room still had a very unpleasant odour and extremely noisy air conditioning. In both rooms the decor was poor, peeling wallpaper, poor bathrooms etc. On the return stopover we experienced the same problems and really did not enjoy the stay at this hotel at all, it was a relief to leave.

Although the reviews on this site were mixed, most seemed to be good. As we have been to Singapore many times and stayed in several different hotels in different areas we felt we were well equiped to make a good choice of hotel. This was a big mistake. After booking the hotel, and at a very good rate I made contact with them regarding our booking and enquired if they could book private hotel transfers for us. They replied that they could, explaining the costs and also offering us alternatives. We decided to ask them to go ahead and make the arrangements for the transfers, to which they emailed that they would do this. On arrival in Singapore there was no one to meet us and after 20 minutes waiting I phoned the hotel and after much confusion by the staff member he eventually said no car had been booked. We caught a taxi, on arrival at the hotel, despite apologising to us for the mixup we were told that the driver was actually there and we didn't see him!!!! However they apologised once again and said that they had upgraded our room. We were shown to a room at the front of the hotel overlooking the street, it was obviously in need of refurbishment with wallpaper peeling off the walls,mouldy tiles over the bath/shower, a noisy airconditioner and dirty carpet, but we weren't really worried about that because of the initial room rate we had paid. Then it got dark and the night clubs and pubs across the street kicked off. That was it, there was no sleep that night for the noise. In the early hours my husband decided to have a shower,that was when we discovered it was near on impossible to stand in the bath to have a shower. Not only was it very narrow, but it was extremely slippery and there was no rubber mat to stand on. And then to make matters even worse the airconditioner decided it was going to switch on and off every 60 seconds ( you tend to count these things as you lay awake in the dark). So even if we did start to fall asleep it would wake us again. At around 4 am I got on the internet to look into other hotels that had availability.At 5.30 I could wait no longer and phoned another hotel to make a reservation,( we were very lucky and got a room at Park Hotel Clarke Quay which I would highly recommend). At around 8 am I informed the reception staff that we would be checking out of the hotel shortly and could they please get our bill ready. They seemed surprised, and when I explained the noise, lack of sleep and inability to use the shower as our reasons they were apologetic. On arrival back in the room I received a phone call offering a further upgrade of rooms as an apology. I declined the offer considering the room we were in was also an upgrade by way of an apology!!! The hotel only charged us for the night that we stayed and the internet usage that we had signed up for. They were quite within their rights to charge us for the following two nights as that was in the agreement when we originally booked. The only conclusion that I can come to regarding this hotel and the mixed reviews is that there must be some very different standards of rooms in this hotel depending on which part of the hotel the room is in. I would not recommend this hotel unless you are planning to spend most of the night in the pubs and clubs opposite and sleep only when they have closed as the hotel is certainly quiet during the day.", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tokyo", "Title": "\u201cForget about the Berjaya - terrible hotel\u201d", "Author": "fredsmithInJapan", "ReviewID": "UR108035313", "Content": "I am not sure who can write anything positive about this hotel.

The hotel has a lot of character from the outside and inside. It is in good location (Chinatown) and the area is really nice and not too busy. It's about 5-10 min walk from the nearest MRT station (Tajong Pagar). It is just two stations from the Harbourfront Station where you hop onto Sentosa Express to get to Sentosa island. The service really nice and helpful and never had any problems. They order taxis for you and help if you have any questions about the city, how to get to a particular place or which is the best place to shop for electronic gadgets (Funan - it is the cheapest, the same thing at Suntec City was much more expensive). The room itself (standard/studio) wasn't a wow but nice and cosy and clean. It was big enough for us and a baby. They provided a free proper wooden cot with bedding for our baby as well. We had some limited space because of that but it's not like we lived there, we just spent nights there so no problems. The bathroom is very decent with a shower enclosure - big enough for a bath. They provide bath towels and face/hand, complimentary toiletries - shampoo, conditioner, lotion, shower gel, cotton buds. There is also extendable washing line under the shower enclosure. In the room there is a wardrobe with hangers, bedside tables, inroom safe, desk with a chair, flatscreen tv, tea/coffee making facilities, mini bar and a fridge. The only negative thing about the room - not sure if it is the case with other rooms, but this one was damp. There was no mould or anything anywhere, not even in the bathroom but we could feel the dampness in the air when we walked in, and could feel it throughout the whole stay.If we had some wet clothes, they wouldn't get dry and stay damp. Also aircon was a bit noisy butit is just a matter of getting used to it. The wifi connection is just under 26 SGD for 24 hours but we didn't use it so don't know how it works. The taxi from/to the hotel (to/from Changi airport) is just under 18 SGD. The taxis in general are relatively cheap (from Suntec Mall to the hotel we paid just under 6 SGD) but good luck queuing for it especially outside some shopping centres. There is always a taxi queue so no queue jumping. The waiting time can get close to the journey time by MRT so think twice. The Singapore zoo - 30 min by taxi, around 20 SGD. All the rooms at the front of the property are the suites with living room and the spiral staircase leading to the bedroom. There are a few bars opposite so in the evening it might get noisy. The restaurant serves breakfast only, no options of lunch or dinner. The breakfast is really good and you have a choice of continental - muesli or cornflakes - ... served with condensed milk (!!!) - I only tried it once and then stuck to the american option - sausages, beans, eggs, pancake, juice, tea/coffee. In general, nice hotel with nice service and in great location.", "Date": "May 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201cDelightful hotel\u201d", "Author": "moggey", "ReviewID": "UR103500552", "Content": "Stayed here for 2 nights before a cruise.

Arrived too early to check in but that was ok as the reception staff looked after our bags whilst we went exploring. The room on first impressions was that it would be fine. It was a reasonable size and had everything that we required. It was one of the rooms facing the back alley / block of flats and the window glass was opaque ie. non see through. The other window looked down to the glass roof above the lift well, noisy during the rain. We had to have the curtains closed all the time because the rooms above looked down into ours. So with all that and the poor lighting it gave the room a very gloomy feel. But after settling in and spending the first night our thoughts changed. The hotel still accepts guests who persist with the unhealthy habit of smoking. Although we had a non-smoking room the smoke stench from down the corridor wafted down into our room. I'm sure also the air conditioner sucked in smoke from somewhere and we had to sleep the second night with it off ( only stayed two nights thankfully ) ---- and it was very noisy. The bathroom was just ok but the shower cubicle was showing it's age. The bed was firm but not uncomfortable but the pillows were very , very soft. Too soft for us with no neck support. The mini bar fridge was only a cooler and was almost useless for getting anything chilled, no ice making facility. The kettle was a cheap little piece of crap that barely got close to boiling. The hotel is in a good location, the staff were nice but I don't know about the bars / nightclubs across the street how much noise they would make during a busy period. My advice would be to pay a little bit more and get something better eg.

The area is primarily a night area, so it is quiet during the day but seems a bit sleazy and seedy at night. The deluxe rooms are rather dated in furnishings, but fairly large. A complaint is that there are no free electrical plug points you can use to charge your laptop or mobile phone etc - the only option is to unplug the desk lamp and stand lamp, which makes the room quite dark (the other lighting is inadequate). Internet is not free and somewhat expensive (much cheaper to go to the internet caf\u00e9 down the road). Service was again a mixed bag - friendly but inefficient. We had to ask for an iron 3 or 4 times before it was delivered (the first time, we were told the hotel had run out and to try again the next day, which we did, only to have to ask several more times). For those who are driving from Malaysia, the hotel does not have its own sheltered / underground car park, but there is one right next to the hotel.

The owners must be dreadful to work for, as the poor staff copped all the flack of complaining guests (I heard 2 others going off as well as myself). Maintenance problems were the biggest issues and \"room not as described or imagined\" caused guests grief. We stayed for 4 days pre-paid on Wotif...then to find that the rate was higher than advertised at the hotel itself. They used the old \"oh that rate includes taxes etc\" excuse but that was rubbish! The rates were over $320 AUD per night for a mezzanine room with one double bed and a sofa...that was not advertised as a bed space but nevertheless was broken....so sitting on it meant that the cushions fell into the broken sofa bed mechanism! Windows overlooking the street did not open, but that was OK in one way as the noise from the bars was loud enough! It was a most disappointing experience. It took 3 of our 4 days stay to finally get our cold tap to work in the only sink...upstairs....and the tea/coffee cups/jug etc were all downstairs! PLUS...the only plugs allowed in the bathroom were shaver plugs so we could not take the tea/coffee things up to the bathroom! SO we had to fill the small electric jug from the upstairs bath then carry it down the rickety, spiral staircase to make coffee and drink it!....I finally received a water jug so we could at least have an easy refill on hand...downstairs! Even more, the 2 coffee sachets and whitener, powdered and awful...were not worthy of such a hotel. Fresh milk and more beverages would have been appreciated. The housemaids obviously also hated having no running water downstairs as our dirty coffee cups were left if we had not washed them ourselves. It was too hard to get up to wash them every time. The aircon was terrible. Loud/inefficient....to set the temp upstairs meant that downstairs we froze in a blast of cold air. It was ancient system and made a joke of the 4 star rating etc. People were sitting on the front steps smoking as there was no table/seating outside to smoke even half-way politely. It was a very poor presentation to new guests especially. That also meant that nowhere could we read outside etc. All up I would never go back. Another man I spoke with had booked for a month in a tiny studio room and had been lucky enough to get a larger room for the same money, after he complained. Having paid all in advance we could do nothing...not even leave without loss. My cab fare to the airport was $12 more after the hotel booked it, than when we took the same trip to the hotel, at peak rates...so that also annoyed me as in 'the straw that broke the camel's back'!

I stayed for 8 nights at the Berjaya with my girlfriend. Check-in was quick, and a nice touch with complimentary fruit punch from the staff whilst credit card details were logged. We stayed room-only (because we are known to be lazy in the mornings!), although on the one occasion we made breakfast it was both reasonably priced and very good standard of food and service. Good enough to consider the extra room cost next time round! Location was as near to Chinatown as you could hope for. My girlfriend and I enjoy being involved in the culture of places and the Berjaya gave us \"Chinatown on your doorstep\" with some of the best food I've had and tons of late night market stalls. MRT is the best way to travel and both Chinatown and Tanjong Pagar stations were within 5mins walking distance of the hotel. The bars across the road... yes they are there, but lets put things in perspective. If you dont like to be near a bar and if you want a sterile, high rise, overly priced big chain hotel thats a cab ride from anything then thats your choice... so dont book the Berjaya. Myself and my partner, we actually loved the vibe of the area!! It was vibrant, friendly and we often saw families walking around. It wasnt seedy in the least as I have read and it felt safe. Loads of bars to choose from, and some had an excellent menu for food which we sampled (Road House Grill - try the cheescake desert... heaven!!). Yes it gets noisy... but so does London (and London is not as safe, trust me). We made good relationships with the bar staff of a few places and they always remembered our names and drink order! We'd have drinks on the table when they saw us walking up the road! We had jet lag one night and got up at 1am just to pop over the road for a cold drink and friendly chat with the local bar staff... I think thats what makes a holiday, not a source of complaint. Like I said, we happened to have a dream holiday, which was only helped by the Berjaya's staff, cleanliness and location. I can also accept some people may not share my opinion of the area... but some people are hard to please.

We booked via internet and paid deposit, but when our credit card wouldn't scan upon check-in we were asked to pay an excessive deposit which exceeded the total cost of our stay by hundreds of dollars. When we requested the 2 pieces of free laundry and 2 hours free internet access per day \"available with all suites\" as advertised on Berjaya Hotel website, the staff made every [--] excuse under the sun as to why we could not have this and would have to pay and kept interrupting my breakfast to discuss it. Even after we complained to Manager about misrepresentation and expressed our anger and disappointment, he continued to make excuses and refused to honour the deal or compromise. Unfortunately, this turned what would have been a pleasant stay into a stressful experience and we left the Hotel feeling like just a few paltry dollars was more important to Berjaya then customer satisfaction and repeat business. Unfortunately a letter to Beryaya's head office afforded us no satisfication either, as they merely referred our complaint to the Manager in Singapore we had already had bad dealings with and we had to suffer another round of [--] excuses from him via email.

This unique boutique hotel, located in Chinatown, was originally Shop Houses and was converted to accommodation. We arrived 7am in the morning expecting to be able to store our luggage as the check in time was 2pm. We were advised that the two rooms that we had booked were available for our use immediately. We were most pleasantly surprised! The rooms were fantastic and very large. Our room had a king size bed and our daughter's had twin beds and a large sitting area. The rooms were well presented and kept beautifully cleaned and vacuumed for our entire stay. We were given the option of not having our sheets replaced every day (for environmental reasons) which we took advantage of. The beds and pillows would rate amongst the most comfortable I have slept on in hotel accommodation. Our accommodation included breakfast in the dining area and we were served by the most wonderful wait staff, very attentive and friendly. Breakfast was served at the table and was fruit juice, tea or coffee, cereal and full cooked breakfast (eggs, bacon, sausage, baked beans, tomatoes) plus toast. We took advantage of the free internet access in the lobby area on several mornings - very fast and convenient! The hotel is very close to the Chinatown MRT ( a very enjoyable walk through the markets!) and Maxwells Food Hall ( I can recommend the Fried Kwai Tow). I noted several comments from other people regarding the location. Yes, it is in the nightclub area, but our room overlooked Duxton Rd and was opposite several clubs and the noise at no time disturbed our sleep. They must have quite amazing sound proofing (and our windows were all double glazed) as the only time we heard any sound was when doors opened when people walked in or out of the clubs. We at no time felt threatened or in any danger while walking home late at night. Overall, I am delighted to recommend this hotel.", "Date": "January 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "wellington", "Title": "\u201cB&B in Blackpool not four star hotel!!\u201d", "Author": "hunnz", "ReviewID": "UR23424694", "Content": "Booked this hotel for one night stay on way to Cambodia.
