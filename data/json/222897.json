This was our first hotel on our European vacation..we slept all night on plane from US went to Madrid for the day then took a Spanish Airline to Paris. I will say if you get a taxi from the Charles G Airport...it is the most expensive option available We were looking forward to our shower and room...the lobby is beautiful and the location is great bc you can easily walk to the Notre Dame Cathedral. Also look for Shakespeare and Co... it is near the ND Cathedral. It's a famous bookstore...Samantha Brown from the travel channel recommends it and do I. This hotel is also very near the tube (Metro) subway...so you can easily access all of Paris within minutes. I rated this hotel average because of the bathroom, stairs, and hallways. This hotel is excellent in price and they will hold your luggage after you check out while you tour the city.However..The rooms are very small, while they are updated..the walls seems to be paper thin. The elevator is more of a luggage lift..or a one person/one suitcase lift. If you are wanting to experience Paris as they did 20 years ago plus then this is a great hotel bc it is VERY SMALL as it is in the older, most historic part of Paris. The staff is very nice and as far as rooms go it was okay. My wife did not like the fact that there were no curtains on bathroom window. Don't expect to watch tv there is maybe 5 channels 2 clear and none in English, as you really shouldn't want to...YOU are in Paris. No Ac either but there heating. It is just fine if you crack a couple windows. There is a toilet seat on toliet...you will find if you look for toliet in the city site seeing...toliet seats are MIA..which is very important to women at all times and men only sometimes. We recommend the Cafe/Patissere (that is as you are leaving hotel directly next door on right.) fabulous coffee, capp, and french goodies. There is a Parisian Street Market during most days across street from Metro entrance. Many places to exchange currency in walking distance. I would recommend this hotel to someone on a budget.. They do have free Wifi.. just ask the front desk and follow his or her instructions..it is not complicated but there is a short process.

Signing in on the network was very easy. You must do a simple registration on your device and then ask the front desk (who can see your registration) to allow you access. Airport Shuttle: Ask the front desk about their shuttle to the airport. It was great. It only cost about $20 for both of us. It picked us up on time and only made a few stops at hotels very near ours. It was quite possibly the fastest ride I have ever taken (I think we hit Mach 1 at one point).

The place was very tidy, looked after well.

There were only two frustrating elements upon which they could improve. Here\u2019s the lowdown: The best aspect of this hotel is the location. First time travelers to Paris will definitely want to stay in the Latin or St. Germain quarters as they will have the look and feel of the Paris you seek. Quaint narrow streets that meander in every direction make it a wonderful place to explore. The neighborhood is clean and safe; I came home after midnight during the week from bars and felt comfortable walking the streets even though very few people were on them. It\u2019s quiet late at night. Notre Dame is a five minute walk as well as the Ile St. Louis which is a great place to explore if you want to get off the beaten path away from packs of tourists. Front desk staff was friendly and Veronique\u2019s English far exceeded my French. The front desk is staffed 24 hours a day. My room on the 5th floor (American 6th) looked like the one on the website with a black, brown and cream motif with everything seemingly recently renovated. Two French doors with a small step-out balcony provided a great view and fresh air. Bathroom was nicely appointed with a great dual head shower (rain and wand) and awesome bath products. Overall everything was very clean. Bed very comfortable with nice pillows and great sheets. Mini bar with decent prices (3E for a Heineken) and a TV. I had booked a single but believe I was upgraded to a double as this room was plenty big for two average-sized people so this was a very nice gesture on the hotel\u2019s part and much appreciated. The only two frustrating elements of this hotel were that there was no computer for guests to use in terms of checking emails or using the Internet to verify open/close times of different sites. This was so helpful in the past at other hotels at which I stayed. So many hotels in Europe provide this service and while Europeans with smart phones don\u2019t need this it\u2019s harder for Americans whose phones will not work in Europe. I had trouble getting messages as there is no voice mail system for a caller to be transferred to like in American hotels. One block away was a youth hostel where I could pay to use their computer. The price at the youth hostel was E1 for 10 minutes of use. It\u2019s an Internet kiosk which was awkward to use but got the job done. When I got to London my contact said he had trouble leaving a message and was told to call back because there was no pencil, another attempt told to call back because the person was too busy to take the message. A third call the person spoke no English (OK \u2013 understandable since it\u2019s France). Another aspect about this trip to France (my fourth in the past six years) was the sticker shock. A large beer E9.60! Simple caf\u00e9s with hamburgers and sandwiches for E18-22! Even wine has gone up considerably. This may explain why so many cafes and brasseries were empty. Who can afford to go out? The inflation of the past few years is incredible. Luckily there were two amazing pastry shops, small grocer where I got a cheap beer and the most amazing pear I\u2019ve ever eaten; a cheese shop and meat shop. So it\u2019s easy to eat great food for less money. In the square is a farmers market every couple of days. Another good option. On the pedestrian streets of the Latin quarter are some cheaper food options such as E10-15 for a three-course meal. While touristy it\u2019s a good area and good food. Lots of choices and restaurateurs who are welcoming and want your business. Metro stop 1.5 block away which again made this a great hotel to have as home base. The Paris Metro is the best in the world hands down.

I think all bar one review was extremely positive. Unfortunately on arrival there was a delay in checking in, due to a broken curtain rail, this was something and nothing and did not hinder the stay. We did however have many other issues with the room which did affect our stay, we had booked a refurbished deluxe room, as advertised on the internet, when we arrived at room 12 we found that the wood around the desk /minibar badly damaged and splintering off, the tiles in the bathroom were not grouted, bad paintwork around the shower frame, the hairdryer in the bathroom was broken and parcel taped together, the carpets were filthy, there were grease marks on the headboard, blood on one of the curtains and rather than a double bed we were put in two small single beds pushed together. from my point of view this is not acceptable, small oversights are part and parcel of life, but there was no effort made to even make the room slightly acceptable.

Our room was a comfort room and had a gorgeous view of St. Germain and a very old church (St. Nicholas I think) through windows that opened up to a small railing/overlook My husband is a very light sleeper and once we closed the windows for the night, there was no noise in the room. The entire buidling is charming as was the hotel staff. Kareem at the front desk gave us wonderful recommendations and was a friend by the end of the trip. And the location is singular. A block from the metro (Maubert Mutualite - turn right if come out at St. Germain exit, walk just over a block and cross the street), it's also two short blocks from Notre Dame. And right in the Latin Quarter so we constantly planned to walk around it's alleys and get lost in areas 5th and 6th of Paris.

Not sure if it was infamous \"bed bug\" - in that case the hotel is in trouble. I reported it to the stuff and do not know the consequences. Location: - Liked: excellent location; 5 minutes walk to Notre Dame and \u00cele Saint-Louis. - Disliked: the closest metro station belongs to a left-bank-only line, so that to come here from other parts of the city you need to change lines, which takes too much time in Paris. So it does not make sense to use metro for short distances. Result: suring our stay we just walked, did not use metro at all. Internet: - Mixed feelings: there is WiFi, but the quality is not good; need to find a place in the room. However this is the way it is with most hotels. Convenience: - Liked: electric kettle and tea bags in the room. Much better that those coffee-makers I saw in American hotels, especially for people that like tea. - Disliked: no available electric outlets except in the bathroom.

We are 23 and 24 years old, and needed a hotel that was decently priced but still clean and nice. Abbatial blew away our expectations! We booked six months in advance on Expedia, and I added a little note on the website that I would prefer a \"higher floor with a balcony if available\" ... I honestly didn't expect that request to be fulfilled, but it was! They put us on the top floor (level five) in a room with a walk out balcony for no extra cost. The room is cleaned thoroughly every day by their staff, and the beds are made up comfortably and very clean. The bedspread is a fluffy, white, down comforter -- we've been so comfortable every night! The balcony gave us a gorgeous view of the Latin Quarter. There is a nice, tall wardrobe so you can hang your clothes, and a few shelves with a safe for security, and a mini fridge. The lights are even well placed, with switches right by your bed so you don't have to get up if you forgot to turn off the lights! Totally comfortable little room, to say the least. Also, a little side note about the staff -- one night my husband brought me home a red rose before dinner. Side-tracked, I left the rose on the desk. We went out to dinner, fell asleep, went out the next morning for a day at the Louvre, and when we got back they had cleaned our room and put my rose in a vase of water to keep it from wilting! If anyone complains that the room is too small, then I would say perhaps that THEY are too big. The room is an adequate size for two people staying in Paris... especially for the money. Great room, great decor, great service. Also check out the restaurant just outside the front door of the hotel. If you're facing the hotel, it is on your immediate right. The staff at this restaurant were amazing, the food was delicious and the drinks were cheap. The servers were the friendliest we met in Paris, and really catered to us even though we didn't speak a word of French... They offered us English menus and joked with us that they could teach us French while we were visiting. I would definitely go back to Hotel Abbatial. The location is perfect (we saw nearly every neighborhood of the city in our stay, and feel that the Latin Quarter is by far the best if you like cafes on every corner, outdoor bars, book stores, flower shops, and a young but quiet feel to the neighborhood. It is close to Sorbonne University, so there are quite a lot of young people.)", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maastricht, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201c#1 Customer Service in Paris\u201d", "Author": "Troi R", "ReviewID": "UR119126374", "Content": "Always a warm greeting at the front desk.

We stayed in their triple room, room 61, and our stay was extremely enjoyable. There was plenty of room for two or three people. The exciting thing about this room is that it is down off it's own small hallway and therefore, there is no noise from any other rooms. We felt like we were on our own private floor. In addition, there are two windows with small balconies in the room. This allowed for nice fresh air circulation should you want it. There is a thermostat that is also easy to use if necessary (we didn't really need it). There is some city noise, sirens etc., but you have to expect that since you are in a city! Some people have complained or noted the church chiming across the street. It does chime, but we never heard it after 10 PM and never before 7:30 AM, so unless you sleep odd hours, it is not an issue. We took a couple of afternoon naps and had no problems sleeping. One other cool thing about the room is the view. There is a small balcony that one get a great view of Notre Dame. The balcony might be a bit hard to get up to for someone with limited mobility. It is about a one and a half foot step up from the floor of the room. We had a great time on sunny afternoons, just standing out there enjoying the sun and the sights. The beds and bathroom were great. I want to point out ...No bed bugs in this room, I checked when we first checked in. There is a very small elevator that holds about two people. The people at the front desk were very helpful and I had no trouble getting the free wifi set up on my netbook. The front desk had no trouble understanding English. We did not eat breakfast there, too many other places to get a quick bite to eat nearby, so I can not comment on that. The hotel is very easy to get to from the CDG airport. We just took the RER B to the St. Michel station and walked for about 10 minutes to the hotel. No sweat. The hotel location is great. Many shops for cheese, bread, deli meats, etc. nearby along with restaurants. There are even a couple of Franprixs within easy walking distance for groceries. The room had a very small fridge which was nice. We were a within easy walking distance of Notre Dame and the Seine.

The cancellation process for the last 3 nights was easily done online. We both booked Superior rooms, and my booking does say with bath - but we only got a shower. Not sure what happened there - but in the end it didn't matter, the shower was fantastic. The cubicle itself was large and the water pressure/heat was just right. The rooms, as you would expect in Paris, are not large at all - we didn't really have any room to put our bags (which is always a pain) but we did get rooms on Rue St Germain side and both rooms had 2 French doors going to a private little balcony. The best thing about this hotel is the location. I loved that you walk down one little side street beside the hotel and there is Notre Dame right in front of you - how fantastic! There are so many restaurants in the area, a laundromat a few streets away - and the Maubert market on Saturdays is small but great. We bought some little jams, mustards, scarves and the yummiest strawberries I have ever tasted there. There is a little cafe right beside the hotel that does take away coffees. Also there are a few bakeries very close by, including Eric Kayser a street away. The staff were very friendly, when we got to the hotel and were definitely there if we had any questions. They spoke very good English as well. Overall we had a great stay, and I recommend this hotel to other travellers.

I had requested a \"quieter\" room since I'm a light sleeper and we were given a room on the 5th floor facing an interior courtyard (not pretty and without a view unlike the street view rooms but very quiet). Our room had somewhat of an awkward layout but there was enough space for our luggage. We appreciated the free wi-fi, safe, and the mini fridge. The bathroom was a good size and I love bathrooms that have natural light (ours had big double windows with frosted glass). The bath products provided smelled wonderful and I'm looking into purchasing some for home use. We ate breakfast there 3 times and thought it was a fair deal (12 Euro/person) for what we got (buffet style scrambled eggs, sausage, assorted breads and some pastries, yogurt, fruit, juice, coffee, cheese, etc). We usually filled up and saved some money by having a light lunch. The location was pretty good but we may look for a place slightly more east down Saint Germain next time we visit just for a change. There's a small market practically across the street and Rue Mouffetard is within walking distance. On our last day, we almost missed our train back to London and had to take a taxi instead of the RER (as we had originally planned) and the taxi was only 13Euro to Gare Nord (there's a taxi stand just down the street from the hotel). The only negative thing we experienced were noisy hotel guests that stayed across from our room. I think it was a couple of younger females (or maybe not) but the first few nights we were there, they would return to the hotel at 2am and were loud (in the hallway and in their room...we could hear them in their room talking). I was tempted to go over the third night to tell them to be mindful of other guest but decided to just let it go.

Let me qualify by adding that we were able to take advantage of the online 3-night package, so our room came out to 100 euros a night. There was hardly any other hotel that offered similar quality at this price during the high-season. The hotel is very central. A stone's-throw from the metro system, and a 5-min walk from the RER B (goes to airport) and RER C (goes to Versailles). Our room came with a private safe, so we did not have to worry about important belongings. It also had a mini-bar fridge, so we were able to cram-in some cheeses, fruit, juice and yogurt. This was very important for us, since eating out in Paris is extremely expensive and grocery/market shopping, at least for some meals, is the key to saving money. It is also the more romantic option. Anywhere along La Seine river and right by The Effiel Tower, Parisians and tourists alike picnic. Bring a thin sheet to eat or sit on. The Notre-Dame Basilica along La Seine river (at least one of, or thee most beautiful spot in Paris) is a 2-min walk from the hotel. We regret a few things after our trip to Paris, like to going to Versailles (not worth the money and time in my opinion) and not having time left to dedicate an afternoon walking around Montmartre district (absolutely charming), but our choice of hotel did not disappoint. *Room: was smallish (but also typical of Paris) and carpeted. Bathroom was a good size though. Good balcony. We had room #53 on the fifth floor - top storey. **Food in the area: Picnic-friendly! An outdoor market (Market Mutualite) on select days and time. Bakery, butcher and cheese shop very close by and next to each other. Great Asian (Vietnamese) restaurant in the area on the busy intersection closest to the hotel. I can't remember the name, but you can't miss or mistake it. There is a huge outdoor terasse at the bottom of some stairs. I had a bowl called Bo-Bens at 12 euros, which is what many people around us were eating.

There is a very small elevator which can accommodate luggage but with only one person. the room was European sized (small by American standards) but very clean. It was well maintained for our stay. They offered TV in the room with English channels. The view was of the street but it was a nice view. The bathroom and shower were fairly new and in good repair, and also very clean. The room included a dining area for breakfast; a buffet with scrambled eggs, tea/coffee, cereal, fruit, bread, yogurt. In short, almost anything you could want. There was a small fee for this meal. Breakfast service went above expectations though as the staff offered several times to send coffee to my room (at no charge). Wireless internet was available and actually worked pretty well. Hotel staff was very friendly and offered to help us in many small ways; calling taxis & museums, special cleaning, restaurant calls/recommendations, directions. It seems a small family-run business and felt very comfortable to stay there. It is not really very near the Louvre/Eiffel area so taxis are needed.

Friends of ours had recommended The Hotel Abbatial Saint Germain to us several times and this year we decided to make a change and try something new. Starting with the booking process Vanessa at the Hotel Abbatial Saint Germain was extremely helpful and accommodating. I explained to her how long we had been coming to Paris and that I was surprising my husband with this trip for both his birthday and Valentine\u2019s Day. I requested a room on the 5th or 6th floor if it would be available and anything she could do to help me to make this trip unique and special for both of us. Upon arrival we were greeted by Vanessa and she is as friendly and kind as I had perceived in our correspondents. The room she had chosen for us was just perfect. We had a wrap around balcony that gave us a great view of the street and both cathedrals. We felt the noise from the street was very minimal. The location of the hotel could not be better with the abundant choices of restaurants, cafes, shops, Notre Dame and the river within 5 minutes walk from the hotel. The hotel offers a nice breakfast if you prefer or you can go to limitless places within walking distance to satisfy your heart\u2019s desire. Everyone on the staff makes you feel so welcome and wants to help in any way to make your trip special. In addition, there is free internet access in the rooms. This trip was more special and memorable than we could have ever imagined prior to leaving home. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting Paris either for the first time or has always wanted to feel like they were a resident for a short period of time.

Multiple cafes and bars dot the neighborhood. Our best \"find\" was an outdoor market on St. Germain, about two blocks west of the hotel (cheese shop; deli; wine shop; fruit stands; coffee ... all the things to make a quick stop to eat on the run).

The hotel's website list much higher, so do some shopping around. Cleanliness ... room was great, sharp, and the rest of the hotel area was in great shape. Rooms ... We give a 4 (out of 5) for only one reason (and it's a shame), but there was no dresser in the room. A small one could have fit we think. The room did not feel 'tiny\" (I've stayed in smaller, more expensive places). We utilized the high shelving in the closet (which may be difficult for people under 5'6\" or so.

You cannot simply build a massive commercial sized elevator in a building that is 200 years old. Get over it. Recommend ... In Paris (for work a few years ago) I stayed at Hotel Edouard VII.

The room does include a small safe, small fridge and a small TV. There are 2 juliet balconies in this room, but don't' be surprised if having multiple suitcases means you can only access one. THE HOTEL The people here are very nice and speak English. I've never encountered this before, but you have to leave your card key with reception whenever you leave. When you return you just indicate your room number and they give you the key. I'm not sure what stops strangers from strolling in and asking for a random room key. But it wasn't a problem when we were there. We had breakfast included in our package, but we wished we didn't. Not because it was bad, but because we cold get a lot more outside of the hotel for 6 Euros per person. If you have the option to skip the breakfast, you should do so. There are bakeries and cheese shops in the neighbourhood where you can get much more for less. This place is a 5 minute walk to the back side of the Notre Dame Cathedral.

The room was very smalll but adequate although since we stayed for 11 nights it would have been nice to have a bit more space. The problem was the bathroom. The lighting was not exactly over the sink and mirror area but rather to the side so it was not the best for makeup and shaving making it an even longer 12 days for us and because the wall was sloped you had to watch your head when getting in and out of the tub which for some strange reason seemed extra slippery. We did ask about another room and were given a choice of 1 other room which was oddly shaped and not much better so we stuck with 66. We did see some other rooms that were being cleaned during our stay and they looked much better, fresher looking and even a little bigger and brighter. We did not have breakfast there since there are so many places close or within a short distance. The restaurant selection on the left bank is outstanding.

It is very easy to get to from the airport: take the RER to St. Michel, transfer to the 10 and get off a couple stops later. Its a very short walk from the Metro stop to the hotel, which is a little hard to find at first (exit the north side of the Metro on Saint Germain, face East and walk past a couple streets, the hotel is tucked behind a cafe after Rue Monge). The RER is only 8.50euros, while taking a taxi is over 50euros. The staff at the hotel is very nice and pleasant (and they speak English) though (as i noticed with most of the customer service in Paris) they either cannot multitask (help more than 1 customer at a time) or they just don't want to be rude to customer #1 by talking to you at the same time (and instead they ignore you for 10 minutes until customer #1 is finished asking questions). Anyway, the hotel is very small. The rooms are tiny, but you have your own shower, toilet and sink, and the water pressure is fine. Also comes with free wifi and a hairdryer in the room. No need to bring shampoo; they have a 3-in-1 shampoo/conditioner/soap dispenser next to the bathroom sink as well as in the shower. But I would recommend you bring your own body lotion; looks like they refill what was left by the last resident, so the bottles have a bit of stickiness and residue on them. Also, if you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs. The walls are THIN! Beds are comfortable, but small (fits one person or 2 very small people). The rooms come with a little frig stocked with drinks. The pricing of the drinks aren't too outrageous. They are about the same as buying a drink from a cafe. But I would recommend you buy your drinks at the street vendor one block west on the south side of Saint Germain; they're cheaper by 1euro (or $1.50USD). Be prepared to climb a lot of stairs; the hotel elevator is very slow and tiny (fits one person with luggage or 2 people very tightly without luggage). I did not check out their breakfast, but its an extra 12euros (I opted for street crepes, croissants and an Orangina). Overall, this is a great place to stay. Its a very short walk to Notre-Dame and also super close to St. Severin (lots of cafes and souvenir shops open late there). If you dont like walking or taking mass public transportation, there is a Taxi stand right before the metro stop. I traveled to Paris alone as a single woman and felt relatively safe walking back to the hotel at midnight, but since the hotel is tucked away and a couple blocks away from the 'happenin' scene, i walked very quickly and vigilantly back to the hotel.

Besides cleanliness and price, location was a large factor for me as I didn't want to feel uncomfortable coming back to the hotel at night - and that was never a problem with this hotel. In other respects, the location was perfect as well. It is in walking distance to nearly all of the tourist sites right at the heart of Paris (though some like the Eiffel tower aren't a short stroll), convenient to a metro, and right near the Latin quarter. I stayed in room 66 which was one of the 'superior double rooms with bath'. I would recommend the top floor rooms that face out onto the street, as that was part of the appeal for me. The little 'balconey' (really, part of the roof) was lovely, and I put the desk chair out there most nights and read for awhile. Noise was never an issue, not even when I took a nap right in the middle of the afternoon when I was tired after a very long plane flight. I would imagine this would be different if the AC was not yet on and you needed the windows open, but this wasn't the case in June. The view to the inner side of the hotel, were the washrooom window faced in this room, isn't exactly breathtaking. The room wasn't 'new' and luxurious, but it was clean and charming. The quality of the shower spray left a lot to be desired, but that's nitpicking as it did it's job. I did have issues with hot water one morning (though just the one), and the temperature didn't always stay constant, but it did it's job. The bed was older, but comfortable. It had the requisit in room safe, a television with a few channels, and well functioning and self adjustabe air conditioning. I had asked for early check in as I knew I would be arriving before 2, and was unable to be accomodated due to the checkout time of the previous person - however they do have luggage storage which they offered to me. However given it left a lot to be desired (basically their 'lounge' room where there were many people sitting and waiting) and I was exhausted, I didn't avail myself of it. The staff in general was very friendly and polite, and helpful when I was trying to find an internet cafe in the area - and tolerant when I idiotically hadn't been able to find the shade pulldown for the washroom window. Most of them spoke English relatively fluently, and the minimal school girl French I had was enough to get me by otherwise. The Abbatial is probably not the absolute best value in terms of price, but Paris isn't a cheap city, and in comparison to what I shopped around for it compares well. At least when you get a deal on their website as I had this particular time. It wasn't a fancy modern hotel, but I was charmed by it and liked the location, and really enjoyed my stay here.

Scrambled eggs, baguettes, cheese, yogurt, juice, coffee, etc. Being a French learner I was pleased when staff members would converse in French and not always switch to English immediately, which used to bother me but I now see is often their attempt to be helpful, efficient or practice English.

Previous reviews cover just about every possibility. The hotel was clean. They are remodeling on at least 2 floors in preparation for the busy season. When traveling we do not need much in the way of help so are interaction with the employees was minimal. They were however friendly enough and as best as I can determine everyone spoke English. Check-in and check-out were fast and easy. They arranged shuttle transportation to the airport for us which cost only a little more than taking the train from St. Michel. Worth the added expense for me as it does help reduce some of the confusion with the train and drop off point at the airport. The walk to and from St. Michel is about 10 minutes and easy to do if you are traveling light, may be with a single roller bag and a purse or backpack. Consider that we are in our late 50's it is not a problem to walk to the hotel from St. Michel or the nearest metro stop. The hotel's A/C was not on yet but that is very typical in Europe for this time of year when the temperatures are great for sleeping with or without a window open. There was much street noise but that was not a problem for me though certainly could be for some. We never tried their breakfast as there are just to many options just outside the door. There were at least a dozen restaurants within two blocks and that many ATM's as well Great: Location, with good transportation options, far enough from the crowds at St. Severin yet close enough to many tourist sights to walk. Good: Good dinning options near hotel Bad: Small rooms, street noise The Abbatial is a good basic hotel and I would recommend it to anyone looking for that in a Parisian hotel. Do try the restaurant just next door, Trattoria Roma, at least that is the name on the canopy. Good food, great service, at reasonable prices. We did not have their pizza but judging by the high number of take out pizzas they sell they must be very good.

The location is unbeatable - one block south of the Seine and the bridge that crosses both the Ile de la Cit\u00e9 and Ile St. Louis, just a few blocks from the Pantheon, the Cluny Museum, St. Severin, St. Etienne-du-Mont and other 5th Arr. attractions, and 1.5 blocks from the Maubert-Mutualit\u00e9 stop on the 10th Metro line. The Louvre and the Orsay museums are about a 20 minute walk. It is also about 4 blocks from the RER station at St. Michel with direct trains to CDG and Orly airports. The staff have been unfailingly cordial and helpful, and uniformly speak excellent English (although also politely tolerant of my erratic French without condescension). While the rooms are simply furnished, and are quite small by American standards, they are better than average size for Paris, particularly for the extremely reasonable rates (go directly to the hotel website for the best pricing and range of room options). The bathrooms are kept spotless and the rooms are impeccably cleaned. Beds are firm but quite comfortable. (On my second trip there was one section of wallcovering that was pulling away from one wall - a small quibble, which had been repaired the next day even though I hadn't reported it yet). There is cable TV and wireless Internet access with no extra charge. Heating is steam radiator, rooms are individually air conditioned (although controls are quirky and require assistance from the reception). The elevator is miniscule - barely room for two people, or one person and one suitcase; take the stairs when possible, they are wide enough even when carrying luggage. Keys are required to be left at the desk when you go out during the day - perhaps not the most secure arrangement, although the hotel staff seem quick to recognize clients, and there is an in-room safe (ok for small valuables but too small for a laptop, however). Interior rooms face a courtyard that is decidedly unscenic, but dead quiet if you are bothered by street noise (the Boulevard is quite busy). Skip the continental breakfast (12 euro extra per day) in favor of a cafe & fresh croissant or pain au chocolat at the coffee shop on the opposite side of Place Maubert for about 5-6 euro. There are excellent pastries, bread, baked goods and pannini sandwiches to be had just a block west at Boulangerie Julien. There are a number of typical French cafes and restaurants and interesting ethnic restaurants within 4 blocks in any direction, to suit any budget and taste (including La Tour d'Argent if you really want to go stratospheric).

The room was a good size, very clean, with built-in wardrobes (plenty of hangers), flat screen TV, desk for our laptop, and the bathroom was immaculate with hair dryer, great shower etc. The double bed was two singles pushed together but that is European luxury for you! The staff were excellent, speaking English and always happy to help, offer advice etc. Always very friendly too. Our room was cleaned every morning if we wanted it, with fresh towels daily. The breakfast was very good also. Downstairs with a lovely French lady. Basically you get bread, croissants, yoghurt, coffee, fruit salad, juice, and cereal - as much as you want. Worth a try but there are also some other great places nearby which have a nice offering. Location is great too. Just a few mins walk from Notre Dame, and about the same distance to the local underground/train station. Plenty of nice little cafes, restaurants and shops 5 mins away, or if you are happy to walk 10-15 mins there is so much on offer.

A unit was available in both rooms my party rented--presumably in all rooms throughout the hotel--but they lack the remotes needed to turn the AC on. Neither of our rooms had a remote. On the second night, after a first that was hot and stuffy, I asked what I needed to do to turn on the air conditioner. The clerk rooted around in a drawer and pulled out a remote, which I took up to my room. At 11:15 I was roused from a sound sleep by a phone call from the front desk asking me to take the remote down--it was needed for another room. When I demurred, the clerk suggested I put the remote on the elevator and send it down, which I did. To me this was unacceptable.

I sleep like a rock so the noise was no problem for me. But for my boyfriend it was another story. Loved that we had 3 large window in the room that completely open to let fresh air in. I would not reccomend this hotel for elderly as the bathtub is difficult to get out of and very, very slippery. If you like oysters I would highly reccomend eating at Le Bar a Huitres on St. Germain.

It is rated, correctly, as a three-star hotel, but it is near the top of the class. The highlights are the location, the cleanliness, and the staff. The hotel is walking distance to many famous sites and two hundred yards to the metro station. Airport transportation is simple. Take the RER B from CDG to St. Michel, and then switch trains and take the metro to Maubert Mutualite. I'm a novice and it was fairly easy. It will cost about 9 euros per person, each way. The hotel can arrange a shuttle to/from the airport for about 17 euros per person, each way. We took the train to the hotel and the shuttle to CDG. Both were fine, and luggage posed no problem. The housekeeping staff did a tremendous job keeping the room spotless and doing so unobtrusively. They were great. The front desk personnel, especially the woman who worked evenings and the overnight guy, were also great. Very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. Now for the negative aspects. The rooms are small. Please spare me the \"but you're in Paris, what did you expect\" rationale. Small is small, regardless of country. We had a \"Superior Double\" room and it was approximately 9-feet x 11-feet, plus a small bathroom. The bed and armoire took up almost the entire room. Storage space is tight. The TV was a disappointing 13-inch (or very close) CRT. Approximately 14 channels -- two English (BBC and MSNBC), one German, one Spanish, and the rest French. The bathroom had a tub/shower combo and it did a bad job at both. The tub is small, but deeper than normal. In the shower, the water temperature constantly cycled, every 30 seconds or so, between very cold and very hot. Very annoying. And the water pressure was horrible. The shower had a half-panel glass separator between it and the toilet that was worthless. If you take a shower, the floor gets wet. Period. Why they didn't install a shower curtain or sliding door is beyond me. And as small as the shower/tub is, they've mounted the towel racks on the inside shower wall! Very odd. Every hotel has flaws, so don't get too discouraged by my critique. This is my second stay at the hotel and I like it. If they would fix some of these annoying faults, I would love it. If you get a price break from the rack rate, the hotel is a good value. p.s. Empty out the mini bar and use it as a fridge. There is a grocery store right across the street that sells, among other things, beer, wine and liquor. The Mexican restaurant and the Brasserie next door are mediocre. The restaurant Marie Verte, a side-street or two down, is excellent.", "Date": "February 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Runcorn, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery Happy With The Abbatial Saint Germain\u201d", "Author": "AnnBellfield", "ReviewID": "UR12770870", "Content": "My husband and I took our parents to Paris for the first time and opted for this hotel.

I've seen, in other reviews, complaints about the elevator beeing to narrow. It is, indeed, but quite enough for two people and a big luggage. Nothing to worry about. So, if you are looking for the best stay in Paris, pick Abbatial. It's really 5 minutes walk to the famous Parisian islands (if you have room no 52 you can actually see Notre Dome and The Pantheon through the window), river Sena, Louvre and Jardin du Luxembourg. Also, from here you can walk to Rue de Rivoli and futher to Champs Elysses.

For Americans, if you ever stayed in NYC or San Francisco hotels, you know what I am talking about. Main thing I look for in a hotel room is the cleanliness and Hotel Abbatial was top notch. We felt very comfortable using the facilities and the sheets and pillows looked like they were brand new. ~Transportation; Le Open tours stop 2 blocks away, metro is a block away, you can take the train to this station from either airport and save a ton of $$$.

While the hotel is on the Quartier Latin and not the St. Germain side of the Blvd. St. Germain, the location is very central and convenient: two blocks from the subway (Maubert-Mutualite), 6 blocks from the RER (suburban rail) that will take you to CDG airport (St. Michel), two metro stations (1km or so) from the old St. Germain cafes and 1 block from the river bridge to Notre Dame. Unlike St. Germain the area is quiet (but not deserted or unsafe) at night, while there are plenty of little stores and cafes around. The rooms are small but not tiny (at least for the price and the location), and I would suggest getting a room facing the street in the middle floors (3rd-5th). The elevator is tiny, so don't expect to share it with other people and their baggage. The reception staff is very polite and helpful and all that I spoke to spoke excellent English. The breakfast is ridiculously and unreasonably overpriced, considering the number of places serving breakfast within 100 meters. All in all, I would definitely recommend the hotel for people visiting Paris on a budget, since while the hotel is unremarkable, it does not have any flaws, and the price is quite reasonable for its location (normally one train change was sufficient to reach all tourist attractions).", "Date": "April 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cAwesome at the Abbatial Saint Germain\u201d", "Author": "jazbad", "ReviewID": "UR7363566", "Content": "We were very pleased with the service and location of this hotel.

It's also a wonderful lively area for going out at night. I have also stayed at Hotel Europe St. Severin in the Latin Quarter that was also good but the prices are about 40 euros more.

Its in one of the pricier locations in Paris, so cafes etc not cheap, but there were loads of great food places 15 minutes walk into the heart of the busy Latin Quarter. If you like seafood you have to go to cafe heutris, ten minutes walk away. You will spot it on a corner with huge shelves of oysters on the front!! The staff were so welcoming, the fresh ice packed platter of mussel, oyster, whelk, crab etc was truly spectacular!! On the junction with the Blvd and the seine is the Museum de Arabe. An amazing metal cladded building. Dont pay to go up the Notre dame towers for the view...go up their lift to the roof terrace for free! My favourite place to eat is refuge de fondue on street of the 3 brothers just below the sacre cour.

Overall we had a pleasant stay and would recommend this for anyone who just wants somewhere to rest their heads at the end of a busy day sightseeing in Paris. We stayed in room 36, a double room at the front of the hotel which had nice views over Blvd St Germain. The room itself was small but clean. The bathroom was bigger than others I have seen in similar Paris hotels and looked as if it had been recently renovated. There was a small mini bar, safe, hairdryer and TV with a few channels to choose from. On the downside the room was quite warm and the air conditioning unit didn't appear to be working. The windows were full length French windows and opening them up to cool the room down wasn't really an option as it was very cold outside and the noise from the main road would have been too much. The other point to note is that there are a number of churches in the area and if you are a light sleeper you may well find yourself being woken up by various bells, especially on Sunday morning! We had breakfast in the hotel on the Sunday morning and there was a reasonable selection of bread, pastries, yoghurt, cheese and scrambled egg. Juices, coffee and tea were also available. Although breakfast was fine, at 12 euros per person we thought this was a little expensive and you could probably find better value at one of the cafes nearby. The location of the hotel is very good indeed. It's a short walk to Notre Dame, near to a number of useful Metro stations and there are lots of bars and restaurants nearby to choose from. We strolled to the Louvre in about 30 mins and walked back from The Bastille in a similar time. It's a great base for exploring Paris and I'd certainly stay in this area again. All the staff that we encountered were very friendly and all spoke good English (we actually found in most places in Paris that our attempts to speak French were usually met with responses in English, in fact on one place someone actually apologised to me for not knowing the word in English -not quite the surly attitude that I had been lead to expect!) The only other word of caution is that the hotel lift is tiny, if you have limited mobility or are on the larger side then this may be a problem if you had a room on a higher floor.

We took rooms 32 (2 single beds for our kids) & 42 (double room for my wife & self.Both have modernised bathrooms with showers &- a feature we all appreciated, liquid soap dispensers in vanity & shower areas- a small feature but much appreciated.Room rate 130 euros per room-reduced from 195. This hotel is in a fantastic position between Pantheon & Notre Dame. Sorbonne is next to Pantheon & St. Germain Des Pres is about 10 minutes walk away- opposite this awe inspiring church are Cafe De FLores & Les Deux Magots-THE places to enjoy coffee,hot chocolate(the hot chocolate in all of Paris is the best I have had but coffee drinkers beware make sure you describe what you want accurately -I am not a coffee drinker but my wife is & she was disappointed in the coffee several times). My wife & I enjoyed walking around area every night & one particular evening took a repeat visit to Notre Dame & voila there was a Mass(probably was 6p.m. Mass) on. We are not very religious but even as I write this review my eyes are misting up.There were 2 priests, 1 lady singer, organ music & it was like being at an opera.The music & singing were absolutely beautiful. Definitely 1 of the highlights of our holiday.Being winter it was even more enjoyable as the cathedral was dimly lit. A must do is the on & off bus tour (the green one-4 different interconnecting routes ). We got a 2 day ticket & saw a lot of Paris this way. Of course the Louvre,Orsay museum, Picasso museum, Sacre Coeur, River Seine cruise, are all a must but there are also other parts of Paris that are attractions in themselves.Try the wonderful Marais area where you have people of all persuasions-the Jewish area is very interesting &, according to my kids, the best falafel in the world! The department stores in Paris are very expensive & the service &attitude could be improved.There Is a lovely city named Troyes ,about 1.5 hours train ride from Paris (Gare de l`Est).You see an area outside Paris,save on your shopping &visit a beautiful city which has a lot of history & half-timbered houses a la Stratford in U.K. The Abbatial has breakfast in the dome shaped basement where a delightful lady will cook you the most eggy scrambled eggs any of us have ever tried.

B'fast was nothing special and the fruit offered was only whole fruit. The thrid night (of six) that we were there my husband proclaimed while I was in the shower that we could see the Eiffel Tower from our room. Well since the hotel boasts about having views of Notre Dame I thought my husband was confused about this but by the time I got to the window the lights on the tower were all ablaze. So we did have a view from our room of the most famous landmark in all of Paris and you could see if from the room, where for the Notre Dame view you must exit to the tiny balcony. The next day I mentioned to the guy at the desk that we were surprised no one mentioned we had a veiw of the Eiffel Tower from our room and he looked at me like I was crazy and aksed what room I was in. Im sure only our room and the one above us had the view but and we could only see about a fifth of the of the tower (top). But still since most places in Paris that have an ET view they charge extra for (some views requiring you to crane your neck), why wouldn't this place even know that two of their rooms had it?.... Our safe didn't work so the staff offered to keep them downstairs so they'd be safe but when we got them back the day before we left we found they had been in an unlocked drawer the whole time! Obviously they would have been much safer in our locked room. Also, it seems as though most rooms (all non-corner rooms) had pocket doors for the bathroom and none of them actually closed so everyone complained but they of course could not be fixed. So unless you're staying on the 5th or 6th floor, on the corner I'd pass on this place and look for a place with a more customer service oriented staff and closing bathroom doors. I highly doubt their a/c units really work as someone actually wanted theirs turned on (it was not hot to us) and there was a problem with that request too.

Otherwise, the room was pleasant -- undeniably tiny, but nicely decorated and clean. I particularly liked the light switches next above the nightstands, the two balconies looking out onto the street, and the easy-to-use safe. We booked a double room with a shower but were confused on both accounts when we actually saw the room. In the States, a double room generally gets you two beds, but here, a double room means one double bed. And our bathroom, which was in very decent condition, had an actual bathtub instead of just a shower (not that we complained)! We never did eat in the cramped basement breakfast room, preferring instead to spend those ten euros on breakfast in one of the many wonderful nearby cafes with outdoor tables. Staff were mixed -- some were kind and very helpful, some less so, but none were downright unpleasant.

It was a special occasion and my husband and I were treating my mum and dad to a long weekend away. I'd tried my best to plan everything so that it would be just right. We booked the hotel 2 months in advance through Laterooms. Almost immediately after booking we received an email from the hotel stating that our credit card wasn't valid. After checking out the problem we realised that the booking agent had given them the wrong expiry date. I emailed the hotel on several occasions with the amended expiry date and asked them to confirm my booking. I was informed by email from 'Vanessa' that the 2 rooms were confirmed. 1 week before travelling I emailed again just to confirm and I was contacted again and told that the 2 rooms were confirmed. However, on arrival we were told that because it was a busy weekend in Paris that they had already let one of the rooms to someone else and that one of us would have to stay in an alternative hotel up the road (which doesn't have views of Notre Dame and wasn't in the location we specifically chose). There was absolutely no reasoning with her and she continued to say that 'normally' when they confirmed a booking then it is confirmed - but not this time. I had copies of the confirmation email that she had sent me a week earlier but she refused to listen - she then basically told us that if we weren't careful we would end up without any rooms at all as she knew that most of the hotels in the area were fully booked. We ultimatley left as we had no choice and ended up staying in a different hotel. I told her that I was appalled with the customer service and that I would ensure that I gave a full review on the internet (as this was where I made my decision in the first place). She shrugged and stated that they were a very popular hotel anyway and that bad reivews didn't affect their trade. I would just like to say - don't believe the hype! From what we saw of the hotel it is at best average - there are loads of nice low budget hotels in the Saint Germain area and I would be inclined to choose another in a hope that they may realise that when some people book something - that's generally what they want! I am disgusted and upset with the treatment we received and I'm also sorry for the other couple who also seemed to be being messed around (I saw them tramping off to the other hotel only to be turned away!)

The room air conditioning was excellent but it was very hot in the corridors and lift. We had a tiny balcony with view of the Parthenon dome and the Eiffel Tower. We had no noise problems. The maid service was friendly and efficient. The front desk staff were a delight, always friendly and welcoming. We had breakfast in the vaulted stone ceiling room and enjoyed it immensely. There was no hot water on one occasion (I seem to recall another reviewer may have mentioned this) but it was all sorted out in about one hour. There is a Laundromat very nearby (up street by church). Yes the best Metro route at St Michel is a little far when you have been walking all day but hey walk back along the Quay gaze across at Notre Dame and you are soon 'home'. There is an excellent 'grocery' shop over the road, a wonderful boulangerie to the West and we had a lovely meal at 'Maharaja' Indian restaurant also to the West. We always felt safe day and night in the neighborhood. We would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel to you.", "Date": "August 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eden Prairie, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "horn55", "ReviewID": "UR3781262", "Content": "Just got back and spent 4 days at this hotel.

The view of the Gothic church and Pantheon was extraordinary--what a sight each morning. Great cafes just moments away; Notre Dame is a two minute walk just around the corner. Continue north for two more minutes for Berthillon, the best ice cream in the world. Delicious boulangerie just west of hotel on St. Germain. The closest \"hub\" metro stop is St. Michel, a ten minute walk, which seemed a little far after a day of sightseeing. But the Maubert-Mutualite stop is about a minute away.

Honestly, given everyone's comments on ALL the Parisian hotels, we expected a tiny room, barely enough to move around in or open suitcases in, but figured the goal was only to be sleeping there; the room was actually a pleasant size. The bed was two twin beds pushed together, which was comfortable enough (a bit firmer than I prefer). at the end of the bed there was enough space to fully open a large suitcase, and then there was a desk with the minibar under it. there was a flat screen TV that played BBC news and then French/Italian channels. the closet had enough hangers, and there was a safe in the closet, the kind that you program in your own combination, which I really like, big enough to hold our stuff. there were two french doors that opened onto cute terraces, not big enough to sit in, but nice to stand in. we weren't high enough to see notre dame, but that was okay with us. the bathroom was nice, we had a tub/shower. as another reviewer mentioned, be sure to put towels down, since there is only a half shower screen, so inevitable the floor and even the toilet got pretty wet easily. water pressure was good. oddly, on the last morning, about 2 hours before checkout, we had NO hot water at all in the bathroom - shower or sink ... no problem during the rest of the time we were there, and we didn't bother to call downstairs to ask, since we were heading out anyway. elevator is tiny, 2 people or 1 person with luggage is all that fits, and a few times when we came in mid day the elevator wasn't working, but it was always back up when we came in during the evening. staff at the front desk was very helpful, all spoke english, helped us get reservations for dinner. we didn't eat breakfast there, preferring instead to sample the local patisseries and creperies (plenty within 1-2 blocks, on your way to notre dame, which is about 2-3 short blocks away). there is a grocer across the road, I highly recommend visiting there early on to pick up drinks/snacks. the tiny glass bottles of soda were something like 2.65 euro in the room, water 1.50 in the room (minibar), but when we went to the grocer, I was able to get a 1.5L soda for less than 1 euro, milk for about 2 euro, plenty of cheeses to sample, and fresh bread from the patisserie. theres also a fromagerie about two blocks away, although we didn't go in. we really liked the area we were in, quiet enough not to feel like we were in the middle of spring break, but busy enough that there was always something we could go do. notre dame was really close. plenty of places to eat and snack. metro is literally out the front door from the hotel. the l'open tour bus stop is about 2 blocks away. we really enjoyed our stay at the abbatial saint germaine, would highly recommend it to others!", "Date": "March 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tallahassee,Florida", "Title": "\u201cQuaint, nicely located and pleasant staff\u201d", "Author": "fsukeyrat", "ReviewID": "UR3242662", "Content": "Stayed 02/19 - 02/25.

It's in a gorgeous area (Latin Quarter and St. Germain de Pres), both really local and vibrant in character. One gets the sense in staying there that it's a less touristy and more Parisian neighbourhood than elsewhere. Extremely central too, Notre Dame is one block behind the hotel and there are efficient subway connections two minutes away. A nearby market by the Metro station has all sorts of options for self-catering and the in-room minibar is great for keeping gooey brie and mousse pastries chilled for late night jet-lag snacks. Reception (Karine and Marco) are both extremely helpful and were more than accomodating when I asked to be moved to a larger room after two nights. For a big guy like myself or couples travelling, request a room facing the street as they are larger and have better views than those facing \"the courtyard\" (an airshaft). Room 37, a double, is very lovely, good mattress, good strong water pressure in the showers, white tiled bathroom and best of all, sound proofed windows to block out any excessive street noise from your view overlooking the busy Latin Quarter. Room soverlooking the street have juliet balconies and full length windows thaty open - although I would not recommend this in the middle of winter! Having stayed in other European hotels of varying quality, I was really impressed at how spotless and neat the rooms were kept. No complaints here, no stains or noxious smells. The TV carries CNN World and BBC by the way for english speaking travellers like myself. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a refined experience in an upscale but relaxed neighbourhood.

Then, somewhere around the first World War, it became Montparnasse, in the southern part of Paris, on the left bank for the first time. After the Second World war the place to be was still the Rive Gauche, but now the Saint Germain part (the 5th), a place which the main characters in the novels of Patrick Modiano are always glad to escape from, preferring the right bank. Well, since ten years or so they get what they want, because the new centre of things is now the Marais (4th), on the right bank again indeed. If in twenty years or so Montmartre becomes the place a la mode again, we are back were we started and history will have made full circle in two centuries. For the time being however Montmartre is still a sad thing, especially around Clichy and Sacre Coeur (but beware, some parts around the butte are still lovely). Montparnasse is quiet nowadays and bourgeois, but also heavily damaged by the terrible Tour. And Saint Germain has suffered tourism so much now, that it has become a bit vulgar, and dotted with cheap pizzeria's. Even the Caf\u00e9 de Cluny has become one. This somewhat overlong introduction is just to show that the Abbatial is in a great place. It is in the 5th, on Boulevard Saint Germain, but very close to the Seine, Ile Saint Louis, and the Marais (4th). A walk to the Rue Saint Antoine will take you fifteen minutes. Notre Dame will take you ten. The real Quartier Latin is around the corner. The Luxembourg gardens are twenty minutes away. You haver, so to speak, both centres of the city close at hand, the old and the new. Metro Maubert is a two minutes walk. A slight problem is that you will always have to change lines, because line nr. 10 will only take you to Auteuil and the Bois de Boulogne (or Austerlitz). If you want to go to Boulogne, take a bus. The hotel itself is a bit of a disappointment though. The room was small, but neat and well appointed. I had room 52 (top floor, in the sidestreet part, with a small balcony), for which I paid 100 euro, but which would normally cost 180 \u20ac. And that is a ridiculous price, reason for my neutral opinion. Breakfast will cost you ten extra. I didn\u2019t take it, because I prefer to take my breakfast elsewhere. The hotel does have some character and it is mentioned in the Guide de Charme, but not (and rightly so) in the Michelin.
