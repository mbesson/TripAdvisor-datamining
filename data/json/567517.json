{"Reviews": [{"Content": "good location...very noisy This hostel was okay. It's very centrally located and within walking distance to the train station, restaurants and other hot spots. The staff is very friendly and the room was quite large. The cleanliness was average -- the shower drain was plugged up so we found ourselves standing in water while showering. Our room was located on the main floor so we heard a lot of opening and closing of doors and voices throughout the night. It's a good place to hang and perhaps party with friends but not good if you want some peace and quiet.", "Date": "Jan 4, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR851635307", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "jlee77"}, {"Content": "Great B The Tourist House was just what we ordered. My husband and I stayed there recently and had a good time. Rooms were clean and neat. The ensuite bathroom was the largest we had seen in all of Europe and was also clean. Breakfast left a little to be desired, Fruit Punch isn't juice...hmm. But all in all, a good place to stay. They called a taxi for us the night before, to get to the airport, and it was on time at 5:30am. The front desk girls were great, good suggestions for dinner. Well done.", "Date": "May 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR354308714", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "hooperpig"}, {"Content": "good value       shower", "Date": "Aug 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR574034077", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Aussie_traveller46"}, {"Content": "Tourist house was fine Our stay was sufficient. It was a clean large room with breakfast included. Nothing fancy but adequate. It is not in the greatest location in Florence since the piazza area is quite run down. But it is a convenient walk to the train station if you plan on taking day trips from Florence and also a convenient location to get around florence. I would go back but don't expect anything fancy.", "Date": "Jun 19, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR737878637", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "fastturtle"}, {"Content": "Semplice l'ambiente, ma pulito...   showReview(11426289, 'full');", "Date": "May 10, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR317333932", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "RAPPORT QUALITE PRIX CONVENABLE...   showReview(11426290, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 29, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR983177184", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Chambre tr\u732bs spacieuse et...   showReview(12651505, 'full');", "Date": "May 3, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR534801747", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d567517-r23269000-Tourist_House-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "567517", "Price": "$91"}}
