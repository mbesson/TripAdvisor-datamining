We walked past several times looking for the hotel before we realized this. The worst part was the noise. People were running up and down the street yelling and screaming literally all night long. Complaining to the staff didn't do anything. In the morning I asked for a later check out because I wasn't able to fall asleep until five in the morning and they said no, saying to many people were checking out (?) but when we got to the lobby no one was there.

Since we're both very tall we requested a change. The second room was not the best, but better. After dropping our bags off we took the shuttle downtown for a bite to eat. Upon returning and getting ready for bed, I notice that the sheets had hair on them. Upon further examination there was also pubic hair on the sheets. I called the front desk to complain and the matter was immediately addressed, but the fact that I had to deal with this was horrible. Later that night the latch on the toilet broke. We had to open the top and pull the chain to flush it. We decided to wait till morning to report it because we already felt like we were trouble makers. We did so lst thing the next morning and it turned into a nightmare. The maintenance worker was late to work and when he did come he told the front desk it would be another hour. I was later told that he had to go and buy a part to fix it. To be fair we were offered another room (dingy and facing a brick wall) which we declined and offered an additional nights stay for free. Honestly, I wouldn't stay there again if it were free for a month. The place needs a major upgrade and little things like finger prints on the elevator walls made it feel dumpy and dirty. On top of that it's some kind of shelter/residence for families. I couldn't get the full story about this, but it was absoulutey the worst place I've stayed in my life.

It certainly isn't what you expect from a hotel, at least. We booked through Expedia and the front desk woman took quite a while to find our reservation. No big deal, though. We had to wait a bit for the room to be ready, but that was a little expected since we were there pretty early, around 11AM. We came for a conference at the convention center, but we waited too long to book a hotel and everything close to the convention center that was even moderately affordable, was booked. This hotel served our purposes, though. It was a little far from everything we wanted to do -- convention center, downtown, etc. We were thrilled that there was a free shuttle just a few blocks away that took us to North Station to catch the T. Unfortunately, the shuttle only ran from 9AM-6PM on weekends and so was basically useless to us on the weekend. It was about a $8 cab ride to the T station. I will say that the women at the front desk were very helpful. Anytime we asked about the best way to get somewhere, they would give us fantastic directions to get there quickly and cheaply. The employees aren't what you would expect from a hotel in that they weren't all about customer service. I kind of liked that fact though - gave an authentic Boston experience. The room - basic and clean. It's old and nothing special, but if you're just looking for a clean and quiet place to sleep, you'll be satisfied. There was a fridge, coffee maker, and microwave, which was nice. The beds were clean and comfortable. Some people complained about there not being enough blankets. We noticed there was no bedspread on the bed and thought that was weird, but found two nice, thick blankets in the closet. The major downside was that our door didn't shut very well. We noticed multiple times that we had inadvertently left the door open a crack. I think that's certainly a security issue that should be addressed. Also, the pictures on this site are not that great of a representation of the room. It was a little darker and dingier than the pictures, but I suppose that's kind of expected.

I had someone look again after having to deal with this problem for one week. Also, I had a problem shutting my window (because the mechanism was broken).

You can use the MTBA ferry, (1,70$, but be careful, they don't accept Charlie Card) but there is only one destination: Quincy Market. The Hotel is clean, but finishes are poor. Shower was clean, but there were water leak and mold on the wall (hidden by wallpaper), so bad point for the bathroom. A good point: the mattress (always check the mattress) was clean and comfortable.

My biggest compaint would be in regards to the elevators: they were extremely slow (I'm talking a 5 minute wait at times). There is an \"Express Elevator\" for those staying on the 5th and 6th floors, but this elevator stopped at every floor on the way up and down, for people on the second floor to go to the third, etc. That was a little annoying as you would expect the Express to be quicker in getting you to the top floor.

I had never heard of the Constitution Inn before, and its Charlestown Navy Yard location was something of a mystery to me. Here's what you need to know: The Constitution Inn is a YMCA hotel, with all the rights and responsibilities that come with that brand. It is situated in the Charlestown Navy Yard, in a renovated warehouse-type building -- though the renovation was a cheap one, apparently done in the 80s, with very little upkeep since. My room was on the sixth floor, \"in the eaves\", with a funky roofline and a skylight window overlooking a dilapidated warehouse and the Tobin Bridge (maybe 200 feet away; constant hum of truck traffic all night, though not so loud as to wake you up -- once you wake up, though, it's hard to get back to sleep). The room itself was in rough shape -- it was a cheap build-out years ago, with industrial carpet, rubber base molding, cheap vinyl tile in the bathroom, and water damage all around the tub. The furnishings were basic, cheap dorm fixtures. In fact, the overall feeling of the place was that of a worn-out dormitory room. There were some pluses: my room had a full kitchenette, with an apartment-sized fridge and four-burner stove. A budget road-warrior could live here reasonably comfortably and cheaply for a week or more, if she absolutely had to. Being a full YMCA, there is a fitness facility in the building and included in your room rate. Street parking was easy (though the meters start at 8am, and Boston is notorious for ticketing), and the hotel has an arrangement with a garage a block away for $6 parking (no in-and-out)... easy parking in Boston can't be underestimated as a virtue. That's good, you will need your car... there aren't any great pedestrian or public transportation options if you need to get into the city (Boston proper and Cambridge are both a few minutes away by car -- but then you're dealing with parking again... good luck). There did appear to be some restaurant and cafe options in the Navy Yard a few steps away, and of course, there is the whole Old Ironsides museum -- well worth a visit, especially with kids. The Constitution Inn's mission is \"affordable lodging in an historic location\", and it fulfills on that front -- I paid about $100 including taxes through Hotwire. The easy parking and kitchenette options might appeal to a limited set of road-warriors who are in Boston for an extended stay and need their cars during the day. Otherwise, though, the worn-out physical plant and somewhat out-of-the-way location make this hotel hard to recommend, even if price is a top consideration.", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat value, great stay!\u201d", "Author": "scoozi_q", "ReviewID": "UR103403907", "Content": "When we arrived in Boston, we had just come from New York.

The Navy Yard around it is like little town all on its own, stone brick streets and a lot of culture. There are some amazing places to eat right around there and a 24 hour store with people who are so willing to help it is amazing! You can walk to downtown (about a 15-20 minute walk) or there is a FREE shuttle that leaves from right outside the hotel to downtown every half hour from 5 am till 6 pm which is super nice!

After looking at numerous sites, we decided to give the Inn a try based upon price and location, since the USS Constitution was high on our list. The online listing showed a \"recently renovated\" hotel. This is a hotel in name only. You are staying at the YMCA, which shares the facility and the hotel is operated as a seperate entity. The place was freshly painted, but the old Y furnishings are still there. The room was a block walled dorm type room, very old, scarred furnishings replete with ancient cigarette burns on the nightstand, small bathroom, cheap mattresses, and so on. There was a small refrigerator microwave and coffeepot stacked up in one corner, you could use two of the three, we found that out after the coffeemaker wouldn't turn on, had to unplug the microwave to make coffee. The halls and room were both unbelievably hot, the outside temperature was in the upper 40's and low 50's. With the heat off and the windows open as far as they could (about 6\") there was no relief, although they do provide a lovely oscillating tabletop fan. We propped that in a window to draw cool air in so we could sleep. Old, fuzzy 19\" TV, although cable worked OK. Noisy place, as well, with the heat, noise, mattress and such, sleep was not easy for two exhaussted folks after a day of hiking around Boston. Torn skirting on the bed, institutional linens, old cheap carpets, 1950-60 era furnishings, this is not what comes to mind when one commands $125 and up for a hotel in off season, and not anywhere near the center of town. Location is great for the Navy Yard, and for Mass General visitors, and students, which composes a lot of the folks there. The Harbor Ferry leaves the Navy Yard, about a 10 minute walk, and drops you at Long Wharf in Boston for $1.70 a person, which is good for a day trip if you confine yourself to the center of town or plan to walk, take a tour bus, etc.. Parking at the Inn doesn't exist, there is metered parking on the street, but the Inn has an agreement with Mass Gen to use their lot at a discount, it is a 1/2 mile walk to the garage, for $6.00/24 hours make sure you get your ticket validated. There are one or two places to grab a snack nearby, no restaurants, diners or so on. There are few to no amenities, your key card allows you to use the shared pool and gym at the Y, nothing like a hotel facility, clean enough, but it is a public facility. The staff seems OK, upon checkout on Sunday morning my AARP rate wasn't applied, although I gave them the card when we arrived. There was no one on the desk that could make the computer authorize the price change, we ended up paying 'rack rate'. Overall, I fell that the online description of the Inn is greatly misleading. This is NOT anything on a par with what the average traveller thinks of as an Inn or Hotel, even on a Best Western/Days Inn level. We weren't expecting the Parker House, but this was a real disappointment. It is an old YMCA dorm, with some fresh paint sloshed on the walls, and a rudimentary set of amenities. I would bite the bullet and spend a little more to stay on the Boston side of the river, or search a little harder than we did and find something else.

I love the Navy Yard, the street is pretty quiet. The bakery around the corner was excellent. Note there is no food at the Inn- you need to go out for everything. But all rooms (well, at least ours, and we didn't ask for it) come with a 'fridge and microwave. The rooms are nothing fancy at all. Our room had concrete walls, and worn carpets. But it was a good size. Same with the bathroom - good size. The shower head leaked and wouldn't stay still (it would constantly try to spray outside the shower). That was a pain. The bed was comfortable. The cooling didn't work well at all - we stayed in March, and had to keep the windows open, as it was so hot in the room. The rooms are under powered. There were two plugs that we could find, and both plugs had 4 things in them each - so we had to unplug something to be able to plug in phone and computer chargers. Not good. Please add a power strip at the least! One reason we chose the Constitution Inn was the pool. While waiting for my wife to arrive, my daughter and I went for a swim. We got in around 3:30. at 4PM on the dot, the lifeguard said family swim was over, and we had to get out. not cool. I found out later that since we were staying in the hotel, we didn't have to get out - family swim was over for YMCA members, not hotel guests. But the lifeguard didn't offer that info. I suggest strongly to management that they give all guests a simple one-sheet when they check in, lettting them know pool rules - like you don't have to get out when the lifeguard says family swim is over! By the time we found out we could have stayed, it was way to late. Its tough to have your 3.5 year old daughter, who was so looking forward to a swim, say \"that swim was too short!\" Towels. You would think they were on the endangered species list. There were no towels at the pool, so we brought ours down from our room. We asked for replacements from the front desk, but the woman there looked at me like I was speaking Greek. Maybe I caught her at a bad moment. The elevator (just one for floors 4-6), was terribly slow. We waited 8-10 minutes one time, 2-3 minutes the other times. I would have taken the stairs, but I couldn't find them.

We were on a budget so we were shocked to see that many of the hotels in the Boston city area were insanely expensive. However, after much research, we discovered The Constitution Inn and, to our delight, at $170 USD per night it was right in our price range. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also located in nearby Charlestown. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let the stories about Charlestown being the city that produces the most crooks and car thieves scare you; the naval yard where the hotel is located is pretty pleasant and quiet. Before booking at The Constitution Inn, you must understand and accept the fact that this is a very no-frills hotel. There is no room service, no mini-bar, no pubs, no restaurant, no continental breakfast, no bell-hops and no bells and whistles whatsoever. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go on a honeymoon here. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use this place as a romantic get-away. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put the VIPs of your company in this place. It's not a hostel or anything but it's very simple so if you're a fussy traveler who likes to be pampered, this place isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for you. First of all, if you aren't used to driving on the crazy streets of Boston, you'll find this place a little hard to find. We circled the damn thing for ages before I finally parked across a sidewalk and ran in to ask where the hell the parking lot was. As it turns out, there is none. You have to park in a parking garage which is about a five minute walk away so if you have lots of luggage or are with people who can't walk far, you might want to drop them off first before you park. It's a paid garage but if you bring your ticket to the front desk, they stamp it and you get discounted or free parking. As well, the trek from the garage to the hotel is along some pretty dark back alley ways but since everything in the vicinity is pretty much deserted and/or boarded up, it's safe enough. It just looks scary. The old lady at the front desk is a bit crusty when you first speak to her but we were very polite and she warmed up considerably. She was also pretty helpful with directions and check in and out was quick and easy. The rooms were small but they were pretty good. The beds were clean and comfortable and bathroom, although a bit old-fashioned, was very clean. I'm picky as hell about these things and I was more than satisfied. The walls had a few scuffs and the carpets were a little dingy but on the whole, it was good. You also get free wireless internet, which was a big bonus for my sister and I. I read a few other reviews where people commented on the noise. First of all, ignore the ranters. Granted, the rooms aren't sound-proof booths so it was a bit noisy but it wasn't like sleeping on the runway of the airport or anything. We heard people in the halls but nothing from the surrounding rooms and even being light sleepers, we had no problems getting a good night sleep. As I said previously, there is no restaurant, continental breakfast or snack machines so you have to venture out to find sustenance. If you walk out the front door, across an empty lot and turn right, you will find a cute little deli. They have great breakfast, coffee, salads, sandwiches and the best pecan cheesecake I have ever had...although the owners have very thick accents and I thought he was offering me bacon cheesecake, which kinda grossed me out a bit. Since my sister and I don't like big, heavy greasy meals, this place was perfect for us. If you do like a little more \"meat and potatoes\" or you like snazzier digs, you are within a short walking distance of about half a dozen restaurants and pubs. Unfortunately, no nightlife within walking distance though. Boooo! The location of this place is amazing!! It is on an old navy base so you are a ten minute walk from the USS Constitution. We also did the Hop on/Hop off trolley tour and the first stop is the USS Constitution so it was nowhere to go to get on the trolley that would take you all over the city. So convenient!! We only had to take a cab twice and it was pretty cheap. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m definitely staying at this place when I go to Boston again. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great value compared to other hotels in the Boston area and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great location.

If $300 downtown hotels get you down, consider the YMCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Constitution Inn in the nearby Charlestown Navy Yards at about half that price. Rooms are simple but comfortable, with a microwave and refrigerator added to the usual hotel room amenities (coffee maker, iron, etc.) Couples should opt for two beds, since one double is a squeeze. There is no restaurant, but there is a small bakery under the arch diagonally across from the south lobby door. A Tedeschi mini-market with snacks and an extensive wine selection is one block west near the USS Constitution museum. The fitness center is free to Inn guests and is much, much larger than any hotel fitness center. It even includes a 25 meter indoor lap pool. Because there is only one entrance to the Navy Yards (at 5th Street and Chelsea Ave.), the Inn is free of traffic noise. I believe parking is free on the street over the week-end, but check details. Allow 20-30 minutes door-to-door to get to downtown. The BMTA ferry (Constitution wharf) and the BMTA #93 bus stop are each about 5-10 minutes walk from the Inn, and each takes about 15 minutes to downtown. Be aware that the outbound bus stops at Chelsea and 5th, but the inbound stops in front of the large brick church 100 yards northeast of there. Return #93 buses are easiest to catch at the Haymarket subway entrance in the north end. Bus and ferry service is quite limited on evenings and week-ends, so check the BMTA web site to make sure that their schedules fit yours before committing to this location (or use taxis to downtown for about $8 each way). A Logan airport taxi to the Inn should cost about $20 plus tip, but our taxi driver took us via the Ted Williams tunnel to increase his fare. Free airport shuttles outside baggage claim can take you to the blue line subway (shuttle #22) or to the Logan marina (shuttle #66) for the private (Rowe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Transport, $10 to the Constitution marina) water taxis. I recommend buying a BMTA Link pass (just $15 for 7 days of unlimited bus, public ferry, and subway rides at the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153T\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd machine in baggage claim (use your credit card).

Without a car or friends/relatives in the Boston are, we needed something affordable as we were traveling on a limited budget. If this interests you read on: The least expensive hostel I could find online in a good area charged $40/night/per person PLUS (taxes, surcharges, etc.) For a family of four, that came close to $200/night just for a youth hostel. Then, while searching online, we chanced upon the Constitution Inn. Before I tell you about the hotel itself, let me tell you some background info: 1. It is located in the Charlestown area near the historic Navy Yard, a place most visitors never see. It is safe, beautiful and quiet. You are blocks away from the USS Constitution Museum and the most famous ship in naval history. 2. There is a mini-supermarket (commissary) opened 18 hours a day around the corner. 3. There is a free shuttle bus a block away ready to shuttle you from the hotel across the bridge to North Station. 4. The hotel has a YMCA fitness facility in the lobby that is FREE to guests that includes a 25 yard multi-lane pool, a fully equipped gym and sauna. Those facilities really made my day, as my gym in NYC closed a year ago, so I really got some good workouts in early morning and late evening. About the hotel: If you're looking for a four to five star hotel and are willing to pay 300 - upwards of $500 per night, stay away. If you're looking for a comfortable, clean place, are budget conscious, and not snooty, this is a wonderful place for you !!! No one will dote on you or leave chocolates on your pillow. But if you need anything the staff will surely assist you. (We asked for an extra cot at 10 at night and got it five minutes later.) Our room was large and comfortable with two double beds and had a small fridge and microwave. That helped us save money on breakfasts and night snacks. And since the hotel is officially a non-Profit organization, there is no tax added on, which can easily save an additional $100 on a four night stay. Veterans and family members are given special discounts, though no one in our group was a vet. You don't have to be a vet to qualify for a discount. AARP and AAA members also receive discounts. All in all, a very nice place that gives you the most bang for your buck. We enjoyed strolling out at night along the bay and piers If you prefer not to use the free shuttle bus that is intended mainly for staff and patients at Mass General Hospital, but open to everyone free of charge, there is a most scenic and sublime ferry ride ($1.70) from Pier 3 (a few blocks from the hotel) to the Long Wharf area near the Boston Aquarium.

The hotel is part of the YMCA. I am not a picky traveler, but I was surprised how poor the accommodations are. To me, $170 is not cheap. I can handle a hotel with some age to it, but I expect my room to be clean and safe. Unfortunately, neither of those things applied here. The ladies at the check-in were friendly enough, but the lobby was a bit shabby. The hotel is a bit out of the way, and the shuttle was not running because of the holiday. It was only about $7 to get to North Station by taxi, so that was not too bad. Our room was on the 5th floor, and the room had not been thoroughly cleaned. I am not convinced that the bedding was changed. If so, they need to buy sheets that fit and learn how to properly make a bed. There was trash left in the nightstand drawer. The bathroom was pretty shabby. There was not any shampoo and only one bar of soap. The bathroom shower did not drain properly. The towels reeked of bleach. The air conditioning did not work properly but there was a fan on the table. We left for the fireworks, and because I heard another guest ask if someone had been in their room, I decided not to leave any valuables. When I returned, I did think someone had been in my duffel bag because they items were not as I had left them. That is a bit disconcerting. My biggest concern, however, occurred about 5:00 in the morning when the headboard fell off the bed and hit me in the head. Thank God, I do not sleep all the way at the end of the bed or else I really could have been seriously injured. I ended up with a nasty bump and quite a scare. The headboard was quite heavy and was basically just sitting on nails. The original screws had been stripped and someone had just put the headboard back on with nails. This was not sufficient for the weight of the board. My fear is that someone could get seriously injured with this. When I checked out, I mentioned this to the lady at the desk who replied, \"Oh, yeah, we've had trouble with this and they've tried to fix it.\" Huh?

Since my hubby is in the military, we got to stay here for $99 a night. Had we paid full price, I would have been much more upset, but for the cost, and the time we were actually in the room, it wasn't bad. That being said, the hotel is in a pretty deserted neighborhood. I would not have wanted to be walking around at night down here. It's in a former military dominated area, and there are/were a lot of warehouses, offices, etc. and not a lot of places open after hours. It's pretty empty in the evening, and I didn't really feel safe outside. The room was pretty basic. One wall was painted cinderblock. The beds were okay comfortable, but the spreads had had a few too many washings, and were old and faded. The carpet looked vacuumed, but I wondered when it was cleaned last and just had to put the thought out of my head when I walked on it. The room was pretty much clean, but it was just tired. We had two full-sized beds, a big closet, three drawers in the bottom of the tv wardrobe, and a table and two chairs. There was also a fridge and microwave. One poster mentioned the thin walls. I will second that! Thankfully, my three kids (12, 9, and 6) were asleep when the folks next door started getting busy. I could hear the bed squeaking for quite awhile before it was quiet. I thought about banging on the wall, but figured that would just postpone the inevitable. There were also some very noisy folks across the hall who had two rooms. Unfortunately, the rooms didn't connect, and they kept visiting back and forth until after midnight. The doors in the hotel close very loudly, and they'd shut their doors and then bang on their friend's door. I finally called the front desk before they got quiet. The hotel has a lot of young military people staying there who are on temporary duty at the Charlestown Navy Yard. Many of them are still in \"party\" mode, and having been young and military, I tried to give them a break. But they were loud. There is a YMCA that you can use when you stay here. The kids were excited to go swimming the first night of our stay. The guy in charge of the pool was, shall we say, \"strict\" about his pool. At 7 p.m. the pool still had lane lines up, and he allowed the kids to swim in about 1/3 of one lane line and got on them if they went past the chair. At about 8, he got out his CD player, and stretched the electric cord across the walkway (safety???), and put in a Roger Whittaker CD and turned it up so loudly, we had to shout to communicate. Then he played Broadway show tunes and Johnny Cash CDs. I got the feeling he was trying to get us out of the pool and was playing whatever he could to make us leave. We gave in about 8:30 and didn't go back for the rest of our stay. One of the good things about this place was that it was really close to the water taxi. It picked us up at the Charlestown Wharf and dropped us off at Long Wharf. It was a short ride, and only cost about $1.70 each way. There was also a free shuttle a couple of blocks away that took us to North Station so we could take the T wherever else we wanted to go. I will say that the front desk people weren't very friendly or helpful. I asked for help on how to get from the hotel to Lexington, and they gave me a map. I asked for more details, and they said I would have to go online because they couldn't help me. I would think that would be something a front desk person at a hotel would just know. Surely I'm not the first person to ask how to use the public transportation in Boston. Parking was another bonus. We got to park in the nearby garage for $6 a day. We could have parked on the street for free but were warned about possible vandalism to our cars overnight. Again, it was pretty deserted where I parked, so I was uncomfortable walking the three blocks back to the hotel, but I am here to write about it, so it worked out okay. I'd take a friend next time, though. All in all, we weren't in the room so much that it was a huge problem for what we paid. Would I stay here again? Probably not, but who knows?

A hotel in a navy yard might conjure up visions of noise, dirt, welding torches, riveters, etc...relax ..that's history. What I found were well preserved brick historic navy buildings and warehouses and such that are being transformed into condos and business offices. The neighborhood is quiet (very quiet compared to staying in downtown Boston)with light traffic. The front of the hotel is on a pedestrian street. With the waterfront closeby there are shoreline jogging trails and parks amid high rise condos and townhouses and marinas in a pleasant and safe upscale neighborhood of Charlestown. I confess that my impressions of this hotel are of a favorable bent because I am a history buff and because of this and the hotels location (the USS Constitution is moored just down the street) I probably overlooked one or two things that might raise one of those proverbial red flags to guests expecting more. This is a navy hotel and has a nautical feel to it with foot square brass plates with black engraved room numbers that looked like they were salvaged from the fleet. The staff was friendly and helpful. The lobby is small and unassuming. Next door is a YMCA. Guests get free access to the pool and excersize equipment. No restaurant. However there are a couple of eateries like the Tavern On The Water a stones throw away. .It was here I enjoyed a bowl of \"chowdah\", and a pint of Sam Adams while watching Old Ironsides fire a 21 gun salute on her annual Boston harbor cruise on the 4th. On the nation's birthday for a history guy like me it doesn't get much better. There is a bistro nearby, a Finegal A Bagel, and Store 24 (like a 7-11) and a B of A . A bit farther away (a 15 minute walk to the Bunker Hill Monument and the nearby Warren Tavern frequented by Paul Revere.) There is a 10 minute water shuttle...from the navy yard to downtown Boston a short walk from the hotel for a $1.85 each way. Next to the hotel is a Mass General Hospital with free bus transportation that runs hourly shuttles to and from the downtown Mass Gen Hospital ..stopping on its way at the North Subway station. Did I say it was a free shuttle? Oh yeah..baby.Not necessary to be brandishing a stethescope around your neck to ride...anyone can climb aboard. . One heck of a deal. Even if it didn't have wifi in the room, or what you'd call state of the art bathroom sinks....the bed was very comfortable, the air conditining, microwave, fridge, shower, head all worked...it was clean and comfortable...and unlike the cookie cutter lodging chains the place had a certain personality and character to it.

The room cost $139 per night sleeping the 4 of us in 2 queen beds which I have to say were not the most comfortable. Our only other problem was regulating the temperature in the room which has some kind of thermostat which made no difference when we turned it to cool. Leaving us no option but to leave the windows open. Fine in a very chilly April but not much use in summer nor very kind to the environment! However having said all that I would still recommend this place. It is very close to the USS Constitution as the hotel name suggests and the area is very quiet most of the time wih very little traffic noise (ask for a room on the Harour side of the hotel). Our room had a fridge and microwave and coffee maker wih free tea and coffee. Also iron and ironing board plus hairdryer in the bathroom. There is a nice local cafe (American Bakers Cafe) just down the street (through the archway) great for breakfast bagels etc also Finnagle A Bagel in the street across from that. Also a small Stop & Shop in the next block on the way to the USS Costitution for groceries etc. Travel to the city couldn't be easier or cheaper. There is a free bus which picks up in the next street ( ask at reception) goes every 15 minutes and takes you to at least North station maybe further. It is meant for staff and patients of the hospital but everyone uses it and the driver asks no questions . Just hop on. The other option is a wonderful 10 min boat ride (part of the \"T\" system) from Charlestown Navy Yard (approx 5min walk) to Long Wharf. Dropping you right by the New England Aquarium. Cost $1.70 each way . Kids free. Runs approx every half hour, more a peak times, less at weekends. Check timetable posted in shelter or pick up timetable once on board. These boat trips were one of the highlights of our trip. A wonderful way to approach the city each morning. We had 3 nights at this hotel at the beginning of our trip and the staff although initially seemed a liitle disinterested, were all very pleasant and helpful if you make the effort to engage them in conversation and kept our cases in the back room while we collected a car for the next part of our trip to Cape Cod.

If you are taking a cab from the airport to the Consttution Inn be sure that your driver knows exactly where he is going (the Constituton Inn is kind of off the radar a little) - our driver didn't actually know where the Constitution Inn was and so we ended up getting a little lost but got there in the end after the driver called the Inn to get directions. The room we stayed in was nice, large and clean. It had an ensuite bathroom. The bathroom was nice and clean. The room faced onto one of the back streets in the Navy yard area and was very quiet. As the Inn is actually positioned inside the navy yard it is well away from the centre of the City. In fact, you need to take the ferry in order to get into the centre of the City. We loved taking the ferry every day. It is a beautiful 10 minute ferry trip. We had to call for toilet paper once because housekeeping didn't provide new toilet paper rolls but they brought up 2 rolls of extra toilet paper for us when we called so no big problem in the end :) The facilities at the Inn are great and include a laundry and a gym. There is also a 24 hour convenience store on the corner. We purchased a box of cerial, some plastic bowls and some milk and ate this for breakfast (there was a kitchen in our room with fridge and a small amount of cutlery). The other option for breakfast is the bagel place just 5 minutes walk away in the navy yard (Fenagle A Bagel ??). There is also a cafe in the navy yard too. Someone posted about the internet not being available - when we stayed here in July 2007 the internet was readily available in the lobby area and we had no problems with that. Despite the Constitution Inn being military accommodation, we did not see many military personnel - mainly wives and children of miltary personnel.

The bathroom might be a problem for some. The sink was just that, a small pedestal sink with no counter space. There were shelves above the toilet that we put our toiletries on, so it wasn't a big deal to us. Also, the only mirror is the one over the sink.
