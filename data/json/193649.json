We wanted to stay in Paddington, so we came across hundreds of hotels and this one popped up and looked to be very good in the photos. The price was about 40 Australian dollars more than want we anticipated paying but we thought what the hell it is only for 3 nights and yeah the hotel looks great in the photos. The reception was run by a pair of Indians who tried very hard but I just don't think they had a lot of experience in hospitality. We arrived a bit early and they allowed us to put the bags in the storage room which was great and we headed off for a walk and to exchange some money. The first impression was quite O.K it was neat and tidy and had plenty of brochures on the tourist activities. We checked in at 3pm, they gave us the key and headed up the stairs to room 25. The stairs are narrow and very steep not recommended to anyone a bit older than us as they are dangerous. We unlocked our door to find an extremely small room, clearly an old cupboard they decided to place a double bed in and install a toilet and shower. Seriously it was so small and literally it was only suited to 1 person. We had to work as a team if one of us wanted to go to the bathroom as one had to be at the end of the bed to allow enough room to get past. The room at only a bed cupboard chair and bathroom. Everything was so small. The bathroom is very outdated and needs a revamp. The toilet is tiny and paint is peeling off around the seat, there was also several large cracks on the roof and you were unable to open any windows to get fresh air. The only air circulating option is a tiny fan that was noisier than the buses and cars that were driving past. The staff were atrocious we asked to book a day trip to Stone Henge as we were very keen to check it out. On the brochure it says to book through your hotel reception. Our main man in the reception had no idea and eventually called us and said the early tour is full and the afternoon tour is not operating which is not true. We gave up. Also on checkout the receptionist checked us out and said have a good day. I said how about my deposit, and he said oh ok and asked for the receipt. I thought this was poor, as he was clearly trying to get me out of there so he could keep the deposit. Do not recommend this hotel as it is terrible. The breakfast is poor, we found mouldy bread in the bread bin and there was no water so we were stuck to drink very sweat orange juice. Simply we will not recommend this hotel to family or friends and honestly would not allow our little dog to stay there.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rockaway Park, New York", "Title": "\u201cneeds very much updating\u201d", "Author": "bevyweby", "ReviewID": "UR118503705", "Content": "although reviews were bad for this hotel i figured how bad could it be..well let me tell you....the room was in the basement down appx 13 stairs (the lift was broken)..so i hobbled down there fore had to leave suitcase in main lobby... room was old and dirty...needed cleaning...although towels were clean and there was soap and tea/coffee available. reviews had said springs came out of matresses and they were right....springs were popping out hotel needs a full makeover", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDisgraceful!

Unable to find floorspace once our small bags were in the room, we sought refuge on the very small, terribly uncomfortable and dirty trundle bed. Nothing in this room looks to have ever been washed or repaired, the curtains are broken, allowing neighbors to look straight in, the drains in the shower/ basin are blocked and we would be better off sleeping on the floor than the threadbare mattress, through which every spring protrudes. We found the general attitude of the staff unhelpful, after mentioning our mattress issue we were told to ask the morning after (our sleepless night). In the morning we were given the key to another \"better\" room, which hadn't been serviced, to discover the same problems. The location of this hotel is definitely NOT an excuse for the rates being this high. ANY hotel/ hostel/ under bridge accommodation will be vastly superior.

Admittedly the hotel was quite old, but it was clean, towels were changed and beds made every day and the bathroom was small but clean. Our room consisted of a double bed and a camp bed, which my friend said was comfier than her own bed at home. The 2 major problems were the heat, as the room did get hot at night and although a fan was provided it was still stifling, and the fact that the lift was broken, and we were on the top (5th) floor.

This was by FAR the most DISGUSTING and terrible hotel I have ever stayed in. The location of it, sure it was nice, close to Paddington, but not worth it! The first room we were put in was the size of a infant's shoebox. All the room was able to fit in it was a rickety old double bed (yes, rickety, it creaked and swayed when you sat on it). The Big Screen tv in the room was about 9-10 inches I'd say, and the hotel didn't provide binoculars so you couldn't watch it from the bed. It also only received about 6 channels, three or four of which played the same program. The bathroom was about the size of a nice sized port o'potty. Oh and the smell of the joint, the hotel as a whole that is, honest to god, my friend threw up upon entering the lobby. No joke, not exaggerating, she vomited outside the front steps. She was feeling a bit queasy that day due to the traveling, but she managed to keep it down for an hour and a half bus ride, then another 25 minute walk. Upon encountering that alluring aroma, all hell broke loose. The hotel staff, yet another treat. We were hassled about having another girl come upstairs with us to our room. He kept calling the room telling us we weren't allowed to have visitors stay past 11!! That was beyond strange. Anyway, in order for her to stay with us we had to pay another 30 pounds!! We got ripped off, majorly. At least we got to be put in a different room, this time a triple, with a surprisingly more modern bathroom. But in this room the beds were just as bad, very uncomfortable with coils sticking out. After sleeping in them I think we all should have gone and got tetnis shots. The room was also conveniently located next to the Indian restaurant attached and wait for it, the laundry/utility room, so we were awakened by the angelic sounds of banging, clanking and pounding. I don't know how well they clean the rooms because in the drawers of the one and only nightstand was garbage from a previous guest which included crumpled papers, napkins, receipts, brochures and other miscellaneous papers. But to top it off, my favorite part of the hotel, in the top drawer there lay a single dirty miniature metal spoon (very cute) and a used pair of broken airline headphones (finders keepers). I understand people just want a cheap place to sleep and shower, but please go elsewhere, establishments like these should be forced to raise their standards of accommodations for travelers such as ourselves. There are places just as cheap, or possibly a few bucks more that you don't have to get deloused after staying there.

It cost me 69 pounds at the time or roughly $150 AUD - I am aware that London is very expensive and was happy to pay that for what i thought would be basic but liveable however boy was i wrong!!! Please read below for my account: - On check in we were greated with an empty desk for almost 10 minutes - Once given our room we found it was down a staircase resembling a verticle drop and not wide enough to fit my back pack. You can imagine how dangerous this was and the difficulty to manage after a 20 hour flight let alone assisting my girlfriend with her luggage. - Once finally getting into our room I was pleased to find our room was situated under the staircase I had just gone flying down and next door to a public toilet for guests. - The room resembled a jail cell. Not wide enough to open luggage, a TV that could be watched with a magnifying glass, a bathroom that i had to suck in my stomach to fit into and a window that looked directly out to a beautiful brick wall. - The bed was the best part of this room - the mattress was designed in a semi circle. It was to short so my legs dangled, the pillow was as thick as an A4 piece of paper and through out the night my Girlfriend and I rolled into eachother in the middle of the bed as the semi circle/slant of the mattress took affect. One positive of this hotel was the breakfast. After waking to the magnificant view of the brick wall and the stench of urin from next door not to mention people crashing down the stairs above us. Breakfast provided a haven. Bread that couldnt be toasted because the toaster had no power. Cheese that was harder then the brick wall i woke up looking at and some spreads (actually make that a spread - jam) By half way through our stay we went out for breakfast - we couldnt bare to be in that hotel for a second longer. Finally as our flight out of London was at 4am i arrose at around 2 to go to reception to ask the man behind the desk if he could check for delays on my flight. He said he could not (but I saw him using internet on facebook and looking up websites). His reasoning was that guests could not use the internet so i then had to call the airline and sit on my mobile phone for 10 minutes. I give this hotel a -10/10.

I stated that I did not have that much on me and was unaware that I would be needing to pay in cash as no call was made before our arrival. Either way I went to get the cash - was then told that I wouldn't get a reciept until the room was freed from the last occupant (we were dropping off our bags prior to check in to explore the city). I then told the staff member if I was not receiving a receipt he could give me my money back, which at first he was unwilling to do. Eventually he gave me back the cash (which I now had to carry around London until we could fully check into the room). The room was cold as all we had was a personal heater. The second time we stayed there before returning to the States was the worst display of customer service I have ever seen. Their credit card machine was fixed by then (two weeks later). We get up to the room and it's Freezing! As we were leaving for a play we infomed the staff and were told that the heat was broken (something I feel guests should be informed of when they check in) and they would send up a space heater while we were out. We returned back and no space heater was there.

The staff member then brought him Sheets! Sheets! Like they would rectify the problem of a freezing cold room. We used our coats that night to stay warm. The next morning we woke up to take showers - no hot water. We went downstairs and were told not only was there no heat, but there was no hot water either (once again something I felt we should have been told). Apparently they left the hot water for the top floor rooms and were giving guests keys to those rooms to take their showers.

We live in Switzerland and were invited to a wedding in London. We decided to spend a few days in Paris and take the Eurostar to London. We booked the hotel via Eurostar too as the package deal sounded good. The only good thing about this hotel is the location. I understand that some people may have had pleasant experiences - yes the breakfast is a decent continental breakfast. However... upon entering the hotel one is greeted by the smell of old carpets. The elevator is broken (they claim it is being repaired) and bounces up and down when it comes to a halt. In our room, the curtains had two holes in them and the floor was cracked. The sink was clogged - we resolved this by removing hair from inside. Finally, after a long trip there was no cold water in the shower! The water was boiling hot. We did our best to wash in the sink and then wanted to go sightseeing. When we informed the recptionist, he said it was normal - in this hotel one has to let the water run for a bit. I explained we had let it run for more than a bit. He promised to look into the matter. Upon our return late at night we were informed that the problem had been resolved. But when we turned the shower on, after one second we had boiling hot water again. Too tired we fell asleep and tried again in the morning. No luck. We went back to the receptionitsts who explained the only thing we could do was change rooms. However, the new room was not yet made - we were advised to return later. I explained we had a wedding to go to. No problem - we were told to move our things and take the shower in the unmade room. It was pretty unmade - the bin filled up with dirty things, the bed unmade, and piles of dirty towels on the floor for us to climb over. At least, after waiting for a few seconds, hot water arrived. We also had not clean towels. But I got hold of the housekeeper. We asked for some sort of refund, but since we booked through Eurostar and prepaid could get nothing, and have written a letter to Eurostar. The next day I discovered I had left my pyjamas in the first room. The receptionists finally traced them downstairs, proudly informing me they had been saved from the garbage bin! We've travelled a lot - even staying in a great one star bungalow in the South of France, but the bottom line is things should work. I nearly scalded my skull trying to wash my hair in the hot water before the wedding. The contrast between our stay and the wedding we finally got to was incredible. This hotel has potential.

This hotel is by far the worst I have ever stayed at. When my wife and I arrived we where offered a room so small that there was no room for opening the suitcase. Aside from this the room had the following defects: The room was very noisy due to the elevator located next to the room. The bed was worn out and squeaked every time it was touched. Fungus and water damage had gotten the better of the shower and the bathroom was so small that it was impossible to sit straight on the toilet as it almost touched the sink. Finally the television and shawing light in the bathroom was out of order. Housekeeping did apparently only tidy the bed on Prince William Hotel, as dust and dirt was all over the room. After seeing the room we decided to complaint about this to the hotel. The clerk in the reception did not see the problem and told us that this was the standard of the hotel. In fact he did not give a damn, but after some arguing he was persuaded into giving us a new room the following day (he argued that there was no spare rooms). So the next day (after spending a night in the noisy cabinet of a room we was complaining about) we got a new room. Even though this room was bigger than the first one it was in fact even worse. All the furniture was worn down, and the window to the street was broken, allowing smoke and noise to enter the room from the street. The bed was as bad as in the first room, and the room itself was just as dirty. The ventilation in the bathroom was out of order and the water in the shower and sink was boiling. The solution to this problem was according to hotel staff that we used the bathroom in some of the other rooms already occupied by guests of the hotel. Complaining over this to the hotel clerk resulted in him insulting us and claiming that this was the case for all the rooms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Even though he knew that we knew he was lying. Yet again after arguing with him and insisting to talk to the manager we got a new room. The new room was still not clean \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Some dirty towels where left by housekeeping and there was piss stains on the toilet and floor of the bathroom. Behind the worn-down furniture there was dirt and dust, along with some garbage the housekeeper apparently had missed. Apart from this we had the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpleasure\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of experiencing one power outage and two false fire alarms while staying on Prince William Hotel.

I asked to see the manager; and explained my situation, I had been travelling all day from Scotland and I was desperate for a bed. The manager agreed to put me up in a staff room (not en-suite) only with a hand wash basin. I accepted and ignored the inconvenience of a tiny room with single bed and used bedding. I slept on top of the bed, so as to avoid contamination from soiled sheets. Around 0330 in the morning I was awoken by someone who had entered the room with a key and was standing by the bed. I was shocked as he/she turned on the light. It was a transexual, friend of the staff personel's room I was staying in. He/she asked where was Lars? I said I did not know, and I was sleeping here tonight. He/she left, and I had trouble getting back to sleep, so I barricaded the door with my baggage.

I asked if I could take breakfast before I left, she shrugged and pointed to a staircase leading down into a basement, self service kitchen. The breakfast on offer was disgusting.

Coffee whitener only available and surly breakfast staff who spoke little English.

I was stunned.

The first night was ok, the bed bugs appear that night however... I woke up at about 2ish in the second night and was thought i had woken up in some nightmare there were about 8 bugs crawling about over the bed. to make matters worse, because it was such a hot night and the fan was crap, we slept in little clothing revealing me tempting flesh for the bed bugs to bite. the bed bugs were pretty big althought they did vary in size. they were beetle- type looking, small black heads with a massive sack on their backs full of blood. i still feel sick just describing them. when you hit them all the blood squirts out - it was really awful. We complained but the didnt care about our problems. We still had another 3 nights left. it was pretty much the same 3rd 4th and 5th night. i tucked the quilt into the mattress thinking they were living in the mattress. however i was mistaken becuase on our last morning when we were packing i pulled the bed away from the wall to check incase anything had fallen down there. i was greeted by between 20-30 bugs all gathered in a group on the skirting board. The majority of them had backs full of blood. the bugs are very distinctive looking and impossible to miss. Some of them were bigger then 5p pieces absolutely sickening. i was screaming and jumping around at the site of them - they make my skin crawl. Dont go to this hotel, it was terrible we only had our room cleaned and bed linen changed on the 2nd day aswell as the room being infested by bugs. Afew bed bugs were also spotted in my friends room, room 44.

Went to complain at the front desk and the first thing he said was \" Are you checking out then?\" I said no, I would like to know what they planned on doing to take care of the problem. They offered to change rooms. New room was a little bigger and did not seem to have any bugs. No shower curtian, water pressure was low. I recommend taking shower in evening as trying to take a shower in the am, you will take a cold shower. Toilet seat was broken. We had to hold onto the wall to keep the seat from pinching our buttocks. Told staff and nothing was done about it while we were there. ( We were there a total of 9 days) No washcloths, but new towels everyday. Mattresses have seen better days and they had flat, hard pillows. Rooms were hot, and the small fan they provided, the cord would not reach the window, so we could pull cool air into the room. Remote control only turned the tv on. would not change the channels. Walls were very thin and we heard the neighbors tv and conversations every day. It would be helpful only if you were in trouble and needed help Breakfast consisted of toast, cereal,tea, juice and coffee. Staff was friendly, but I definately would not return. The bed bugs certianly did it for me. The hotel was close to many tourist sites and pubs with good food.

We were slightly concerned when we arrived and saw an old upturned toilet pan, old beds and other rubbish piled up outside! The reception area was tatty with missing carpet on the stairs. There was a sign appologising for the mess due to 'refurbishment' but we suspect this may have been there for some time! We'd booked a double room but were given a room with 3 single beds cramed in so tight that we could not open the wardrobe doors! We had to literally climb over the beds. The whole hotel was very tatty. Breakfast was a complete joke - no coffee cups, a sad looking stack of cheese slices a pile of white bread and a long queue of people waiting for a slow toaster. The breakfast room was obviously a curry house at night. We walked out and sought breakfast elsewhere.
