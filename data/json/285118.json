This hotel was easy to get to by taking the water bus (vaporetto) #1 from the train station to the Arsenale stop. The #1 stops at just about EVERY stop along the Canal, so if you want a shorter route to get you there a little quicker, just find any other water bus that stops at Arsenale. The signs are very easy to read. After getting off the Arsenale stop, go right. You're going to go over 2 bridges. The first one had stairs (so I hope you packed light) and the second bridge had a ramp. Turn left after the second bridge onto Via Garibaldi. Another TripAdvisor had it exactly right...go about 200 yards just before you hit the white building, which is a church. You might ask youself, \"Where? What white building? Would you consider that building white?\" Don't worry, keep walkig you'll see it. JUST before the building, turn left. You'll be walking just alongside the church. The you will see signs for the hotel. You'll make another left and then see the entrance to the hotel. LIKES: (1)Staff. Namely just the front desk person who is really the only person you see besides the people that help serve breakfast in the morning. (2) Internet use. It's a small hotel, so be nice, flash a smile, and ask if you can use the one at the front desk. (3) Another boutique hotel that is literally in the middle of a neighborhood. You can witness real Venetian life being here and it it is definitely not far from the 'sites' since Venice is so small. DISLIKES: (1) The shower. Just when we thought the shower couldn't get any smaller than one the in Rome, WRONG! But again, after an exhausting day of sight seeing and shopping - you're still glad you get to take a shower! (2). No elevator. No kidding. So pack light! Which you should have done anyway when going to Europe. GETTING AROUND: Walking is a good way to explore Venice since it is so small. But, the water busses (vaporetti) are easy to use. We bought the 3-day pass for each of us. But like the other cities, no one every checked. So you can take a gamble and hop on a water bus to go where you want without paying, but risk getting fined if caught. GETTING TO THE AIRPORT TO GO HOME FROM VENICE: If you're like us and will be flying out from Venice back home (to the U.S.). Take the #42 water bus (from Arsenale) to the last stop, Piazzale Roma. This will take less than 30 minutes. As soon as you get off this station you can just follow the crowd towards the bus station. Buy a bus ticket from the ticket booth. It will be the #5 bus, which can be caught at the A1 platform. This will take about another 30 minutes to get to the airport. **Good thing we bought our bus tickets (2.50 Euro each) here because there were 2 \"officials\" that hopped on from one of the bus stops along the way to the airport and checked every passenger for a valid ticket. However, the bus police person gave us trouble saying that we don't have the right ticket or something rather. She questioned how much we paid for them, where we bought them, for our receipt (which we could not find). Eventually, she let us go and just telling us that next time we need to keep our receipt.

We travelled to Venice from Treviso, the easiest and cheapest way to get there is to take the connecting ATVO Eurobus service. Bus times coincide with Ryanair arrivals and departures, and the fare is much cheaper than a taxi, only \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 one-way or \u00e2\u201a\u00ac9 return. Purchase your ticket at the ATVO counter in the airport and stamp it in the ticket-validation machine on the bus. (If you need a ticket from Venice to Treviso Airport, go to the ATVO ticket office in the Piazzale de Roma). Remember to ask for a bus timetable before leaving the airport so that you can plan your return journey, although usually they have somebody handing them out near the exits. You'll need to allow about one hour for the bus trip, the end of the line is the Piazzale de Roma, where you can catch a vaporetto (water bus) to your hotel. When you get off the bus head towards the main entrance and keep left, do not cross any bridges, just keep left until you reach the Vaporetto stops, all within a few yards of each other. A single fare is valid for 60 minutes (which is plenty of time to get to the hotel) and costs \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6 per person, however you can get a 24 or 72 hour ticket which cost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac16 and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30 respectively. You can take the number 41/42/51 or 52 Vaporetto down to Arsenale, but I would recommend the number 1 Vaporetto, it travels through the grand canal and in my opinion gives the best initial impression and views of Venice, it also seemed more readily available. As mentioned take No. 1 Vaporetto down to Arsenale, from here, we walked over two bridges and turned left onto Via Garibaldi. After about 200 yards look for a big white building on your left, which is a little church called San Francesco di Paola, turn left here, (before not after the Church) then left again and you are at the Corte Contarina front door. If you reach the canal you have gone too far, although when you turn around you will then see the sign which is only viewable from one direction, which is only when you have gone too far as we did. Because of the walking, a suitcase with wheels is a MUST. First impressions of the hotel were good, we were made to feel very welcome, we arrived early, about 12.30pm but only had to wait half an hour for our room to be made up, during which time we signed in, left our bags and were told to grab a drink at one of many of the nearby cafe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. When we returned the Manager, Maury welcomed us and helped carry our bags up to our room which was on the first floor, 203. The steps are quite steep, as they all are in Venice, although the hotel does have a stair lift for any guests who may require it. The room was compact, and the bathroom even more so. I remember a previous reviewer saying they called the shower a coffin, which was probably being generous. The hotel is classed as a three star which is generous and has probably been rewarded for the excellent customer service than the amenities of the hotel!!! Breakfast is standard fare although regardless of whether you get up early or late the staff will always ensure that you come away well fed, we tried to get away with just a cup of coffee but was stopped and given a tray of croissants, buns, spreads and biscuits to take away with us. The hotel is situated about 5/10 minutes walk from San Marco which lets you get into the midst of things quickly, but at the end of a busy day lets you relax in calmer (and cheaper) surroundings, it also gives you a little insight in to the real Venice. As a person who is always warm even I found the room cold, and pillows and blankets must be at a premium in Venice. We requested extra pillows and blankets but returned to find we had been given only one extra pillow between us, I returned to reception to be told by the porter that they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have anything else to give me, and only when I complained further did another pillow and blanket suddenly appear. We stayed during the Carnival by complete chance as I only booked the flights as they were so cheap, but I am so glad that we did. The atmosphere in San Marco square was fantastic and there was lots to do around the various districts. Venice is expensive, \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8 for a large beer, (40cl, less than a pint!) so I would advise people to ask for a menu before sitting down as some places are more expensive than others, although keep an eye out for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153happy hours\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We can highly recommend the Jazz Bar for both cocktails and food. We enjoyed our time at the hotel, it was clean and reasonably comfortable, and although it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t my first choice, (I was limited due to the Carnival) I would recommend it, although feel that it belongs firmly in the budget hotel sector.", "Date": "February 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Sussex", "Title": "\u201cMmmm\u201d", "Author": "amfra", "ReviewID": "UR12873904", "Content": "Was told initially 5* by booking company - it most certainly is not.

It was clean and the maid was friendly. The location was pretty far from the center of Venice's main attraction, St. Mark's. We weren't prepared to haul our suitcases about a mile from the Vaporetto #82 stop in the 90 degree heat, or for the fact that the sign on the main street for the hotel (you have to go down an alley way to get to the back, where the entrance is) was about the size of a post-it note and we missed it, walking by it twice.

We boarded, and when they came by to take the tickets, we were slapped with a 36Euro fine each for not having a ticket, and were \"made an example of\" by the boat police. YOU CANNOT BUY A TICKET ON THE BOAT!!! Don't make the same foolish mistake we did. In hindsight, we should have taken a water taxi instead.", "Date": "June 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Apartment, Great Neighborhood\u201d", "Author": "Mikenap15", "ReviewID": "UR7805255", "Content": "We stayed here end of May for a couple of days.

The hotel was easy to locate from the waterbus stop, and the staff were very friendly and helpful. We were on the second floor which was quite a climb after a day's walking. Do not go here if you are at all challenged with agility, unless you can guarantee a room on the first floor, which is serviced by a chairlift. Our room was very traditionally furnished, with 3 windows (no views though) and a beautiful beamed ceiling. The shower room was very small but totally adequate. There was a fridge in the room which was useful for keeping our own drinks cool (minibar prices were fairly standard). We were woken each morning by the smell of sweet bread baking - and of course this led us quickly down to the beautiful breakfast room for an adequate breakfast of juices, cereals, yogurts, breads and croissants - and of course coffee (or tea). On our last day we were able to leave our luggage for most of the day while we went on one final walk into central Venice (10 minutes away).

My wife was initially worried that the hotel, which is off Via Garibaldi in Castello, would be too far off the beaten path, but this did not turn out to be the case. We arrived late from the airport, but the hotel had assured us this was fine as they have a 24h porter. We took the ACTV bus into P de Roma and then the No. 1 Vaporetto down to Arsenale. (It turns out taking the No. 52 to Giardini would have been quicker). From there, we walked over two bridges and turned left onto Via Garibaldi. Just by the little church San Francesco di Paola there was a helpful sign pointing the way and we found the hotel no problem. Our room was one floor up (no lift) and next to the breakfast area but this didn't disturb us much. The room itself was well furnished, had high frescoed ceilings, a good double bed, TV with CNN and Eurosport, closets with a safe, and a well equipped bathroom with a hairdryer and shower over the bath. It was all very clean, except for dust clinging to some of the light fixtures. Breakfast was, as most travellers to Italy will have realized, the standard caffe latte or cappucino served with four rolls of bread, two croissants (unfortunately stuffed with apricot jam), butter, marmalade and a Nutella knock-off, along with those two packaged pre-toasted slices no-one ever eats. There was unrefrigerated yoghurt to be had too, but we skipped that. The hotel is in a quiet side street and we were undisturbed for the duration of our stay. It was quite cold when we arrived and the hotel were unable to give us a second blanket (we got two extra sheets instead which we had to hide to stop the maid from taking them back) but once I figured out how to switch on the heated towel rail in the bathroom and that I could leave the door to the overly hot closet holding the minibar open, we were slightly warmer. Each morning we would either take the picturesque back alleys and canals past the imposing entrance to Arsenale to wherever we were going or walk down to the quay and go along the Grande Canal up to San Marco and the sights. Only rarely did we actually take the Vaporetto. It was a nice feeling to leave the hustle and bustle behind at the end of the day, and retire to the more congenial and residential Castello area. We left early on Saturday morning and the hotel kindly arranged breakfast for us out of hours, recommended a faster way of getting to the airport and processed our bill quickly and efficiently.

However folk must remember that Venice is an ancient city, hundreds of years ago rooms were small and it's difficult - unless a new build - to actually have a lot of space.
