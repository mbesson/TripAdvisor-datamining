We arrived after midnight and received a noisy hole in the wall as a deluxe room with no option to switch to another room (the hotel was fully booked). Next morning we complained to the manager and even though we got refunded the price difference between the deluxe and the superior room, it didn't make us feel any better.

The hotel is located in Little India, about 20+/- minutes from the airport ($30 cab ride). The hotel was clean and the staff were very helpful and nice. They spoke good English. The subway/metro stop was about 5 minutes away. We had three people in our group. While there were three beds in the room, they were all side by side, resembling one large bed made up of three twin beds. The pillows were perfect. The air conditioning unit worked VERY well. So well that I got cold and there weren't enough blankets in the room! The breakfast is meager. There was always cereal (corn flakes or the like), sandwich bread, jam, and hard-boiled eggs. While they had fruit every day, it was always some form of melon. They had water, orange juice, and milk. They also had yogurt. The bathroom is small. The shower nozzle is literally right above the sink, so you shower in the same space where you wash your hands. One would not really be able to shower and someone else use the bathroom at the same time. It was a quiet hotel. Not the kind of place for 20-somethings wanting to party. All in all, a very nice hotel! Oh, and if you're there on a Sunday night, be prepared for the hoardes of Indian men who come out to socialize on their day off. The women stay in.

I paid around 233 S$ ( inclusive of taxes-BBF) / night which I feel is quite OK as compared to other hotels viewed over internet. They have used single inch of the space to accomodate everything. Free WIFI in all the floors but signal is strong only if you use cable to your laptop. For hand devices you need to come to lobby or passage inorder to connect well to the internet.

We stayed at the Sentosa Festive Hotel on the last day. I was choosing between Perak Hotel and the chic Saff Hotel. But since Perak offered a room with three beds, it was a pretty easy option. Perak is situated in Little India. Though the place itself stinks, you'd see that it all adds up to the unique experience in Singapore. The area outside is generally dirty, with the cheap restaurants, and the marketplace a few steps away. The hotel room was clean, but very small. It felt as if three beds were forced inside a room for one. The bathroom was small too. It has a shower, right beside the toilet bowl, and everything else. Staff were not unfriendly, but they were rather quiet and they talk less. I don't see how this could add to the minus points, but definitely not a plus. They respond to your questions in sentences four words or less. Ahahah! There was a horse race on one of the nearby restaurants and people from Little India were cheering all night long. That was a bummer. Breakfast buffet was okay. and their dining area was really cute. It was small too, and easily creates a homey-feel for breakfast goers. It sets a mood that there will be a great day ahead of you. Overall, I won't recommend the experience for family trips. There is a long walk from the hotel going to the train station, and it's difficult to let your parents walk that distance. You're better off staying at Resorts World Sentosa for a few extra bucks.

We ate at some excellent restaurants iin the neighbourhood, too. We hesitated about being in Little India but, as this was really the only hotel which was reasonably priced for the dates we were going, we went for it, and did not regret our choice (we were, I think, pleasantly surprised). I would definitely go back - for the same price on our way back through Singapore we stayed in a hotel on Robertsons Quay which was not nearly so nice.

The room was of adequate size, comfortable, equipped with a/c, room safe, ensuite, tv, wardrobe and other basics.

The bed, linen and pillows were all clean and very comfortable with good housekeeping service that maintained the standard set at book-in. There was no view from the window however the room was well lit and leaving the shutters closed permitted us to use the a/c less. Perak Hotel is located in Little India which is a lively, interesting and convenient location in the city. As it is between 2 metro stations on different lines, it offers easy and affordable access to many of the other places that we wished to visit in Singapore. Perak Hotel however is MUCH more than this - it is a gem of care, efficiency and good service for its visitors. During our two-day visit, desk staff were welcoming, effective and well-informed at all times, providing advice and assistance that reflected our particular circumstances, as well as general information. They also pre-empted our possible needs at book-in, with relevant & timely advice such as their luggage storage and shower facilities for book-out day, and their internet access options should we need them for flight confirmations. Other specific examples of their quality service include helping to organise a repair to luggage that had been damaged by the airline; personalising map directions and advice to assist our explorations of the city and attending promptly to an electric buzz sound in the room that was interfering with sleep.

Initially I was worried about how our stay was going to be, because the gentleman behind the desk requested my credit card used to book the room. Not a problem.

The room we stayed in was very clean and spacious enough for the two of us. The bed was really comfortable, and when we called for extra blankets, the staff brought them right away.

Downstairs in the breakfast area there is complimentary tea, coffee , hot chocolate and biscuits all day long. The room was extremely comfortable with a safe in the room too. the bathroom was very clean but looked like it needed a bit of TLC, but having said that we found that the bathrooms all over the areas we went to in SE Asia were a little bit below standard. The staff were excellent and extremely helpful. We needed to book our daughter in for an extra night after we left and they were very accommodating giving us a special price and a very nice room too. We were also very happy to see that they upgraded our room on our return. This was a really super room, quite large and a decent sized bathroom too. Breakfast is very good and sufficient with quite a variety of food which you can take as much as you want of. Leaving your luggage after checking out is no problem at all cos they will store it for you at no extra charge. There is also internet facilities. The location in Little India is great fun. Close to some great restaurants (try the Banana Leaf Apollo - brilliant Indian food!) and also great for shopping. If you like walking you can easily walk to alot of attractions around and is just round the corner from Sim Lim Sq where you can get great electronics. Location is excellent.

On calling they told me that only deluxe-rooms are free. My mistake, I didn't do attention to the confirmation email, they confirmed 2 standard-rooms. We arrived at midnight and was very disappointed about the standard-rooms, very small, no windows, only air-con and no internet, the good thing about the rooms: they are clean. Next day I checked the deluxe-rooms, but finally for this price I don't agree and we changed the hotel. Paying only 40 SD more we've in very well four star hotel now. The perak hotel staff is very friendly, they offered deluxe-rooms and did no problems about our hotel change.", "Date": "March 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Turin, Italy", "Title": "\u201cI agree with 'the indipendent': one of the best budget hotel in the world.\u201d", "Author": "valemaffy", "ReviewID": "UR6916632", "Content": "A nice hotel in the indian part of singapore.
