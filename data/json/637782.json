Of course, you'll get a basic comfort, with shared bathrooms, but the room is really OK.

Basic room with pillow, sheets, blanket and bedspread; desk with chair; and telephone included but mine didn't work. Very economical accommodations in a very expensive city. Laundry machines were $1 per load and $0.50 to dry. Breakfast buffet was available while I was there but can be sporadic depending if there are large groups staying on campus.

I booked the residences because I was last-minute and it was one of the few places with availability. I was apprehensive of partying with it being a weekend, but the place quieted right down at midnight, so no problems there. My room was fine, clean and given I had a double to myself I had plenty of space. The free wi-fi was completely reliable. The shared bathrooms, however, weren't cleaned once in the three days I was there, even though they needed it (particularly the sinks). I didn't use the common areas so I can't comment on them. The staff are really helpful. The location and price are the main things going for this place. I'd stay again.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bowling Green, OH", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for.\u201d", "Author": "professorjackson", "ReviewID": "UR17561674", "Content": "The room was tiny and spartan, as I expected. The toilets and shower down the hall were almost disgusting, but not quite. Let's just say it was clear many people used them both frequently. All of this was as I expected, given the incredible price of $40 per night. And the location is incredibly convenient for downtown. The Spadina street car is very closeby. I needed to leave a day earlier than expected, not an emergency but a change of plans.

This is two student residences, open to the public during the summer holidays. As such, the rooms were large, with shared bathrooms - great for us as we didn't have to share a bathroom! Also security was better than with hostel accomodation. It was a bonus having access to a common room with a fridge and TV. There is a choice of single or twin rooms, and our rooms were very clean. You can book via hostelling websites, but we found that you can book directly with the college and then get student discount. The buffet breakfast included in the price was extensive and pretty good quality. The location was good, close to Spadina station and the tram line. It was great as a quiet base for exploring, but not a lot going on if you want accommodation with action.", "Date": "January 8, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "University of Toronto - New College Residences", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g155019-d637782-Reviews-University_of_Toronto_New_College_Residences-Toronto_Ontario.html", "Price": "$44 - $46*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">40 Willcocks Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Toronto</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">Ontario</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">M5S1C6</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "637782", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/29/24/29247cce1c417f65036133fa07a190cf1large.jpg"}}
