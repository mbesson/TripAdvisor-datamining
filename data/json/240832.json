When we got there, I was amazed! I had chosen not only a nice place to stay, but we were definitely centrally located. The tour bus stop is right across the hotel, but the hotel is not on a busy road, it is peaceful and quiet in the area. Lovely old buildings lined the road. The tour bus picked us up right in front of the hotel to take us to the Colosseum, and to the Vatican City tours. We walked or took bus rides to the close-by shopping centers. The street the hotel is on has many different open-air restaurants and cafes, and bistros to choose from. It is on the famous Via Veneto, where to film La Dolce Vita was filmed. The staff of the hotel was helpful. We requested a room on the ground floor, it was granted. The breakfast room is small, but cozy. Well stocked breakfast buffet.

Our friends with 4 in their party too also stayed there. All aspects of the hotel are excellent including the family room (remembering that finding a hotel that accomodates 4 in a room is not easy in Europe) that had bath tub, shower, large bathroom, and individually controlled air conditioning. I started the reservation process about 6 months in advance, and always received prompt detailed replies to my queries. Our rate of Euros 199 per nite with breakfast was fair and well worth it. Being from Canada, I was surprised that the staff spoke English so fluently and it is hard to believe that it is not their first language. We had a quiet room that was clean, and great for our kids. What sets this hotel apart from many others is the service, and the knowledgeable and polite staff. Our transfer was properly arranged from the port to the hotel, and confirmed to us via email even when we were still cruising. Upon arrival (2 hours before check in), we were told that our room was not available (as the prior guest had not checked in) and that it would likely be ready within 45 minutes, and it was ready. In the interim, we were offered coffee and brochures to help plan our time in Roma. We asked many questions about sites, tours, restaurants which were answered with detail and insight. The manager, Andrea Contini, is the epitome of what hopes to expect from a 4 star hotel like this place. Other staff like Barbara followed the high standards set by Andrea, and would ensure that we did not go on wild goose chases for open restaurants and would call to make a reservation and ensure that our kids particular tastes would be met. A detailed map with highlighted directions would also be given as i am geographically challenged. The breakfast is fresh and has lots of items to choose from including various pastries, meats, scrambled eggs, bacon, meats, fruits, coffee, tea, and juices. I presume (rightly or wrongly) that Europe 4 star hotels are not the same as those in North America, but this hotel deserves its rating. Finally, our return transportation (8 people and luggage) on a Sunday on a day that is a holiday in Italy was again properly arranged ensuring that our whole trip ended positively. While there is much to do in Roma, staying at this property, in my view, will ensure that your bank is not broken, while enabling you to go to many of the sites (on your own if you wish) as it is centrally located within minutes of the Spanish Steps. Frankly, I would go back to Roma just to stay at this Hotel!!

I don't know exactly how much the rooms would have cost us independently, but it was a pretty good value, considering what we got. We took a train from Fiumcino Airport to Termini station and then took a taxi to the hotel. Total cost for the 2 of us including \"baggage handling fees\" (the random amount the taxi driver charges you for having suitcases) was appx $70. The good: The room was clean and although not huge, had plenty of space for 2 people. There was a small buffet breakfast every morning which never changed in the week we were there, but there was much more provided than at a standard american continental breakfast. The staff was incredibly nice and accommodating. When we arrived, the concierge immediately handed us a tour map and circled the closest destinations for us to begin sightseeing right away. In addition to the underground Metro, the bus service in Rome is really good and was extremely convenient to the hotel (and the red City Sightseeing Rome bus has a stop just 3 blocks from the hotel just outside the Villa Borghese!) The bad: the wireless was out for one of the nights of our stay. The WiFi is not installed, per se - you buy a wireless access card from the reception desk and that card is good on only 1 computer for 24 hours so if you travel with more than 1 laptop, you have to buy multiple cards. The hotel is on a hill which makes for quite an uphill walk home at the end of the day from most tourist sites (and the closest Metro station). My husband was dissatisfied with the lack of breakfast variety. There were too few covers on the bed for coverhogs like us, but the other sleeping problem was that there was construction in the restaurant on the ground floor of the building shared by our hotel and work started promptly at 8am each morning. Don't plan on sleeping in except on weekends. The TV had only a dozen or so channels, mostly in Italian.

The Ludovisi is within easy walking distance of Via Veneto, the Spanish Steps, Borghese Gardens, and Trevi Fountain; a bit more energy gets you to Piazza Navona and the Pantheon. Rome is best experienced on foot so we wanted to be in a central, safe location. A bus stop across the street provides service to the Vatican City area. The hotel is nothing fancy, no grand lobby or restaurant, but it is located on a very nice, fairly quiet street - off the main road but just around the corner from Via Veneto. The room was clean and comfortable, not large by any means but not cramped either. The bathroom was surprisingly spacious for an Italian property and even had a bathtub, rather than just a stand up shower. Most importantly for us, the room had two double beds - a rarity in Italy - which allowed our family to stay together. The front desk staff was helpful if not overly friendly, which we found was typical throughout Italy. In general Italians are polite, but distant - they'll help if asked but don't go out of their way. Breakfast was decent if not anything special, though my kids were excited to see bacon and eggs in addition to the usual breads, cereals, fruit, juices and yogurt.

Also within walking distance is the Ancient Forum and Piazza Venezia. For those who aren't into walking, the bus and Metro stop is 5 minutes away. Another plus, the hotel is located on a quieter than average street in Rome, so you don't hear the constant traffic outside. Staff was helpful, but not overly friendly. Maria helped us with dinner reservations before our arrival, which was wonderful. Room was clean and comfortable, but not luxurious. Overall, in our opinion the hotel is in serious need of renovation, including new carpet, new light fixtures, paint/wallpaper, higher quality pillows and bedding, etc. The current decor is extremely dated. However, this would most surely raise their rates, which are quite reasonable when compared to other 4-star hotels on the same street.

I had spent hours going through lists of hotels and reviews on various websites and compiled a shortlist. We chose Hotel Ludovisi for the location and as it had better reviews than the Savoy. When we arrived, we discovered that our hotel was in the same street as the Savoy and looked very basic compared to the Savoy. The breakfast and room and general appearance of the hotel were basic. We chose to take a taxi from the airport to the hotel rather than spending hours getting lost on the Metro and it cost 35 euros. When checking out of the hotel we asked the guy behind reception to book a taxi for us. When the taxi arrived we asked how much and he said 'sixteen five'. Thinking this was cheap we were happy to accept. After a rollercoaster of a journey with the driver driving like a complete idiot and talking on his mobile phone we arrived at the airport and were charged 65 EUROS!!!! I am sure that the hotel guy must have had a cut of that. But after spending two days in a city where we were ripped off from start to finish, it was the final straw and we were just glad to fly home. Before we went to Rome, friends raved about the place, but we were very disappointed by the whole trip. This hotel is ideal for the location - close to the Trevi Fountain etc but I am sure that you could book better for the money - and if you do stay here - dont ask them to book you a taxi!!!", "Date": "November 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cNot Much of a Palace\u201d", "Author": "SAS13", "ReviewID": "UR4101839", "Content": "I stayed at the Ludovisi for one night as an individual traveler (I arrived in Rome one night early) and three additional nights as part of a Globus Tour. The first hotel room I was given was full of cigarette smoke (the carpet reeked of smoke) and the view of the dirty, ugly courtyard was less than desirable. I called down to the front desk to see if the had any rooms that were non-smoking, and they said that they didn't, but would give me a room that the previous inhabitants hadn't smoked in. My 2nd hotel room had marble floors, because it was on the same floor as the lobby. This room was much better (nicer and cleaner smelling), but had the same view of the dirty courtyard--this one had steps and a door that opened onto the courtyard (see photos). Cigarettes and trash were everywhere. The hotel had made no attempt to clean up their part of the courtyard. The hotel staff was friendly to me on the first day, but turned very ugly when the rest of my tour group arrived. They were angry that one couple on my tour wanted the leak in their hotel room fixed (it was smelling of mold already), and that another couple was complaining that their hotel door didn't open properly. Another man couldn't use his safe deposit box, and gave up on the hotel staff and used a friend's box instead. The staff was complaining to me and in front of me, about these problems. They should have been embarrassed to have their rooms falling apart, but blamed their guests instead. They weren't happy to give people directions to nearby sites, and seemed to hate their jobs. We were a nice, happy tour group, and were treated as intruders. We weren't treated this way anyplace in Rome, except for at our hotel!

I got my room when I arrived from my international flight in the late morning, the room was fine, breakfast was pretty good. Location is quiet and reasonably convenient to the Via Veneto and metro. Even the phone charges were reasonable. I was quite upset, however, when the hotel insisted on converting my bill (which was in Euros) to dollars, at an unfavorable exchange rate. The clerk told me he was helpless to override their machine. Though I insisted on (and got) a manual charge slip, and refused to sign the automated one (in dollars), they put the higher charge through. When I called the manager after I got home, he promised me a refund, but I never received one.", "Date": "July 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlington, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cWonderful experience at the Ludovisi!\u201d", "Author": "ashleybga", "ReviewID": "UR3622000", "Content": "The Ludovisi Palace was a wonderful hotel in a wonderful location. You are literally a 10 minute walk from the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps, Via Veneto, Via del Corso. The evening staff was extremely helpful (shopping, restaurant & sightseeing recommendations); the daytime staff seemed a bit too busy to actually help with anything. The evening staff also made reservations for us at Villa Borghese as well as with an airport shuttle company. The room was clean and the bathroom very spacious. The breakfast was the best we had in the three weeks we traveled around Italy. Bacon and eggs were a nice addition to the usual bread and jam! The air conditioning was great! You could actually adjust both the temperature and the speed...definitely not what I've experienced in other European hotels. We got a spectacular deal (140 Euros) because we booked at the last minute...it was a steal!
