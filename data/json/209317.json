The Royal Kahana is more a condominium than hotel style accomodation. All rooms have a fully equipped kitchen with all necessary supplies and well maintained. As the rooms are not belonging to the hotel but to indidual owners, they are all a bit different in regard to decoration and in regard to renovation level. Our friends, who stayed there at the same time, had a much nicer and lately renovated room. The rooms have a good size including diner table, sofa and some chairs. In addition we had a nice balcony also with table and chairs, unfortunately with view rather on the neighbour building than on the ocean. Therefore we do recommend to book a room with ocean view, from where you could even watch the whales in the late afternoon. The Royal Kahana is located directly at a small sandy beach with some rocks within the water line, which make the access to the ocean a bit uncomfortable. It's quite steep, so no place to let small children play unattended.There is small swimming pool, too, a nice garden and sufficient number of beach chairs. The latter most likely because people tend to spend the day somewhere at nicer beaches, with golfing or sightseeing. The hotel doesn't have any restaurant but a small snack-bar, which is closing latest at 5.00 p.m. In the garden area the hotel is offering the opportunity for barbecue. In the surroundings you find some restaurants, a small supermarket (Whaler's) and a Shell gas station. Parking is free, but the parking lots are somehow small and the total number seems to be a bit unsufficient in case of a fully booked hotel. During our whole stay we had to learn that the surroundings of the Royal Kahana is a bit more windy and rainy than neighbouring towns like Lahaina and Kaanapali. By the way, in Kaanapali you find beautiful golf courses and the best beaches with public parking free of charge. Upon checking-in the lady at the reception seemd to be a bit unmotivated and not very enthusiastic to welcome new guests, but the other staff was very friendly and helpful. Please avoid to join the offered event on the first morning, where they offer a kind of free breakfast. It's a pure sales promotion and you can spend your time much better elsewhere.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "BC", "Title": "\u201cGood beach, clean accomadations, nice location\u201d", "Author": "tornado17", "ReviewID": "UR125820572", "Content": "My husband and I recently stayed at the Outrigger Royal Kahana and had a lovely experience. I wasn't sure what to expect reading the reviews on here as they varied quite a bit in some cases. The property is on Kahana Beach. It is not a large beach, but it is still very nice. There are some rock sections further out in the water, but we found some very sandy sections too. It is nice to snorkel at and there were turtles roaming about every day. Whales can also be seen at a distance (don't worry not too close!). Overall the property is nice, clean and uncrowded. Our room was an ocean view studio (#904). By no means was it luxury accommodation, but it was adequate. It was spacious, clean, bright, appliances worked perfectly and the view was fantastic. It was great sitting out on our balcony every day looking out on a fantastic view. My only complaint/dislike about our room was the thin walls. We had a couple with a child next door that cried and screamed hours upon hours throughout the day. It is an older building so I'm sure thin walls are a common theme throughout. Staff at the hotel were lovely. The front desk was always helpful. As for shops nearby, there were lots within walking distance and Safeway, Longs, Walgreens, etc... were only an 8-10 minute car ride away. I had some people complain to me how far some things were, but we found it was easy to zip around in our rental car.

Like many of you, we only considered this place because it was part of a Costco package. Really not much too exciting to say about this place. Pros: Clean updated lobby Very friendly staff Close to the beach Whale sightings during \"winter\" Cheap if part of a package Here are the down sides. The hotel is old, carpets are old, furnishings are old. We had a 27inch RCA CRT TV in our room with a VHS VCR!!! I know some of you reading this don't even know what half of those letters stand for. The occupants of the hotel were even older! The pool area looked like a cast reunion party for Cocoon 2. I half expected to see large glowing rock-eggs in the pool at night. Nothing against the elderly, but when every one in the \"resort\" have 30 to 40 years on you, you starts to feel a bit out of place. I think I've seen enough obese, hairy, white dudes in swim trunks to last me a life time! Aside from the age of the residents, the hotel has some serious short-comings. Primary of which are the thinness of the walls and floors. We had an elderly person with a walker in the room above us. So every time he or she moved about the room, it sounded like someone was dragging the coffee table across the floor. Next door, we had two elderly couples very hard of hearing. So conversation was a yelling match between the four of them. \"DID YOU SEE MY GLASSES! WHAT? MY GLASSES! OH! NO THANKS! I'VE ALREADY ATE!\" Another issue, this was the most un-condo, condo we have ever stayed at. This is my third time renting a condo in Maui and my seventh time renting a condo in Hawaii, so I have a good idea of what to expect in a rental condo. This was not a condo! It is a hotel room with a kitchenette. Unlike a typical condo, actually owned and used by real owners, there were none of the usual conveniences. Normally, there would be beach chairs, coolers, boogie boards, beach umbrellas, maps, CD's, snorkeling equipment and I've even come across bikes for the renter to use. There were none of those things in this \"condo\". Basically this is an old hotel room with a place to cook. What our room (#1118) reminded me of was the 500 Sq Ft. studio I rented in the early 90's while I was in Grad school. It was like someone had time warped that tiny place on to Maui. Everything was small and old. There wasn't enough space in the kitchen to prep food and cook it. When the fridge cycled on, which it did constantly, it was loud enough to wake you, since it was only 7 feet away from the bed. Lastly, and a major issue is the shape of the building. You don't have to be an architect to know what will happen when you build a \"V\" shaped hotel in a windy area. Yes! a funnel! When the trade winds pick in the afternoon massive amounts of wind whip through the building creating a LOUD wooshing sound through out the night. So if you leave your widows open at night hoping to hear the surf, all you'll get is something that sounds like a taxing jet all night long! Not a bad place to stay for cheap, but not a resort or condo. This is basically Motel 6 with a kitchenette, on top of a Holiday Inn lobby, on an average beach in Maui.", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice prices, decent room\u201d", "Author": "cher01ice", "ReviewID": "UR123972834", "Content": "If you're looking for a no frills stay, you've found it.

It's a bit slower and easier paced, but with the exception of an astronomically priced Roy's, a Maui Brewing Company, and a MacDonalds in walking distance, you will be driving to dinner and to other spots. The beach in front of this hotel is eroded to the point of being unusable. If you want to hang out on a wide beach, you'll need to drive somewhere. You can swim in the ocean here, depending on surf, etc., although the sign implies it is dangerous at all times. There is a nice little pool. The rooms are old style, reasonably well maintained, and quite satisfactory. We found the mornings a bit noisy, due to various maintenance activity in the adjoining courtyard areas. Overall, this was reasonably priced, generous in size, and the kitchen allows for avoiding some of the high food costs in Maui. You are however, in a high-rise, looking at other high-rises, with a peek ocean view. You have to decide if that is what you want.

When we arrived at the hotel, we were offered a terrible bedroom with 1 queen bed and one twin. Imagine a motel bedroom with a little kitchen against the wall that it shares with a stinky bathroom. But more importantly, how were we supposed to fit there? So we started our Maui vacation with a tough discussion with the hotel management and Costco. The hotel manager offered us the option to add a rollerway bed at $20 extra per day but also told us that that would be against the fire code! Option two, pay $65 more per day ($45 for the upgrade and $20 for the rollerway bed) and get a nicer room with a king, a queen sofabed and a rollerway bed. No fire code violations this time. We moved to the better room to the risk of having to pay the \"upgrade\" by ourselves. A few days later, Costco told us that they had talked to the hotel and that they had figured out that there was a glitch in the system. The hotel was expecting 3 people, not 4. The hotel accepted to give us a complementary update, so we only paid the $20 extra for the rollerway bed. What really bothers me of this hotel is that they saw our paperwork with a reservation for 2 adults and 2 children and did nothing about it. That when you are checking in after a long trip with 2 children and expecting the vacation of a lifetime... Besides, we were offered a solution that was against the fire code. But, at the end of things, we must say that the stay was enjoyable. The better bedroom was a good deal for Maui and everybody slept really well. We had a nice ocean view that allowed us to see whales from the balcony. The hotel is very close to at least 5 great beaches and has an okay swimming pool, so our kids had a great time. Remember that you get what you pay for... this is not a hotel, and most nights there is only one staff in the entire building.

The staff were warm, sincere and genuine not fake and rehearsed like we've experienced at some of the resort properties we've visited.

The first room in which we stayed here was #402. It was old, the fixtures were old, the place smelled of stale \"human\" odor, old sweat, and cleaning solution. The bathroom floor and shower curtain had human hair - not our own - left over from prior \"guests\". The wooden kitchen cabinets and drawers in the kitchenette were worn and sticky. The drawers squeaked on their runners. The lanai carpet had numerous cigarette and water stains. After calling \"UNpleasant Hawaiian Holidays\", we were able to switch to a slightly more modern and cleaner room the next day. Still, this property is tired and dumpy. The elevators are slow and noisy. Most of the painted surfaces on the property (railings, door jambs, etc) are chipped, rusty, or both. THERE IS NO BEACH ACCESS AS OF DECEMBER 2010. Apparently retaining walls and steps to the beach were washed away in a recent storm, and \"Caution\" tape now blocks access to the tiny and rocky non-beach. The front desk service is as bad as the rest of the place. The staff are slow to respond, and rather cavalier. One gentlemen behind the counter didn't bother to stand when addressing my wife and I as we asked him questions. He sat down, and propped his feet upon an adjacent chair, as if he were lounging in his living room. THIS IS THE WORST PLACE WE'VE STAYED IN A LONG TIME ANYWHERE. AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS! Housekeeping is sketchy, at best. (Yes, we understand what \"lite\" housekeeping is, but here the staff seems to take \"Island Time\" to a whole new and bad level). AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS. I was underimpressed with Kahana as a whole, and this Outhouse Rigger property in particular. Go to the southern part of Maui if you want beaches. Even Kaanapali is far far far better. Oh, and as for parking, if you drive a Gem car, Mini-Cooper, or a scooter, you'll be fine.

The only downful to the hotel was as we did not have the use of a car you were isolated in the position of local facilities available. Just round the corner was a couple of restaurants which we found expensive, there was alway MacDonals. There was also a bar which served a local brewery's beer which we enjoyed. You needed to get a bus or taxi to anywhere else and the bus only ran once an hour and to get to Lahaina you need to connect with another bus and they stopped at around 8pm. The rooms offered kitchen facilites and use of barbi's near the pools which helped with the saving of money on self catering. The staff were friendly and Daisy May was very helpful with the booking of our chosen trips and connected us with a really usefull taxi firm which obviously cost us over the week due to not having a car. The taxi from the airport cost us $100 and would have been cheaper if we had contacted the hotel to get a number of the local taxi firm Daisy's taxis which were a husband and wife team who were fantastic and so helpfull and friendly. The view from the room was lovely and the hotel was right on the beach. The whales are not around until the beginning of the year when we were under the impression from advertising they were around during November. We did see the turtles on the beach in the evening and the sunsets were amazing. Overall the hotel gave us what we needed for our stay and helped us enjoy a remarkable visit to Maui. We did a helicopter trip and a road trip back along the Hana Road which was absolutely amazing and well worth the expense. We had planned to spend out a helicopter trip before we went but the road trip was an extra bonus and cheaper that doing the two separate as the Hana road trip was an all day road trip on its own.

Just a few things I would change: seems like it would be great if there were a bar at the pool, and there's even an area for it by the pool, but maybe it's a zoning issue (I did notice while swimming in the ocean that the other hotels nearby also didn't seem to have bars), or maybe to preserve the quieter atmosphere of this area.

One is about five minutes north, in Kapalua. The walk winds along in front of the Ritz Carlton complex. It's quite beautiful, and includes a lava flow, a wild, rocky cove, and a surfing beach. The family oriented beach (safe, good snorkelling) is at the south end of the walk, with lots of parking. The other beach walk is five minutes south of the hotel, again with lots of parking, at the northern part of Ka'anapali Beach.

The evenings on the beach with the tiki torches and taking walks and watching the sunsets were fantastic, too. The rooms were cleaned nicely every day. The Royal Kahanna is just a bit north of the busiest West Maui areas of Kanaapli and Lahaina, but that was what we liked.

It was awesome and Boss Frog's in Kahana is close and was really great. Also, a must do is Road to Hana (we did it twice and loved it)! When you do the Road to Hana, be sure to continue passed Hana, and go to the Seven Pools of Oheo. Loved it. And go to see the Haleakala Crater and do some hiking there, too, but watch how far you go because it is HARDER coming back out. Just a few comments that didn't really affect our stay, but maybe the Royal Kahanna could improve upon: Every time we stopped at the concierge to try to get discounts she was busy. Either on the phone or taking a very long time-- very long time -- with other customers that we would get tired of waiting and leave. So, we went elsewhere for discounts. We thought the staff at the front desk could have been a little more friendly and never greeted us once while we passed by. Perhaps getting them out from behind the glass would help?

When we got to the room though we discovered it was on the poolside of the building and the ocean view wasn't as good as we'd had in the past. The individual on the desk did some searching and found another room on the side of the building we preferred but suggested we wait until morning to switch rooms since we must be tired. All of the personnel were extremely pleasant and helpful the remainder of our stay as well. The rooms are large, very clean, and the kitchen stocked with all necessary small appliances, dishes, etc. Wed especially like having a washer and dryer in the room.

We arrived on Friday Feb 26th to a clean room in a hotel filled with pleasant people. We were in a ground floor studio and really loved the room with the full kitchen. The next morning we woke to tsunami sirens. What a way to start a vacation. The staff were helpful and vertically evacuted us to the tenth floor. Thank goodness nothing came of the tsunami and we loved the view of our new room so much we kept it. We sat on our lanai eating dinner watching the whales. It was very peaceful. The grounds are beautiful and the staff are helpful. I heard that there was a turtle sunning itself right out front of the hotel but I did not see him:( The hotel has an Expedia desk right onsite so we were able to book a scuba trip and a helicopter tour of the island right there. I recommend going to their little talk at 8:30 in the morning. The girls know the island and what there is to see. Daisy Mae is very friendly and helpful. Just remember not to overbook yourselves as Kahana is a bit away from the Ma'alaea Harbour and the airport so you spend alot of time driving. But the hotel is very peaceful and quiet. We met alot of very nice people from the US and lots of fellow Canadians. The only thing that bothered me was the wind. We were told it was unusually windy but the wind never stopped. Ever. So bring a jacket as it does blow at this end of the island. If it bothers you like it did me, do what I was told to do......if you don't like the weather in Maui, drive 15 minutes down the beach.

We made every effort to work with the friendly staff to find a suitable room, but either they only have a couple rooms that merit the positive rooms I see on Trip Advisor or they just didn't have any other rooms updated any earlier than 1987.

The dated appearance of appliances, fixtures, cabinetry and furniture just added to feeling of an unsanitary condition. Maybe if there was the smell with brand new appliances, granite countertops, etc it would have been easier but when every sensory perception is just overwhelmed with \"stale\" it becomes something even a guy can't ignore.

We chose to stay there because it gave us the option of cooking some of our own meals. We enjoy preparing and eating our own meals, even while on vacation. The Royal Kahana is also away from the craziness of Lahaina (we call it Little Waikiki) and the long row of pricey resort hotels in Ka'anapali. Yet, it is a fairly short drive into Lahaina for the requisite visits. Free hotel parking and didn't find the parking problems some other reviewers seemed to have. Unit 518, a studio condo, was delightful. It appeared to have been recently repainted. The kitchen was adequately equipped with cookware, appliances, plates, etc. Our \"ocean view\" certainly was not spectacular, due to the design of the building. But, we could see the ocean from specific angles in our room and from one end of the lanai. We could hear the ocean at night, which made the \"ocean view\" upgrade worthwhile. Maybe they should say \"ocean sound\", instead. One negative: the bathroom is very tiny. The toilet is inches away from the bathtub making it difficult to step into the bathtub if you have any type of mobility impairment. Housekeeping arrived daily for this unit and did a very conscientious job. On the whole, it was a VERY quiet hotel. One exception was an early-rising couple a floor below us who had breakfast two mornings on their lanai at 6:30 a.m. and talked excitedly and loudly to each other during their meals. I admit that I did \"bark\" at them during their second breakfast and reminded them that others were still trying to sleep. They quickly made their way into the room to carry on their energetic conversation. Muted, but better. Families and children were constantly using the shuffleboard and ping pong recreation areas. We did have to ask the front desk at 8:30 p.m. one night, what time the ping pong room closed. He responded that it closed at 10. A very loud family was using it, making it difficult for us to watch TV that evening. However, a few minutes after our call, the noise and activity from that area seemed to stop altogether. We later found out that the room was supposed to close at dusk. It took a total of 5 hours and two phone calls to the front desk for several dirty, wet towels someone left in the hallway to be removed one evening. Beach towels are available from the front desk. Persons unfamiliar with ocean swimming, tides and currents should swim in the hotel's pool. The beach fronting the Royal Kahana is not the type a novice with oceans should attempt. You might also try the gentler beaches of Ka'anapali fronting those monstrous hotels. Hawai'i requires public access to beaches, so you can use the beach even though you don't stay at one of those hotels. There is no restaurant on grounds. (That's one of the reasons the kitchens are useful.) There are several options for meals close by. The front desk people suggested the Okazuya down the road. Great local plate lunches and other local kine stuffs. Also, ask the concierge for coupons for some of the other restaurants! The best point of this hotel was Genie C. , the concierge. She doesn't work every day, but if you get a chance to go to her 8:30 am presentation, go. I've always avoided the activities sales pitch by hotel concierge. I was dragged to this one and am happy I went. Since she is a local girl, she is sensitive to Hawaiian and local folks' issues. She subtly discourages island visitors from exploring Maui's most sacred spots, and points them toward more tourist-friendly activities. If you are in Maui during whale-watching season, make sure you book an excursion with the Pacific Whale Foundation! It's worth every penny of the very reasonable fee. An evening at the production 'Ulalena is also a must. It is a very unique and compelling show for both malihini (new-comers) and kama'aina (local folks). Both will learn, or be reminded of, ancient and modern Hawaiian culture and history. If we return to Maui, we will certainly book another stay at the Royal Kahana.

Family with two teens plus one pre-K. It's a condo resort, not a full service hotel so services are limited. No restaurant / stores on property. Vending machines limited. Plenty of parking but narrow spaces. Ping pong table, saunas in basement. Has several gas grills for cookouts (utensils available) and a party pavilion for larger groups. Nice wide beach when tide out, much narrower when tide in. Front desk staff was helpful as was the concierge service to arrange activities. Nice clean pool. Ask at housekeeping or front desk for pool towels you use all week. No kids pool, so had to keep the little one close at hand as pool got deep quickly. Lots of sun on pool area in June. Well stocked convenience store / gas station and laundromat across the street along with McDonalds and four sit down restaurants / drinking establishments within one block with a range of prices. All were good with typical Hawaiian prices. Nice grocery store and more casual restaurants about one mile down the road to the south. Be adventurous and try them! We had an 8th floor, end room, 2 bdrm, 2 bath suite with a view and it was big, very clean, no bugs, functional and everything worked except we couldn't figure out the DVD player. It turned on but wouldn't display. Opening the windows created a great wind tunnel so we shut off the AC and enjoyed the breeze. Washer and dryer are stacked, apartment size with internal dryer vent. They run noisy, but since they are in one of the bathrooms, you can close the door. Kitchen was fully stocked with utensils, dishes and glasses. KEY TRAVEL TIP - We lightly tipped the housekeeping staff early in our weekly stay so they even put the dishes in the dishwasher and ran it for us and took the trash out! Then we tipped upon our departure. We bought a travel package through Costco Travel so it came with a $150 gift card for a grocery store in Lahaina. Saved us a bunch of money on drinks, fruit to snack on and breakfast/snack items. Cooking at the condo saved money for our larger family. They had to do some plumbing maintenance in our wing while we were there but they posted notices in advance and the workers met the schedule estimated. Since it's a condo, you get owners / time share owners as guests. Who owns condos? A mixed crowd but it trends older (40+). This is not the hot bod, in-crowd spot if you're looking to party down. If you need or want the full service hotel experience, don't stay here and then rip it in a review. It is a great value, clean and everyone was friendly. A bit far out on the NW coast so everything is a drive. But we've stayed in Makena before and everything is a drive from there, too! We had modest expectations and they were fully met.

DO NOT visit if you're a smoker. You have to completely leave the hotel grounds to have a cigarette and they're very unapologetic about it. DO NOT visit if you're with your lover. There's absolutely no romance about the place. DO FEEL FREE to visit if you're with a family on a budget. Odds are your mom will clean up after you. Positives: The room was clean and it had a small kitchen which came in handy. It was air-conditioned and well lit. Not a bad location, but you need a car to get anywhere interesting. Also, it was quite inexpensive, which was the reason I chose it in the first place. Negatives: (This is the difficult part to know where to start). 1. Their beach. It was dirty and had more bugs and wanut-sized crabs than I saw anywhere else near Lahaina. The water was sandy and muddy and I really didn't want to go in. 2. Their pool. It's peanut-sized, and they don't seem to be interested in cleaning it very often. There were a handful of chairs to lie in, but no point of interest to keep you there. 3. Their internet. It was down for 5 out of 6 days of my stay, and the staff had no control over it. They were happy to apologize and direct me to their off-site tech support, which went directly to voice mail with no follow-up or results. VERY annoying. When I finally got access on the 6th day, the connection was sporradic and slower than your average DSL. 4. Their room service. I actually had to request that they remove the wet towels on the floor after they had been there for three daysstraight--and they STILL DIDN'T DO IT. The staff was quite polite when you talked with them, but the conversation(s) never resolved in any results. 5. Their rooms. My room's outside-facing glass door was so poorly designed that when breezes hit it (which is the standard for Hawaii) it howled like a force 5 tornado. This made it difficult to sleep. Also, the bed's headboard was not properly attached to the frame, so it slammed against the wall at the nudge of a toe. (not to mention any other activity, in which case i'd sorely pity the next-door neighbors!) 6. Their parking. The spots are tiny and if you come in any time after 7 pm you have to park at the end of the lot. 7. Their grounds. There really weren't any. No lawn to speak of--just a lot of poorly kept pavement. All in all--I really can't recommend it and will not be returning. Their staff was very polite and nice, but never actually accomplished anything I asked for(which wasn't much).

I really enjoy this place. I highly recommend using VRBO (Vacation Rentals By Owner). You will get a much better rate than booking thru the Royal Kahana. Visit the VRBO website and it will give you details on each condo and easy access to contact the property owner. My 2 week stay in September was in a one bedroom oceanfront condo, 509, website is www.vrbo.com/36439. It is wonderfully decorated, made me think of what Bali would be like. In addition to the ammenities listed on the website, it had so many things that made it unique. These included, beach towels, coolers(2), beach chairs, beach umbrella, beach mats, boogie boards, 2 sets of masks and snorkels, hats, books, beach toys for kids, 2 phones, one with answering machine, 2 clock radios. Also has an iron and ironing board, hair dryer, lots of hangers and drawer space. I appreciated the hot water, came on right away, did not have to wait, great water pressure in the shower, no bugs (they do bi-monthly pest control), free internet - the Royal Kahana charges $9.95 per day to its guests. There are also computers set up in the lobby that charge by the minute, so the free internet that this owner provides is a really nice touch! Parking is included. The air conditioner worked great, but I was more comfortable after awhile opening all the windows and letting the breeze keep the condo very comfortable. The sound of the constant surf is great! This condo is very well kept up, you can tell the owner takes pride in it. One of the best things about this unit is the view. From the lanai, you see the islands of Molokai and Lanai. Molokai is beautitul to see, especially as the weather changes over it. It is million dollar view and I do not know of a nicer place to stay on Maui that has a better view in such a nice area. Condo 509 is on the side of the Royal Kahana that is away from the pool area which can get noisy. Also, the pool side gets more direct sun during most of the day so your unit can really heat up. I enjoy the pool area, there are plenty of chairs in the sunny areas and under trees around the pool, also, you can enjoy laying under the palm trees in a grassy area between the building and the beach. Tiki torches are lit at night which adds to the tropical flavor of the area. The lobby is undergoing major reconstruction and should be wonderful when it is completed. As you can tell, I am a big fan of the Royal Kahana, but do compare the prices on their website, with those of the individual condo owners. Also, compare the prices of just a room at the other oceanfront properties in Maui and you will not find a better deal than an oceanfront condo thru VRBO. The owner of this condo lives on Maui and if there is a problem, you can call the owner directly. You do not have to deal with the front desk which according to previous reviews can be hit and miss.", "Date": "October 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "ohio", "Title": "\u201cenjoyed our trip\u201d", "Author": "hemisrt", "ReviewID": "UR17536818", "Content": "just returned from our trip to maui and we stayed at the royal kahana.we stayed on the 7th floor and our room was so nice and clean. view was so beautiful. if you need a hotel that doesn't cost an arm and leg this one is it. true it does need a little painting here and there but for the price i think this one is okay . front desk service was wonderful,ladies were really sweet and helpful. maid service was good! extra towels needed and they delivered quickly.. no bugs seen!! thanks you royal kahana! and we will return to your hotel.", "Date": "July 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cA Pleasant Stay\u201d", "Author": "acsfoguy", "ReviewID": "UR16712401", "Content": "I had a very pleasant and relaxing stay at the Royal Kahana. Check-in was very organized and efficient. Couldn't of asked for a nicer and most pleasant front desk person. I was tired when I checked in and she somehow picked up on that and reminded me of certain things that she had said earlier, that I had somehow spaced on. That was nice of her. There were no major problems with the room. Everything was clean and in excellent condition. The only thing that I really could not sort out was the air conditioning. It had a mind of its own. It came on and turned off when it wanted. Also, to make matters more confusing are the controls. You have the old controls, which are from the original A/C units that were installed when the hotel was built. All the knobs are taken off because that system no longer works. (check out the pictures by OCALAFLORIDATRAVELER) Then you have the new controls which are digital, but takes a bit of practice to get the hang of. What I did was to just shut it off, and fully open the bathroom windows, and the sliding glass door leading out the the lanai. This created great flow through ventilation, that worked much better than the A/C. I was surprised at how updated and modern my room was. The bathroom was spotless, no dirt, mold or mildew. The kitchen was amazing, everything you could ask for was provided. The hotel provides a small amount of coffee & tea in your room to start you off with. They even provide a small box of detergent, all of which was greatly appreciated. Replenishing your food and other supplies is quite easy and convenient. The Kahana Gateway Shopping Center is maybe a 5 minute walk from the front door of the hotel. A General store is there. There's also a Safeways, and Star Market just a few miles away. I bought a bag of Kona Coffee at a nearby supermarket and made good use of the coffee pot and filters provided by the hotel in my room. The pool is a nice and relaxing place to hang out, and just be lazy. Also the beach is great to walk along at sunset. Parking was never a problem. There was always an ample supply of spaces, but the spaces seemed to be a bit narrow. I normally drive a small car. All that was left to rent were mid size, family sedans, and SUVs. I guess I'm not use to maneuvering a mid size car. I do have a few more things to say about the hotel in general, in order to give the place a fair assessment. Yes, it is an older property. I feel that it is well kept and its staff does a good job of making it a pleasant place to stay. The rooms can be, how can I put it?..............\"Hit & Miss\" at times. Some rooms are old and in need of updating. Some rooms have been partially updated, while others are totally updated and refurbished. Please read some of the reviews and look at all the pictures provided by traveladvisor. Especially if you are in the planning stages of your next vacation to Maui. This is my second time staying at the Royal Kahana. Both times I have lucked out with really nice, well maintained updated and/or refurbished rooms. This last time, I met some real nice folks from Canada and was invited to their room for tea and cards. I was shocked at how different the room was compared to mine. Some of the appliances lets just say were well used and showed it, the furniture was dated, the carpet wasn't as clean and bright as the carpet in my room. But they did have a large flat screen TV, the one thing I didn't have in my room. Even the room next door to mine had a few differences worth noting. The furniture was quite different, (modern faux leather), the carpet was clean but older than mine. You could tell by the wear. The bathroom and kitchen was just as new as mine. It is also worth mentioning that the rooms on the higher floors are used much more than the ones on the lower floors. This time I was on the second floor and had a beautiful room. The last time I was on the 8th floor, and had a nice room too, but you could tell that the room on the 8th floor with it's wonderful view had endured a little more wear & tear than the room on the second floor with it's partial view of the water. Even the furniture on the lanai will differ from room to room. This is not one of those hotels where everything is uniform. It's not one of those places where the TVs are all the same; the furniture is exactly alike in every room, the appliances are the same. It is interesting however, to find out what you get. (that is, if you get something nice.) Lastly, the washer/dryer. Having just flown in from Oahu with a suitcase full of dirty clothes; It's great to have this right in your room. Furthermore these appliances were so quiet I fell asleep while doing my laundry. I wish my washer/dryer at home could be that quiet!! My only disappointment was with the internet. I got about 1 day worth of free wifi. After that I could not access it any longer. I would sign on and it would automatically go to a pay site. Since I was on vacation, 24/7 internet access was not a pressing need. I do see where this may be a problem if you are doing a certain amount of work. Or if you are in constant communication with friends, family, or associates. I also believe that in a place like the Royal Kahana, free and easily accessible wifi should not be an issue. I don't believe in nitpicking. Yes, you can find nicer places on Maui and you can do a lot worse. Go in with an open mind, and you will be pleasantly surprised. By no means am I saying to settle for something if it's not to your liking. If your room is not to your liking, go back to the front desk and sort it out. From my experience(s) they have always been willing to accommodate my wishes. The Royal Kahana is a good value for the price you pay. Being an airline employee, I am always on the lookout for a good bargain, and someplace that I can refer friends and family too. The Outrigger group has always been good to airline people and I can gladly recommend this place to all my airline & non airline friends.", "Date": "June 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ocala, Florida", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing and rundown\u201d", "Author": "OCALAFLORIDATRAVELER", "ReviewID": "UR15603884", "Content": "I did alot of research on this condo/hotel and found it to be an ideal location for our 2nd trip to Hawaii in less than a year. We are not the type to complain, but this place is in dire need of some help. The grounds are nice and kept up well and the pool area was very nice. However the main problems exists in the units themselves. Our unit specifically #312 Ocean Front 1 Br Condo was tastefully appointed with what you would expect to have in your own home. That was a nice touch and saves some $$$ on eating out or staying at a hotel with the high $$$ room service or restaurants. The chief complaint was the AC. No matter what one did you couldn't get the air to get below 75-76 degrees. You could stand in maybe 2 spots in the entire condo and get a glimpse or feel of cool air. I called and complained and they sent up a housemen that said \"I've been telling the owners for years to fix these AC units but they don't\" Where does that leave me the guest? I asked. Well \"out of luck\" he responded. We've been here since the 23rd of April and are leaving on the 5th of May. And honestly the AC in my rental car is cooler than the air in this condo unit. It's so bad that as I type this review I'm sweating profusely. I've never written a review while still in the hotel I'm reviewing. The problem is the jalecy(sp?) windows on the front side including the bathroom won't close leaving holes big enough you can fit your hand through them allowing whatever air is in the unit to escape. However it is noteworty that they have signs all over the windows and doors saying to be sure to close the windows on the lanai or bedroom windows while the AC is running.... But why since the other windows don't even have controls to close them allowing the AC to escape anyways. No response for that one either. I have never in my travels ever stayed at a hotel/condo or otherwise where I've literally sweated while lying in the bed at night. I would get up occasionally and stick my head in the freezer to cool off or walk out on the lanai or get this actually stand on the bed in one certain spot to get a blast of cold air from the 1 of 2 vents in the entire place. My recommendation is that until the Royal Kahana management and possibly the owners of the units actually fix these problems it will continue to be a mediocre place to stay. It's very far away from Kahului Maui Airport and the only positive I have to say was the grounds and the front desk staff on check in were very warm and personable. But the hotel err condo or whatever you want to call it is in dire need of a makeover in the HVAC system. I would recommend that you stay somewhere else or at the Outrigger property in Wailea. Kanaapali Taxi (Loi and Ti) were superb in handling transportation to areas where we just didn't want to fight to find parking like our trip to Molokai. (Highly recommend that!!))) Rudy is the best tour guide on Molokai. Check out Blue Hawaiian Helicopters http://www.bluehawaiian.com For an aerial experience of Maui they are the best.

We enjoyed the little features the owners provided like the iPod docking station and the coffee maker which brews into travel mugs- perfect for mornings on the go. The kitchen had everything we needed to make a few meals and while the blender didn't work the first time we tried to use it, the management company was very quick to deliver a brand new machine so we could enjoy fruity cocktails. As I mentioned, the resort is dated. There was work being done at the pool but there were plenty of lounge chairs on the grass facing the ocean which provide a much better view anyway. There was a small work out facility which we had access to & used daily.

We even got some great views of the whales breaching from our lanai. Yes, the complex isn't the Ritz-Carlton, but it wasn't in that bad of shape as some of the other reviews have claimed. The staff was also very pleasant and not rude at all as others have claimed. The daily maid service was super and efficient. She even did our dishes! The carpet was clean and in very good condition as was the furniture in all the rooms. The only \"dated\" aspect of the room was the tile in the bathroom (it was still in good shape though). Having a car (a must) made it very easy to get to the various beaches, Lahaina, South Maui, etc, although the traffic can be a bit congested at times. And speaking of beaches, we found the D.T. Fleming beach to be a great place to use the body board, but the ones in Kihei (South Maui) offered calmer water and nicer facilities. Just a matter of opinion as ALL the beaches we went to were very good. The only downside for my wife was the water temp (74 degrees) and the cool evenings. This was our first trip to Hawaii as we have been going to Jamaica the last two years which does have warmer water, but it just takes a day or two to acclimate.

Our travel agent had recommended it, so we thought we would give it a try even though we had stayed at and were familiar with other properties in the the area. Location: About 5-10 mins north of Kaannapali and Lahaina, the location suited us well. We did not feel like we were in the middle of everything, yet close enough that it was never a hassle. Across the street is Kahana Gateway, which has a gas station, McDonalds, Outback Steakhouse, Maui Brewing Co. Restuarant (good food & beer), Roys Restaurant (didn't eat there), Hawaiian Village Coffee (good ice cream), and some shops. We went there several times and enjoyed having all that within a very short walking distance. Parking: We never had a problem parking at all. We had a PT Cruiser and it worked just fine fitting in the stalls and never had a problem finding a spot. I imagine an SUV would have a little harder time fitting in some of the stalls because they are on the smaller side. Beach: We really enjoyed the beach in back of the property. It was not crowded and we were able to hang out and do some swimming. A lot better than what we were thinking it would be like based on other reviews. Building: The building is a little older.. there were some areas that they were working on on the exterior, but it was never bother. There were 3 elevators, so getting up and down was never problem. The pool area was average size and although we always went to the beach, it looked nice. They also have several BBQ's on the property by the pool which we should have but never used. The lawn area was well maintanced and had some lawn chairs on it as well. Check-In: Smooth and quick. Nice staff. No problems. Room: We were in Room 905 and loved it. It was clean, up to date and the air conditioning worked great! The view from the balcony was amazing in both directions- the ocean and the green valley. The kitchen was fully stocked. We bought some groceries for the fridge to snack on and housekeeping even did our dishes, which was not expected. They kept our room clean and nice the whole time. We used the washer and dryer once, with soap they provided. They only give one coffee packet, which for 2 people worked for 2 days. We asked for another and they said it would be $1.00. We paid it, used it and after that got our coffee in the lobby each morning. It was quiet the whole stay. Our only complant would probably be on the bathroom tub faucet... it was a hard to turn and wasn't attached to the wall securely, but that was a minimal problem that didn't bother us much. Overall: We really enjoyed our stay at the Royal Kahana. We thought that the price was right, especially to have the kitchenette and oceanview with balcony (compared to some other properties prices) and it was a great place to call home for a week. We did hear one person at the front desk asking for a different room, so we figure a lot has to do with owner of the condo and how well they have maintained/updated it.

It was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime. Our first few days at the Outrigger Royal Kahana were lovely. We were in the penthouse; it had a giant television, a nicely equipped kitchen, a full size washer and dryer and decent bedrooms. I was a little disappointed that my husband and I were in a bedroom with two single beds, but I think that was more the travel agent's oversight than anything. Our trip was booked through AAA travel. About 4 days into our stay housekeeping informed my folks that they found bedbugs in my husband's bed and that we would have to move to another condo and all of our belongings including our luggage would have to be washed and/or fumigated. Management promised they would take care of it and whisked our clothing away to be laundered. Our luggage was strewn about the floor and we were assured they would fumigate it and return it promptly. A few hours later our laundry was delivered to the original condo unwashed and we were told housekeeping couldn't wash it because it would contaminate their washer and dryer. We were given several boxes of laundry detergent and told we could wash our cloths in the original condo. There we were, in Hawaii on the trip of a lifetime and we were doing laundry and checking under the bed every so often for creepy crawlies. In the mean time my sister and her husband were in another condo with a broken air conditioner. They were told that the electrician and whoever is in charge of air conditioners were on separate contracts and that it would be fixed shortly. The air conditioning worked sporadicly throughout the week, but was never fixed properly by anybody contracted to fix it during our stay. The condo we were moved to wasn't nearly as nicely appointed as the first one. It had a smaller TV, the kitchen wasn't as nicely equipped and according to my folks the bed in the master bedroom was like trying to sleep on a marshmallow. The only upside was that in the new condo at least my husband and I had a double bed to sleep in. Never mind that we all woke up for the 3AM bug check every night. Our luggage was not fumigated. Housekeeping took it downstairs and put it in the dryer. I suppose they changed their minds about contamination. The case for my husbands fishing reels melted so I presume it go hot enough to kill any bugs that may have been trying to hitch a ride to Pennsylvania. Management posted a sign on the door announcing a plumbing problem in the room. Funny, I thought the plumbing worked fine. My Dad spent $40.00 on wireless Internet access. It did not work properly in either room. To get any sort of wireless signal you had to take the lap top out onto the balcony and hold your face just right and say a certain combination of words. Though we complained he was not reimbursed. We were told simply that we should \"get closer to the ocean.\" In the end Outrigger reimbursed my parents for only 4 days in the penthouse, though we actually lost 5 days plus whatever time we spent fooling around doing laundry and checking for bugs. Nothing was done about my sister's condo and the fact that the air conditioner was broken. To my knowledge that issue was never even addressed. I do have to give the maid who discovered the bugs and alerted us credit. Thanks to her I don't believe we brought the disgusting little critters home. I'd go back to Maui, but I would not stay at any Outrigger property anywhere again. The only reason they got two stars instead of one is because of the fantastic view and that is something management has no control over.", "Date": "February 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Powell River BC", "Title": "\u201cloved the view only\u201d", "Author": "SheandE", "ReviewID": "UR13055255", "Content": "We just returned from a 15 day stay at the Royal Kahana.

We ate in each morning and for dinner two nights and had everything we needed to prepare our meals. The view is extraordinary, and the setting is beautiful. The daily maid service was adequate, although the towel supply was hit-and-miss. The washer and dryer were great.

The furnishings in these two units were quite worn. We had problems with living room lights. They never did work in 711, even after we asked for help and they told us the problem was solved. The living room lamps in 1011 worked for part of the time we were there. The office staff were not very friendly or helpful. For instance, I did not know until almost the end of our stay that pool towels were available. The ocean in front of the condo was brown the entire stay. We did not swim there. As I mentioned my son did surf and he said it was clearer farther out. Lounge chairs around the building are minimal, mostly full and the building shades much of the area most of the day. We spent our days at other beaches. All in all, the space made the condos acceptable. It was good to have large rooms and to be able to spread out. But we paid $399 per night and even for Maui that seems high for what it was. We usually stay in a resort when in Maui and will again. We've paid less for wonderful hotel rooms that were clean and had amenities. But if you need space and are doing a family vacation, this place works. Just don't expect a resort or full service hotel.

After reading a large number of reviews, we chose to stay at the Royal Kahana, and we weren't disappointed at all! We stayed in Condo 1215, a beautiful one-bedroom ocean-view. The condo was equipped with a full kitchen (as well as appliances and utensils) along with a washer, dryer and dishwasher. It is located in Kahana (just a few minutes North of Lahaina on the west side of Maui). The room was comfortable and clean and unless a \"Privacy\" sign was on the door, the cleaning staff would clean and re-stock the condo every day (including doing the dishes!). The resort also has a pool and beach towels are provided by the resort (so you can change them daily for fresh ones!) Also, to alleviate some other concerns I read in reviews, we didn't see any bugs (with the exception of a dead cricket on the lanai), but we did catch a small lizard in our room on our last night there! (small meaning not as big as a penny). The staff was always polite and courteous and there was always someone available at the main desk in the lobby. Also, there is an Expedia travel office at the resort if you need to book activities. Most of the prices they quoted were quite a bit cheaper than what I saw anywhere online, so you might want to check them out! The Expedia reps were really helpful and even provided a short introduction to the island and it's activities during our first day so we wouldn't miss a thing! The view from the lanai was incredible! Being an ocean-view, the left side of the view was of neighboring resorts, but on the right side we had a great view of the ocean and distant islands. The beach at the condo isn't really anything special unless you have small kids who want to play in the quiet waters. I would recommend travelling a few minutes North to the best beach we discovered in the area... the D.T. Fleming beach park! The waves here are pretty big (great for boogie boarding) and the beach is quite large. There is also ample parking and facilities available (both of which are hard to find at many of the beaches around Lahaina). Another beach I would recommend is the LONG stretch of Ka'anapali Beach (including Black Rock- a great snorkeling spot). The waves here aren't very intense, so if you just prefer swimming out, this is probably the beach for you. The weather in Kahana is a little on the breezy side, but we found that if you didn't like the weather in one place, a 5 minute drive in either direction brings a drastic change! Lahaina is HOT with very little breeze to speak of.

Our room was on the 8th floor with a view of the ocean which was nice. The room itself was big and had everything you needed for the stay. Our only complaint, and it depends which condo unit you rent, is that the carpets were filthy. We were told by the front door staff that they had been scheduled to be cleaned prior to our arrival but they had not been done yet and they were going to be done the following day. So the next day by the time we got back from a day of exploring the carpets had been cleaned. It helped marginally, but they really were in need of getting new flooring. The Hotel had a nice size pool which was never to capacity surprisingly because the beach was pretty small to be lounging around at. It is also pretty rocky entering the water so be careful. It is not what you call a playing beach but when you are on maui there are plenty of good beaches within a few minutes drive. We did the road to Hana, the volcano, snorkelling all over the island, the luau in Lahaina, visited the Kihei and Kaanapali areas and golfed at 3 different courses. All these excursions were worth the time. There really is so much to do that the week went by too quickly. As far as the golf went, the more the course charge does not mean they are any better. Try some of the cheaper courses inland and you will be pleasantly surprised. Overall, the Royal Kahana is a nice place to call home when you are in Maui.

I had room 1102 which had a view of Molokai and it was so beautiful watching the weather change daily over Molokai. The studio was not as well furnished in the kitchen as the condos I read about in previous reviews. There were no condiments in the refrigerator, it was completely bare. There was salt & pepper and lots of paper towels, but no plastic wrap and no aluminum foil. Also no storage containers for leftover food. I ate almost all my meals in the room so I stored things in pots and pans and in the one casserole dish in the refrigerator. I would have liked a frying pan but that was the only other thing missing. There is a clothes line in the tub which came in handy. As my clothes got dirty, I just put them in the washing machine till I had enough for a load. They sell extra laundry soap across the street at the Whalers General Store for .89 if you need more. This store has everything you need to start out your groceries before you go to a grocery store. Plenty of grocery stores near by, Star Market in Kaanapali, Safeway and Food Land in Lahaina. Both stores in Lahaina gave me a discount card which saved alot. There was plenty of toilet paper and kleenix. I had the sliding door open all the time I was there including at night, could hear the waves, and with the bathroom windows open abit, it was always very comfortable. There was a ceiling fan in the room also. It was also very quiet. The only time I heard my neighbors was when we were both in our bathrooms and had our windows open. I could hear the couple next door very clearly. The pool is small but the water is nice and warm, There are always plenty of chairs available around the pool and on the grass facing the ocean. Snorkling was abit boring here, but is great at most of the other beaches. I had a small economy car and did not have any problems pulling into the parking stalls, also, there were always plenty available, maybe I was there at a slower time. This was my 3rd trip to Maui so I did not use the travel center in the lobby. I did book a snorkling trip to Molokini thru Maui Divers (across the street in strip mall). Not many fish and the crew on the boat was not helpful when people were trying to get back on the boat. My big mistake was taking a road I was unfamiliar with. It goes along the ocean on the northwestern most tip of Maui. I don't remember the hwy number, but it starts out as a state hwy and shortly after it ends it is one lane most of the way on a very curvey road. It makes the road to Hana seem like a cake walk.

This was a return trip so I knew what the hotel was like, yet the first hours there I was noticing that the unit had cracks in the walls and ceiling and badly need a paint job, because of the U shape of the hotel, the first morning I was disturbed by the echoing sounds of cars, people, garbage trucks. My kids had to take the matress off the hide-a-bed and sleep on the floor as it was so thin and uncomfortable. But after a full day of relaxing in MAUI, all I could see was how happy I was to be there. We enjoyed cooking dinner on the gas grill on property (three are available) and eating dinner on our balcony overlooking the beautful sunset, watching the whales, listening to the waves as we fell asleep. The \"pool boy\" kept the pool spotless, washed the deck and chairs every morning. The exercize room had a variety of machines, all working, water to drink and a fan. There was coffee available that we grabbed every morning for our walk on the beach. We could walk to the convience store, to rent snorkle equipment or to eat dinner at Roy's (highly recommed). Although parking spots are little we could always find one, either outside or in the basement and there is no fee to park that so many other places charge. The pool house is a nice place to get protection from a passing rain storm, we saw a group that was traveling together eat there every night with each family bringing a portion of the meal-great place for a family reunion. The front desk was helpful with information and guidance. We thouroughly enjoyed our week there and hated to leave. But it is not for everyone. Although it was just what we were looking for( peace and quite) I heard some young couples complaining that there was no \"nightlife\", bar atmosphere or dancing into the wee hours of the morning.

The owner had recently renovated the condo, so it was tiled, nicely equipped and had a new washer and dryer (this was not booked through Outrigger). There was a slow drain in the bathroom. I didn't like the glass slat windows which opened (at the top of the bathroom wall) and faced the open hallway. Not a lot of light as it faced another condo, and was not ocean view (unless you were out on the patio and looked out to the side). The property is very dated. The front desk staff were nice. There are few amenities and the beach is really not good for swimming. The pool area is fine, though again, somewhat dated (especially the party room) with regular lounge chairs and some tables and chairs and umbrellas. There were also lounge chairs on the grass area on the ocean but it was hard to see the ocean over the hedges. There is an Expedia activity desk on site. Having stayed at much nicer properties, this was a disappointment. You pay a lot for the hotel rooms (though my studio condo was very reasonably priced) but probably about what you would expect to pay for Maui properties in this class. There is a plaza with McDonalds, Outbook, internet access, a gas station and convenience store very close by and very convenient to this condo/hotel. The garbage room was closed and then packed with garbage towards the evening, so much so that I had to stuff garbage in the chute which would no longer close. Parking is outdoors, no assigned spots. Tennis courts are on some elevated thing in the parking lot...looked cheap. Nice ocean view from the lawn and sunsets were great, but this is 3 stars all the way. I am sure an ocean front suite is more impressive (it was at the first place I stayed - far superiod to Royal Kahana). I think it gives more of a mid range hotel experience for a property that also looks built in the 70s. Good perhaps if you are on a budget and want to use it as a base for visiting all of the other great sights in Maui. The room and view you get makes a difference.

With the countless properties up and down the shoreline of West Maui, this seemed to fit the bill; a place that would accept a 2 night reservation, ocean-front views and an easy location. While all three of those held true, there were definite drawbacks and I would NEVER return to this property unless I had to look for a 2 night minimun reservation again. First off our unit number was 712 which is catagorized as a \"1BR Ocean-front\" unit. It is but it is located directly oposite the three elevators that seemingly run all day & night reminding me of my stays in Paris listening to the Metro until 1:00am every night! At least the trains there stop at 1:00am though!!! Also, to illuminate the hallway there is a 150-watt bright light that stays on all day & night absolutely BLINDING anyone in the living room area trying to use the absolutely useless sofa bed (more on that later). They have these \"panels\" that act as an upper wall that you can open and open the sliding glass door to the lanai to get a breeze, but once you do this not only do you allow even MORE light to flood in but you also get the benefit of hearing everyone outside as they wait for the elevators. The unit itself was nice and clean. Not very big but not too small. The bathroom area was very small and a bit cheesy in my opinion with plastic wrapped cups. At least you could grab a glass from the nicely sized and equipped kitchen. The DVD player was not hooked up so that was useless. The clock on the wall was off by about 3 1/2 hours but you couldn't remove it from the wall to reset or turn off. The water pressure was terrible and the temperature changed based on who was using water elsewhere in the building. The lanai was small and although it had a nice view of both Lana'i and Molakai, it was skewed so it also faced another nearby property allowing anyone on their lanai to look directly into our unit...not very private! It was nearly impossible to get the sliding glass door to open and close. The bed was pretty comfy though and it was nice to have a washer & dryer so we got all of our clothes clean prior to returning home (nice)! Parking was a freaking NIGHTMARE. If you didn't get home before 4:00pm, forget about it. They give you a permit to park on their grounds or in their garage but WELL OVER HALF of those spots are reserved for permanent guests and they will tow your car if you park there. Thankfully I only had to park there those 2 nights and both nights I scrunched my Chrysler Sebring into the tightest spots I've ever been into. Again, overall they have a nice presentation; nice friendly greeting, good website with nice pictures and a good location. The problem is their property is outdated on the outside and it really feels like you're in an apartment rather than a condo as we could hear the people below us at sunset on the lanai rather loudly. We will never return to this property. Having been going to Maui for about 22 years now I would suggest that if you have a short term stay as we did to try and stretch it out to 3 nights at least and check out the Maui Kai at <---.com>. If you have at least a week, do yourself a favor and check into a villa (Golf or Bay) at Kapalua.

The no smoking rule is a major pain so if you're a smoker, be prepared. They have an area out back by the pool where you can light up. When we booked the vacation in August, we had a smoking room. The law changed in Hawaii in November and now you have to be 20 or 25 feet away from public buildings. The beach and in your car seemed to be the only safe spots. The Mai Tai party was fun. We felt they should do it more than one night (Thursday's 4:30-5:30pm) because we met the other guests and enjoyed visiting with them. It's a good way to mingle if you're into that sort of thing. We saw a lot of whales from our balcony so bring binoculars. We did the Ultimate Whale Watch from slip 17 at Lahaina Harbor and it was worth every penny. These guys know their stuff and get you right up in the middle of numerous whales FAST. The boat only holds 18 people so it was easy to see whales on both sides of the craft.

It was our first time in Hawaii and we werent expecting anything other than a comfortable stay. The location is pretty good-- driving distance to Lahaina and other towns were within good driving time. Kahana isnt in the middle obviously but it didnt take long at all to travel to other towns. There are a few shops here and there in Kahana but it is a pretty good town to stay in. Less busy-- i guess i wouldnt recommend staying in Kannaapali or Lahaina if you want a lot of people. Kahana was perfect for us! The non satisfactory things: It was a bit windier up there-- which made it hard to sit on the beach. But, not a huge deal, just go to another beach!

They dont have breakfast there, but do have full kitchens which made it easy for us to go to a grocery store to get breakfast stuff, milk, juice, and of course, water.

The pizza hut is along the main road to get to the hotel. They also have some stores and a couuple restaurants, atm machine, and other things all within walking distance of the hotel.

This stay started off in unit 1001, which is considered a two bedroom, two-bath ocean view room. DO NOT RENT THIS UNIT until it is updated or remodeled. It is a step below a Motel 6. I think the towels were extra large dishtowels. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even was my dog in the master bath. Two holes in the bathtub along with large cracks that were rusted and a showerhead that was full of mildew. The bathroom sink had a large rust ring around the cold-water handle. Along with that, the king bed was so uncomfortable; there was no way to get a good night sleep. The kitchen was a walk in pantry and I could touch both walls with my arms reached out at the same time. The washer handle was broken off and you had to have super human strength to open the sliding doors on all the closets. The sofa and carpet were damp and the room smelled like a gym locker. I think you get the picture. How a name like Outrigger can associate and rent out this unit is beyond me. As we told the manager of Royal Kahana, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rent the unit and the owner will be forced to fix the problems. We were finally able to move to another room 220 which was a garden view room. So much for my ocean. This move was equal to a Holiday Inn. At least it was clean and felt much more comfortable. Outdated TV in the master bedroom. Still not up to my experience of the first time I stayed at this property. The first time at this property was in unit 110, which is the only unit I would stay in. All the modern comforts of home, well furnished and appointed. Clean and upscale. Excellent beds, TVs and great kitchen. If you are going with families, the property itself is average and works well with children/teenagers. The pool is not crowded and the beach works even as small as it is. It is an easy drive to the other west areas of Maui. I doubt I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll stay there again. This experience really did put a damper on our trip and we did not get fully settled into the new room until our 3rd day. Trying to move 2 adults and 3 teenagers along with the food we purchased is not an easy task. Our friends were at the Westin Villas, which were lovely. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also stayed at the Hyatt Regency. Resort over condo\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6hmmmmmm! Not a hard choice if I had to pick this property again. As far as activities, the Old Lahaina Luau is the best. Also the full day hike by Hike Maui was wonderful. Our guide Helga was full of great facts about Maui and extremely knowledgeable. Pacific O is great for dinner and very romantic. We walked to the Ritz Carlton for breakfast. Worth the 8 mile roundtrip walk.

The Royal Kahana is not a deluxe hotel, it is a clean, quiet, family-oriented beachfront condo / hotel, so if you are expecting otherwise, you should investigate staying in Kaanapali's resort hotels or in Kihei / Wailea. For our money, it was fabulous - room 402 has a breathtaking view of the ocean and the island of Molokai from the private lanai, which also overlooks the landscaped courtyard. The pool is very nice with plenty of chairs, and the hotel staff were great and very helpful.

Get up early and take the road to Hana - Wainapanapa's black sand beaches are a must-see. Also, the Old Lahaina Luau is the best on the island, backdropped by gorgeous sunsets over the ocean.

We have been to Maui several times and decided since this was only a 4 night stay we were going to SPLURGE and upgrade to an OCEAN FRONT 1 bedroom unit. What a fantastic disappointment this was. Please beware. You see the building is V shaped and the tip of the V is at the ocean. We assumed we would be at the tip of the V. Turns out there are only 2 2-bedroom units at the tip of the V on each floor and all 1 bedroom units are down each side of the V. So you can only see the ocean to one side because the building blocks your view the other way. Plus we were on the opposite side of the pool, which got no sun shine the entire day. These units are Ocean view not Ocean Front. And there is a big price difference. Needless to say we were very disappointed. Our unit, #908, had new carpeting so that was nice. #908 is three units from the tip of the V. It also had a newer bed but it was a full size and the sleeper sofa was not fit for man or beast when pulled out as a bed. The kitchen and bath cabinets were extremely worn and run down. There were marks on the walls and chips in the tile floor. Actually the whole unit was very tired. The kitchen was stocked but kind of dirty and with very cheap utensils. This unit also did not have anything in the way games/puzzles/beach things for people to use. There was no music source and the VCR was not connected or plugged in. The only thing they did have was some used paper back books in the tv cabinet in the bedroom. It was like the place was cleaned out by someone. There was a very large dining area and all across it are slatted windows that open and shut. Actually these windows did not shut all the way and they open to the outdoor hallway. Well as you can imagine the wind was whipping thru those windows howling like crazy. They had the closing mechanisms replaced on some but still did not close all the way. And the bathroom with the toilet and the tub also had the same windows. It was kind of creepy taking a shower and having the howling wind blow on you while you hear people talking outside the window. The washer and dryer in the unit are nice and are a stacked unit. There also was a huge walk in closet that had a safe, but you had to go to the front desk to get the key for the safe. The balcony was large and had a table and 4 chairs but the handle on the screen was missing and it kept coming off the track. The pool is small and kidney shaped. The beach was maybe 10 ft deep at most and there really is no place to lay out here. Housekeeping was spotty at best, and we never got the same amenities 2 days in a row. We had to go and ask to buy the coffee replacements. The thursday party with free mai tais and chips was great. And yes, they were very generous with the rum. The Kahana Gateway center was walking distance, if you can walk up a small hill. Roys and Fish and Game had excellent food. The location is very nice, only 5 minutes to Kaanapali and maybe 10 to Lahaina. The walking distance to Gateway center was great also. If our unit was not so run down and dumpy, with a king size bed, and we had not paid for and expected to be able to see the ocean when we looked both ways it would have been a much better stay.

Room 1204. We had reserved a oceanfront studio and were we surprised by our view. Beautiful room with washer dryer oven, microwave and large fridge. The hotel is older but for what you pay it is well worth the money. The views of Molokai are amazing, and on our last day we saw a whale breach from our room about a 1/4 mile out. WOW!!!! There are some things to know when you travel to Maui. First, expect to get hit up for a timeshare at least once. Second, Plan to spend more than you think on food. Each meal for us averaged about $50 bucks except for lunches at Subway and McDonalds. The Outback steakhouse is extremely expensive but close for the first night meal. Recommendations.... Go down to Kaanapali and the Whalers Village and have dinner at Leilani's. They have an upper area for formal dinners and a lower area that is open next to the beach with sunset views. The lower area has inexpensive meals burger fries, and other meals for 9-11 dollars. (this is a good deal for the area). I ordered the Mahi Mahi fish of the day which was $14.00. WOW!!!!!! I highly recommend this to everyone We ate here 3 times. Maui Dive shop for snorkeling gear. Best Snorkel spots...Milemarker 14. For the brave, drive out to Hana. There is a park there in town with a beautiful beach and concrete peir. Snorkel on the ocean side of the pier. Rougher water but deep with BIG fish. Go to Napili beach beautiful Do the drive to Hana. For those with infants who want the ocean but worried about waves. There is a great park about 5 miles south of Lahaina. Don't remember the name but you drive 5 miles south and come to a stop light. (It is NOT Shaw Street). Pul into this park. They have a protected rock jetty that contains shallow water that the kids can play in. There is small fish, crabs in here which will make it a learning adventure as well. If you sit real still the little fish will come up to you and swim all round you, between your fingers and nip at you lightly. It is lots of fun. Bottom line is this. This is a great hotel for what you pay. Staff is courtious and friendly views are a 10, beach is good, pool is good Free Mai-Ti's on Thursdays are great.

There are a lot of hotels in Maui that dont even advertise on the net and I wish I would of stayed elsewhere. I called the hotel a few days before we left. We live on the east coast and it was going to be a LONG day and I did not want anything left to chance... first of all I called five times trying to get to the *reservations department* guess what? they only have ONE PERSON for the entire building that could handle the reservation... her name is Michelle and she is very very hard to get a hold of. She wont return voice mail so I kept on till I got a hold of her. I wanted to make sure she had us down and we had asked for a King smoking room... she said yes we had both in the computer. First of all this condo building has very high prices and advertises oceanfront... I have traveled the world including Oahu but have never been to Maui and ONLY went because of the wedding. It seems Maui is one over priced adventure and all in all I will never go back there. We went to the store and a box of cereal is $5.00 and yes this was at Safeway not some small gas station. The beach sucks at this hotel. It is a small plot of blackish brown dirt with lots of rocks...NOT like Waikiki which is white sand and blue water. The ocean was dark and murky green and nasty and muddy ground that will suck you down if your not careful. Ok we drove from the airport in the dark due to a four hour travel delay out of LAX... it was dark and we needed directions...the hotel was clueless on how to tell us how to get there and we eventually just followed highway 30 to Lahaina and actually the hotel is in Kahana up the road... also when I was on the phone with them at home they said many places to eat just walking distance across the street...that is a total lie. They have a Mcdonalds which for two people costs $11-15 dollars ordering value meals.... that is the closest place to eat then they have a outback steack house and thats it. You have to DRIVE everywhere if you want something to eat or go to the store and cook on your vacation. There is NO gift shop or convenience store located on the property so come prepared with band aids, aspirin, drinks ect ect... the parking sucks its all close together jammed with a million rental cars and every night at least three times a rental car alarm would go off for a minute straight. We checked in and the girl working the desk said yes we had a smoking room and a king bed... dont look for a bell hop...they dont have any. We lugged our stuff upstairs and it was a NON smoking room with a queen bed and a twin bed... I called down for a ashtray... yes we are smokers and I like to keep things cleaned up and not drop ashes in the sink or out on the deck... we had to use a gatorade bottle and asked for three days in a row and never got a ashtray....the next person said we were in a non smoking room so I told her to check with the person who checked us in because we had already smoked in the room for two days... Im saying all this because for a person who is allergic to smoke they would not be happy checking in after a smoker. The room was basic and the carpets were dirty. The bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen and reminded me of my last visit to London with the small baths in the hotels there. The bathroom also has NO a/c and no fan...they want you to crank open these acient window slats to get the hot humid air so you will sweat to death after your bath or shower. The toilet ran for two days straight as the chain was getting caught up on a piece of plumbing that was falling apart so everytime someone used the toilet you had to remove the lid and untangle the mess. We reported this to the front desk and no one ever came to straighten it out. They have a very tiny pool for all the guests to use... you think it would be larger or they would have at least two of them. My other family members stayed at other hotels around Lahaina and Kannapoli... we had the dumpiest hotel and everyone was suprised to see the lack of facilites including a sauna that does not work and a dusty small workout room. We spent a lot of money to stay at this dump and I would not recommend it to anyone and NO this was not our cheapest option. Maui all in all is totally overpriced and I would take our favorite spot which is Cancun which is closer and better and all inclusive for a fraction of the price over Maui anyday of the week. They have a lot of overpriced tourist things to do and we knew better then to pay $200 to bike down Haleakala at the crack of dawn.... if you want to do these things SHOP AROUND.... I saw Lu'aus for $19.00 at the Marriot (my sister stayed here) and my family went to the Old Lahaina Lu'ua for my brothers reception which was sooo boring and it was $85.00 a person plus tax and gratuity.... this is my fifth Lu'ua and it was not worth the money and the meal was just so so... downtown Lahaina they have many places to book parasailing, biking the volcano, snorkeling, L'uaus ect ect DONT GET RIPPED OFF... we drove everyday to get to a decent beach and stayed away from the sharks who are dying to take your money.

I speak nothing but the truth... read back and see I was not the only one who thinks this is a really crappy condo building with really crappy service and facilities.", "Date": "October 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cSolid value!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3905280", "Content": "The Outrigger Royal Kahana is a very clean, off-the-beaten-\"resort\"-track kind of hotel. we found not pretensious but a very accomidating staff very willing to please.

The northern side was a little too grassy for swimming, but the southern side was coral....lots of fish to see (especially the state fish: Humuhumunukunukuapua'a). The room was fine, and the housekeeping swept and made the bed, but didn't do the dishes or wipe up the counters. I'll chalk it up to the mostly slow-pace of life of the Hawaiian housekeepers.

Including paying $0 for the 5th night, we paid an average of $190/night for 5 nights, and didn't feel that it was really worth it. Granted, MAUI IS EXPENSIVE. (Other islands such as Kauai and Hawaii - the big island - are much less touristy and greener) NEGATIVES: - This hotel is a little rundown, and although in a convenient location to drive to places, there wasn't anything to do within walking distance - Although it is true that all rooms are oceanview, our 2nd to last room had to gaze out to the left to see the ocean. (See uploaded photo) - Our \"suite\" was really an oversized hotel room (no separate bedroom and a kitchenette along one wall.) (See uploaded photo) - The beach at the hotel is very small and not great for either swimming or sunbathing. No others within walking distance. - Internet access is either dial up in the rooms or wireless that wasn't working in the common area (but no one knew why) POSITIVES: - The staff was pleasant, things were clean - The pool was nice - Not too many loud kids since the area (Kahana section of Lahaina) was sort of isolated - Local Fish Market (called 'Got Fish') had good fresh fish to grill on the resort's barbeques - For the most part, the kitchenette had adequate cooking supplies. (Hit the Safeway in Lahaina for best prices) IF I HAD TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN: On Maui, the nearby KAANAPALLI area is much nicer, has a boardwalk, and some good beaches with common activities such as volleyball or restaurants. However, there are more kids and it is pricy. - WAILEA on the southern shore is much more ritzy. - NAPILI on the northwest shore is kind of a \"hidden gem\" of a place to stay in - I'd go to Kauai or the Big Island, where we spent time during the second half of this trip and one other.

Our suite had a king bed in one room, a twin and a double in the second bedroom, plus two and a half bathrooms. The full kitchen and full size washer and dryer made the stay very comfortable. Parking was free and ample. As for the location, it could not be more convenient. Maui didn't seem to have many sidewalks or people walking to their destinations. Most hotels seemed to be located out of walking distance to most other things (Lahaina, Napili, Kapalua). So, yes, you do have to drive to most places from the Kahana. But, I think it would be the same from ANY hotel (excpet for those in Whaler's Village). The Royal Kahana does have a great little shopping center in walking distance. It's pretty much right in front of the hotel. There's an Outback restaurant, a McDonalds, a General Store, a gas station, and two other bigger restaurants. There's also another smaller shopping center with Dollie's (GREAT pizza) and a dive shop. The pool was small, but well-kept. They cleaned it every morning. There were ample lounge chairs. The beach was clean and sandy. The water wasn't clear, but, ALL of the beaches we went to were murky (Napili, Wailea, Kapalua), due to the season. Lahaina is about a 15 minute drive. Napili and Kapalua are about 5 minutes in the opposite direction. ALL of the highways in Maui seemed to be two lanes(one going each way). So, I don't know why that other person was using the 2 lane thing against the Kahana. The highway is actually two lanes in each direction, from Lahaina to Kahana. The airport (OGG) is 45 minutes away. We paid $265 per night. It was a GREAT value that we could not beat anywhere else. This would probably be a great place in whale-watching season, as long as you get an ocean front condo. The staff was also wonderful and honest. The housekeeping staff found our cell phone after we left and turned it into the front desk. The beds were always made and clean. We had new towels every morning. All soaps and detergents were in our room waiting for us. You do have to purchase your own laudry detergent, once you use up the first box the hotel provides you with (enough for two loads). We will stay at the Royal Kahana again. As I said before, it is cheaper than you'll find anywhere else (on the Lahaina side of the island, on the water).
