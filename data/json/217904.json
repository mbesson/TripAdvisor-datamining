It was very expensive-199 euros(for two nights of my stay, lower for others) for a very basic (no alarm clock) but large room. For example, I had to ask for soap in the shower since the dispenser was empty. The Internet was so slow that I could only look at emails, not respond or even get on a web site. The Internet did not work at all for a day and a half. I only made the front desk staff nervous when I asked them when it would work. In the room, the curtains were very dirty and needed to be rehung as parts were off the hook. My bathroom sink dripped from a loose fitting and did not hold water for rinsing underwear. I hurt my foot and needed ice; the front desk sent my son to the gas station. There is not any hotwater for tea or coffee available. Now for the bright side, Frau Rosenbergenr was very helpful with boarding passes and check out and the hotel is located next to the Tiergarten and close to different train lines. It would be a good budget hotel but was the worst value I have every had in a hotel room.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHelpful staff, good location\u201d", "Author": "Tommytee23", "ReviewID": "UR126768654", "Content": "Semi-grand arrival, large glass entrance canopy.

I did not think of this and I wasn't able to get one at first. Luckily I came back Saturday midday to drop off some purchases, and one bike had become free.

I really did not run into an issues with rudeness, in fact for the most part people went out of their way to show there kindness. My best advise is get a day pass every morning for about 6 Euro and you are good to go on all transportation systems. We extensively traveled thru Berlin and the countryside. Well worth the Cost.

Hotel is very clean, adequate, geared for business person or someone attending a film festival, convention centre or for anyone who needs to stay in touch with the world via internet, or needs to get any information. Buffet was amazing. Great quality of food, big selection, and they changed a few items every day. Dining room, was huge, immaculately clean, and the wait staff were friendly and all spoke English which I was grateful for. Same with front desk staff. Very professional, friendly, English was perfect, and staff were very helpful. Some of them however, mainly the night staff would look at you suspiciously if they never saw you previously. After an exchange of pleasanteries and with your door key in hand, they were fine after that - just be patient with that. Housekeeping was very friendly. If you needed to sleep in t'll noon, you would be left alone . You should always put the do not disturb sign up even though when I was in Bologna, Italy, the staff there didn't seem to respect that sign.

Fabulous places to eat and drink within short walking distance: the cafe just down the road on the corner Knesebeckstrasse/Goethestrasse sells great sandwiches.

We did our research into various hotels and this one, despite a couple of complaints, seemed fairly good so we went ahead and booked. We were not disappointed. Contrary to a couple of reviews, we found the staff on the front desk to be diligent and friendly, (my German is schoolboy stuff but passable, their English was excellent). The rooms were spotless and cleaned every day and apart from the odd person walking across the courtyard at night, it was pretty much as peaceful as you'd want. The location is fabulous: 500 metres from the Ku'Damm, 100 metres from the nearest U-Bahn \"Ernst Reuter Platz,\" 200 metres to the nearest S-Bahn \"Sauvignyplatz\" and a mere stone's throw to the nearest restaurants (which ranged from the homely and inexpensive to the more pricy ones) We tried hard to think of any negative things to say about the Gates, and can only think of two: 1. Being Brits we love a morning cup of tea, but this facility, so common in most European hotels, was not available in the room. There is a coffee house 50 metres away, so it's not like you can't get an early morning drink. 2. We were here in Spring and the weather was just turning pleasantly warm, and a large opening window was a nice touch in these days of sealed units and aircon, but I feel that in July and August, when the weather gets a lot hotter, aircon would be a bonus to be savoured. There you go, two very minor points, not even worth calling complaints really. We've stayed in hotels across Europe and paid more for a lot worse, and we both agreed that this was without doubt the best deal we've ever had. Booked through Expedia, flights and accommodation for 4 nights came to a touch under \u00a3200 each flying from London.
