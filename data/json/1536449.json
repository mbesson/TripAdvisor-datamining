In less than 1 hour after I made the reservation I got a list of restaurants with links to their webpage and distance from the hotel indicated and their judgment of the restaurants. As for the something special they also gave me some options. I picked the champagne and fresh fruit. As for the restaurant I reserved a table at All'Oro a gourmet restaurant (Michelin 1 star) indicated in their list of restaurants. Great. We get there and the room is great and there is the champagne and fruit laid out. The front desk staff proceed to call up the restaurant to remind them that my wife is pregnant and to make sure that the menu will not include things that she cannot eat.

You can walk into town by day (about 30 minutes gets you to Piazza del Popolo and its a nice walk through the Park Villa Borghese. Or you can get a bus (the number 52 leaves from nearby) Now the hotel: It's clean, modern with beautiful rooms at a reasonable price for Rome. We stayed here to save money as the hotels in the centre are expensive. Breakfasts are nice (a shame that they have them in the basement rather than in the garden, but I guess that's logistics). The ambience of the hotel is cosy and friendly with very nice staff who looked after us well. The decor everywhere is beautiful. The building is lovely with a lovely garden where you can sit outside and have a drink. The area is also nice. Now that minor thing that would make it perfect: There is a raised platform out in the garden which would make a perfect place to have a little swimming pool. For northern Europeans Rome weather is suitable to swim right up to early November with temperatures of over 20 degrees by day.

We were able to get maybe 20 minutes of good signal during our stay and they MUST correct this, since it is very annoying. In general a very good stay with a correct price.", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "Scooney1967", "ReviewID": "UR114688846", "Content": "Ok, thought I'd write a review on this hotel - because it deserves it. Just stayed 3 nights at the Villa Duse earlier this week, and had a great time. The hotel is out of the main centre, but a 360 bus 10 metres away takes you to Termini central station for \u20ac1! (Suggest you buy a \u20ac4 day card - gets you on all busses and metro, and gets you \u20ac2 off the open-top sight-seeing bus if you fancy doing that - which I recommentd. 2 days for \u20ac18 if you use the discount. It is worth it. Anyway, so the hotel is far out enough to be lovely and quiet and peaceful (perfect for a whole night's sleep) but handy enough to be in the centre within 20 mins. We got lucky with the room - free upgrade to the excellent red junior suite - complete with balcony. Awesome. Everything was clean - the bed was 10/10 - the room was stylish - the aircon worked perfectly - tv great - minibar (which can act as a fridge if you're watching the pennies.....) Great sleeps, which is priceless in big cities - gives you the energy to do the sights and really enjoy it. Breakfast was very good - a good mix of healthy and cakes if you want to indulge. The fruit was very fresh and everything was in plentiful supply. Breakfast was served 7.30 - 10.30am - so we bombed down at 10am each morning, due to late nights!!! For me the staff were tremendous, and one of the reasons the hotel has so much appeal. I stay in hotels maybe 4 times a month with work, and I normally really don't like them - this one is different - it's a bit like staying in someone's house. I have to mention Daniel, who was an excellent guy, and a real credit to the hotel. OWNER/MANAGER, if you are reading this, please note!!! He was very helpful, well mannered and very professional. Anyway, I think that's all I want to say - if you have specific questions, I would be happy to reply - suggest you get a late cab to the Ponte Milvio - it's not cheap at \u20ac16 but worth it. We went twice out of 3 nights. Absolutely jumping with under 40-year olds. Great restos and great bars - not rowdy, mostly couples, and everyone just seemed in a great mood. The restos were pretty cheap, so took the pain out of the cab fares there and back. The quality of the food we got was first rate. Enjoy - am jealous writing this thinking you might be going and I AM BACK TO BLOODY WORK ON MONDAY!!!! haha. cheers - Paul", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nea Alikarnassos, Greece", "Title": "\u201cAbove expectations!!\u201d", "Author": "pitmanos", "ReviewID": "UR114594204", "Content": "We wanted to find a nice, clean, quiet hotel but this small jewel offered us a lot more.

The hotel is situated in a very quiet residential area of Rome called Parioli. We took a no. 360 bus from the Termini train station which dropped us off almost outside Villa Duse which was very convenient and only cost 1 euro per ticket! The hotel is a beautifully converted private villa and every attention has been made to detail. Elegant but also very comfortable, we had booked the least expensive room ( they only have a dozen or so all together ) which was no.3 and had it's own tiny private patio where we sat enjoyed the warm Spring evening. The bathroom eas well equipped with luxury large towels, robes and slippers and was a good size with a real window that you could open! The bedroom was medium sized decorated with taste and beautiful fabrics. The bed was large and comfortable. There was a awell stocked mini bar, reasonabily priced and a flat screen TV. Breakfast was served in the garden and consisted of wonderful home made cakes, puddings and pies ( an Italian breakfast tradition ) but also frsh fruit salad, yoghurt, cereals, croissants, rolls and preserves. There was a small selection of ham and cheese too. The cappucino was very good and the waiter extremely pleasant.

The hotel is small, but decent sized rooms and beautiful decor. The beds are amazingly comfortable and they have electronic blackout bindes. They have a well stocked mini bar and the wine in the room is delicious. The flat screen sky TV is a bonus, as is the decent shower, bath and hair-dryer is included. Big towels & bath robes are another plus. In Italy it's apparnently illegal to supply/lend irons by the hotel (or at least this is what we were advised by the staff) so gentleman, take a travel one if needed. The cold breakfast was really good too, beautiful/cozy dining area with plenty of cold food available, fruit, yogurt, cereal, cakes, and pastries and good coffee. The staff were absolutely wonderful, everyone's english was fantastic and they all knew plenty about Rome to give advice from places to dine and drink to transport. The location was the only slight downfall as you're about 20mins from town. Catch the 360 bus to and from the Termini, you want the bus going to Romania street from the centre when coming back, you're the final stop or second to last, the hotel is a 5 minute walk from the Romania stop if you get confused. The 19 Tram will take you to the Vatican (expect 1.5 hr queue in the morning, we paid \u20ac35 to a tour group including entry which is usually \u20ac15+\u20ac7 for headset, and to skip the queue and gained a 2 hour tour with an american speaking italian within the price, definitely pleased we did, this tour group work with the little coffee kiosk in the centre of the square if you want to use them) and after there you can walk to the Colluseum (closes at 3.30 if you want to do this 1st and go the opposite way to us as we missed getting in by 15 mins) with lots of other sights on route. Buy transport tickets from the tobbaconists, or at the hotel desk \u20ac1 a trip or \u20ac4 a day or \u20ac11 for the week. No one ever checked the tickets on the trams or buses but we bought them anyway. The metro shuts at 9pm. The buses are every 15 mins, and the trams are frequent too, running late around midnight, so the location isn't really an issue. DO NOT DO TAXIS IF POSSIBLE. They are expensive, and they add on euros, quickly turning off the metre so you cant see it, or adding several euros if you ask directions anywhere. Italians are so lovely - every stranger we stopped couldn't have gone out of their way more, one couple even missed their bus with no concern so that they would direct us. The waiter of the cafe called the hotel without being asked, and the restaurants are happy for you to use their washrooms without purchasing from them. So no need to ask the taxi driver. Also if you order one, the metre starts from when they take the call - not when you get in. Note - upon departure in all hotels the government have imposed a new tax \u20ac6 per person per night which you will need to pay. I would definitely recommend this hotel to any friend. Rome is a city to fall in love in and with and this hotel just perfected the trip - I can't wait for another opportunity to go back!

We booked an executive room, because we wanted a room with a jacuzzi, which was great, after a day of strolling around Rome. The room wasn't really big, but good enough for a few (5) days: enough space to store our luggage, a nice bed, classic furniture, spacious bathroom. The room was very tidy and they cleaned it every time we left the hotel (sometimes the towels were changed twice a day). Breakfast room was downstairs. They offered a wide range of cakes and some bread, yoghurt and fruit. Coffee (try the latte macchiato) and tea was served fresh. The men who worked were really nice. Breakfast was served until 10.30, which was great for us. We spend most of our time in the centre (Colloseum, Vatican, shopping streets) with all the other tourists, but the location of the hotel was also great if we wanted to go to the park (Villa Borghese is a 10 minute walk), the Zoo (in Park Borghese) or when we wanted to go to great restaurants without other tourists. The receptionists at the hotel gave us great tips and made reservations for Molto (international food, great, but a little expensive) and La Pariolina (Italian food, not too fancy). We ate at 9, that's when it becomes more crowded in restaurants. Both restaurants are only a 10 minute walk from the hotel.
