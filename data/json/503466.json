Unlike many of the photos I've seen the stories I had read, I was expecting it to be impossibly tight and uncomfortable. Not so! They had thick mattresses in our 2 double beds room, and everything was super clean and modest. It was difficult finding the location as there's no signage whatsoever. When you enter Knight's Garden, to find the office, you walk to the 2nd floor of the first stairway on the left. There's only one door, and you can hit the doorbell to get in. The staff was really helpful (and spoke good English) and allowed us to keep our bags in the office after we checked out but before we left town. The only down point beyond finding it was the number of steps you have to deal with if you have a lot of luggage or are tired from coming from the airport. While there is an elevator, it is small and hard to move around in. If you're flying out from HKG, make sure to ask the staff where the A22 bus stop is from the hotel, it's much more convenient than taking the Airport Express back, and costs hk$39 one way.", "Date": "July 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cThe worst hotel i've ever stayed\u201d", "Author": "Yeannie Y", "ReviewID": "UR135687265", "Content": "Been staying here for 5 days 4 nights. if not because of the full payment that I have made, I would have cancelled my booking on the spot once I saw the hotel. It is located somehow next to a restaurant named spicy mama, thus when you walk around the long corridor (yes, long corridor with stairs, wouldn't be much helpful if you have heavy luggage and travelling with elderly), you'll noticed some weird and annoying cooking smell. The rooms were dirty with lizards and flies and small, not as spacious as it claims. The rooms were cleaned daily throughout my stay however it is still not up to my expectation. Bad air conditioning system and poor lighting. The toilet light was spoil on the very first day of my stay. The stairs are faster than the old elevator. Some of the staff were very friendly, like Paul but for the others, a definitely no-no. The worst part of my stay is that when one of my relative would like to borrow their toilet after check out, and they insist it is not possible because we have check out, everything is on our own. This is so inhumane. Although the hotel is located strategically near to Jordan MTR station and Temple street, there are more others worth-staying hotels nearby, I swear I wouldnt come back to this hotel anymore! Some good points about the hotel is they allowed you to make free IDD call throughout your stay.", "Date": "July 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida, USA", "Title": "\u201cBasic, clean, safe, affordable\u201d", "Author": "UsuallyFarFromHome", "ReviewID": "UR126497774", "Content": "This hotel is apartments converted to groups of small hotel rooms, or so it seems.

The helpful staff all speak good English. The Internet (wifi) was good most of the time. It is a good value for the money. One thing though - this place is a bit tough to find. There was NO signage that I could see. You have to look for the address, which is clearly marked but you might overlook it if you are looking for a hotel entrance - instead it is just a passage way to an apartment building.

The single en suite room was, as advertised, very small, but neat, very clean, newly decorated, had an openable window, A/C, fridge, TV, kettle, and everything I needed. Only (slight) hiccups were an small additional charge on arrival due to \"incorrect exchange rate on website\" (an extra HKD45 on top of a prepaid HKD650 charge), and in-room internet acess only if you bought a phone-to-laptop cable (for HKD20).
