The bed was very comfortable and plenty of room for the two of us. When booking a room for a motorcycle trip, a big priority for me is parking. Going to Key West parking can always be a problem. While researching I found the Key Lime Inn has their own parking area. I was pleasently surprised when the desk clerk said I could keep my bike by our room, even though our room was at the back of the property. This was very nice to have the bike right out side our room where I could keep a good eye on it. The breakfast is served around the pool with a very nice selection and they also have coffee makers in the room.

Pretty far from the Mallory Square scene. One supposed advantage is that there is parking on the property, but there are not nearly enough spots for the crowd. We had to park on the street most nights, which kind of defeats the purpose of a motel. Since this was built years ago as a motor lodge, there is really no main building - you check in by the building near the pool, then get assigned an individual cabin, or a room in a small building (we had the latter). Slow check in and no luggage help, so we had to drag a big luggage cart across the wood-chip filled parking lot. Room was decent sized, but we had the deluxe king. Our pals had the deluxe queen, which didn't even have a window. Shower stall only (no tub), small sink, not much room for bathroom materials. One day we were up early, got back to the room at 2 (room was not serviced), then took a nap until two. When asked if we could get service, we were told the cleaners had left for the day. Hard to believe we are the only people in town taking a nap at 2, but we were handed some clean towels and that was that. At $279 a night, I expect a bit more than that. The pool was very nice, and the continental breakfast was ok (fruit, breads, cereal, juice, coffee). If the location was better, I could have dealt with the quirks and provided a higher rating.

The bed and pillows were very comfortable, and I'm usually really picky about this aspect of my hotel stays. The staff was quite friendly and helpful. On the downside, as other reviewers have noted, this inn is not a luxury resort. But it has some dated charm, in a recently renovated sense. I was a bit disappointed that they didn't have parking available when we arrived in the evening -- we were directed to find street parking until spots opened up in the a.m. The following morning, we got a spot on the property, and it didn't turn out to be a big deal, just a minor annoyance. Also, the breakfast was ... OK. It wasn't much -- bagels, muffins, cereal, coffee, orange juice, and apples -- but it was, well, OK.

The front desk staff were very couteous and offered to hold our bags, offered us use of the pool, pool towels, and showed use where the front desk restroom was in case we needed to change. We decided to go find some lunch instead, but appreciated their efforts to make us at home. We stayed in one of the Malone House rooms. I believe these rooms are the larger rooms at the Inn. We found them only average size, but this is understandable given the nature of most Old Town KW properties. The room was clean, with a mini fridge and small bathroom. Hardwood floors were nice, and the room had a door that opened onto an interior hallway as well as to the front porch of the house, about 20 yards from Truman Ave. We sat outside on the front porch area to have a few drinks in the evening before going out for dinner. The property was nicely landscaped with some palm trees, flowering bushes, and mulch and stone walkways between the buildings. There are a few sitting areas and hammocks in the spaces between the cottages and the main Inn buildings. Nothing too fancy, but it definately contributed to the relaxing atmosphere. The pool was decently sized and clean. The pool has a deck around it, where they serve breakfast. The breakfast was standard continental, yogurt, fruit, cereal, juice, bagels, coffee, tea, etc. The property is centrally located, a 5-10 minute walk from both Duval Street and the Southernmost Beach area. The front desk staff was extremely helpful setting us up with rental bikes (<$15 a day for two bikes), which can be used to get from one side of the island to another in 15 minutes or so. There were racks to lock the bikes to near the front desk area, which I highly recommend doing at night. We flew into EYW so we did not have a car with us, but there is parking at the Inn, which is something of a rarity in the Old Town area of KW. Our stay was for 3 nights. Overall the property was a good value, clean, and had friendly helpful staff.

On positive note the rooms themselves are very nice and the setting is nice and Key Westy, but I think this hotel is living off shine and not substance. Negative facts: Parking is a nightmare. It mentions nothing about first come first serve in the website unyet we were told this is clearly shown. It was difficult to park nearby and when we had trouble parking the staff were not helpful at all, could not advise on anywhere they knew might be OK to park and I was generally not happy about this. We could not park in the main car park the whole time we were there, The toilet was blocked and once again the desk staff needed me to come up with the ideas. I ended up having to take a mucky plunger to my room through the breakfast eating guests to plunge the toliet in my $200+ per night room myself!!! The room floor was never swept the whole 5 days we were there. The bathroom generally smelled, it just needed a bit of bleach or cleaner. The pool was not clean and the generator for the pool swicthed on early in the mornings which made our stay a bit noisy. Breakfast was exactly the same every day, it consisted of cereal, orange juice (not fresh as we saw them filling it up!), weak coffee/tea and toasted bagels, muffins and bread. It could have been just a bit better in my view. lastly, being picky maybe was that we had a room by the pool but were always woken up by people eating breakfast right by our window at 8.30am. One lady I had to ask not to do her morning business Skype call so loudly and the chairs and tables were just noisy. i thought we would have had a proper table and chairs on our own blacony but we didn't. We spoke to ther guests whilst we were there. Some were also very unhappy with the parking and someone else did say that their room was noisy as it was by the road and carpark. We noticed that quite a few rooms are by the road and car park but we immune to noise in a way as we are city dwellers normally.

We stayed in room #30. Upon entering, I was under whelmed with the size and amenities of the room; and overwhelmed with the smell of mildew emanating from the damp and visibly dingy carpeting. There was no refrigerator, no microwave, no coffeemaker. The sink was right next to the bed. The lights over the bed did not work. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m from South Florida and found the room very humid (probably as a result of the damp carpet). If you want to open a window, forget about it, they removed the knobs so that you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. The shower is proportionate to the room, as it is just a stall. Another reviewer mentioned that if you drop the soap, you have to step out of the shower to pick it up, I laughed when I saw that because it is absolutely true. Also, the first night, we asked for an extra blanket and they said no. The bed was pretty, the sheets were clean, but it the mattress was hard. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all bad though. It was cool having breakfast with a rooster. The breakfast itself was O.K., not the typical B&B breakfast that you\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcd expect. It was more like the continental breakfast at Super8. Bagels, pastries, juice, coffee, cereal. It was a good distance from Duval (not too close, not too far). The property and grounds themselves are pretty. I had a good wifi connection from The Chelsea House next door. All and all, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a good experience. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t what I was expecting.

While this was not our first trip to Key West (several stops while on a cruise ship), it was the first time we drove down from Savannah. The ride down was a new experience, I really expected more bridges than land! We drove to Fort Lauderdale, spent the night there so that we could continue the drive the next morning and see all the keys by daylight. We reserved a Deluxe King room and were placed in Room 10 which is on the second floor of the Maloney House. There are two doors to this room, one from a corridor and one from the porch. The porch view was toward the street, with a canopy of palm trees to obscure the view some but not totally. We rather enjoyed being on the second floor with this type of view. It was a very clean and spacious room, 12 foot ceilings, with one window looking out to the very large & long front porch and the other two windows were side by side looking out the side of the building which overlooked the cottages. We checked in early, and it was no problem to gain access to our room. Katie was at the front desk and was such a help with attractions, dining, etc. Ask for coupons to area establishments - especially dining. Katie told us that many places were likely closed because we were there during the \"off season\" - time between Labor Day and Fantasy Fest! We didn't find any limitations on what we hoped to do because it was off season. Some of Katie's best advice was to grab a parking spot on the property and not move without the risk of losing that spot. The Inn was expected to be nearly all full by early evening. We were able to park directly below our room and made unloading easy. I have read some complaints about the mulched pathways making it difficult to roll luggage to your room. We didn't find it a nuissance and thought it added to the charm. How much do you need to pack anyway? It's Key West! Same goes for the roosters! It's Key West! (I can honestly say that I couldn't hear a rooster while trying to sleep for the drone of the AC unit!) We rented bicycles from A&M Scooters just a block & a half away from the Inn. I believe the prices are $15 per 24 hours per bike, with a lower rental rate if you didn't need a full day. We must have received some sort of discount, we had 2 bikes for 32 hours for $32.25 total! Bike riding IS the way to go! The bikes have a basket, lock, key on an elastic wristband, and lights for night-time riding. Bike racks are everywhere. We so enjoyed riding bikes to supper, Mallory Square, shopping, the attractions, and bicycling through sidestreets looking at the architecture. We were able to take advantage of a Key Lime Inn promotion, Stay Longer / Get More. We received complimentary cocktails - served poolside at sister property, Lighthouse Court and got 2 free tickets to the Hemingway House. We loved strolling Duval Street by day and especially at night. It's fun to eat outdoors and watch locals and other tourists stroll by. Trust me, you will see everything -- the drag queens promoting their show are a hoot! Lots of choices for shopping & dining. Key Lime Inn pros: Large, spacious clean room - plenty of windows in Room 10! Safe located in the closet was very useful, as was the room fridge. Helpful staff Picturesque setting Wireless connectivity. Could use improvement: Key Lime Inn bathrooms really need a shelf or or corner table for toiletries. Not a huge deal, but a microwave would have been great to heat up leftover dinner. Trip Highlights: Mangos Restaurant -- large outdoor dining area, fantastic menu, excellent service & atmosphere. Cheeseburger in Paradise -- when you get tired of seafood! Truman's Little White House -- Excellent tour, informative, such a beautiful area of town. Renting Bicycles and riding around -- no need for a car -- really! A slice of Kermit's Key Lime pie! Yum! Driving down US-1 from Miami to Key West - gotta do it once!

However, our room (cabin #2) was covered (and I mean COVERED) in hair. When we arrived at around 3pm we immediately showered and found that there were about 40 hairs (all types..) all over the bathroom (walls, floor, toilet, shower stall, etc.). As we are not the type of people to complain (this is my first online review), we cleaned up the hairs and decided that if we didn't find any on the bed, there was no need to contact the front desk. Upon checking the bed, my boyfriend and I decided to request a different room. Not only did we easily find several hairs on the bed (on the pillows and comforter), but on our way out we saw a few on the lampshades! The woman at the front desk was very nice about the situation and switched us over to the only other available room (#10), which happened to be much bigger. Once we'd moved all of our things, just to be sure, my boyfriend and I half-jokingly checked the bed and lampshades for hairs - and they were EVERYWHERE! All over the bed, all over the lampshades and window sills, a few in the bathroom, and, I kid you not, one in the fridge (along with some blue gum). We laughed that if we complained to the front desk again, they'd suspect us of planting them! Of course by then we were looking for hairs, but they really weren't difficult to find. We aren't clean freaks - it was just GROSS. We had to go back to the front desk to return our key to cabin #2 and when they asked how we found our new room, we told them, embarrassed, that it too was rather.. hairy. The woman there assured us that they'd never received such complaints before (which I can't imagine) and promised that the housekeeper would come up shortly to change the sheets. But the housekeeper never came. Many hours later, shortly before we wanted to go to bed, we asked the lady at the front desk to please send up the housekeeper soon. What we got was a pile of fresh linens on our bed, which would have been fine if there wasn't a fair amount of hair imbedded in its fibers! There were also several stains on the sheets. We ultimately ended up picking out the hairs, one by one, before making the bed and going to sleep. Obsessive? Maybe. But by then we were seriously wigged out (pun intended.. ha). As we were picking out the hairs we at first just let them fall to the floor but then we decided to collect a few in a cup so we could post a picture with our review.

It certainly wasn't as noisy as some units we have come across but it was close enough to my ear that it made sleep difficult. However, the rooms have good fans which helped. Would I consider it 5* - no, I must be honest and say not. The room itself was actually quite small, mainly taken up by the huge bed. One of the really annoying things I found was the bathroom - in our bathroom there was absolutely nowhere to put toiletries etc. Everything had to go on the floor. Not much thought gone into that one!! Also, the other really silly thing was that the patio had a small raised, bricked area just large enough for the round table and two chairs. If you moved your chair slightly, you fell off the \"raised\" area. Nit-picking I know but all it needed was a little more thought. Yes, there is a rooster at the back and it woke me up at 7 am as it was actually in our patio. But I guess he had more squatters rights than we did. Breakfast was round the pool - cereal, yogurts, bagels, muffins. One silly oversight was that there was only coffee available - if you wanted hot water for tea you had to walk round into Reception and get it there. Again, just a little more thought. The pool area was nice and clean and although the pool faces the street, you really aren't aware of the traffic due to all the trees around.

This hotel was perfect fit for all that and more. The location is just a short couple blocks away from Duval Street (where all the action is). The look & feel of this hotel is just how I imagined Key West to be. We stayed in the main 2 story building but loved the small individual cottages on the property, next time we are in K.W. I would definitely stay in this hotel and request one of the cottages as they look so cool. Room was clean and simple with nice dark hardwood floors and nice bed & furniture. No weird or musty smells. Our room was on the 1st floor so we had a secluded porch with some chairs shielded by the tall bushes in the front. Breakfast was served under a canopy out by the pool. Just some fruits, bagels, muffins, juice & coffee, nothing fancy but it was enough.

At a Key West establishment for over $200/night, I would think at the very least there could be fresh citrus and fresh baked goods. Maybe some tea? With all the European tourists passing through Key West (and this hotel) I actually felt embarrassed about the kind of food served for breakfast, when in Europe, at even a low-price travelers hostel you get fresh food for breakfast. The rooms were clean and pleasant, but quite small again considering the price. And rooms are packed together with thin walls, so we heard the amorous activities of our neighbors on both sides. I understand that it's Key West and I'm happy for couples experiencing rekindled romance, but it shouldn't make you feel like you're in a motel 6.

Vicky and Robert at the front desk were especially helpful and accomodating but all the staff were friendly and welcoming. Make sure to ask them for their recommendations on restaurants, bike routes, local bars, etc. Next, we highly recommend the cottage rooms. They resemble small bungalows but the furnishings inside are modern and very comfortable. Next, the location of the inn is perfect. It's close enough (3 blocks) to all the fun on Duval Street but far enough away to have a restful stay. We spent half of one day on bikes touring the island and the other half relaxing by the pool. The Inn is not on a commercial strip, it's part of a residential neighborhood which is part of its charm. Next, the continental breakfast is nothing fancy (coffee, juice, yogurt, bagels, toast, cereal, etc) but it is ample and nicely laid out by the pool. The only small downside to the inn is the small parking lot. If you get a spot, parking is free. If not, there is street parking nearby. We parked our car and left it in the spot for 4 days.

Not a big deal, just annoying. Parking is very limited (maybe 15 spaces or so), but there's a good deal of free street parking on Truman. There was also a very slightly odd smell in the room. Not strong enough for us to bother with complaining, and I imagine it's very difficult to avoid some small amount of mildew in the Keys, but there it is. Also, whatever cleaners the housekeeping staff used, they didn't smell great. That said, how much time do you spend sniffing at your hotel room in a place like Key West anyway? This is a great hotel.

A 24 hour Denny's is right down the street, as is a 24 hour CVS (along with a Papa Johns and Subway in the same complex). We rented bikes just around the corner and the inn had a bike rack where you could park them. We didn't have a car so we didn't have to worry about parking. We walked or biked everywhere and enjoyed it. Our room was #18, a stand alone cottage that had its own little deck and private bathroom. I personally found the bed uncomfortable (a bit too hard for me) and the linens are very cheap and scratchy. There was a sofa, chair and coffee table, along with a flat screen TV, king size bed and two nightstands. The bathroom was pretty basic and had a shower. One big thing I didn't like was that there wasn't much hot water. Even when I was trying to be very conservative and save hot water for my husband the hot water ran out, and I was in there for less than 10 minutes. I could see in the summer how this wouldn't be a big deal but it was pretty chilly so this was one downside to the room. The fridge and coffee pot are in the bathroom to the left of the shower. We had little bugs running around by ours (again it's Florida so no big deal really) but after I got rid of them once they seemed to stay away. Overall, this inn isn't anything fancy but is in a nice location and has comfortable accomodations. Don't expect five stars or anything but the staff are friendly and the pool looked nice (too cold to swim). They also offered a complimentary breakfast but we never made it to that.

We would have liked a bath (apparently none of the rooms have a bath) but having said that the large shower was fine. My only complaint with the room was that one of the 2 windows didn't have shutters so the light from the porch meant the room was very light in the night. The hotel is set in a great location, back off the road so very quiet at night and only minutes walk from a number of excellent restaurants including on Duval Street where many of the art galleries, shops and bars/restaurants are located. We had originally booked for 2 nights but so liked the hotel and Key West itself that we stayed an extra night - and would have been happy to stay a lot longer had time not been restricted. If we return to Florida we would love to return to Key West and highly recommend the Key Lime Inn to other holiday makers/business travellers.", "Date": "December 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcaslte UK", "Title": "\u201cGood location and value\u201d", "Author": "essexgirlNewcastleUK", "ReviewID": "UR50656335", "Content": "Booked this based on Lonely Planet recommendation as we didn't want to stay in a chain and liked the idea of an older property.

I read many reviews on Trip Advisor before I booked, and while the reviews were not outstanding, I decided to give it a try. A couple of main reasons for choosing Key Lime Inn were that my friends were staying right next door at The Mermaid & The Alligator, the price was right, it has a good central location, and the pictures looked pretty good. I had a \"superior queen\" room which was fine. Pros on the room: It was clean, towels and sheets were good, the air conditioner worked really well, housekeeping service was good, shower was fine, cable TV included, overhead fan. It had a small wine refrigerator which wasn't too cold, but OK if you drank your beer fast. There was a loose tile on the bathroom floor and the floor grout was really dirty, except under the sink where no one walks. Breakfast was just OK. The pool is OK, but it's right on the highway which is a detractor. Otherwise, the stuff that was pretty negative was: Location, in that it is right on the highway and traffic (e.g. loud motorcycles, trucks) can be heard in the room. At the same time the location is good in that it is centrally located, it would be better if it were just a block off the highway. Last is the roosters, they started crowing at 3 AM everyday. That is really annoying. Aside from putting up fences to keep them out, I suppose there is nothing that can be done about them. However, my friends at the B&B next door never heard them their entire stay. Overall, my stay was fine, but I would not stay there again. I think you can spend a few more bucks and get a better place. I've attached a map of the Inn grounds that they gave me. If you decide to stay there, try to get a room off the highway and away from the parking lot. I was in #17. Other stuff: Go to Dry Tortugas, it's worth it. Have breakfast at Azur, it's 1,000 times better than Blue Heaven. Try Seven Fish, Sarabeth's and drink at the Conch Republic. Get a gyro at Miami Subs (yes, I know it's a chain).

It seemed expensive for the quality of the room aswell. Unfortunately our rooms was in one of the outhouses which seemed quite flimsy and more like a shed.

Each of our rooms had a lovely balconey and the pool area was nice and sunny with lots of tables and chairs. One of the best things about the Key Lime Inn is all the available onsite parking. Most places that close to downtown have terrible parking but it was such a breeze for us to park everyday. The staff at the Inn was wonderful (especially Richard) :) We were only two blocks from Duval Street so getting around was great. We also rented a 4-seater golf cart, which I highly recommend for ease of parking while shopping or going to the beach.

Also, if you shut off the loud A/C, you're sure to hear the roosters crowing at 3 a.m. (so much for the \"pro\" above). We had double patio doors out to our private patio area, but there was no screen, so we couldn't leave the doors open all night (there are little critters, including the occasional scorpion, in Key West, folks). Also, only one-third of the patio was paved; the rest was full of dead leaves and stones (not very pretty). The bathroom fan was very noisy, and there was limited space for toiletries.

The pool was lovely, with several lounge chairs. While it does back up right to Truman street, the pool is raised several feet above street level, with a lovely fence and trees, bushes, etc. to block out the direct view from anyone on the street. The inn's location is great, as well. I highly advise anyone staying on the island to rent a bicycle, as cars are simply not necessary. The inn is a few minute bike ride to Duval St., which is one of the main attractions of the island. It might be a bit far of a walk later at night, but you certainly are kept a good distance away from the noise of the nightlife that runs up and down parts of Duval St. Overall, we absolutely loved our stay at the Key Lime Inn.

At least there weren't any shared walls! There are roosters on the property who crow at the crack of dawn and the revving sound of the Harley Davidson's cruising down the street 25 feet away kept us up all night long.

We made our decision after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor and it really paid off for us. The inn is not upscale, but very tidy and the grounds are lovely. Flowers are beautiful. We stayed in a deluxe king room (Number 5) and it was nice. The quality of the room rated 2.5 stars, but don't let that bother you. I am very picky about accommodations and was completely comfortable here. We were initially concerned because the room was in the small building with three other rooms. Our worries were put to rest when we got in the room. There were french doors leading out to a completely fenced in private patio with two chairs and a small table. Apparently, the cute little cottage type rooms that surround the pool don't have the private patio. That is what we were told. The beds were very clean and the housekeeping staff did an amazing job every single day. The location of the inn is on Truman, across the street from a beautiful old Catholic church and minutes from the popular and very busy Duval street downtown. Incredibly convenient location. We walked or rode our bikes everywhere, except when we drove to the boat to go SCUBA diving or when we drove to the airport to take a seaplane to the Dry Tortugas (which was worth every penny and the highlight of our trip!!!). Parking was a breeze at the Key Lime Inn. We always got a spot in the inn's lot. Parking can be a pain in Key West, because many accommodations do not have onsight parking. Why the \"above average\" instead of \"excellent\" review? Well, two small reasons. The first is that while the staff in the office were efficient, they were less than welcoming. Not rude, but far from friendly to us. Secondly, the desk called us twice to park our vehicle \"better.\" We saw absolutely nothing wrong with our parking. We parked straight in the unmarked slots and courteously left room for other cars. We moved the car both times, but firmly decided that if asked again, we wouldn't be happy. These were two small complaints and did not put a damper on the stay. We were able to blow these minor things off and move on. The price of the Key Lime Inn is great for what you get.

We chose to walk much of the time but also found the cab ride down to Mallory Square quick and cost only $2.50/person. The rooms are good. We stayed in a King Deluxe which was actually it's own little cottage by the pool. Our room backed up to Truman which is a very busy street but noise typically does not bother us so it was not a problem. If you are bothered by noise, you will want to request a room away from the street. The property is quite large and I'm sure they can accommodate you. My only complaint about the room was the carpet. It looked quite old and due to the humidity in FL, felt damp to bare feet. I felt I had to wear flip flops while in the room. Other than that, the room was fairly clean and comfortable. The pool area is fantastic. If you've never traveled to Key West, you should know it is not known for it's natural beaches. Everything is manmade so unless you want to hoof it to the beach, you will want a hotel with a nice pool area. A lot of the inns in Key West have small properties and often the pool area is small and shaded. Key Lime Inn has a large area with comfortable lounge chairs. We never made it up for breakfast but our friends said it was sufficient. Nothing fancy but fresh. Other recommendations - if you are looking for a nice dinner, you must eat at Hot Tin Roof. Wonderful food and the views are terrific. Fogarty's on Duval has great sandwiches. Skip Willie T's for dinner - only average food and service was terrible. Great mojito's though. We also took a sunset sail with Danger Cruises. It was fantastic and not your typical \"booze cruise\". This was their Wind & Wine sail which was on a 60' schooner. They limit it to about 25 people and serve nice wine, beer and light appetizers (veggies, cheese, fruit). The crew was terrific and the sunset was just beautiful. I would highly recommend it!

I emailed in advance my request and it was granted. We had a King size bed, mini-fridge, cathedral ceiling with a fan, a nice bathroom and a private patio sitting area that was fenced in. It was #8 on the right hand side. Perfect spot in my opinion. There was slight water damage to one wall from the hurricane, but I'm sure it was being fixed.

I called the Inn on the morning itself of my reservation to inform them that I would have to cancel my reservation. Because they had a 7-day cancellation policy, I was prepared to pay the full-price; but I asked if I could get a refund anyway because of the weather and the guy on the phone was most nice. There wasn't an evacuation notice and he was in no way obliged to give me a refund, but he did anyway. I thought that was extremely considerate. The next time we plan a trip to the Keys (hopefully not during hurricane season!), we'll be sure to book a room with them again!", "Date": "August 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scarsdale, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place\u201d", "Author": "Teri64_11", "ReviewID": "UR3723692", "Content": "Loved this place. I never wanted to stay in a B&B, but found this place to be a little different thatn the average B&B. We stayed in a room that had a fridge and it was located a short walk from the pool. The breakfasts were fine but served as a continental breakfast (toast, bagels muffins, etc) We are not big breakfast eaters, so this was fine. The room was very cute, painted in a light yellow with hard wood floors, a small bathroom with shower stall. We really didn't need the fridge, since we purchased a cooler and used that most of the time. The fridge really didn't keep drinks cold anyway. We used the pool many times and it was never really crowded considering it was on th smaller side. Then again that week they had vacant rooms available. The Inn offers complimentary newspapers every morning and pool towels. It is walking distance into Old town but it is a long walk. We went when it is extremely hot, so try and do your walking early or later in the day. They have great restaurants in the area and really enjoyed our stay. We will definately stay here again.", "Date": "July 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis", "Title": "\u201cPerfect - I really enjoyed my stay at the Key Lime\u201d", "Author": "pb77", "ReviewID": "UR3722780", "Content": "Dont let the 5 rating fool you into thinking this is a 5 star hotel - it's not. But for the money and value I rated it a 5. Key Lime was simply perfect. Two blocks off Duval, quiet, cozy, just a great experience. I enjoyed spending my money on things to do instead of on a room I was hardly in. But while at the Key Lime, I have zero complaints. The pool is nice, the grounds were beautiful, the staff was very friendly, the parking was free and available, the rooms were clean and nicely decorated, the balcony was perfect. I actually requested a poolside room but at check-in was told that they didnt have any available so they put me in the main house second floor. After seeing the room, i was glad. It was big, away from the poolside chatter, and it had a better view of the tropical grounds. In fact, if I return to key west i will probably stay at the key lime again and request the same room, room #9. Listen, if you have never been to key west and you dont understand the layout of the old town, trust me, the key lime is perfect. You are a 10 minute walk from mallory square and a 7 minute walk from the southernmost point. Literally right in the middle of everything but secluded enough to get away from the noise and enjoy some tropical peace and quiet. No u dont have a roomside view of the sunset, but why would you want to watch that from your room? Stay at the key lime, save your money, and watch the sunset with everyone else at mallory square.", "Date": "July 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location and lovely quaint accommodation\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3555681", "Content": "We recently stayed at the Key Lime Inn and were really pleased with the standard of accommodation.

Great room. A little larger, since this is a handicap room. We enjoyed the morning breakfast and paper. I agree with other folks that the breakfast could be a little more varied. Maybe cold cereal, more fruit. But, we liked the muffins ,especially the blueberry muffins. We rented bikes and used them the entire stay. We went to Fort Zachery State Park, good beach.
