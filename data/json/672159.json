{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Basic, simple, economical, adequate There is nothing special about Monte Rio, but also nothing not to recommend it. Adjuntas itself has little to recommend, but it does allow one to get into the mountains quickly and easily, via highway 10 from Ponce. In that regard, it is a good base, or a good starting point. Monte Rio is a block from the Plaza, in a somewhat noisy area. The room is basic but acceptable. They have a pool but nothing else in amenities (a one-station TV and no internet that we found in the city). There are great views of the mountains from the rooms. The hotel has a restaurant that serves a $5 Puerto Rican lunch buffet.There are only two choices around Adjuntas, and for a large distance. This is the less expensive of the two, and is wholly adequate, though basic.", "Date": "Aug 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR106390699", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "bilawing"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g147319-d672159-r8454830-Monte_Rio_Hotel-Puerto_Rico.html", "HotelID": "672159", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
