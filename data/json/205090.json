On arrival at the hotel we were greeted very nicely and our luggage was taken up to our room which was on the first floor and overlooked the front of the hotel. The room was slightly outdated - the bathroom sadly was in need of refurbishment although everything worked satisfactorily. Our filter coffee machine didn't work but we were soon brought Nescafe instant which suited us well. The second day our TV wouldn' turn on and the mini bar wasn't cold which we reported and this was rectified almost immediately. Nothing was too much trouble although of course these hiccups shouldn't really occur in a 4 star hotel. The breakfast room was very comfortable although in my opinion the hot breakfast offerings should be taken away as for the three mornings we were there the food was always cold - such a shame and waste of food. Mushrooms, fried eggs, fried bread, baked beans, bacon, frankfurters and scrambled eggs were all on offer but it was all cold. Everything else offered was extremely good quality, fresh and tinned fruits, cheeses, hams, yogurts, cakes, jams, biscuits and cereals so you wouldn't go hungry. A very nice touch is the Friday evening cocktail party which my husband and I attended - it is from 18.30 and a very nice harpist was playing which was lovelly and relaxing to listen to after a long afternoon of touring around Rome. There were plenty of canapes on offer and we were offer two glasses of wine each so you don't have to have cocktails. All in all a very nice stay in Rome - very convenient for most of the sights. We did the tour bus with the two day ticket which was an excellent way of getting our bearings.

Moving to what was considered a higher end hotel made me realize what a great bargain La Residenza is! At La Residenza I stayed in a suite on the 1st floor. It was very spacious with a sitting room that had doors that could be closed going in to the bedroom. Then there was a very small hallway with a closet that led in to the big bathroom. The decor in the room was somewhat outdated but it was clean and comfortable. The one let down was that this room had no out the windows at all, basically looking at a wall. The staff was great and friendly. For a little more than it would cost to take a taxi, a member of the staff will pick you up from the airport and drive you the almost 30 minutes to the hotel. Our driver carried our luggage and loaded it into the car as well as unloaded it when we got to the hotel and had it sent to our room. He also spoke English well enough to point out some sights along the drive. After such a long flight it was nice not to have to navigate to find a taxi and explain where we wanted to go. Breakfast every morning is included and, with prices in Rome being so expensive, it's a great thing to take advantage of. They had everything you could want in a breakfast and you could have a typical Italian or American meal. Upon request the breakfast room server will make you a fresh cup of cappicino as well. The location is also a plus of this hotel as it was right around the corner from the one I stayed at next on Via Venato. It's an easy walk to the Spanish Steps and the Borghese Gardens.

Near the Villa Borghese park, this part of town was quiet and pretty upscale. The hotel looks fairly recently updated on the ground floor but the rooms look a bit warn. Our double room on the third floor had the most massive bed! I think it was two doubles pushed together and is likely what you get if you ask for a triple (because I'm fairly certain that the couch pulls out). It was mostly full of middle-aged Americans when we were there. The breakfast had a large selection and two waiters. It's included in the cost of the room. I don't have any serious qualms with the place except that it's pretty expensive for what you get. For 220 per night (Euro), I would expect something a bit fancier, but Rome is a pretty expensive city and this is pretty par for the course I'd imagine.

Not in our Book\u201d", "Author": "amyoscar", "ReviewID": "UR118371605", "Content": "My husband and I had such fond memories of La Residenza from our first trip to Rome in the mid-90's. We particularly remembered a large and pleasant breakfast room with an amazing assortment of hot and cold delights. We also remembered gracious staff and special levels of attention paid to the smallest detail. So when our plans called for another visit to Rome we decided to go back. The fact that it was in the top 100 of over 1200 hotels in Rome also made us feel pretty good. We stayed in three star hotels in Naples and Amafi and had wonderful experiences in both so in learning that the hotel now had a fourth star, we thought that we would enjoy the extra pampering and luxury that a four star would bring. What a mistake! After our experience, one has to wonder how often the \"star checkers\" revisit once an additional star is earned. On the plus side, our room, even though it faced the front, was quiet and the extra wooden shutters helped to keep out the morning sun. What shall we say about the desk staff? While one of the individuals with whom we interacted were helpful and pleasant, that was not the norm. We would characterize their attitudes as ranging from pompous and annoying to downright rude. From no one helping us bring our luggage up the flight of stairs at their entrance, to questions being answered with a sneer and condescension, this part of the hotel was the worst 4 star experience we had ever had. We don't blame the hotel for having a \"lap dance\" establishment nearby. You can't control who will be your neighbors but you can most certainly control what happens inside your place. The breakfast experience had also changed greatly since our last trip and not for the better. The room is now much smaller than it used to be since they moved in a large griddle into the room (it used to be out of sight in another room). As a result, the seating is so tight and the tables so close together that guests need to get up from their chair and move out of the way to allow others guests to get to the tables that are in the next row back. On this trip, Rome was our last stop so we were fresh from being treated wonderfully in Naples and Amalfi. Certainly, the first thing that happened when we entered a dining room was that we were greeted and asked what our hot beverage of choice was. Here, you were lucky if you got the attention of one of the serving people, who were so busy talking to each other (in very loud voices) that it was rare that they ever looked at their guests to see if anyone needed anything. The food itself was a shadow of our memories. How can a four star Italian hotel have inedible mozzarella and tomatoes? The eggplant and other \"griddle\" items were so badly done and so tasteless that it was almost laughable. The eggs we requested were OK but the rest of the food was so awful that I was tempted to skip the breakfast (I can't remember the last time THAT happened.) On the plus side, the bread was good (as long as you toasted it) and they did have a nice array of cereals and juices. The rooms look like they are in a bad 70's time warp with broken tiles in the bathroom and one of the worst shower heads we had ever had in a hotel at this price point. Luckily we were able to use the secondary smaller shower head which provided decent pressure but the bathtub was so narrow, you could barely get under that shower head. They even had a price list for the tea fixings in the room. There was no wi-fi connection - just a cable which functioned poorly or not at all. I have never had an internet connection through a cable that only provided one bar of strength. Although we complained a number of times, the front desk shrugged it off and said it wasn't their fault, it was outside the hotel. Don't believe that for a minute. The room was so poorly lit that even the bedside lamps were really more dims than lights. We feel badly for anyone who tried to read a real book with that little light. I-Pad users would not be affected. There were few if any electrical outlets and those that existed were poorly placed for using your computer at the desk. All in all, we were very disappointed and after reading some of the more recent reviews I have to wonder if we were staying at the same hotel?

Without knowing the city of Rome well, we were searching for something safe and in a central location. This hotel met both of our goals, and had a few extra very nice perks. Location: La Residenza is located in a beautiful, upscale neighborhood. Very safe. It is a 5-10 minute walk to both the Trevi fountain and the Spanish Steps. The Colosseum felt like it was a little more than a mile, 20-25 minute walk with traffic. The Train Station was about a 20 minute walk. Manageable with light baggage, but difficult for us with heavy suitcases. The cab drivers wanted 25 Euros, which we declined as we felt it was overpriced. All in all, if you don't mind a little walking, everything we wanted to see was within walking distance. Staff: Friendly and helpful. They provided us with a wonderful little map of the area upon check-in. In addition, they helped secure a taxi ride to the airport that morning, which was 45 Euros. 55 Euros if you wanted a private car. Extra Perks: Here is where the hotel really shined, in our opinion. At 6:30pm they invited all of their guests \"for a drink\", which was actually finger foods with beverage service from the bar. No charge. Very nice setup. The wifi was free. As any traveler knows, this is very handy. The breakfast buffet was absolutely out of this world. Better than the cruise buffet for sure. Beautiful setup, wide display of foods. Fruit and water were also provided to us free of charge in the hotel room. Rooms: The rooms were fine. As an American, we're used to large, upscale rooms. By European standards this was a large room, but by American standards it felt just normal. Clean, wouldn't describe as \"modern\" but was just fine for one day.

Nevertheless, the hotel is only two short blocks from a fancy street in Rome with high-end shops and hotels. It is not too far (ten minutes or so) to walk to the Spanish Steps, but a bit more of a hike to the bulk of Rome's tourist attractions, so we ended up taking taxis when our kids got tired. STAFF: The hotel staff couldn't have been nicer, helped us find our way around Rome, made parking our rental car in front of the hotel quite painless, and took care of arranging a transfer to the airport for us at the end of our stay. COMMON AREAS: The small lobby area was old-fashioned and decorated in an opulent style with red carpeting and expensive draperies. ROOMS/BATHROOMS: The rooms were ample in terms of size (surprisingly, the beds were all very large, with the king bed was even larger than an American-sized king, and our bathrooms were big for by European hotel standards. Both the rooms and bathrooms were clean, but very, very dated. If this hotel got four stars, it had to be at least twenty years ago.

This led me to choose it again on a return trip with another couple. Bad idea - either my memory failed me, or the hotel has gone down in quality in the last 5 years. The lobby is decent - they've replaced some couches with newer ones that seem to be covered in vinyl or pleather - doesn't really go with the rest of the hotel. We checked in early and our rooms weren't available - that was fine, but they they seemed really irritated at having to put up our luggage for an hour until the rooms were available, and when I asked to get back into my luggage after they took it away (I had forgotten to pull out a medication), they made it seem like it was such an impossible chore, I told them just to forget it. Plus, when we checked in, the gentleman at the front desk called someone to check on the status of the rooms, and I missed part of the conversation, but what I did pick up, seemed to imply that our relative youth was playing into the assignment of rooms. When we finally returned to the hotel in the late afternoon, our bags had been delivered to the rooms, but the rooms themselves were a huge disappointment - both were very dark, facing interior walls. The furnishings seem about 20-30 years old, and just sort of tired, linens are on the threadbare side. The bathroom was functional at best. Breakfast buffet had definitely deteriorated - lots of options, none of them very good - everything seemed a little old, a little stale. Generally felt depressing. Luckily we were only there for one night. This is a 3-star hotel, at best. The price was good, but I would happily pay more in the future for a better, friendlier hotel. The charm and warmth of the staff that I remembered from my previous stay had totally vanished, and instead the hotel staff made us feel like it was a chore for them to be there.

I do not know how this rates 4 stars and would never go back. They offer virtually no toiletries so we used our own; they had tiny tea bag little packets of shampoo and some shower caps, nothing more. They did turn down out beds but did not change the towels at night. Towels were pretty thin but less tired than the robes. I guess they list all of their \"amenities\" and have somehow represented they are much better than reality. The breakfast buffet was huge, but though they had three kinds of eggs, none was edible. The boiled eggs were apparently cooked for about 1 minute. On the second day, after having two basically raw eggs crush in my hands I asked if they might be able to cook them until firm and the surly waitress said I could have a fried egg from the buffet if I wanted something different. The fried eggs and the scrambled sat on a heating element that, even at 7 am, just after they opened, had them all dried out and turned a nasty orange color. They offer juice, but it is sour, canned type of orange juice. There are loads of pastries though the couple we tried seemed stale, too. We had yogurt and fresh fruit with granola which were all good and limited breakfast to that. Other than the waitress, the staff was very pleasant and it was a quiet place, especially in our room on the back. Not so sure about the rooms on the street as there are two lap dance businesses across the street on the otherwise quiet block.

The pasta was uncooked, not \"al dente\" or just a little chewy, but uncooked meaning when you chew on it you can taste the bits of flour as if you are eating raw pasta.

Like most hotels in this area a bidet was also in the bathroom. On Fridays they have a complimentary cocktail party at 6:30 pm for all their guests. We had a blast and met many wonderful people, drank wonderful wines, and liquers and had some great snacks. Breakfast was included also in the cost of our room, and we took advantage of the wonderful buffet spread in the mornings. Everything from American items, plus they would cook eggs to order, to cold meats, fruits, traditional european items, cereals, and the best fresh baked breads and pastries. Coffee was served along with a variety of juices, teas and of course water. While this hotel does have two gentlemens clubs, one at each corner across the street, we didn't notice any noise or have any problems. This location was ideal for us . There was a bank ATM just across the main street, a cafe at the corner, a tabacchi ( tobacco shop) just two minutes away for cigs, stamps, etc... , an internet cafe is only 5 minutes away with really great rates, there are also a few nice restaurants within 5 to 10 minutes walking at a leasurely pace. The subways are also within walking distance and you could catch a bus at the corner of the street. We felt very safe at night. ALL of the sightsa are within walking distance and very accessable, however Rome is built on a hill so it is a bit like San francisco with cobble stone streets, so I would suggest comfortable shoes. At one point we had a problem with a credit card at a restaurant, we told the concierge at La Residenza and he was able to straighten it out for us. It was well appreciated. Trevi fountain, Spanish steps, Plaza Navarona, Pantheon and more are only a 10 to 15 minute walk from hotel. Cab fare to and from Termani station is about 15 euros depending on luggage.

I wanted to visit, but they wouldn't let us in, even with American passports. I told the man that I wished to see what my taxes were paying for. He chuckled, and in good humor replied: \"Write your congressman.\" Throughout Rome, the churches at night are spectacular (and warm), filled with people singing. The services were beautiful. There is so much to see and do while in Rome! It was even fun \"grocery\" shopping; the stores are so small. And everything in Rome is expensive! People's homes are really beautiful - the entrances, the front gates, the stairway, the decor. We walked and walked. The alleys; cobblestone streets; endless churches; nuns in habits (hadn't seen that in years); the Vatican. Viewing The Pieta nearly brought me to tears seeing the resignation on the Madonna's face.

The doorman/desk clerk was very nice, and got us checked in with ease, but was often clueless as to recommendations for restaurants, or even places to cash a traveller's cheque. Of course, they could not or would not cash a check or change any money, and perhaps that is too much to expect for a small hotel. The location is quite good, just a block from Via Veneto. There are two lap-dance clubs across the street, but noise was minimal. We did see rats running around a trash can at the street corner the hotel borders. We never saw any others throughout Rome. The title of this review comes from a general attitude we found among many of the employees. We had hired private guides, and they were told in a rather nasty manner that NO, they could not wait in the lobby for us (they gave our names to the front desk by way of identification), but they would have to wait outside. NO, the front desk would not call and let us know that the guide had arrived. The worst of the \"NO's\" came from a young man I'll refer to as the \"Breakfast Nazi\". It was his mission in life to ensure that nothing left his breakfast room. We wanted to eat our breakfast on the little porch (that has two tables set for four) at the front of the hotel. \"NO, you cannot take food out there!\" was the refrain. Could we take coffee out there? \"Only if you bring back the cup!\" Just the kind of treatment I enjoy in the morning. I cannot in all good conscience recommend this hotel. It is a fairly good value given its location, but the unpleasantries ruined that advantage for us.", "Date": "August 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cloved the breakfast\u201d", "Author": "laura818", "ReviewID": "UR8406473", "Content": "We stayed one night here and loved everything.

Pleased with choice and would stay again/tell friends - hotel built around 1930's and has traditional frontage, lovely lobby and ground floor. Booked a junior suite as good rate from Expedia. Huge bedroom/sitting room and balcony (see photos). Very clean. Very large bed that was essential after tiring day sightseeing. Bathroom large with shower/tub enclosed by sliding doors. Shower central over bath. Plenty of hot water, but shower head not very adjustable (small point but easy to improve). A kettle was available in the room - but note the tea bags and coffee will be chargeable to the mini bar so take your own! (about 50p a tea bag.) Hotel staff very friendly (including the cleaning staff) and helpful, and spoke very good english, but dont let that stop you from trying your italian out. Received basket of fruit in room on return from sightseeing. Breakfast was a delight in the lower ground floor. Plenty of variety of hot/cold food (cooked to order as well) from about 6.45 am and extremely pleasant staff. They also will get you piping hot water for tea if you ask!! Hotel situated in a small side street just off Via Veneto, 10 minutes walk to Borghese park, 10 minutes walk to Spanish steps, 20 minutes walk to Trevi fountain, a leisurely 30min walk to the Colleseum. It is about 20 minutes walk uphill from the train/bus Terminus to the hotel, so would recommend taxi if you have luggage. (Note: The Easyjet ATS airport taxi transfer was good value and quick.). The via veneto is just round the corner with its multitude of restaurants - excellent food and service, but the prices are not cheap - 70 euros upwards for a 3 course meal. The Piazza Barberini is a 5 minute walk from the hotel - (use the steps on the right as you come out of the hotel) - it is a good shortcut where you can catch the hop-on Rome tourist bus 110 (all day ticket - not cheap but great for seeing all the sites with a commentary). Also you can get a bus from here to drop you by the Vatican museuem sfrom here (I think it was the 492). The Vatican is a long walk away from the hotel. Also at Barberini is the metro - I would not reccomend using the metro - was dark, dirty, grafitti and beggars. Rome is built for walking around! When researching this hotel came across a review which mentioned dubious clubs and the like in the area. To give a balanced view - yes there is a \"gentlemans private club\" along the street (see photo), and others round the other hotels in this area, but they all appear to be located in basement areas with closed doors or secure entry.

There are three banks in equal walking distance with cash machines, a street flower vendor, magazine stalls and a taxi rank. Caf\u00e9s can be found also in the same general location which bustle at night. The Hotel has a very 1940\u2019s/1950\u2019s feel to the d\u00e9cor which adds to the charm, since for us staying in modern and bland rooms is a negative. The air conditioning is ok to good (depending on the room), bathrooms small but very well equipped. The Hotel has limited parking and as a result allow a little extra time to manoeuvre your car out. There is also a nearby sandwich bar for evening snacks. The Hotel also has a list of private drivers you can hire if you are planning a trip outside of Rome. This is just simply a marvellous hotel with marvellous staff, at affordable rates in an excellent location.", "Date": "January 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charleston, SC", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "travlibe", "ReviewID": "UR2971629", "Content": "We stayed here for one night because our first choice was not available at the last minute and we booked in desperation.

Definitely the best thing about this hotel is its buffet breakfast, which is enormous compared to other European hotels, but still average versus American buffets. Considering the price (approx 240USD) and rating (4 star), you would expect a top flight hotel all around. but the biggest drawback was the size of the room. While nicely decorated, it was the size of a sandbox. My wife and i had to tiptoe around each other or walk along the beds to avoid running each other over. We did have a balcony which was useless because it was faced the side of a building and was small (of course) and dirty. That being said, you're probably not going to spend alot of time in your room in Rome, as you will be out and about seeing the sites, so if you're willing to overlook these minor irritations, you should fare fine. The hotel is centrally located near restaurants, internet cafe, and a few shops, and a 10 minute walk from the Spanish Steps. The staff was very friendly and the busboy was helpful in providing nightlife tips. They were also very prompt in addressing special requests. I'm probably reiterating what alot of other people are posting, but one tidbit no one mentioned which might affect a family with kids is that there are 2 \"gentleman\" clubs directly across the street. They're pretty private in that there are no rowdy crowds, but there's always a couple of guys hanging ouside of \"Chica Chica Boom Boom\" trying to get you to venture in. In summary, the hotel served its purpose for our needs in Rome, but its nothing to write home about.", "Date": "November 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cReasonable value, mediocre location\u201d", "Author": "talkingstick", "ReviewID": "UR2623755", "Content": "We stayed for 3 nights in September 2004.
