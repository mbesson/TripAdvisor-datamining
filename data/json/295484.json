Last visit this oct 2011 and were horrified by room we were given, toilet hadnt been flushed let alone cleaned. Room filthy. Dont be conned into paying bill first which they insist until you have seen room. My advice dont waste precious time and energy even going there. Very sad as it had been a great hotel many years ago.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "heymiami", "Title": "\u201camazing hotel with a great view\u201d", "Author": "heymiami", "ReviewID": "UR51754091", "Content": "i looked at the reviews they have put before me and i wasnt sure it was the same hotel we were talking about . i think they had a new management and redone in the hotel . the rooms were great with plasma TV and a greatest view in istanbul. people were great and helping me all the time. it was a great time we all had and defenetly will go there once again .", "Date": "December 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cFilthy\u201d", "Author": "nammarine69", "ReviewID": "UR35350215", "Content": "We stayed there only because I got sick and needed a place immediately to get in and rest before we moved on. The place had not seen a cleaning rag in years. The rooms were large. It had a great view of the bay and one employee went out of his way to see we were comfortable, the rest acted like they had a chip on their shoulder.

It is very old. One member of the reception staff was great, very helpful, polite and professional, but others were not so. My \"room\" was extremely spacious, I could choose among four different beds in 3 rooms. The entire hotel was dirty and sloppy. Most of the time it didn't have warm water, ants were all over the place. My view was nice, but extremely noisy since the 4 line traffic 3 m under my window didn't stop until 3 am and begun again at 5 am. The furniture was old and shabby. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "May 29, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Eysan Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d295484-Reviews-Eysan_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$50 - $90*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Rihtim Caddesi 26</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Kadik&Atilde;&para;y</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "295484", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/c0/6f/a6/eysan-hotel-thumbnail.jpg"}}
