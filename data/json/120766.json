This was one of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had. Here is why: *(This review is a bit long. I have tried to be comprehensive so that you can make your own educated decision not to stay at this hotel). First, this hotel was extremely dirty. The bathroom was dirty,the sink area had red stuff on the sink, wall, and on the hair dryer. The fact that it was on also on the hand towel but not a permanent stain led us to believe the towels had been not changed. Many things were just dirty or sticky. The bed was disgusting. It had brown stains running down the sides of the box spring, looked like vomit or blood. Honestly I didn't want to know. Second, the bed was very uncomfortable, there were only two pillows and no extra blankets. The blanket had lots of hair on it. No toiletries were provided, the TV wasn't hooked up to the cable and once I got it working it had lines running the picture. Internet was terribly slow. Third, the room had a bad smell and it sounded like water was dripping through the wall. Regulating the temperature was very difficult. The carpet and arm chair had stains. A few positives. The staff was polite when we checked in and the gentleman who was driving the shuttle van to the airport was friendly. *Given the fact that the circumstances of my stay were less than optimal, I have tried to be as objective as possible in my review. Bottom line. Don't stay here. Just don't. There are far better hotels in the vicinity for the same price. Safe travels! A secondary point--My wife and I stayed here the night before a 6 am flight since we live far from the airport. We wanted to take advantage of the park and ride service which allows you to park free at the hotel while you are gone. Upon arriving and inquiring about the shuttle, we found that it starts running at 4am and stops running at 10pm. They had changed it since the last time we had used the service and since our return flight came in at 10:30pm, we were forced to take a taxi back tot he airport. It seems a bit odd that the shuttle will start as early as 4 but stop at 10 but I guess I can't really complain about that, I could have checked that before I booked.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa", "Title": "\u201cNot very good\u201d", "Author": "bay192003", "ReviewID": "UR125462195", "Content": "Hotel was somewhat dirty and rooms very dated.

Card key reader to outer door was broken, so had to walk around to the lobby in very, very cold weather. Main disappointment was the breakfast - maybe I've been spoiled by other chains, but the breakfast room was so large and newly done, I thought surely the food would be comparable. Otis Spunkmeyer packaged muffins, some oranges and apples were the total items. Plus side was a good choice of coffee and creamers, available all day.

No apartments to be found who were willing to sign such a short-term lease. The weekly rate was very reasonable for an efficiency with a queen-size bed, so he booked a second room - 1 bedroom King for his parents for two nights, so we could help him settle in. For the price, I anticipated that the hotel would be rather worn and perhaps \"scary\", but I was pleasantly surprised. The lobby area was clean and well-lit. The front desk staff was friendly and very helpful with suggestions for where to eat, buy groceries, etc. The breakfast was light- packaged muffins, whole fruit, coffee and juice- but good quality. The rooms were clean, but furniture and carpet were worn- not surprising at this price point. The other guests seemed to include a church youth group (very polite), many temporary workers who went to bed early and left early in the morning, and some families on vacation. Although the walls are not particularly well-insulated, the other guests were very quiet, so noise was not a problem. The bed was very comfortable; mattress seemed new, and linens were clean. Pool was clean and pleasant. Fitness room small, but with good equipment- treadmill, stair climber. Guest laundry on-site. For about half the price of the newer extended stay hotels, I would say it is an excellent value.

First problem upon arrival was that the desk clerk tried to overcharge. Fortunately I had a reservation printout showing the agreed upon rate. The deal-breaker problem was that the room was swealtering hot with broken AC - unlivable on this 95 degree day - and no other rooms were available. Things went downhill fast when the teenaged solo deskclerk contacted property manager, Michelle Mouser, by phone and allowed me to speak to her. After whining to me about her current physical ailments, Ms. Mouser volunteered her overwhelmed desk clerk to find alternative accomodations for us. The result was a smoking room with one bed. Thank you very little. After making literally dozens of phone calls my son and I were finally able to secure a room at the Hilton Garden Inn, paying almost triple what I had agreed to pay for the Extended Stay Deluxe accomodations, but at least we had livable conditions and were able to enjoy the 500. BTW, I also had tix to the night before the 500 races at IRP and we couldn't go due to having to the mess created by Extended Stay Deluxe. The Extended Stay property manager, Ms. Michelle Mouser, demonstrated her complete incompetance in handling this situation and Rachel, the pathetic child she left in charge of the hotel on arguably the busiest weekend of the year, appeared incapable of managing her own Facebook page, nevermind an entire hotel. Mr. Jeff Orme, presumably Area or District manager, you and your staff owe my son and I a tremendous apology, and you sir, have a big problem with the staff at this establishment.

We were in town for the Indy 500. Sleep Inn Airport had canceled our confirmed reservations and didn't tell us until we got there. No apology of any sort. Sleep Inn sent us to Days Hotel, but at 5 am on race day, our room leaked water from the ceiling and the lights shorted out. Scary. We were already unhappy because Sleep Inn sent us to Days Hotel (same owner)-- and staff's response at Days Hotel was \"This is not our problem.\" One employee, who called herself \"management\" at Days, actually argued with us when we had the nerve to voice our complaints. This happened every time we talked to her. Atrocious. Rude. Unbelievable. My husband noticed that there was an Extended Stay Deluxe Hotel nearby. Luckily, after the race, many people checked out of their hotels, and Extended Stay Deluxe had a room for us. The person at the front desk at Extended Stay was friendly and helpful. She explained in advance that we would not be seeing housekeeping because of our short stay (no problem for us), but said if there was anything we needed, to let her know. The only thing we needed was a refill for a coffee packet. It was given to us with pleasure. What a difference from the first 2 motels. The front-desk person at Extended Stay was apologizing to us for things that weren't even Extended Stay's fault!!!! (She gave us directions to an ice-cream shop, but when we got there, they had just closed for the evening. We found another shop that was open). It was our own fault; we took our time getting there and it was after 10 pm by then. We cheerfully told her about our adventures and she apologized profusely!!!! We were cracking up-- she was apologizing, and it wasn't even her fault!!! (As opposed to the other 2 motels, where apparently the motel's mistakes are the customer's fault.) The front-desk person at Extended Stay had a big smile and helpful attitude every time we walked through the lobby. THAT is how you treat customers (instead of saying, \"not my problem,\" \"come back later,\" etc). It doesn't matter if it's a one-star motel or a five-star hotel; a smile is free, and it does wonders for the customer. Granted, we didn't have any problems at Extended Stay Deluxe, so I can't comment on how a problem would have been handled. However, it is a good sign in and of itself that there were no problems. The welcoming atmosphere at Extended Stay made us forget the disasters of the previous 24 hours at the other 2 motels. When we left for the airport at 4:30 am two days later, there was even some coffee and breakfast items in the complimentary-breakfast room--and breakfast wasn't officially even scheduled to start yet.

But though I checked in around 3:00 they were \"out of single rooms\". Unlikely but I was tired and didn't feel like looking elsewhere. The hotel itself is tucked away in an odd place. It actually sits back behind some office buildings and across a weird parking lot so its easy to miss. But the weirdest thing about this hotel is that if feels like you're staying in government subsidized housing. Perhaps its the economy, but the clientele were a little scary. In fact, upon first entering the back of the hotel (where my room was and where I parked) and getting on the elevator, I was immediately hit with the smell of pot. And as I walked down the halls I heard yelling coming from several of the rooms. Later, after coming back from dinner, I noticed a police officer leaving the hotel and saw a strange man with a glare on his face sitting in the lobby.

I also liked the idea that it was a suite with kitchenette. Because this is an extended stay property, there is limited staff on hand. There is no daily housekeeping service, but you can exchange towels at the front desk if necessary. The property is in an industrial area, so there is nothing within walking distance except a Waffle House, a gas station/convenience store and a Schlotsky's deli. There is a continental breakfast of sorts, mostly coffee juice, fresh fruit and some pre-packaged muffins. They call it a \"gourmet coffee bar\". Nice for a snack to get started. Overall impression of the room was that although it was clean, it is time for an upgrade to the entire room. The kitchenette has a refrigerator, two burner cooktop, dishwasher, mini microwave, and coffee maker. The dishes are old and need to be replaced, especially the cups. They were plastic and chipped from wear. The living area had a couch and one leather recliner. The couch upholstery and the carpet were both stained and worn which really made the entire room look old. The closet is just a niche in the wall- no enclosure. The bathroom is only big enough for the toilet and shower, so the sink and vanity are in the sleeping area. It was clean, but the grout and fixtures need a good scrubbing. On the plus side, the shower was very strong, the towels were newer and the tub area seemed to be recently renovated. We had two doubles which made the sleeping area very crowded. You could only get in on one side of each bed because one side was up against the wall, which made it very difficult to make the beds, even just to pull up the comforter. The sheets came off the edge of the bed every time I rolled over because the elastic was worn, but the pillows and sheets were clean and the bed was reasonably comfortable.
