The location couldn't be any closer to the main sites of the old town. You literally look over the Blue Mosque whilst having breakfast on the rooftop terrace. Of course, with any central location comes noise so bring some ear plugs if you are a light sleeper, but I quite like getting woken by the call to prayer. I had a double room to myself, which was great. The bed was very comfortable. However, I can see two people finding it small, especially if staying for several days, so you would have to stay organised. The bathroom is small and clean, with a great shower. It's only a small hotel, with perhaps 16 rooms in total, which means you do feel you are getting a very good personal service from the staff. They will even lend you a travelcard for the tram! The hotel has lovely decoration, is clean and is well maintained, but like any hotel it has wear and tear. The buffet breakfast was good and certainly set you up for the day. However, the food seems to be great everywhere in Istanbul. Overall, this is a great little hotel with lots of character and great staff.

We had the hotel send the passports to the Nomade Hotel and the Nomade Hotel was so understanding. They paid the shipping fee for us and kept the passports safe until we arrived a couple days later. The location simply cant be beat if you are wanting to hit up the main attractions in a small amount of time. It is literally a stones throw away from the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia - as well as the Basillica Cistern.

Yes, it is not inexpensive (eating in the Old City is cheap, but sleeping there will be your biggest expense), but the location simply could not be better. This hotel is on a leafy street only 1 block back from the tram line, Blue Mosque, Aya Sofya, and Hippodrome. If you walk along the tram line north for 5 minutes you will be at the entrance to the Grand Bazaar, follow it south for 5 minutes and you are at the entrance to Topkapi Palace and gardens. Take the tram down the hill (east) and you will be at the train and ferry terminals in 10 minutes. As you may know, the ferry terminals are where you will find the Bosphorus Cruise boats (e.g., Turyol cruises) and the vendors that sell fresh fish sandwiches directly from the boats. Across the tram line and street from the docks are the Yeni Camii/New Mosque, the Pet Market, and the Spice Market. As convenient as this sounds, a lot of hotels can boast the same if you stay around Sultanahmet Square, however Nomade offers an excellent boutique hotel experience with small but perfectly formed rooms on one of the most charming streets in this highly touristed area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is rare. See photos for what our room looked like. Outside our windows we could look down onto the street where 3-4 attractive restaurants had their outside seating. We ate at one of these (Cafe Adonin) and had an excellent if slightly overpriced meal. Some things to know: (1) If you are on the street facing side of the hotel, these restaurants can be loud and if you require absolute quiet, this means you will not be able to sleep with your windows open, although rooms have air conditioning. I think this is probably true for all the area hotels given how popular the district is with tourists and Turks alike. (2) The terrace is lovely, but the portion with the view has little-to-no shade so you will be sitting in direct sun to enjoy it. The view is so nice (see pics) that we did this each day, but very few of our fellow guests seemed to be willing to do the same. (3) It is probably best to tell your taxi driver Sultanahmet Square instead of the hotel name as the taxis we used did not know it. Print yourself a Google map before you leave home getting you from the Hippodrome in Sultahnamet Square to the hotel. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll only need to use this when you first get there and have no clue where things are, after that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very easy.

An extensive breakfast is served on the terrace in the morning and the terrace is open in the afternoon and evening as a cafe. The only small drawback to the hotel was the small bathroom in the room.

The location is perfect for sightseeing as you are within easy walking distance of the Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace and the Grand Bazaar. There are lots of restaurants nearby so basically all of your needs are just steps away. The hotel has a wonderful roof terrace with great views of the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia. It's a great spot to enjoy your breakfast and an evening drink after a long day of sightseeing. The common areas of the hotel are very stylishly decorated but could perhaps do with a fresh coat of paint here and there. There is a small elevator however you still need to navigate a narrow winding staircase to get to the terrace and again to street level so travellers who have difficulty with stairs may want to take this into consideration before choosing this hotel. We stayed in Room 404 and found it to be very clean and comfortable. The bathroom was on the small side, but the shower worked great and the hot water and towels were plentiful. Our room was right next to the elevator and staircase and although we did not find it a problem, lighter sleepers may find the noise from these disturbing at times. Our only problem with the room was the floorboards outside the bathroom which felt in need of some reinforcing supports (a little too springy for comfort). This was a bit unnerving at times. We found the staff to be very pleasant and very professional. They arranged for very efficient transfers from/to the airport (including a very early morning transfer) for a reasonable fee. We appreciated having this service available to us. Overall, we would recommend this stylish little hotel to others.

The bed was comfortable. The \"bathroom\" is small beyond belief and there is black mould in the shower. Because of the large glass shelf over the sink, shaving was very difficult. Washing of any sort was tricky. Breakfast was fine and the roof terrace gave spectacular views over the city. We used the hotel owned restaurant across the road once only and found it rather expensive for a very average meal.

On the downside, the walls are thin and you do hear people walking up the staircase from time to time, but I didn't have any problems with it. My room was cleaned every morning and everything worked fine (the A/C and TV were perfect). Yes the rooms are a tight squeeze and so is the bathroom, but this is very common for Istanbul (or even say NYC or London). The people who complain about this place have no idea how much worse off it could be. All my other hotels in Turkey were disasterous by comparison to this place.

The rooms however, are very small and are showing their wear as the paint is damaged, walls are bruised, and baseboards are coming off. The bathrooms are tiny and have no ventilation system. Consequently, the showers are mouldy. The bathroom door in room 103 opens just 15 inches and one needs to slink into the bathroom to avoid hitting one's head.
