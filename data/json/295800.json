We booked this hotel because we wanted to be close to beyoglu/taksim and this was the cheapest option I could find ($145/night for a triple room). I didn't expect much given the price, but boy were we surprised! The hotel is off a small side street from Istikal street which was perfect for us. Istikal street and all the action is within a short 2 min walk from the hotel but being in a side street helped keep the noise away at night. The room we stayed in appeared recently refurbished. I've stayed in hundreds of hotels (as a tourist and business traveller), but never seen anything nearly as modern as the Troya room. Everything was touch screen (switches, a/c control, etc) including the elevator buttons. TV was LCD. Bathroom was fabulous - very clean and modern and with running hot and cold water. Shower had 2 shower heads - one was a pull out/hand held shower and another was an overhead rain shower. Service was excellent. I don't remember the names of the gentlemen at the reception but there were two - one in the day shift and another in the evening shift. The day shift guy was especially helpful and both speak excellent English. General guidelines - 1. My buddies arrived before me and took a cab from the airport to the hotel. It cost them 45 lira. I took Havas bus from the airport to the Taksim square (10 lira) and then a cab from Taksim to the hotel (told the cabbie Tepebashi as he didn't know Troya). The cab cost an additional 10 lira (I think more like 5 but the guy asked for 10). 2. To go to Sultanahmet, you have 3 options - - walk - takes about 30 mins and not really recommended. - take a train to Taksim square and catch another train to Sultanahmet - not recommended but this was the initial option that the reception gave us. - walk to Tophane station (10 min) and then catch a train from there (1.5 lira).

My only word of caution concerns the air conditioning -- when we went, the hotel advertised air conditioning on the website. However, when we arrived, we discovered that the air conditioning was not turned on yet in the rooms (it was on in the lobby) because May was not considered \"air conditioning season.\" It's my understanding that they won't turn the air on until June, no matter how hot it is. Before you reserve, you might want to find out if they plan to have the air conditioning turned on in the rooms during your stay; otherwise, don't expect to sleep too much past sunrise in warm weather, when it starts to get noisy (especially with open windows) and hot.

Don't get me wrong, it's not the Ritz, but it seemed like a way nicer hotel overall than would be indicated by the price. The room was huge (especially as compared to the hotel we stayed at in Sultanahmet) and actually pretty decently furnished, if you can get past the bed covers and drapes, which are a hideous rust-orange color. Luckily you could flip the bed covers over to their inoffensive black lining.

Water pressure in the shower was terrible, but I guess you can't have everything. The staff is very nice. The clincher on this hotel, though, is the location. It's a short block from the shopping, restaurants, and bars of Istiklal Cd., an easy walk north to Taksim Square or south to Tunel, and yet -- this is key -- just far enough away to be QUIET. One night when we were out bar hopping we passed another hotel where we had considered staying, and I thanked my lucky stars we hadn't ended up there -- it was directly on top of one of the liveliest, loudest rows of bars and clubs in Istanbul. When you are planning your trip, this sort of thing is impossible to discern from looking at a map -- some of the side streets off Istiklal Cd. are quiet, and some are lined with bars and raucous crowds that go all night. The great thing about the Troya is that you can walk out your door and be in the heart of the action in two minutes, but when you're ready to come home and sleep, you can do so in peace. The only thing I can really complain about is the wireless internet. It sucked. Slow as molasses when it was working, and frequently down. Oh well.

It will take you five minutes of walking to reach the Istical Cad., with its tram, all of its shops and restaurants; and another fifteen to walk to the Taksim Square itself. Upon arrival, I was given a single room which provided an OK standard - with a pleasant enough bathroom. The windows faced an inward shaft, with windows from the opposite side very close. The only solution was to close the curtains, and in such a small room you then soon start to feel pretty cramped. The air-condition, although in working order, never managed to lower the temperature below about 23 Celsius; which was way to hot for me. I asked for a better situated and larger room - ufortunately, one was not available until the next day. This upgrade added about USD 35 pr night to my prepaid bill. The new room was much larger, and had street facing windows, which came as a relief (although the street noise was considerable). Like in so many Southern European and Middle East countries, The Turks honk their car horns violently - at any hour and in any given situation. Bring your earplugs! The TV had mostly Turkish channels (including CNN Turk), an English movie channel(dubbed), and BBC World. The telephone worked, but made no ringing signal when a call was connected to the room. Staff would come running, telling me that I had a call. Breakfast was included in my rate, and was rather basic in my opinion: Hard boiled eggs, some fruit, bread, honey, jam and some cheese, coffee\\tea and preserved juice. Not bad, but \"rich\" (as the hotel states on their internet site), is a bit of an exaggeration. The breakfast lounge is nice. The hotel itself looks somewhat worn, with lots of brown colored panels and fabrics. It seemed reasonably clean. The staff was friendly enough, about half of them speaking English to a level where you could make yourself well understood. They arrange for airport shuttle bus, which is a nice touch. All in all : \"Troya\" isn't a bad hotel, but if you're looking for a very relaxed and luxurious stay, it probably isn't the place to be. On the other hand, it's inexpensive. Some final points: - Consider where your interest lies - if they involve mostly history, mosques and culture, the Sulthanamet area would be a good place to look into. On the other side, if shopping and restaurants is more you preference, the Taksim \\ Istical cadessi area seems to have the better selection. - Bring your earplugs - Get a good map (Istanbul streets can be confusing). The \"Freemaps\" which can be found at restaurants are fine. The ones given out at the hotel aren't nearly good enough. - Be prepared for intense traffic and crowded streets...
