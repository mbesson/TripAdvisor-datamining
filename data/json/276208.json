Do not be fooled by the reception area as the rest of the hotel isnt like it! This is a very basic poor hostel and not a hotel. Our twin room and private facilities were very small and shabby. The beds were uncomfortable and the pillows were non existent.The curtain did not close properly. We did ask for an upgrade but were told that this was as good as it gets. The reception staff were very unhelpful and were unable to offer advice and help about the area the hotel was in. 1 young lady pointed out the hotel on the map to us in the wrong location. There were four locks on the inside of the door which left us a bit nervous as to the necessity for this. There was also a huge crack in the shower tray.

For those without their own computer, we were able to use the computers at the Cecil's sister hotel next door.

Definitely avoid walking in the direction behind the hotel - there is really no reason to anyway and if you need to get the Grey Hound which is in that direction, get the bus on the corner (the hotel will give you details).

I do not have high expectations as in my view i am there to see the city. We had some bad experiences with other places being falsely advertised or in bad neighborhoods with little assistance for staff sitting happily behind a desk. Here however, it ticked our boxes. YES- they do have shared bathrooms. I was NOT keen on this but we were running low on money and it was towards the end of a very long journey so the price was the most important factor. Even though i had been nervous, we actually had a great experience. They gave us a room on a quiet floor down a quiet corridor meaning i dont think anyone else actually used the bathroom that was consistantly clean. Also, as many have mentioned, the entrance and lobby are beautiful, though it doesnt reflect the rooms, it is a very nice welcome and very comfortable if you are down waiting for your laundry to finish, the laundry is very reasonably priced too. They also have free wifi. Our room itself was just a double bed and a sink, with a bedside locker, lamp, approx. 36 inch tv (not flat screen but what-evs) and some dresser drawers. Staff were friendly enough to us and helped us when we had problems or questions and have leaflets on everything. This is NOT a 4 or 5 star hotel but if you are considering it then i presume you are on a budget like we were. the price for us could not be beaten and though the area of LA itself is not 100% safe, it is close to transport and we as two 21 year old girls didnt have an issue.

That being said, I really liked this hotel! I have stayed at other hostels in Ecuador and Chicago, but this was, by far, the best one. The lobby of the hotel is very nice as can be seen from several pics on here. The hotel staff was very friendly, and they were bilingual (English and Spanish). They even practiced with me as I tried my Spanish a bit. I reserved a queen bed with a bathroom for four nights ($69 a night with 4th night free), and for a place that I considered to be a hostel, it was great. The bed was a nice size and comfy, the closet was sufficient, the dresser had plenty of room for my clothes, and the bathroom was clean and filled with all my necessities. I didn't much care for only having a fan, but I know this is typical in LA. I liked being able to open the window to get a good breeze while I snoozed, but this was also a drawback because it was really noisy in the morning. Sirens usually woke me up before the alarm. Like I said, the bathroom was neat and had all my necessities. One of my worst fears is having to sleep in a place with ROACHES! UGH! Luckily, I never saw one in this hotel, and I looked every day when I entered that bathroom. Do not expect to take a bath, though, because they have it set up so that you cannot do so. I also paid attention to the shared bathrooms, and honestly, they didn't look that bad. Both the toilet and shower were in separate rooms that were singles. It's like they converted broom closets into one shower and one bathroom. Just take your stuff with you, and you're all set. They also looked very clean as I saw cleaning staff on the floors every morning. As for Internet access, this can only be accessed in the lobby and the coffee shop, which only has access to Stay's router. The Cecil's access is open, but Stay needs a password, which is \"stayh0tel\". Notice that the \"o\" in hotel is actually a zero. People mentioned how they noticed that some of the same people could be seen out front every day and night. Well, come to find out, they live there! I talked to one of the guys, who actually lives on one of the top floors and has been there for years. He just pays rent. There is no parking for the hotel, but you can pay a daily rate at plenty of local lots that are not too expensive. I'm used to paying $20 or more a day in big cities like Chicago. You might be able to get away with $7 to $10 a day here. TIP: If you are staying here on the weekend. Look for free street parking at the meters. Just make sure to read the signs because many of them say no parking between 2am and 5am. Take a chance and park in the Fashion District one block behind the Hotel like I did. I had free parking all weekend. Overall, this hotel is great for the budget-minded and those that want to meet other people from different countries because there were a lot of international travelers there.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Casa Grande, AZ", "Title": "\u201cOH HECK NO!!\u201d", "Author": "Shannon K", "ReviewID": "UR116771192", "Content": "We attempted to cancel all three nights originally scheduled online but I was advised that we had to give 48 hrs notice so we were only able to cancel 2 of the nights. For starters, the decision to cancel was after reading numerous bad reviews about staying at the Cecil. Such as no a/c in the room, no electrical outlets in the rooms, unresponsive staff to the needs of their customers, vagrants roaming inside the building and a stabbing on the 5th floor. (googled the hotel and most of this information was on tripadvisor.com) Also, when I called on 2 separate occasions speaking to 2 separate people they were both less then cordial. Now we intended on staying the 1 night we could not cancel to \u201ctry it out for ourselves\u201d but after driving 6 LONG hours when we arrived at the Cecil at 1 am we were extremely disappointed and horrified by the surroundings. Police on every corner, people living in tents, sleeping bags, drug dealers and hookers not what you want to impress upon two teenage girls who were traveling with us for vacation. We expected to see some things but not to this degree. After exiting the interstate and driving past the hotel (with everyone terrified) we continued on and ended up staying at another hotel spending additional money and losing the money paid to the Cecil. I am sure the interior (from what I saw when we drove by of the entrance) is elegant but also per the reviews \u201cdon\u2019t let the lobby fool you\u201d we could not chance staying there and trusting that our vehicle would be safe when you have to park off site and walk to the hotel.

They gave me one but it was no better. The handbasin was IN the shower recess but at least had my own toilet. The fan though only worked when the light switch was on which wouldnt have been good for sleeping all thru the night. So I rang down to see if there was another room I could have but while I was talking to them the cord fell out from the handset so I went down in the very slow lift to the desk to talk directly to them. They gave me my third room and I kept my fingers crossed. BUT the power point was too loose to hold my cell phone charger in & it kept falling out. No chair to sit on. The fan worked but only on one speed (full on) and as the room is so small there wasnt any space to move the bed out a bit so I slept (?) with a sheet covering me to try to ease the blast of the fan. Weird cos this was the middle of summer. So in the morning I said I wasnt staying for the other 2 nights I'd paid for and asked for a refund but they said as I'd booked thru Expedia I would have to ask them.

I will admit that some of the reviews on here left us a little nervous about arriving at the Cecil late at night (11pm) with two suitcases and several hundred dollars in US cash. Our fear quickly became the subject of self-ridicule as the ten minute walk from the 7th St. Metro Station seemed as safe and uneventful as any such stroll in any large US city. A few sleeping bag-toting individuals slept in crevices and alleyways, but nothing out of the ordinary or of a threatening nature. The Cecil's principal highpoint is the location: Downtown LA. Downtown's central location in the city makes it a great base point for commuting to all of the greater Los Angeles area's points of interest. There are numerous local bus routes that service the area around the hotel and at least two (maybe more) Rapid bus stops within extreme proximity to the Cecil: the 720 to Santa Monica and the 733 to Venice Beach (this one literally stops outside of the Cecil's front door). The Cecil is also within a 10 minute walk from the 7th St Metro Center Station (Red Line + Blue Line (useful if coming from LAX)), as well as about an 8 minute walk from Pershing Square Red Line Subway Station. The Cecil is also walking distance to many of Downtown LA's local attractions. There is a 24 hour mini grocery/convenience within a five minute walk (west on 6th I think it was) as well as a Rite Aid and Walgreens west on 7th. While I did not rent a vehicle during my stay, I did notice plenty of private parking lots within close proximity of the Cecil (which does not have its own car lot). Hotel: The lobby of Hotel Cecil is probably the most stunning part of the physical building: it has a classic appeal with shiny marble floors, bright chandeliers, gold trim, and tasteful statues. This could easily be the lobby of a 4 or 5 star resort. The Cecil houses a coffee shop with patio (supplied with some basic toiletries and such), as well as a mid-deck business-type lounge (usually littered with technology abusers taking advantage of the free wireless internet). Hotel staff were friendly and helpful, and an armed night guard guarantees the safety of both patrons and staff. The Cecil supplies guests with basic hygiene amenities (soap, conditioning shampoo, lotion, toilet paper) and hairdryers (which I did have to request, but was delivered without hesitation). The Cecil's weakest point aesthetically would have to be the accomodation level hallways. The transition from glamorous lobby to the aqua green, industrial-tasting corridor was somewhat drastic. There was a slight odor of cleaning product but that shouldn't be seen as a bad thing. Anyways, the hallway serves the purpose it is designed for; transporting you efficiently from elevator to hotel room. The Room: Being on a university budget, I opted for the cheaper \"shared bathroom\" accomodation but was pleasantly suprised when I opened the door and saw that we had been given a free upgrade to a room with a bathroom (perhaps because of our latenight arrival?). Although I cannot properly comment on the communal facilities, there appeared to be several shower and toilet stations on each level, the showers themselves looked quite clean and were nicely tiled, I also never noticed the fomation of people \"queued up\" waiting to use the facilities (although I was staying sunday-thursday mid February). The room itself both met, and exceeded at times, my expectations for the price and rating. Do not go expecting the image shown on the Cecil's website and you will not be dissapointed. Expect two star accomodation and you will be satisfied. The room itself was compact (from what I've experienced is the norm in budget, older, mid-city accomodation). The decor was tired, yet maintained a somewhat historic charm (the Cecil must be nearly a century old, if not more). Ceilings were tall enough, and the sliding window was quite large. The room was overall clean, although if I was pressed to name the \"dirtiest\" part of the room it would have to be the carpet, particularily the seam between the carpet and the baseboard. The bed and mattress was newer and firm enough, sheets and blankets were crisp and clean. The pillows were somewhat weak, they felt as though they had been stuffed with cottonballs. There is a large dresser as well as a telephone, television, and alarm clock, and a large closet equiped with an iron. The bathroom was overall clean. The sink and toilet appeared almost new. The tub/shower was older but clean, although the shower head was a little disgusting with green and white calcium build up. I cannot stress enough that if you keep your expectations in line with what you paid for the room you should not be dissapointed. The Cecil is ideal for those who will use the hotel simply for nighttime accomodation. I will conclude by saying that Hotel Cecil deserves a fair chance amidst the barrage of negative reviews on this site, most of which I disagree with. Visit the Cecil with an open mind and do not expect more than the price can offer. Accept the fact that Hotel Cecil is a budget establishment and you will agree that the value achieved by both price and location simply cannot be beat .", "Date": "February 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hermiston, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cNo matter what the deal on this hotel, you will not happy at the Cecil!\u201d", "Author": "bjcrystal", "ReviewID": "UR97352801", "Content": "I could not believe the pure manipulation of the website photos compared to the reality of this hotel!

We actually went back down stairs and asked where the room is that they have advertised on the internet. They acted as though they didn't know what we were talking about. They said they only had one other room if we wanted to switch. We looked at it and it was the exact same! The place was filthy. My skin was crawling the whole time we were there. We looked into getting another hotel but it was All-Star weekend and there wasn't anything we could switch to. We were stuck!! We luckily had a bathroom in our room but had to walk by communal toilets and showers in the hallway. The room was so tiny it only had a bed and dresser with a tv. No chair, no space to put your suitcase, no plugin in the bathroom at all and the only outlet we could find was behind the dresser. We had to call down for soap and shampoo after the first day our room was cleaned and it was not replaced. This took 1 hour and 45 minutes. What hotel is so cheap that they can't replace the soap and shampoo? The walls were VERY thin and we could hear the complete converstation of the guests next door...even at 3 am. The bathroom vent was directly connected to the one next door and it was if they were urinating in our own bathroom!! On the other side of us was a party with people coming and going all night which let out the pot fumes with each pass. We asked for blankets one night and they came up with paper-thin twin blankets 2 hours after the call. This hotel is scary! The last morning I woke up with a bite on my leg.

BIG MISTAKE. PLEASE DO NOT BE CHEAP WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING A HOTEL ROOM. The outside of the building is kind of run down & dirty, do not let the pictures fool you. But the inside lobby was nice..beautiful marble floors, nice color scheme, but very very old school. Older than old school. I knew something was up when they handed us our keys..they look like dorm room keys!! So we get in the elevator, which btw smelled terrible..like garbage. When we get to our floor & are trying to find our rooms, we see the \"community showers & toilets.\" WE WERE NOT INFORMED OUR ROOM DID NOT HAVE A BATHROOM. The shower would make you calustrophobic. It looked like a place where a rapist would get u or where someone would stash a dead body. I also did not like the idea of sharing the shower!! There was no barrier to the shower or anything it was just a door seperating it from the hallway..& the toilets. OMG. There was doo-doo smeared all over one of them. By this time we were already disgusted & didnt even find our room yet. The hallways were hot being that there is no air conditioning & it smelled foul. & THEN we found our room. We put the key in & it didnt even work. Thats because you had to almost break down the door to get in. The smell of smoke & old man cologne was in the room. It had holes & rips in the carpet & had a sink. The mattress was cheap & when you looked out the window it looked like you were in the projects. Every single screen on every window was bent & or torn as if sum1 were trying to get in or jump out. & were talking the 14th floor. We were pissed because this was not what we expected. We complained to priceline & the front lobby & were told we cannot cancel this reservation without being charged for the night. & while on the phone, the cleaning lady barges in even with our \"do not disturb\" placard on the door knob. Because we could not cancel this, we decided to upgrade our room. So we are moved to the 9th floor..this time the elevator smelled like straight up armpits. The hallways smelled the same, like garbage, & our lock on the door was flimsy. BUT we had a bathroom. It had a toilet & sink, but no tub. There is just a shower head on the ceiling so basically the whole bathroom was the shower with a toilet in it. There was this creepy little vent on the wall that creeped the crap out of me because it was like someone could be watching. But we tried to make the most out of it so we turned the tv on while we got ready to go to the beach. When we were leaving, we did not bother to turn the tv off & again put up our \"do not disturb\" sign. Hours later when we returned, our tv was off. Everything else was in place, I didnt think the cleaning lady was in there. We were a little creeped out but joked around that the place was haunted. I wouldnt doubt it, being that its old & it looked like a place where you would go after your wife kicked you out & commit suicide. It reminded me of the movie The Shining. Everything about the place was creepy..very diverse guests, BUT crackheads & bums surround the area. Even in the lobby. Very, very unprofessional..but anyways!! We were very glad to check out. But upon checking out, I asked the guy working if the hotel was haunted. He had a look on his face as if we were already supposed to know, & said so casually, YES. We started laughing because we thought he was joking around, but I asked why? He says, \"Well this hotel has been around since the 1920's & there have been murders & suicides throughout the years..\" My mouth dropped!! My friend then asked, \"Are there timers on the tvs?\" & he said no..but ppl ask ALL the time. So we are scared to be in that place so we hurry out of there..on our long drive home, I start to google the history on this place. Sure enough, it comes up as one of the haunted hotels in la. Its a historical landmark, the 1st hotel in la to have 3 stories. Its also where movie stars used to hang out, & also a place where a few movie stars committed suicide..I still cant believe we stayed in that dorm-like piece of trash but please..if you do not wish to have an experience like this, splurge a little.", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cTake other negative reviews seriously... this is a flophouse not a hotel\u201d", "Author": "Missy025", "ReviewID": "UR71086043", "Content": "... and I need to qualify b/c I actually was checked into STAY - the hostel group that rents (and has renovated) a few floors of the Cecil.

It wasn't the kind of bland clean look of a standard hotel, it was kinda gritty. We got a room with no bathroom, again to save money, and the communal bathroom was down the hall. The room just felt kind of old, it wasn't particularly dirty or anything, just old. The bathroom was small, kind of dim lighting, but I didn't expect much more. They leave a roll of toilet paper in your room (we didn't find ours so we searched other floors until we found some left in a bathroom) then it was on top of a shelf we noticed when we got back to our room. Its an old building, and the neighborhood is... colorful. Coming back in the evening, we were approached by a man recently released from prison (he showed us his \"LA COUNTY JAIL\" shoes and everything) asking if we had any money, but we politely told him we didn't and he thanked us anyway and we went inside. The lobby was well lit and there was always some sort of staff there, which made us feel more secure. When we got hungry that evening, we made a judgement call to not go outside, so we went down to the hotel desk and asked which pizza places would deliver. They helped us find a place, and were really helpful. During the day, there were still homeless people outside, but no one bothered us as we walked to the metro. I was apprehensive at first about the location and encountering problems, but if you just keep an open mind, walk with confidence, and be polite, hopefully you'll have as good an experience.

I booked myself into a more expensive hotel nearer LAX for my first night because I didn't want to travel far from the Airport in the dark and now know where I was. I found an amazing deal on expedia offering the Cecil hotel at \u00a325 per night which I thought was incredible! So, after reading a few positive and negative reviews, I booked 6 nights there. The lobby is just amazing, faux marble or not, and the staff (especially security) are incredible and SO friendly. There are also some real characters living in the Cecil Hotel who I really got on with. My room was pretty much average, if a little too hot at times. My only complaint would be the really high phone bill, although that was most likely my own fault for not understanding how much it costs to call england from the USA (I spent $200 on the phone bill!). The bathroom was clean, as were the sheets, and there was plenty of room to store my things, as well as lots of choice for channels on the Cable T.V. Despite being alone and thousands of miles away from home, I never once felt scared, and everyone I met at the Cecil and around the area made me feel so at home I never wanted to leave. I was never without help if I needed it, and there was always somebody about to tell me what there was to do in the area.

We arrived by Geyhound, and although the station is close, I would not recommend walking to the hotel. This is because the streets surrounding the hotel are full of homeless people, crack heads, and groups of thugs. I had no idea that downtown L.A was such a dodgy area. In most other cities, downtown is the place to be, where everything happens. I guess in L.A you should really be in Hollywood/Beverley Hills area. Unless you need to be in downtown specifically I would suggest not staying or going anywhere near it. Even during the day it's a bit rough. A good thing for us was the price, and the nearby metro station. A couple of blocks away is the metro which will take you everywhere you need to go in L.A - universal studios, hollywood, LAX. I'm pretty sure you can get to Disneyland or at least nearby as well. The front of house staff were also very efficient. The first night we arrived the internet was not working so the lady had the security guard escort us to the hotel next door so we could use theirs, free of charge of course. The room was okay, but it was quite humid and there was only one ceiling fan. The whole time we stayed we could not sleep under any of the bedding because it was too hot. We had an ensuite bathroom which was small but did the job. Everything looked quite clean, but we did spot a cockroach crawling around on one of the walls. I thought it was quite funny until my friend said \"if there is one there are probably more!\" The hotel lobby is one of the nicest things about the hotel. It is huge, and just upstairs of the lobby there are plenty of tables and chairs so you can take your laptop and surf the net for as long as you want. The internet here is free. We could get a weak signal in our room but it was better to go downstairs and more comfortable anyway. Just left of the hotel (when you are facing it) is a diner called \"Nickel Diner\" and they do a really nice breakfast there, and great coffee. The staff there were great too. Just ignore the dodgy types hanging around on the street I guess. If you are a lone traveller I would not recommend staying at cecil, and I would not recommend arriving by yourself at night time or walking anywhere on the streets at night. Every time I stepped outside the hotel I would have creepy homeless guys or young thugs proposition me. If you're in a group and you need somewhere cheap to stay then Cecil will be fine.

WORST HOTEL we've EVER stayed at!\u201d", "Author": "worktravelingcouple", "ReviewID": "UR21486476", "Content": "My husband and I had to travel to the Fashion District in Los Angelos for business. We travel frequently and had check many of the big name hotels who we prefer to stay with but all were completely booked. After searching online we found The Cecil Hotel. It showed two different types of rooms - ones with no bathroom where you would use a shared bathroom down the hall and ones with a bathroom inside. After looking online at photos that seemed \"decent\", we decided to book our 2 night stay there in a room with a bathroom. It was very inexpensive, which made no difference to us, as we are accustomed to paying upwards of $200/night when we travel. When we arrived, we were beyond disappointed. The area that the hotel is located in is very unsafe, with many homeless people and drug addicts sleeping on the street right outside the front door. As we entered the lobby, it seemed not too bad. The huge let down was upon getting off the elevator to the floor we were staying on. It was musty, moldy, and downright disgusting smelling and looking. We went to our room to find even bigger let down. The bed was merely an old \"cot\" with sheets on it -- no blanket or comforter. It didn't make much difference, though -- there is NO Air Conditioner or ventilation unit anywhere. The whole place just felt dirty and uncomfortable. The bathroom (which was supposed to be an \"upgrade\" at this hotel) was terrible to say the least. Neither my husband or I even wanted to go in there. We were at a loss as to what to do -- we had work meetings starting within an hour. We quickly dropped our bags and left for the day. Upon returning for the evening, we did not feel safe. Although there is a security guard downstairs that asks for your key, it was pretty much a nightmare. Firetrucks and sirens loudly going off every 3-4 minutes all night long, smoke smells coming in from people smoking on the street or in the hallways. We literally could not wait to get up and get out of there in the morning. We walked about 4-5 blocks in each direction from the hotel the next afternoon, just wasting time in between work meetings. We were willing to do anything to avoid having to go back to our hotel room. Much to our surprise, the downtown LA area changes quickly within about 4-5 blocks from this hotel location. Cleaner people, newer buildings, and for once we felt safer. WE SO WISH we had checked the review about The Cecil and opted to change our business trip to different dates where nicer hotels (Marriott, Sheraton, etc) were available. I would highly recommend to anyone traveling for business or pleasure to look elsewhere. I would rather pay $500/night to stay somewhere that was clean, comfortable, and felt safe over ever staying at the Cecil again even for FREE!

This was the cheapest place I could find for two people the week before we needed the room. For the price it was not horrible, but NOT GREAT either. What people said here is true. The front lobby is very nice at first glance. Faux marble is everywhere but it is easy to tell it is just a facade. The young man at the front desk asked me if I was \"aware this is a hostel?\" I felt like saying, \"Are you aware?\" because of all the glamor in the entry but I refrained. ::things you should know about me. I stayed on the 11th floor in a room with a double bed. Two girls, one sink, one closet, one TV with remote, one window, one night stand. that's it. I am a female college student who is very very okay with \"roughing it\". I've done the whole hostel thing before so I know what to expect. I am not squeamish and I do not need to be pampered. \"Girlie\" has never been a fitting adjective for me. If you are a girliegirl then maybe you will find this place way too gross. just saying.:: There is some sort of restaurant going in next door and people (workers) seem to hang out there all the time Not actually working mind you. They just laugh when you walk buy and you feel like you're not a part of their cool kids club. However I did not find this \"tent city\" mentioned and I felt quite safe walking around on a saturday night with my female friend. Yes, there were some homeless men calling out to us but nothing bad really. Maybe I am just really used to San Francisco. There always seems to be some sort of maid or handy man in the small, poorly painted elevators and that made me uneasy. Are there no service elevators. These people always seemed unhappy like they hated life. The room was okay. The things that bugged me were that the carpet was a bit damp and over all nothing seemed exceedingly clean. I kept feeling like I needed to wash my hands after touching things. There was no way to really get clean though because the soap they provide you smells like really bad roses. *bring your own hand soap* Also the room smelled. Not fresh at all and no way to air it out since we left the window open all day and that didn't do anything. Just a damp humid smell (outside was not humid for the record). *Think about bringing something to make your room smell better. febreeze it yo.* We brought sleeping bags and pillows after heeding the other reviews of the Cecil Hotel on this site and I think it was a darn good idea. The hostel style bathroom was...ehhhh. There was a bar to hang a towel/clothes. the water pressure was okay. I had no confidence in the walls or floor though so made very sure I never toughed either. scummy marble. yum. The toilets were ALWAYS missing toilet paper which is, let's face it, awkward. And the \"vent\" in the bathroom was caked with black dust?scum?alien species? The young man at the front desk was helpful and helped me find a few things downtown. I think he was helpful because I was a young girl flirting though and not because it was his job. Overall this is an okay place to stay if you need a cheap room for one, maybe two nights. Will I be back? maaaaybe if I am with my brother or some other person who can really rough it and we need to stay right downtown. I won't be coming back here with any girls who need basic cleanliness needs met. They just won't find it here.

I ask if they have parking. He says no, but I can park the car in a metered spot while I check in. The meter is broken, I look around for no parking signs, there are none, so I figure I'm good. I enter the lobby which looks ok enough, except there's a homeless guy slurping on a coffee in what appears to be some sort of automat like area which opens onto the lobby. OK, I'm from NYC, so homeless guys aren't a big deal, but certainly starts to raise a red flag. I get to the check-in and the receptionist tells me the hotel does not have parking. But I'm welcome to park the car in one of the two lots surrounded by torn up chain link fences either across the street, or beside the hotel I think it was either 5 to 10 dollars, but no in and out privileges. Sounds weird, but I ask her where I can get some money to pay for the parking. She tells me there's an atm in that deli/automat where I saw the homeless guy, but by the afternoon, the atm is usually out of money. So my best bet is a bank a few blocks away. I ask her if my car will be ok outside, since I'll have to take my baggage up to the room to then go to the atm. She says don't worry at all, your car will be fine out there for the rest of the night if you like. So I take the elevator up to the room where I'm greeted by open doors on the hallways of shared bathrooms. They looked clean enough I suppose, but still, that's not what you want to be greeted with, multiple shared bathrooms--it really gave the feeling of a flophouse. I get to the room a door so flimsy it looks like it couldn't stop a light breeze from entering. The room was clean enough, but small with an en suite bathroom, the mattress was cheap and the room smelled like smoke. I guess this is one of the few hotels in LA that still has smoking... Anyway, there's no internet in the room despite the claim that there was wifi in the hotel, so having work to do for most of the night and internet being crucial, I decide combined with the smell of smoke and the general overall creepiness of the hotel, I can't stay there. I talk to orbitz about the situation, and they say the manager refuses to let me out of the reservation and will charge me for a night, despite the pretty much false advertising this place has given. That's when somebody asks if I'm the person with the rental car out front. I say yes, and they say, we were trying to get in touch with you because it was getting towed. I say, you're joking right? Nope, my car was towed. After 2 employees told me it would be ok. So now they agree to refund me my first night as well, but at this point I'm a tow ($150) and a ticket ($75) in the hole. So the only thing this manager can say is I'm sorry, then he kinda just acts like people do when they aren't really sorry they try and make themselves scarce. Not \"how can we help make this up to you\" or \"what can we do to help,\" no, just \"I'm sorry about that.\" To his credit he did find the number of the towing company for me so I could find out how much I was now in the hole thanks to their incompetence. While I'm at the desk by the way, the strangest cast of characters who stay there, or wanted to stay there came up. One guy was trying to decide whether paying 3 bucks more a night for a TV in his room was worth it. Flophouse. So after I regain my composure, I say you telling me you're \"sorry\" isn't enough. Don't you think the hotel should share some of the responsibility of having my car towed? His response was \"no, if it's money you're looking for you won't get it, we already refunded you for the first night.\" Which was a joke since they really should have anyway considering how they advertised themselves. Finally I tell him this report is going to go on Trip Advisor and that's when he immediately changes his tune. Then he says he'll talk to management as see if they'll agree. I say, look just pay for half and show you're sharing some responsibility in this, and I'll feel much less anger toward your establishment which I thought was totally fair. I leave and after another hour of dealing with getting 250 bucks out of the bank and having a friend come by to help me find the towing pound, I was not a happy camper. The hotel cecil manager did call to say they agreed to cover half the towing. Not the ticket, ONLY the towing. So I think ok, I guess that's something and they're doing the honorable thing. We fax over the towing receipt as they asked us to do, and two months later, still no check. I assume it's not coming, which just proves how incompetent they are, bordering on just full-on scam artists, and dishonorable. Well, here's your trip advisor review Hotel Cecil. And I think I'm being kinder than anybody would be under the circumstances I was put in. Pros: Cheap Security Guards in Marble Lobby. Free wifi in Lobby area. Cons: Security Guards in Lobby. (They're there for a reason) Crackheads (I kid you not) stumbling down street in front of hotel as I wait for my friend to pick me up. No parking. Room/Hallways smelled like smoke. Incompetent staff. Summary: Saving a few bucks a night in this place is NOT worth the hassle. Not to mention the location is in the worst part of LA. If you want to experience the LA you've seen in the movies (unless you are attracted to the LA you saw in \"Seven\") stay anywhere else. This place is horrible. Period.

Everything was OK by me, I always got my favorite room. Never had a problem until one night there is a banging on my door late at night. I answered and a security guard pushed his way into my room saying he had a noise complaint. Standing outside my door he could have heard if there was any noise or not, but instead he chose to knock and push his way in. He looked in my TV cabinet and then even looked in my clothes closet, then just non-chalantly said \"go back to sleep\" and left my room. I got dressed and went over to a police precinct a short walk away and complained. The police came back to the hotel with me, one spoke to me, the other to the guard. The next day I went out in the morning for a short time and came back to find a metal plug in my room lock. When I went down and questioned why, they told me I had to leave because I called the police when the security guy was only doing his job. Looking back now, I guess I over-reacted by going to the police, but I couldn't understand why this particular guard did this, because the guards knew me well from coming and going for a few years previous to that visit. I was always on \"hello\" basis with all of them because I was in and out often on my trips and sometimes they didn't even bother to check my ID any more when I went in and out. I guess I'd stay there again if I had to because the price is unbeatable, but on my visits now I stay at similar place just up the street.", "Date": "November 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Deal at the Cecil!\u201d", "Author": "smagnew", "ReviewID": "UR10650809", "Content": "After attending a function downtown, my friend and I decided to make a night of it and book a room at the Cecil.

The rooms were filthy, the plumbing is circa 1960s. My bedspread had cigarrette burns in it, my chair had a knife slash in it. The room smelled of fresh vomit when I arrived and it did not have AC. The bathroom towels had stains on them and the water coming out of the tap was brown. The doors have 4 locks on them and trust me you'll feel like you need them.
