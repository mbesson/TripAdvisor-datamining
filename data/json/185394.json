Even though I travel quite a bit, I was a little overwhelmed by my first visit here. Check in was quick and easy. Staff was professional if not overly friendly. (This seems true of all Holiday Inns everywhere I go, usually professional but never really friendly) They knew enough English to communicate with me, but as I discovered everywhere else I went in Mexico City, English is not really spoken that much here). I had a King Master Suite which was huge and really comfortable. I especially loved the big new walk in shower. Although there were two sofas in the living area that really need to be put out to pasture, everything else was in good condition. They still have the old tube TVs though (Room Tip) I did notice that if I was in the living area close to the front door of my room, all the hallway noise was magnified because of the tile floors in the hall, luckily my bedroom was set back, so I never heard anything while sleeping, so think about upgrading to a suite. Maid service was excellent and always respected my do not disturb sign. (I'm a late sleeper!) I had breakfast in the hotel every morning, I have to say for hotel food, it was excellent and actually cheap for a hotel. I think they have room service because I saw trays in the hallway, but for some reason they ripped the menu pages out of my room guide. The location which at first put me off, turned out to be very good. It's on the edge of the Zona Rosa. About a 10 minute walk from the all restaurants, bars and clubs in a quiet little neighborhood. There is a music school across the street (my room was facing it) and I woke up to some nice live music every morning. Small shops and a 7-11 very close by. Public transportation, the metrobus and the metro are easy to walk to from here. But if you like to walk and don't mind a good healthy hike, I discovered that you can walk to the Zocalo, Chatapultec Park, La Condensa and many other sites from here. This really was a nice suprise as I like to walk and discover cities this way. I did try to use the\"Fitness Center\" one night, but really, this was kind of a joke. 3 pieces of equipment with no water and no bathroom is not a fitness center. Also, the remote controls for the TV and the AC were missing. You really need to be determined to work out to use this place. But if you go outside of the fitmess center they do have a really nice rooftop balcony next to it. At check out I asked for a taxi to the airport and they had a guy in an old van waiting for me. Luckily, by this time I trusted the hotel staff enough, so I went right in. Only 200 pesos, and the driver was very nice (Dressed in a suit). Although the van was a little bit scary. The hotel should probably re-think this option. After spending a whole day exploring the cacophony of Mexico City, I came to really appreciate being able to return to the quiet and comfortable hotel", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, OR", "Title": "\u201cComfortable rooms and good location\u201d", "Author": "Dooglas", "ReviewID": "UR95719693", "Content": "The location in the middle of the Zona Rosa is excellent.

We booked 2 junior suites for 3 nights through the Holiday Inn website. Holiday Inn confirmed a 14 day advance purchase (non refundable) nightly rate of $90 US, plus tax for each room, based on 4 people in 2 rooms. The hotel is in a good location, on a relatively quiet street, just on the edge of Zona Rosa. The hotel appearance and general amenities are what we usually expect from a Holiday Inn although, in this case, somewhat worn and dated. The front desk service was poor and at times both understaffed and chaotic. We found it difficult to impossible to communicate in English, often depending on a Bellman for translation. The air conditioner did not work in one of the two rooms we were given. The next day we requested a repair. When we arrived at our room that evening there was still no air conditioning. The room did not have screens on the windows. When we opened a window for air, we were swarmed with mosquitoes throughout the night. The next day we requested a change of rooms and did have a decent rest on the third night. When we checked out we discovered that our credit card had been charged a room rate that was more than 30% higher than the rate Holiday Inn had confirmed. We were unable to communicate effectively with the front desk in English, and left with the matter unresolved. Since then we have had four separate communications with Holiday Inn Reservations and Guest Relations over a period of 2 weeks. So far the hotel has not honoured the confirmed reservation and Holidy Inn has been ineffective in dealing with our concerns. There are numerous hotel choices in Zona Rosa, and we will never stay in this hotel again. We would also caution travelers using the Holiday Inn reservation system.

This place is classy. The colonial-modern design is a delight to the eye, and during my stay, there were various local artists works featured throughout the hotel. Magnificent sculptures and intriguing mixed media works festooned the walls of a place that managed to be both classic and modern at the same time. The wooden doors to the hotel are 20 feet high and must weigh a ton each and give an immediate sense of history and security as well as beauty. The hotel was tastefully decorated for Christmas using pointsettias and subdued holiday adornments. The staff at the hotel match the sophistication, eclecticism and beauty of the building itself. They are friendly, diverse, and painstakingly caring about their guests. Minutes after they showed me my room which was large and beautiful and had a view of the fountained courtyard, they called to offer me another room since there was a party booked in the restaurant for the evening and they were very concerned that I would be disturbed. I elected to keep the room since I liked it so much, and I could sleep through a trainwreck if need be. The party ended earlier than they expected and the noise that came from it was minimal. Caudia and Vincent (sp?) were especially helpful throughout my stay. I had room service at the hotel a few times. The breakfasts were very good. The menu, however, lacked snack-hors d'oevre items which was a problem since the magnificent room inspired me to entertain fellow travelers. I ordered cookies and coffee for one guest and the cookies weren't very good. The coffee could take a lesson from Starbucks as well. The shower was large, marble, beautiful and powerful. The bed was large with lots of pillows and firm yet comfortable. The internet service was included at no additional charge. I would not hesitate to stay here again. I also enjoyed being only a few blocks away from the clubs and fun in the Zona Rosa. This was my first trip to Mexico City and I was surprised and delighted at every turn. The people in the city are warm and genteel. I always felt respected and validated and never once felt mistrustful or threatened by anything.
