{"Reviews": [{"Content": "No Thanks I'll Pass On this One I booked this room for my family who were in town to visit, the room was ok, could of been cleaned a whole lot better, the bed was not comfortable and an upgrade of $20.00 a day meant you get a second bed in the room. We were on the second floor and my niece was walking around the room, apparently this kind of thing cannot be tolerated because we got a call twice from the front desk that a guest was complaining of all the noise (seriously), we had two rooms and moved our party to it where we did not receive any complaints. If you want a room with a bed and nothing else than this is the place for you.", "Date": "Apr 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR229004547", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "jmj1993"}, {"Content": "Zero Amenities Booked this hotel for 4 people through Priceline. The price was great, but we found out why when we got there.When we got to the hotel, we were given a room with 1 queen bed. Clearly not enough for 4 adults. We were able to switch to a king suite with a pull-out couch, but were charged an additional $20 a night. We were told there were no sheets or pillows left in the hotel, so the two people who had to stay on the pullout couch slept on blankets with sweatshirts as pillows. How does a hotel not have enough sheets???The third morning, the staff was able to find one extra pillow for us. The morning staff was very friendly and accomodating, but the night-time staff were not helpful at all. Our TV remotes had no batteries in them and the wireless internet was pretty slow. There is also no shampoo, conditioner or a hair dryer in the room. The air conditioning was a joke, we couldn't turn it on at night when it was hot, and instead it came on during the day when we were gone. The fan in the bathroom was broken and hanging off the wall.There is no pool, no continental breakfast, no towel or laundry service unless you want to pay extra. The hotel itself is pretty far from downtown Phoenix, Scottsdale and Tempe. However, it is located right off of I-17.This hotel is only good if you are looking for a cheap place with a bed and a shower.", "Date": "Mar 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR171606184", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "MkeTraveler13"}, {"Content": "** If you want rest and comfort, DO NOT STAY HERE!! ** My first couple of experiences at this hotel were very good. The staff and management were friendly and made you feel welcome to be a guest at their hotel. This changed after a new manager came along that insisted the employees at this hotel do not interact with their guest. This hotel went from a warm and welcoming atmosphere (what hotels are supposed to be) to a place that was cold and unfriendly. The new manager fired any employee that was friendly to there guest. Security is a joke. If you are looking for a bed for the night, fine.

First and foremost, the management at this property are rude. The only person who was actually courteous to the guests was fired for fraternizing? I thought this was supposed to be the hospitality industry?!? The wireless internet is ridiculous, only about 15K downloads. The tv's are only 19 with a limited cable channel selection. There is no type of breakfast or anything offered. There is no gym, pool, hot tub, etc. The walls are paper thin and I've had the neighbor from [--] since I've been here. He apparently has emphysemea or something and all you can hear all night long is *cough*cough*cough* (literally). I've been here 3 months and the only reason I've stayed is because I'm on a multi-month discounted rate and if I move I have to start paying hotel taxes again.", "Date": "Apr 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR174611963", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Astroboy_OKC"}, {"Content": "Like it so far I booked 5 nights for my parents as they visit Phoenix at end of Oct 2006, so far I like the place, specially with the price ($25) per night. Full kitchen, qeen bed standard on all reservation. The place is little too far from Phoenix's area, but nothing terrible as only about 10 minutes drive to Metro area and about 20 to downtown Phoenix.
