In fairness, I didn't call the front desk to complain -- I was only there for one night and was generously upgraded to a room with an incredible view of the city so I overlooked those things. But, the room was loud due to the HVAC system and there is also very little soundproofing between the rooms. Not the best night's sleep... and the bed was just OK... very oddly lumpy.

The morning of our arrival we received a call from the hotel asking if that was what we wanted because there was not a pullout couch in the room they had for us. We were asked if we wanted connecting rooms instead and said yes (rollaway beds were also offered). When we got to the hotel our rooms were not ready but were told they would be after lunch. We went to lunch and got a call that one of the rooms was ready but the other one wouldn't be ready until 5:00 pm as they were shooting a commercial in our room. We were fine with it and continued with our sightseeing. Our rooms had a spectacular view. The bathrooms were spacious but had a very tiny shower. Don't know why they would not have made a larger shower and perhaps put in a smaller tub or no tub at all. We were excited about our room as it was a suite with a connecting room (we were expecting 2 regular rooms). Thought we had been hooked up but upon check out we realized that we had to pay for it. I thought they should have mentioned this to us when they called and we switched our reservations. On our last night at the hotel there was a very loud party going on above us. At 2:00 am security knocked on our door assuming we were the ones having the party! Couldn't they hear from the hallway that it wasn't us? Did they check the register? We were a family with 2 kids!

I have to say that, compared to the regular rooms, the suite is the way to go due to the poor soundproofing between the rooms and the halls. In a suite, you have two sets of doors between you and the hallway, and the bathroom is between you and the neighboring hotel room, so it is much easier to get a quiet night's sleep. The first time we stayed in a regular room last spring, unfortunately, we were right next to a suite which had what sounded like at least 50 young,drunk people partying into the night. Even with their door closed and ours closed, we could hear everything, and of course they insisted on wandering up and down the hall whooping it up. We were moved quickly though to another room upon calling the front desk, which we appreciated. The lobby is great, but it does turn into a major nightclub on the weekends. If you're up for partying, it is great, but also a tad pretentious. Dinner at Scampo: the food was good. The service (with the exception of our primary server, who was very experienced) was so-so at best. We sat at the bar to wait for our table, and the female bartender had absolutely no personality whatsoever. It kind of left us cold. Then, upon being seated, the hostess seemed very confused about where to seat my husband and I and brought us to a 4-person table that had someone else's jacket there. Then she checked with the front desk and told us that we could sit there \"if you want\", so of course we took it. Then, two busboys came out and hung out at the computer by our table and started goofing around. I guess what I am saying is that the staff could have been slightly more professional for the way this place is raved about. Our primary server was great, though, and we have no complaints. Food was good, but I don't know if it is 5-star or is Scampo just a little pretentious itself because the Liberty is the \"place to be\" for the in crowd?", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cThe Liberty Hotel\u201d", "Author": "looper63", "ReviewID": "UR124496709", "Content": "The Liberty is a great hotel that's close to the Garden, the North End, and Cambridge, right across from the Charles River.

It was my first time staying in one of Starwood's Luxury Collection properties and the Liberty delivered on providing a luxurious stay. The combination of history, room amenities, restaurants, service, atmosphere, and location made the stay one of my best experiences at a hotel. As someone who loves history and architectural preservation, the Liberty was a natural fit. Television screens in the lobby and informational books in the rooms provide guests with the history of the hotel, formerly known as the Charles Street Jail (built in 1851). The prison theme is used in every aspect of the hotel. The massive lobby is beautifully decorated and incorporates the prison stairwells and jail bars. The lobby ceiling appears to be the original woodwork and the four large black chandeliers are nice touches. During check-in, I was offered a complimentary glass of champagne by Patrick, the friendly front desk agent on duty. The room was tastefully decorated and includes a nice minibar selection, high-tech phone system, and a complimentary bottle of water (a rarity nowadays). The bathroom was gorgeous; the tub was nice, but the gray-stoned shower wins hands down. Turn-down service was provided each night and housekeeping always did an excellent job. The \"Do Not Disturb\" sign is nowhere to be found; instead, a \"Solitary\" sign and large cell key is provided. Instead of an ice machine, a sleek cooler with individually wrapped plastic bags of ice is on each floor. I suppose that cuts down on the noise; it was a nice touch. Also a complimentary business center (two computers with printers) is located on the fifth floor. I didn't visit the Catwalk Bar (3rd floor), but Clink (2nd floor - lobby) offered a good breakfast. It's also open for lunch and dinner, but I can't vouch for those menus since I ate at Scampo (first floor) instead. Wow, that restaurant didn't let me down. You can read my separate review of Scampo, an Italian-with-a-modern-twist restaurant, but the jist of it: great service and one of the best sirloin steaks I've ever had. Each night Alibi (first floor) and the entire lobby (Liberty Bar) turns into a packed nightclub of sorts. The DJ music and crowds could be overwhelming for a family with kids walking through the lobby. But the people enjoying themselves didn't seem to cause any problems and were generally very friendly. Besides, I think the numerous security personnel kept everyone in line. Each night a different theme takes place in the lobby. For instance, Thursday night featured a fashion show (the escalator from the first floor turned into the \"runway\") and an energetic jazz band played Friday night. There was a line to get into the hotel, so be prepared to show your room key to the doorman/bouncer after 10 or 11pm. The Liberty is conveniently located across the street from the Charles/MGH Station\u00e2\u20ac\u017d on the Green Line. It's three short stops to Harvard Square (I had a great time walking around Cambridge), and a 15-20 minute T ride to Copley Square. The hotel is one block from Beacon Hill; it's a 15 minute walk to Boston Common and a 20-25 minute walk to the North End. (tip: try Al Dente for dinner and Modern Pastry for dessert if you're in the North End) If you forgot hairspray or don't want to pay minibar prices for sodas and snacks, a 24-hour CVS is across the street from the hotel. I honestly don't have anything negative to say about the hotel. I usually offer some \"advice\" to management when they read these reviews, but all I can say is, keep up the good work. I shall return.

The old prison theme is nicely done in the hotel. Although, like another poster, I expected to see more of the theme in the hotel rooms. The lobby bar was busy and inviting. Ordinarily, I'd be more of a bar fly but that wasn't on the agenda for this visit. The room was nice and a fine size for one or a couple. The room overlooked the courtyard. Not an issue with this trip as I was there for a few hours of sleep and shower, but for a vacation, I'd probably want one with a better view. My room had turn down service and was ready for me. This was a bit surprising as I think I arrived less than an hour after the reservation was made. The bed and linens were comfortable. There were some elements of the room that seemed to be showing a little bit of age (some minor scratches, stain or burn mark on the carpet, there was a little bit of rust on the bath caddy), but overall I found everything to be clean. There was no noise from the lobby or city and I found the room to be nice and quiet. The mini bar was nicely stocked. The room darkening curtains were nice and I didn't even realize it was daylight when they were closed. I found the room to be a bit too bright at night. The clock and the phones had very bright back lights and glowed like nightlights. There may have been a way to dim those, but I didn't feel like dealing with it. I ended up covering them up with a towel to get some more darkness. The shower is on the small side compared to other comparable hotels in the city. It took FOREVER for the shower to get hot, like several minutes. I kept turning it up and turning it up. I was getting to the point where I was going to get dressed and call down or bite the bullet and take a cold shower when it got HOT. Once hot, it was hot. The TV channel changing is a bit slow and the trackball part of the remote had some gunk under the edges that was visible sometimes. I'm a bit of a neat freak and think hotel remotes are pretty gross in general and probably look for proof. It is probably not something the average person will notice.

The restaurants are amazing, especially Scampo. The bar area in the lobby turns into a fun social gathering for all ages and often times has a fashion show, a DJ spinning tunes and the list goes on. It's probably the hippest most fun place to stay in Boston. And in the summer they have outdoor areas to sip cocktails or have some appetizers. Location is fantastic as well. It's across the street from the Charles River which is great for running, walking, or biking. It's also across the street from Boston's famous Charles Street of Beacon Hill.

The rooms and service were first rate, as they should be for an expensive hotel. The ownership has changed recently and the service has gone downhill so much that I doubt we will be coming back. We were there for three nights recently and there were many problems: 1. The electronic room keys rarely work. After the first day when I could not get back in my room, the front desk told me that cell phones or other electronic cards cause a problem, so to keep the card isolated. They gave me two cards, just in case and I kept the cards in an outside pocket of my leather handbag with *nothing* else in it. I emptied the pocket just for the cards. Result? Second day, neither card worked. The cards did work in the elevator, which requires your card to get to your floor, but not for the room. Back downstairs, where I got new cards. This happened every day we were there, sometimes 2x a day. Each time cost me 15 minutes of my day to go up to my room, then back to the front desk, wait for the new cards, then back up to my room. I can fairly say that all the trips back and forth cost me a solid hour of my time. One night, when I could not get back into my room and went to the front desk to ask for new cards, yet again, the man behind the desk took my old cards and slapped the new cards down on the counter, all without a word. I asked him if this was too much trouble, as it was pretty annoying for us and he told me it was no fun for him either. Not sure where to go with that. Sorry I was one of those awful guests who like to be able to get into their room! By the way, I happened to ride in the elevator with one of the front desk staff and her card did not work either. She was muttering about it under her breath, so it appears to be a problem for everyone. 2. The toilet clogged up. Okay, unpleasant, but that can happen anywhere. It was in the morning and we were on our way out to breakfast anyway, so I let them know we would be out for 45 minutes or so and could they send someone to fix it. I was assured they would get right on it. Surprise! We came back, amazingly the card still worked, so we could get into the room, but the toilet was still clogged. Back to the front desk to wait in the lobby, as we didn't really want to hang around the hotel room with the plumber. Another half hour and the front desk came over to let us know we could now use our bathroom. 3. The bathrooms are getting a bit shabby. The tub has a lovely stainless steel caddy in it, one of those shelves that sits across the tub and holds sponges and soap. The caddy was rusty, which is pretty unpleasant to look at, quite honestly. Plus, the floor tiles had what looks like tar on them, probably from the previous tenant's shoes. I would not say the room was dirty, just not quite up to the standards of an expensive hotel like The Liberty.

Really enjoyed every minute and Scampos, the restaurant downstairs, is definitely worth a visit even if you just have one of their delicious, gourmet pizzas. High quality rooms, public areas and service. Just a few minor disappointments that could have an affect on it overall. 1. The showers take a good 5-7 minutes before the hot water comes through. 2. Cleaners need to rotate or check the freshness of the complimentary body lotions because ours smelt musky and off. They should also check all the relevant literature and accessories are in the rooms. We had no minibar price list or do not disturb sign. I think this is because they are so unique, previous guests had taken them as memorabilia. 3. Although every other member of staff had an amazing attitude, one guy serving drinks in the lobby at 1pm ish on our last day (Jan 2nd) had a really bad attitude and he really didn't deserve the tip we left him. No idea why we left a tip, habit by that point I think. 4. We understand that local taxi drivers have a really low opinion of one of The Liberty's doormen and are not shy in telling customers about it (not sure exactly what he has done to get this reputation!).

Once we finally were able to check in to our room, we realized that they had us on the top floor on the corner, which we thought was an unexpected upgrade. However, once we opened the door, we saw how wrong we were in that assumption. The room was poorly maintained, with scratches and random paint marks covering all the furniture. The bathroom was decent, but had a rusty bath 'caddy' holding the bath products, which was somewhat of a turnoff. The closet door had a cheap hinge on it that lead me to believe that it was broken, until my boyfriend figured out how to open it as we were walking out the door to check out. We ordered room service for lunch which was not only inedible, but probably the most overpriced meal I have ever had ($60 for a salad and a cheeseburger). Overall, I would most certainly never stay at this hotel again nor would I ever recommend it to anyone; I think that a Holiday Inn is cleaner and has better quality rooms than this hotel.

The windows are floor to ceiling and we had a great view. The only issue that I have is that the hotel is very impressive, but the rooms are underwhelming. They almost have a modern feel. I feel as though they should have carried some of the same themes from the prison motif into the hotel rooms. I would have also hoped that they kept some of the exposed brick or original beams. Don't get me wrong, the rooms were nice, but way too standard for a \"luxury collection\" hotel. Restaurants - We didn't eat at any of the restaurants, but have heard that they're wonderful.

Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by all staff including the valet (parking is expensive, but you are in a city with expensive parking anyway). The unique multi-storied lobby blends the former jail space with modern touches and is an inviting place to hang out. We received glasses of champagne and headed to our room which was in the \"new\" wing.

We dropped our bags and headed back to the lobby for a pre-dinner drink. Here the service dropped off a bit, we waited for 20 mins for our order to be taken and then another 5 to 10 mins to be brought our drinks (nibbles arrived very quickly in comparison). The waitress was very nice and apologized for the wait and the next round was much quicker. Upon returning after dinner the place was rocking. The bar downstairs (Alibi) was packed with attractive young people dressed up for a night on the town. The lobby was filled with similar folk and the 3rd floor \"catwalk\" provides a perfect place to people watch and is exclusive to hotel guests. Although we didn't try the restaurants, we are told that both Clink and Scampo are pretty good, if expensive.

As we followed the escalator up we realized what a fantastic looking hotel it truly is. Check in was no problem (free glass of champagne although we declined) and our room was clean and we could see the Charles from our window even though we had a direct view of Mass Eye & Ear. Who cares, there is so much sight seeing to do down in the lobby! It did appear they were short-staffed on Saturday night, but since we were guests we could sit up on the third floor and look down and people watch while having our drinks - very nice. We also could by-pass all the people waiting to get into Alibi. Very sweet. Pro - We found the bathroom to be larger than expected and I liked that there was a shelf under the 2nd mirror for all my girlie stuff. Con - The towels and robes have been bleached so much they do feel like cardboard. Pro - the bed was comfortable. Con - the tv kept shutting off. Free wifi is always awesome and it was cute that the phone and tv both had my name on them. Con - Clink was not that great. The staff was eh. My advice on the menu is to add some selections that appeal to the meat & potatoes guy. My husband was lost. They also desperately need to broaden their beer selection in all bars. That said room service was fast even though I was told 20 -30 minutes, our meals arrived quickly. Pro - The T is right across the street which made getting to Downtown Crossing and Quincy Market easy (2 stops up). We did use cabs Saturday night and the Door Men had a heck of a time getting them. Thank God we allowed enough time before our show started. By the way The Wayans Brothers were awesome. Alibi is a lot of fun. We found the crowd fun to watch and the DJ on Friday was awesome. We also liked dressing up for once. The ladies dress in high heels and dresses so I was so excited to dress up. Alibi starts to get really crowded around 11:30 so I would advise getting there way earlier. We lucked out both nights (Friday we were there around 10 and Saturday around 11:30) with finding tables that weren't reserved but again it was by chance.

Great sunsets from the room and in room dining that was quite impressive as well - definitely not your typical \"room service\".

Felt a little under dressed but we were in a great mood from Bruins Victory so we went to the The Catwalk for a couple of drinks. It was great. Its only for hotel guests and we could relax and we met some nice folks. Highly recommend the Juniper Blossom ( I think that's what it was called). I was tempted to try some home made potato with smoke truffle salt but was still full from our dinner. Next time!. We did not find the noise from the lobby a problem at all. We went to Clink for Breakfast and it was very good. Our breakfast was included with our certificate but my Credit card got charged. One phone call to hotel and charge was removed.

While sitting on the runway for over an hour, with a cell phone rapidly running out of power, I needed to find a place to stay there -- I wasn't going to land until after midnight. With a dying phone, I called all the places I had stayed on previous occasions. All were full. Not wanting to arrive at midnight with no options, I asked for recommendations. The only place that had a room available was the Liberty which I had never heard of. I knew it was an upper end hotel (I did ask the rate) and figured it was better than sleeping at the airport. When we pulled up to the entrance, the cab door was opened by 3 very drunk young men who invited me to step out as I was trying to pay the driver. The hotel behind them was pulsing with techno-pop music and the entrance was swarming with equally inebriated people. I made my way to the front desk by weaving my way through a lobby jammed-packed with hundreds of 20 and 30 somethings, dancing, drinking and having a seriously good time. The band was in the lobby. I could not hear a word the front desk guy said. Through pantomime and yelling directly in each other's ears, the front desk guy and I got more or less squared away. He handed me a key and then pointed to the elevators. By this time it was nearly 1:00 AM and I was pretty much finished for the day. I reached my room (which was in an adjacent tower removed from the historic building) and found the TV on, playing a self-congratulatory loop about the history of the hotel which for more than a century served as the Suffolk County Jail -- hence the name \"liberty\" which I found horrifyingly insensitive and actually rather perverse. The room was small and unimaginative, the touted thread count a deception, and the room pretty grubby and gray. No tub. Shower cleverly designed to seem larger than it actually was, and lined with some kind of plastic \"stone\" veneer. Nothing at all special about the room, and yet the rate was $700 for one night. Seriously. After my hard day of travel, I would have felt better about treating myself with a really great room. But this rate for this room was outrageous and impossible to justify. Frankly, I would have felt ripped-off at $400 a night. I understand (from their video) that there are more interesting rooms in the original jail building, but I think they are twice the price. The hotel brings in business by serving as a night club. I commend them for their creativity, and would have forgiven the chaos at my arrival had it been a bad luck, one-time thing, but apparently, they have a party of one kind or another going on several times every week. Finally, I can't begin to say how arrogant and insensitive it is to have actual jail cells with bars as the architectural focal point throughout the main part of the hotel. The brink and vaulting ceiling of the lobby are truly beautiful, as is the original ironwork throughout, but they are JAIL CELLS. I could not think of anything other than the suffering that must have gone on there for a hundred or more years.

BTW--the Liberty Hotel is pet friendly. Upon check-in, you are offered a glass of champagne--a very nice touch. One small turn off--when we got to our room, I requested pet bowls--they said they'd bring them right up. While unpacking, we received a phone call saying they we unaware that we had a dog and that we'd need to move rooms. I said I found that hard to believe because when I made the reservation I mentioned I was traveling with a pet, and also had the dog with me when I checked in! Patrick the front desk rep also asked me what my dog's name was. They obviously put us in the wrong room. Not a huge deal but we did have to gather our stuff, wait for another key and move. They did waive the pet fee (which is $100 to $150 depending on who you ask) so that was nice. The lobby is spectacular. It was the former prison common area and you can see where the cells were. In your room, watch channel 1 for a complete history of the prison and hotel. The \"window\" channels are also great -- esp when traveling with a pet. Put on \"tranquility\" to help keep your furry friend quiet when you leave--it worked for us! There is also a Bloody Mary bar in the lobby outside the restaurant Clink. You pay $12 or $14 (if you want premium vodka) and your server will bring you a glass with ice and vodka. The rest is up to you. There is an area set up with a zillion varieties of spices, salts, olives, shrimp, tomato juice and Bloody Mary mix for you to make your Mary to your liking. I did and it was fun. However, the breakfast food at Clink was just so-so. Another downer: Valet parking is $41 for the night--which seems to be pretty standard in Boston. However, when we returned from a Red Sox game Saturday evening, we found our car was no longer parked underground but was moved outside just sitting there among a very busy crowd (wedding guests and club goers).

Excellent fast internet service, TV a little slow to respond to clicking on the remote but was a great picture and sound. A/C blew straight on our faces while in the bed so we slept in reverse with our feet at the headboard and heads at the foot. Pricey soft drinks in the restaurant but free refills.

It was nice to see my name on the TV and the phone. The room was nice, and I loved the bathrooms. The only con the first time I stayed there, was the bed. It is way too firm. I would think that in a luxury hotel, they would have better mattresses. It felt almost like I am laying on a floor. Business wise: Great experience. The rooms were bright, and didnt have a feel of a meeting room. The selection of catered food was great (more than your usual deli sandwiches), especially the breakfast! We did have a difficult time of other people from other meetings who kept eating our food. But the catering manager made sure we were compensated for that situation. The 2nd time was not that great of an experience. My room was actually bigger this time, and i loved it (I recommend the corner rooms, you have windows all around!), but while the TV \"welcomed\" me, the phones were programmed to welcome someone else. Also, our room keys did not work, and we had to go back down and get them replaced 3 times. The front desk ended up coming up to let us in, but never gave us the new card keys, so we had to go back down stairs and get them. It's frustrating when you have dinner plans, but you have to wait an extra 30 minutes just to get into your room. Also, probably the worst experience was the valet. The day I checked out, I gave the ticket to the lady that was running the valet. I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my car.

The only negative was that there is an outside bar that was hopping until 2 am, right below our window. UGH. There is also a central bar in the lobby area, which is also very popular til late. Not as noisy as the outside one, but could be problematic for light sleepers. We ended up going to bed around 12:30, so we didn't have the energy to switch rooms at that time. If you're going to be out late, then the room was cool and worth it, but if you want to go to bed early, you might want a room in the new part of the hotel.

The well heeled come here to show off the new fancy pants and Bottega Veneta bags. It can be a divine time if that's your thing.

I'm staying here one night, mid-week (Wednesday night) on a quick business trip through Boston. My experience here has, hands down, been the worst of any I've had at any high-end hotel in the world -- and I travel extensively, probably spending at least two weeks each month on the road. I arrived yesterday at 5:30 p.m. after experiencing a two-hour delay on the Acela train from New York -- originally I'd been scheduled to arrive at 3:30 p.m. Because of the delay, I needed to check in and go straight to a dinner meeting. This was impossible, however, because my room was not ready. Yes, you read that right, my luxury king room was not ready at 5:30 p.m. -- even after I explained that I literally needed to drop my things off and leave immediately, the front desk kept me waiting. After about ten minutes of standing around, the front desk told me that housekeeping was still in my room and I wouldn't be able to check in because \"the internet in the room is broken.\" I had to absolutely insist that I be allowed to check in, and they finally let me. When I got to the room, it was 85 degrees in there. I know it was 85 degrees in there because that's what it said on the thermostat. The air conditioner was set to cool the room to 65 degrees, but it was obviously not working. I called reception to have the air conditioner looked at and they promptly sent someone up to \"fix\" the air con. Unfortunately, I had to run to my meeting, so couldn't stay to see what he did, but the room never dropped below 78 degrees the entire night. The air conditioning in the room is terrible. It's August. The luxury king room I am in is unfortunately situated directly above an outdoor bar owned and operated by the hotel. The bar blares music outdoors until 2 a.m. It seems that the front desk is unaware of this. I phoned down around 10:40 p.m. to find out what time the bar would stop playing music outside and they told me the music would stop at midnight. I told them I needed to be up at 4:30 a.m. for work. The music at the bar continued to blare until 2 a.m. At these prices, you could do far better than to stay at the Liberty Hotel, which has some serious basic problems with the \"luxury hotel\" aspect of their business.

My mom and I were having a fun weekend in Boston, and I suggested the Liberty, and convinced her to stay here, despite the high price tag. We were excited to partake in the 4th of July package, which included tickets to the rehearsal on the Esplanade, and breakfast. We checked in early, and I had previously called to verify that this wouldn't be a problem, and was assured a room would be ready, and that a note was in the res. Also, I was told that there would be a pet amenity package of bowls, bed, water and cookies for my little dog. We arrived early, and the woman at the concierge gave off the impression that it would be a problem, and the front desk seemed as if they had no prior knowledge of this. Also, we were not offered a drink of water or champagne, which is customary for check in! We were staying in the original jail, which is located above the bar. We go into the room and it was not ready for us. The phone and television still had the name of the previous guest, and there was only one set of towels and amenities. I am fairly certain the room wasn't turned over. Also, there were no pet amenities which were promised. We called for towels and a dog bed and then went out. We arrived back four hours later, and still did not have what we needed. It was about 90 degrees out, and we both wanted to shower before going out again. It took three calls to the front desk and about two hours later to get towels and dog stuff. On top of that the shower head and hardware literary came apart and broke in the shower. The staff profusely apologized, and claimed their Blackberrys weren't working- but frankly, I don't think it's relevant at all. That night, the bar was extremely loud until about three am- if the noise level was mentioned at the time of the reservation, I certainly would have never made the res. Don't get me wrong, I like singing along to Lady Gaga as much as the next gal, but not when you're trying to relax with your mom and dog, and paying upwards of three hundred a night. Unless you're going to be out late drinking in the Liberty's vibrant bar scene, I wouldn't recommend staying in the old jail. I was extremely disappointed, and spoke with the desk manager the next day. She was extremely responsive to my concerns and was very professional. She rectified the situation, and moved us immediately to a room in the tower. We had breakfast, went out, walked around, enjoyed the city, and came back to a room which was ready. Soothing music on, the dog bed and bowls...this was the Liberty I remembered! We even were able to watch the fireworks from the room! It was a great night. We ate at Scampo the first night, and it was so good we went back the second night. The food is interesting and satisfying, and the menu is diverse enough to eat there two nights in a row.

After all said and done.. none of these promises were fulfilled. I think the hotel was amazing and the rooms were great however the infrastructure of this property is lacking especially in the room service(kitchen) department. The kitchen was a complete joke and a bit insulting the things they would send up trying to pass off as food. I would call down to order in room and get the same thing I had the other night and when it arrived, it was the same dish yet cooked another way with different preparation. Very very inconsistent and the food was not always fresh and hot. I ordered a grilled cheese one evening and they put mayo in it---ewww and why? They also had no idea what a Denver omelet-what they sent an omelet with two types of onion, cheese and ham-(Not a Denver omelet and I know that and I'm not a cook) I figured out that they has issues in the kitchen so i was very descriptive in ordering and they even messed that up after i spelled it all out for them. As the kitchen was not solid with there food I did not eat on a few occasions as It was to much hassle to deal with there rookie kitchen. I think I sent back half of the things ordered. Not having the type of service they promised was upsetting,stressful and I wanted to leave several times yet I was trapped as I was recuperating.

The doorman was very welcomming and polite. On entering the hotel, the wow factor kicks in. The reception atrium is stunning and is a fantastic transformation of this former prison. Dakota checked me in and was exceptionally friendly and welcoming. He assisted me with all my queries (as it was my first time in Boston, I had many!). The room was amazing. The view over the river and the city is second to none. The pros in the room included the very comfortable bed, oversized bath, separate large shower, very extensive minibar, molton brown products, excellent phone system that has links to weather, flight information, news etc. A separate mention must go to the complimentary wifi access. It is a complete rip off the way other hotels charge for internet usage. So well done to the Liberty for not ripping us off by charging! Other attractions in the hotel include a well equipped gym, a funky and very buzzing atmosphere in the trendiest lobby I have ever seen. The bar is hopping from about 8 onwards and because it is in the lobby, it adds to the atmosphere of the atrium. I had dinner in the restaurant at the bar which was a fun dining experience. A very very friendly waitress gave me great recommendations including a cosmo made from cucumber pulp! Delicious. The concierge (from Wexford) was wonderful to deal and made some great recommendations for breakfast, sightseeing and many other wonderful things. The Liberty made my stay in Boston perfect.

With the high price point, I was also expecting a great experience. I am sorry to say that I was disappointed. This is probably because of the high expectations before arriving but these proved to be just hype. Similar to recent reviews, the property is really a social venue with a hotel attached to it. Despite beautiful architecture and restoration, the ex-jail theme is sadly more of a gimmick than it is an integral part of the experience. I arrived on a Monday and the hotel lobby, which is shared with a bar, was quite busy. No problem. Check-in and the staff were very efficient and friendly. Rooms are situated in either the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tower\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153jail\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I had no idea until after I checked in. Rooms in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tower\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are located in a new build which is connected to the restored jail reception area. So, I was not in a historic building or the jail itself, but an extension. My room was at the end of the hall and behind a separate set of doors. This was a bit strange since it was my room and only one other that were behind these doors. This extra door didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay open and only the detachable panel beside it was open. I used this 2 foot opening to get through for the remainder of the stay. Upon arriving at my room, the door was open. The security latch was used as a door stop. I assumed that a housekeeper had used this to prop the door open and forgot about it. Nevertheless, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not nice arriving at midnight to your room at the end of the hall (already behind another set of doors) to walk into a dark room and having to knock before entering, just in case. The room was empty, fine and undisturbed. I called reception to inform them and the operator told me \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it should be fine, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll put a note in your file in case of any problems at check-out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Well handled. Room was very nice and impeccably clean. Furnishings were nice and a very nice washroom. Molton Brown toiletries were very appreciated and the nice towels. Unfortunately, the view was terrible and overlooked a construction site that was light with florescent lights for the entire night. There was nothing of Boston to be seen from this room and despite the heavily played upon jail theme, this hotel room could have been a Marriott or a Sheraton anywhere in the world. With the view, I was more likely to be in Dubai. Service at the restaurant, Clink, was very good. Breakfast was a la carte and mostly heavier items. Lunch was also quite good but nothing inspiring. The gym or fitness room is not to be found on the website of the hotel for good reason. This facility was a terrible disappointment and was the size of about one guest room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c two treadmills, two elliptical machines and a bike with some hand weights and a universal machine. There was no pool or even a small steam or sauna. The TV did not work on the treadmill that I used and on the bike, the sound didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. The hotel is not in a good location for shopping or going out compared to hotels in the Backbay or Copley area. Walking to Backbay or to the Prudential building is about 20 minutes in cold December. The hotel offers a car service which is appreciated but not always available. The part I object to the most about the property is the social venue. In some ways it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reminiscent of a Las Vegas hotel. I like my return to my hotel to be an exclusive experience, welcoming, quiet, private and tasteful. In the evenings, the hotel is a bustling social venue with two bars and this often means pushing your way through crowds to get to reception. There is loud music and people from all over and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just really not nice. Small things also left a bad impression like very fussy elevators that require a key card to access your room (a good thing but only works after several attempts); no wake-up call because the line to reception was disconnected one of the nights; slow tv because of too many options, etc. The Liberty is not a bad hotel, it is just trying to be too many things. It is missing a lot of attention to detail that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect at a hotel in its price range and to live up to its hype.

This noise continued on the hotel floors as well, inconsiderate people being to blame, and by 3am on our first night, I was still wide awake because of the noise in the corridors and other rooms. Loud music started in one of the other rooms, but someone must have said something, as that was turned off. We were moved the next day, to a higher floor, but again, noisy revellers from the bar area and the cellar night club kept us awake and the people next door held a conversation as if it was 3 in the afternoon, not 3 in the morning, finishing with having sex, which was clear to hear. Surely a newly refurbished hotel which costs so much to stay in should have had more sound proofing during it's construction, and also the hotel seemed unsure as to whether it was a luxury hotel, or a night club.

There are apparently a handful of rooms in the old prison building (which houses the lobby) so I suspect those reviewers complaining of noise may have stayed in one of those rooms.

From the beginning of my visit until I checked out on Sunday, I was repeatedly impressed with the customer service. Every staff member was attentive and helpful without being overbearing or stuffy/haughty. Room service was very fast. On check in, you get a complmentary class of champagne as well as chocolates and fruit in your room. I thought that was a very nice touch. The location is so convenient as well. You can walk to shopping on St. Charles Street and Boston Common is quite close too. The T stop literally steps away from the hotel gives you access to the rest of the city. The hotel lends its guests bikes so on Sunday before I left I took a ride around the St. Charles River on the Esplanade - what a great way to end a relaxing weekend. As a single traveler, the only complaint I had was regarding the restaurant Scampo where I had dinner Friday night. I had gone down early to explain that I would now be dining solo and wanted to be seated in an area of the restaurant that would be comfortable for a single diner. Well, they gave up my two-top and sat me smack in the middle of the \"chef's table\" which is normally open seating. I was stuffed between two couples - it would have been better if I had been seated on one of the ends - and it was very uncomfortable. However, the meal was very good which made up for this a bit. The waitstaff was also very attentive. One other note - The Liberty is a very popular night spot, and lots of people congregate in the lobby - the focal point of the hotel. This makes it a great spot for people watching. But, checking in later at night or heading back to your room after a night out for dinner could be a little uncomfortable because of the crowd.

We found out later that they were suppose to offer us Champagne but they did not. We were initially given the wrong room (2 beds instead of 1). But as soon as I notified the front desk, they switched us right away and the bellhop was wonderful in taking us there. This mix up ended up to be a blessing, we ended up in one of the few rooms that are actually in the main jail part of the hotel. The bellhop made sure we were happy with the room, informing us that they tend to be smaller and a bit noisier because they are above the lobby. Due to the brick and thickness of these old jail walls, it wasn't a problem and the room had the old jail charm. The location is unbeatable. The T is right in front of the hotel and I puchased a $15 week pass which I used over and over again. I was able to go anywhere with ease. Their transit system is amazing. There is a 24hr CVS pharmacy right on the other side of the T which was great. Also, the start of Beacon Hill is right there and is a great walk to the Commons. Upon check out I noticed my watch was missing. The front desk did not at all seem interested in my loss. I went back to the room to do another sweep to look for it but no luck. I left my information and waited a few more days to hear from them but did not. I called the hotel again but they were disinterested. This infuriated me even more. I stay in hotels at least 40 nights out of the year, for many years and have never had anything missing. I always lock my jewelry in the safe but my watch I usually take off and put on the bedside table. It is my fault that I forgot to put it on but I thought the Hotel would want to know if things turn up missing in there rooms. THEY DIDN'T CARE! I really wanted to love this hotel but most of their customer service is bad.; which is surprising because throughout Boston the locals seemed really friendly. SCARPO (to escape) restaurant was really great. We stopped there the night of our check in for a drink to escape the crowd in the lobby. The restaurant bar was also very crowded but we managed to get a seat at the bar. The drinks were good and strong, the bartenderes were friendly and we met the owner & her husband who were very friendly. We had some appetizers at that time and came back the next night for a fabulous dinner.

Harvard Square,\" parc yaur karr in tha Harvard yard\" you could feel the scholarship, brain power in the air! JFK library, I expected a little more, not much was there about the assasination. The Liberty Hotel is a hot party spot..if you like to party you don't have to leave the hotel. The party is there every night...the pretty people....with money or pretending to have some and fancy cars out front. The food at the hotel is very disappointing and pricey. Don't eat at the hotel, you will be disappointed and mad at yourself! Because now you know better. There are plenty of places to eat close by, the wine liqour store is right across the street and the Starbucks is one block away. The subway is right in front of the hotel, Harvard is 2 stops north and you can travel the city on a subway pass. The subways are clean and appear to be safe, we incurred no problems.Now back to the hotel..Our room was very nice and the view was to die for. We did the Boston duck tour and went into the Charles River...the view of Boston was better from the room! I was told Mick Jagger and Bruce Willis stayed at the Hotel. The Tower rooms where we stayed was so neat. The room keys resemble prison keys..the elevators only go to the room floor that the key works for...thats good. The hotel staff were very professional and are good at their jobs..the check in was flawless especially with the glass of pink Champagne :) Tasty! My only complaint is, I like the doorman to open the doors and greet me by name coming in and out of the hotel. Due to the large party crowd, the doorman could'nt seperate who's a hotel guest or bar patron. So their service was'nt consitent, some times they would open the doors sometimes they would'nt. Due to the Party crowd it was very tough for them to keep up.....The Hotel needs to hire some more people to man the front doors. The bellmen and Valet were fine.

The valet greeted us and offered to assist with bags which we declined. We entered into the beautiful lobby of the hotel, which is most certainly not like anything I've ever seen before. It has an ecclectic sort of charm and I just knew it was our kind of place. It did take us a few minutes to get through the line at check in, it appeared there had been some confusion with the guests checking in prior to us. We were however welcomed my a friendly girl Sara at the check in who gave us a quick over view and some champagne. Before we went upstairs we headed over to the conceirge for some advice on dinner reservations. Maryanne was amazing, she found us a perfect restaurant to suit my craving for steak and his for italian. She picked up and made us a reservation, highlighted a route for us on a map and told us about other points of interested in the area. I was impressed. We headed upstairs to check out our room. We liked our room very much, it was very modern and contemporary which is just our taste. The bathroom had a corner shower and big inviting bathtub, also very nice bath products from London. The kind bed was very comfy and there was a nice area for a desk and also a chaise chair as well and we had a nice view of the patio area below. We cracked open the mini bar and found a vast array of nips, champagnes, wines, juice, sodas and waters. There was also a nice choice of snacks mix and nuts. We sampled a few things and enjoyed all of them. Everything in the room was wonderful. We would have loved to stay another day. Though a little pricey I booked through Hotwire and got a substantial discount. The hotel lobby is the hot spot at night and there was quite a hip crowd mingling and drinking. We went up to our room after dinner with the intentions of going back downstairs and never made it because we fell asleep, though it looked like it was a great time! The next morning we woke up rested we were not bothered at all with any noises as I had read in other reviews. We were in the Tower section of the hotel on the 4th floor. We headed downstairs in the morning for brunch at Clink before our check out. I must say I was disappointed in that. The service was average but the food selection was mediocre. The portion of foods already prepared, eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, waffles, etc were set up in buffet style but everything was lukewarm/cold in temperature. There was a small selection of fruit & cereal which looked adequate. There was also a separate menu which you could order other things from as part of the brunch. Ranged from things like steak & eggs, eggs benedicts, boston lettuce salad, roast beef melts, veggie omelete, all which sound enticing but are not so much. I was disappointed with the taste and quality of all the foods. Also I felt as though the selection was odd and not suitiable to be called brunch. And it was $35.00 per person. Defintiely not worth it.

This should have been done prior to opening in January, not while paying guests were \"stuck\" right at dinner time. They charged daily - $10 per day - for the wireless, but it only worked a few hours total. No one in the hotel could tell us how to connect. The business center was totally down as well.

We asked for consideration on the bill but were flatly and rudely turned down. The food in the restaurant, Clink, was overpriced and not very good.

When we pulled up to the Liberty Hotel, I thought \"wow - this is going to be a place I will never forget\". And it turns out I was right. Despite the fact that it was freezing outside, the minute we pulled up, a gentleman opened our car doors and helped us with our luggage. Once we went inside, we were greeted by one of the most amazing hotel lobbies you will ever see. Words cannot describe how unique the lobby is, so I am not even going to try. But take my word for it - it's an architectural wonder. Open and airy yet cozy and chic. Just beautiful. And because it was happy hour on a Friday, people were arriving to have drinks in the hotel's lobby bar. Needless to say, it was a bit crowded because this hotel is definitely a hot spot in Boston. Once we checked in (which, by the way, was very easy and quick), we went to our room and were amazed at how chic and cozy it was. A thick duvet on the bed was soft and inviting, as was the sunk-in bathtub and large flat screen television. This is definitely a room one could just lounge in for a day or two. After checking in, we went to the lobby for a drink. By this time, it was incredibly crowded in the lobby and all the tables were taken. We paid a premium for 1 glass of champagne ($25) but it was tasty! Then we went exploring in Boston! The great thing is that there is a subway stop directly next to the hotel. From there, you can get to central boston, or even take it to the JFK museum! In all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The stay was nice, the hotel was amazing and the location was wonderful!

STAFF: I never encountered a gruff staff member at the hotel. Being warmly greeted with champagne upon entering was a treat after coming in from the rain. The lobby is gorgeous, and I appreciated that the check-in desk was off to the side and unassuming. I had guests come up to my room before the game, and I didn't feel like the staff was staring me down. The doormen readily hailed a cab for you and escorted you under umbrellas to your cab, valet, etc. There is a simple touch screen phone that made calling down to the front desk a breeze, and they readily explained the $10.95 charge for internet when I asked. ACCOMODATIONS: The room was beautiful, again the little things count. For one thing, the umbrella in the closet in our room came in handy for the rainy days. There was an extremely soft and cozy throw on the bed that made you want to snuggle up while enjoying the view. The bed itself and the pillows were soft and comfortable. The shower being separate from the tub was a plus - while the tub was not extra long, it was deeper than a standard tub, and was more than sufficient for my needs. There was also a book rack on the tub, which was a nice touch and made me feel more at home. There were several mirrors - 3 in the bathroom(1 was a shaving mirror) and a full-length mirror outside the bathroom. There was an extra shelf along one of the mirrors in the bathroom that gave it a feel of a separate vanity. Another nice touch was the comfy robes and (disposable) slippers. I had hot water everytime I showered, and the water pressure was exceptional. The bellman offered to bring ice to my room immediately after bringing up our bags and I appreciated the real ice chest, not a cheap plastic bucket. There's a wonderful channel that plays light classical music and showcases art - adding to our relaxing stay. LOBBY - I enjoyed the atmosphere of the lobby, and didn't feel it was at all pretentious. On one afternoon, my husband and I sat in a pair of the leather chairs and ate ice cream while enjoying the rotunda, and one evening in the lobby we had cocktails in our jeans after the game. The main bar is in the lower lobby, so while there are people, bouncers, etc. when you first enter, you take ten steps to the escalators and are in huge main lobby. That being said, my stay was mid-week and I have nothing to vouch for the weekend crowd. The music was never an issue for me, and you can't hear it if you are staying in a tower room(I can't be sure about rooms in the main area). Everytime I was outside of my room I encountered a member of the cleaning staff fastidiously working in the background. Their work was evident - the lobby and hallways were pristine. - I did utilize the fitness center, and found it to be basic - the equipment was new, and of a familiar brand. There were headphones provided so you could access your preferred TV/Radio station on your treadmill/elliptical/bike in privacy - though the channel options were limited. Bottles of water were available in the workout room, as well (the same bottles that were $5 in your room, go figure!). Another nice touch was that they have complementary laundering of your workout clothes 1x during your stay. I worked out every day, so this was very nice - it wasn't openly advertised - but a quick call down to the front desk took care of it all for me. NEGATIVES: No establishment is perfect, not even a 5star. Our stay was amazing, and none of what I found wrong affected that. 1)The shower door didn't stick too well - but it wasn't an inconvenience as it still closed. 2)The pocket door to enter the bathroom was off-alignment, obviously due to constantly being opened incorrectly by guests - again, not an inconvenience as it still closed. 3)Not all Rooms have the greatest view, if you back up against the hospital/clinic - we had a partial view of an office. 4)If you have no other background noise, you may hear people in the hallways from your room. For some reason, there were several children staying on our floor and when their family came and left, we could hear them. We never heard anyone else but those children, though - and we never heard them in their rooms. FYI 1)I like to walk around the area, and while I didn't feel it was an unsafe neighborhood, the traffic on the street in front of the hotel was a constant flow. I didn't consider this a negative but felt it should be mentioned. 2) There were several restaurants within walking distance, and a 24-hour CVS across the street - which came in handy to avoid the $5 sodas in the mini-bar.", "Date": "March 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "sailorg", "Title": "\u201cNice Place but Strange\u201d", "Author": "sailorg", "ReviewID": "UR14325641", "Content": "This is a \"luxury hotel\". You will have a clean and well appointed room in a lovely area of town. However this place is strange. It used to be a jail and has a jail theme, which I don't find cute. Room service is \"solitary dining\" for example. Staff were ok, a little gruff sometimes, but this is Boston. There is a bar downstairs which people wait in line to get into! A hotel bar! Then people fill up the lobby and they play music pretty loud. I can't imagine trying to check in there on a Thur - Sat evening. When I walked back in after dinner saturday night it felt like Sex and City was shooting. But not in a cool way. Rather in a lame, this place is trying too hard to be Manhattan cool. If I want to go to a club, I'll go to a club. I go to my hotel to sleep. Also, they charge out the wazoo for anything extra. Internet is $12 a day, doesn't work well and no where could I find this price listed - not even when you click \"OK\" on your computer to get online. I don't like prices being hidden. Also no breakfast included. Next time, I'd stay at the new looking Holiday Inn a few blocks down that probably has a breakfast and internet included. My one big beef was they required a hold on my credit card for the total amount for my stay plus a few hundred in case I decided to drink a coke from the mini bar! That meant they had my credit card company hold $1400 on my account - basically reducing my credit limit by $1400 during my stay. I have never heard of this before and I thought the point of a credit card was that whatever I do, the hotel gets paid because that's the risk the credit card company takes on for getting paid interest. And even if you have a debit card w/ enough $$ in the bank to pay - you still need enough credit for their stupid hold.", "Date": "March 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Old Saybrook", "Title": "\u201cVery Interesting\u201d", "Author": "EVEOOldSaybrook", "ReviewID": "UR13960162", "Content": "One must try this place if coming to Boston, with $$$ to spend.

I agree with every reviewer who thought the valet parking price, in addition to a sizeable fee for your room, was a bit much. Ditto to the price tag for the food in the Clink, which was \"OK\", but not exceptional. Glad to see \"Buzzy's\" roast beef sandwich is alive and well. We had an exceptional view of the Charles River, with the Citgo sign still alive and well it seems. I would say that breakfast in the room was not special...when you are paying a delivery fee, a tax fee, and a gratuity of 18%, you don't expect the cream or the coffee to come to you from the pocket of the server! Not me, at least...it should be in a pewter creamer, at the least. The pancakes were on the cold side, and the syrup was in little jelly-like containers...not in pewter servers as one would expect. Champagne upon arrival is a nice touch. The room(s) seemed as though they were awaiting at least a touch of color...perhaps a fica tree in the parlor area.

Some great marketing minds must have been involved in the development too, lots of clever touches throughout.

If you're really into the nightlife scene, you'll LOVE the Liberty. Saturday nights the place has a line extending outside of the hotel (even in 20 degree weather) of people waiting to get into Alibi. We felt the clientele were a bit pretentious and were more than a little turned off. As for the hotel rooms, they are a little on the small side, but you are in a city, so have to expect that to some degree. Decor is fantastic - very modern, neutral colors. Bed is REALLY comfortable!
