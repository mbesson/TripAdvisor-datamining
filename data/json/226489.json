We weren't sure of the city and the things \"Vancouverites enjoy\" but David let us know IN DETAIL what and where to be, His personality and attention to ourselves as well as other guests we saw him dealing with was unbelievable...a real draw to coming back to this hotel for sure! The rest of the staff were also quite friendly but David definitely made an impresssion. There aren't too many extra's with the hotel, a small gym and average continental breakfast are a part of the rate...but the breakfast isn't much on variety.

It looks nice and has 24 hour concierge service. It has 2 elevators, but one is almost always not working; so you have to wait for the elevator constantly. The room came fully furnished, barely. I had 2 water glasses & 2 forks. Lots of cups, mugs and other cutlery, but I was constantly doing dishes to have a full setting. The \"high speed internet\" isn't high speed at all. A modem would have been faster. Plus it constantly kicks you off of your connection. The shower head was split and sprayed everywhere in the bathroom. So all my items that I didn't keep under the sink were wet all the time. The exercise equipment was so poorly maintained that the weight stacks stuck half way up. Mentioning it to the concierge didn't get it fixed, had to go buy some silicone lube to clean it myself (which I am sending them a bill for). Plus some of the equipment has broken welds and loose pivot anchors, so there will be a law suite any day due to negligence. They turn off the heat in the exercise room overnight, so expect to be freezing in the morning when you go to work out. The cleaning service comes whenever they feel like it, instead of regularly. Also, things seemed to go missing every time they came through. There were 3 light switches that did nothing. Plus there were way too many lights that only turned on with a button on the light. The telephones always hang up on whomever you are talking to as well as when you first pick up the receiver (I had over 40 calls dropped). The closet door was off the track, so it wouldn't open and close properly. Cheap wire rack closet rods, in the bedroom and hallway with only 2 hangers for the entire place.
