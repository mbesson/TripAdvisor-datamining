Hotel is located in a part of town with lots of traffic because it's close to the entrance to the Lincoln tunnel and the Javits Center is a couple blocks away. With that said it's location is also a plus because the Port Authority terminal and Penn Station are within walking distance. The best thing about being in this part of town is that feels a lot like NY did before it started it's latest renaissance of sleek condo towers and chic hotels and restaurants. In this part of town there are a pizza stand that has no sitting area, a classic bagel place, and small family owned bodegas and the best part is the price reflects it. Of course there are also the newer restaurants and other places trying to make it, but they are sprinkled throughout and not necessarily concentrated in one particular area. Picked this hotel after canceling a reservation at another nearby place. It was last minute and wound up being lucky because I got the last room. A couple came in as I was filling out paperwork and they were told the hotel was full. Whew! Although it was just me, I wound up with a room with 2 full size beds. The room was just big enough to fit both beds, TV console with TV, and small desk with chair. The room's decor seemed outdated. The bathroom was basic and not much to write home about. Breakfast was simple and the dining area was a bit small. Just got my little bit of food and ate up in the room. Again, plenty of options to eat around so just treat yourself elsewhere. For the price it was not bad but had I planned better probably could have found something better for less. Since it was just a place to sleep at night, no major complaints.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ljubljana, Slovenia", "Title": "\u201cExelent sleep & location, poor breakfast\u201d", "Author": "Nekdo", "ReviewID": "UR126133207", "Content": "Best value for money if you attend conference or event near Time Square.

So i went to the hotel expecting nothing. The rooms however were better than what I expected it to be. The bed mattress was pretty good. Only problems I had with the room was of course space, it's pretty tight. There is not alot of area to walk around in the room. Another problem I found is the carpet is not vacumed and also they don't put a plastic bag for the bin in the bathroom. A bag is like 10 cents, come on seriously. Now talking about breakfast. it's a rip off. a friend of mine(who was not staying at the hotel) had breakfast with us and they charged her $20. the breakfast is not worth $20- it's like cold food(bagels, juice, muffin) sometimes they have scrambled eggs and it tastes soo fake like powdered egg. another issue is the cleaners are the so called \"chefs\" at best western is kind of gross. Safety- there are no nearby hotels in that area so i was initially abit scared because I was travelling with friends. It's not that bad- there were these weird drunk ppl who were always at the 38th and 11th av(the intersection closest to the hotel) at 10pm, just have to look away and walk past them. that's the only tackle.

There's a gentleman's club a couple of buildings away, and lots of unsavory characters around the area, especially at night.

The room overall wasn't filthy dirty, but not clean either. The bed was clean enough to sleep in, but it was one of those experiences where I couldn't wait to shower when I got up out of it. The desk surface was slightly greasy, like it had not been cleaned in awhile. The front desk will not call a cab for you, you have to walk outside to call it yourself.

If you are looking for fancy amenities, look elsewhere. The room was small but by New York standards it was normal sized. The view was Westside industrial. As other reviewers mentioned there was train noise from the tracks below, but I don't think it was excessive. We have train noise regularly at our home near Detroit, and we get along OK. It's located west of 10th ave on 38 St., so it's 4 short blocks and 3 long blocks from Times Square, maybe 10 minutes. About the same distance from Penn Station. Those places are where you can catch subway trains, or there is frequent bus service on 9th and 10th Avenues. It's adequately close to public transportation in my opinion. We were assured by the clerk when we arrived that the neighborhood was safe, despite its gritty industrial location. We certainly had no incidents, and did feel relatively safe in the well-lit neighborhood. When we arrived on 38th Street we noticed a peculiar smell in the area and were a bit concerned. It turns out that a stable for carriage horses is just down the street from the hotel. So it turned out to be a horsey smell and ceased bothering us. One complaint I have is that the WiFi service was poor. At first it didn't work at all. I reported that to management, and they had it mostly fixed by morning. However, even then the performance from my room was very slow. It was also bad in the lobby, on my mobile computing devices, and also on the public computer terminal in the lobby, which was connected with WiFi. I was extremely underwhelmed by the hotel's attempt at providing a breakfast bar. I like a simple \"continental\" breakfast, but this barely qualified. We foraged at nearby groceries instead. The air conditioner worked ok except it made some extra noises that were sometimes bothersome. We should have reported the noises to management, but didn't, so that's really our own problem, I guess. The staff was friendly and responsive, so that's a plus if that's important to you. For example, they sent somebody up immediately when I reported I couldn't open the room safe.

I felt like I was in the wasteland of Cleveland, NOT Manhattan. The \"breakfast\" consisted of powdered eggs, no meat, dry cereal, and oranges and bananas. Good luck putting milk in your cereal because it says right on the carton \"extended shelf life.\" I felt like this was free lunch they used to give out in the hood in the summer. Did I say it was terrible?! I booked this hotel because it did have breakfast included, but ended up going to Dunkin Donuts or Market Diner on 43rd and 11th because I absolutely could not stomach this alleged food. The rooms were super small, even by NYC standards. And they smelled badly. I was convinced there was a water leak somewhere because even with the AC on, the windows open, and spraying mass amounts of air freshener, I could never shake the musty, mildew smell. I stayed here for 7 nights and the \"housekeeping\" only changed the sheets and gave us new towels-no vacuuming, no cleaning of any kind. Gee, thanks. They even left gum on the bathroom floor which is now on my slippers. Gross! Forget about checking out early because they charge you $1 per bag to keep an eye on your bags. Seriously. There is also only one-that's right-ONE elevator which is used by not only the guests but also the entire housekeeping staff. So, as if the funk emanating from ever corner of the hallway wasn't enough, you also have to endure this pain whilst waiting for the elevator for about 5-10 minutes only to find there is no room for you because of a huge cleaning cart. There is an Amtrak train that runs directly under the hotel, which is exposed. Therefore, you hear horns starting at about 7:30 a.m. every. single. day. That was worse than the 24-hour taxi repair shop, who drills constantly. But wait-there's more!! Ya know the pretty little horses you see in Central Park pulling carriages? Guess where their stable is? That's right. About 50 feet to the right of this hotel. So you also get to see horse slave labor in action. When you walk in this hotel, you can either walk down about 10 steps or take the elevator. The elevator ONLY goes to the lobby and back. But the door doesn't shut, so please, just walk the steps. And it screeches. The internet didn't work some days, and you are advised to call an 800-number, which ALSO does not work. The bed itself was comfortable, but not the pillows. They were about the size of throw pillows. I would guess the bed size was a full or queen although we booked a king. Whatever-I was scared to leave the room and ask for another one because it could have been worse. The neighborhood also kind of sucks. You are going to have to walk 4 blocks to either 34th or 42nd to get on the train, then another 2.5 blocks to get to 8th Ave. It's definitely not scary or anything, but it's shady nonetheless. What, with all the various car mechanics, horsemen, and Amtrak horns. The Taj Mahal this place is NOT. I honestly don't even see how they can claim they are a 2-star hotel. I would give it 0.5 and that is being generous. Once again, in case you skimmed this review, the main point lies here: DON'T DO IT!

We were with elderly parents so walking and subway were out of the question, which made the location of this hotel a bit problematic. We couldn't walk to Chelsea or mid-town for meals.

Clean, in good repair, plenty of street lights, fancy apartment buildings a block away, etc. If you are driving into the city, it couldn't be more convenient - a straight shot down the Henry Hudson Parkway from the GW Bridge or two blocks from the Lincoln Tunnel.

On our last night, we had a very nice taxi driver, so we asked him if he would like to come pick us up and take us to the airport the next day; he gave us his phone number, we called him the next day, he was there in 10 minutes. The ride from/to JFK is a flat rate of $45 + $5 toll = $50 + tip. Other amenities of the hotel include ice machine, ATM, computer in lobby for internet, and elevator. The hotel will hold your luggage for you for $1.00 per person/luggage (technically we had 8 \u201cpieces\u201d of luggage, but he kind of counted them together and charged us $4.00.) The staff were all nice, friendly, helpful. The hotel was clean, comfortable, and I felt safe (even though it doesn\u2019t LOOK like the best part of town). MISC. NOTES: There is an Amtrak train that runs close to the hotel. We only heard the train twice while we were there.

On 38th, between 10th and 9th there is a little fire station, which is neat to see. There were some memorials from 9/11 which was both sad, yet, a little historic. Also, from that same location, you can see the top of the Empire State Building (so pretty at night, all lit up). Our first day there, we needed just a light lunch, so we took a walk & found a place called \u201cBurgers and Cupcakes\u201d (on 9th, between 35th & 36th). It was good food, but for $6.50 we we\u2019re expecting our burgers to be bigger than the ones at McDonald\u2019s\u2026pretty close size, but MUCH better quality! The sweet potato fries were delicious! There were several different kinds of cupcakes, like red velvet, carrot cake, yellow, and chocolate ($2.50 for a regular sized one, $3.50 for a larger one).

There was no rubber bath mat nor was there a towel type mat in the bathroom. A set of towels for each of us was provided, with no extra towel. He looked at the bottom of the tub, and there were faint gray ovals on the bottom of the tub. He assumed that this meant that it was a non-slip surface by looking at it, especially since no mat was provided. He turned on the water, and then started to get into the shower. His foot slipped out from under him and he fell heavily to the floor, taking the shower curtain and its rings with him. He fell with such force that the mirror fell from the wall above the sink, broke against the edge of the sink, and then landed on top of him. (The mirror was attached to the wall with only two small flat clips.) Small pieces of the mirror cut his chest, legs, hands, and near his ear. These were all small cuts, nothing major, and I always pack band-aids just to be on the safe side. Luckily he was not badly hurt, especially when you are talking about a 61 year old man falling in the manner that he did. I called the front desk and told them what had happened. A gentleman came up and tried to clean up the shards from the mirror, but there were small pieces that he was unable to get up with the broom. I called the front desk while he was in the room and asked if we could move to another room since the bathroom floor wasn\u2019t safe to walk on without shoes, but I was told that no other room was available that evening. The man who came to help us got us a new shower curtain and brought up some ceiling tiles to put on the floor along with some extra towels. He couldn\u2019t find any shower curtain rings, so he brought me some pieces of string for me to use to put the shower curtain up. I had cleaned up the blood with the wash cloth and he told me to just put that in the trash can, which I did. The next morning I went down to the front desk and asked to speak to the manager. I was told that he would not be in until Monday morning. Our phone number was taken down and I was given a card with the hotel information on it. I asked the man at the desk to please let housekeeping know that the floor really needed to be carefully mopped since there were still tiny pieces of mirror on the floor. This was done. No new shower curtain rings were put up; the mirror was not replaced. We were given a towel type bath mat. On Sunday morning we went to the front desk to check out and were told that a $130 charge for the mirror and a $10 charge for the curtain rings were added to our bill since we broke them. Once again I went through the entire account, and the young woman then removed the charges, but we were told that they might be put back on our bill on Monday. I reiterated that we wanted the manager to call us. Our daughter noticed that the notes that were sitting on the front desk had highlighted the statement that we broke the mirror, not that there was a fall and the mirror fell off the wall and broke on top of my husband.. This entire ordeal has left us extremely disappointed with Best Western Hotels. To begin with, this event never should have occurred. You either provide your guests with a bath mat of some sort, or your tubs have non-slip surfaces. You should also mount your mirrors with a stronger type of anchoring system than what was used. If and when an unfortunate event like this does occur, you do not bill your guests for damages that occurred through no fault of their own. We were upset that this happened to him to begin with, and billing us for the mirror and shower curtain rings made matters a hundred times worse. All that my husband wanted to do was take a shower safely. That certainly is not too much to ask of a hotel. The manager has yet to call us, and it is over a week since this happened. He told the Best Western people to say that he was sorry. They have also asked him repeatedly to call us. The charges were not added back on to the bill, and the owner did not make any other adjustment to our charges to compensate us for this.

It isn't terribly well-lit, but I never really felt unsafe walking back to the hotel at 3am. That said, if I were a female and alone, I would exercise a little bit of caution. 2) Only one elevator for the entire hotel. It's a smaller hotel but it went out for a little while when we were leaving and we had to walk down 10 flights of stairs. 3) If you could get a room for $100/night (taxes included), I would probably recommend this hotel. However, I don't really know if that's a feasible price point. They advertise for roughly $220/night plus taxes, which is outrageous. I would stay in 20 other hotels in the city before this one at ~$260/night. Summary: I don't think I would stay here again, if only because of the bed situation.

There is train path close to the hotel, each night, we would be waked up few times by the passing train noises. For price over $300.00 for the condition in NYC, it is much over priced. Our terrible experience came to the day of check out. First of all, it was our mistake remembering wrong check out date. We thought the check out date was 28 but it actually was 27. We came back to hotel at around 8:00PM, and the room was locked out. We came to the front desk and were told that we already passed the check out time, and would be charged a full day rate for the day and let us leave immediately. I talked to the on site manager that it was a mistake we made, and If we charged the full day rate, we should have the room for the night. But the manager told me that all the rooms were sold out, I can not get any room. I thought that the person who booked our room had not checked in yet, if we move out at this time, we actually not cause any financial lose to the hotel, I asked for a discount/half day charge if we can not stay at the night. I get refused, too. I asked to speak to the senior manager, The on-site manager talked to the senior manager over the phone, and told me that the senior manager was angry and yelling at him, so the price increased from 299.00 to 375.00 due to my asking for talking to the senior manager. This is ridicules! The total charge is 428.65 include tax for the late check out and we even can not have the room for the night!

The staff was friendly and low key. I loved the internet access. The place is indeed new, if a bit small. The bed was firm, and the bathroom, clean. The bed won't kill you and they have continental breakfast if you like such food. I was ready for the neighborhood, in fact, I have been visiting New York every 2-3 years more than 30 years, and understand this is an industrial neighborhood, for tourists on a budget. There was plenty of parking on the street. I had no problem taking buses or the subway during my entire stay, and best of all I walked just one block to the convention center. The surroundings are drab to put it mildly. The term \"Industrial\" sugar-coats the fact that #1, there are no nearby restaurants until you walk to 9th ave, and #2, there are bags of trash waiting to be picked on the street. Sadly, the taxi driver will be able to locate the hotel faster if you tell him to look for a giant inflatable rat (the product of a labor dispute) in front of the building. Since the hotel sign is the tiniest I've ever seen on a Best Western, the rat makes a great landmark. At night, the lobby light provides the best illumination on W 38th street. Once inside the lobby, the flight of stairs right in front of you will prompt you to negotiate your luggage to the registration desk, without noticing an elevator to your right. Speaking of elevators, the hotel's only elevator broke during my stay, making me suddenly glad they had placed me on the sixth floor. It seems the company greedily crammed as many rooms as possible in the small frame of this hotel. The rooms are small. Don't expect a big lobby or anonymity. There isn't. The tiny breakfast area means you have to elbow your way to continental breakfast. I cannot complain about internet access. Their wi-fi was reliable and fast. I was there in November, and the cooling/heating system was clean and efficient, warming up the room almost instantly. For a hotel in this price range, the bed sheets, pillows (only 2) and cover were rough. The bed was firm if again, a bit small, it seemed like ours was a full instead of a queen size bed. The diminutive bathroom was clean, but there were mold spots in the tub's caulking in the two rooms I saw. In the 1st room the toilet sat strangely low for a person my size (5'4\"), in fact, my knees were higher than my rear end. The second room had a normal toilet. The best rooms are above the 8th floor, and look westward, since their biggest problem is noise. Not only is the hotel located right by some train tracks, I was awakened at 7:00 AM inside my north-facing room by construction sounds and the noise of the giant rat being inflated. There is a large construction site next to this lilliputian hotel.When I complained, the staff promptly found me another room one floor above. The second room was quieter because it faced south, and I was able to sleep in a bit. In short, if you're a small-framed business traveler who needs to be close to the Javitz, and if you need to be up before 7:00 AM to get to work, this is a good value.

Stay at Motel 6 before this place. The previous reviews are very accurate. It is situated on 38th st very close to the convention center. I booked this hotel on priceline for $70/night. This is a great price for NYC and always book with priceline as I have never had a problem with any of the hotels they have given me. I am far from picky. Unlike some guests, I had no problems with the lobby or with check in. Upon going up to our room on the second floor, we were very unimpressed with its condition. The curtains were falling off the hangers and we noticed the main recessed lights was out as well as stale cigarette smoke permeating the room. We called down to the front desk to ask if we could move to another room. They said they had none but did send up an asian man who spoke NO english who handed us a light for a lamp. I said no and pointed to the ceiling and he just left. A few minutes later, he came back with a light (no ladder). Since he was about 5 ft tall, I just took it and changed it myself. The following AM we were introduced to their horrible breakfast. They only have about 10 tables for everyone and served brown bananas (yummy) and stale looking doughnuts as well as plain bagels. They had a limited selection of cereal and only had whole milk?? Who drinks whole milk. I heard one lady ask for some butter for her bagel and one of the workers said they had been out for over a week! That evening, I called down for an extra blanket as my wife was cold. The blanket never came. I also asked for a 7 am wake up call so we could get an early start. The wake up call came the following morning at 7:25 am. 25 minutes late....lucky I didnt have to catch a plane. We didnt oversleep, however, as we had a prompt wake up call from all the banging from the 24 hr cab repair shop just across the street. One night when we were passing by the front desk, we overheard one of the staff who was on her cell phone calling one of her friends a stupid [--]. NICE. Not to mention this hotel is horribly located. They have to be selling drugs out of the 24 hr cab repair place. We also had the pleasure of seeing multiple prostitutes just two blocks away from the hotel on our way back. We felt very unsafe in the area and woud recommend carrying a gun. The only positive aspect of this hotel is the $70/night price.

I walked in and was first greeted with a terribly hot and muggy lobby area, that lacked any a/c whatsoever. My room was on the second floor, and even though I asked for non-smoking and was assured that my request was honored, my entire floor overwhelmingly reaked like stale smoke. I entered my room only to find out that, after I was finished gagging from the odor, that I couldn't walk around without shoes on because the floor was soaked. The curtains were broken off the hooks and wouldn't close all the way, leaving no privacy against the 24-HOUR cab repair shop right across the street, which made loud, obnoxious noises through the entirety of the night. My blow-dryer started sparking profusously after it was on for about two minutes, and smelled like I lit something on fire. The bedspread had cigarette burn-holes on it, and the front desk staff had the knowledge of a door knob and the speed of immobile 90-year-olds. A half a block down the road was a horse and buggy area, which was lovely enough to fill our nostrils with the smell of urine and manure right after they emptied the smoke smell of our hotel room. The location is mildly convenient if you are in the city to go to the convention center, but not convenient to anything else. I didn't feel safe walking around the area during the daytime, and saw two lovely hookers on one of our walks toward Time Square, not to mention other spooky crowds. You are far better off staying somewhere like the Milford Plaza, which is comparitvely priced, and provides a shuttle to the convention center.

The front desk clerk told us that they are going to be building up that area soon so that's good to hear. The rooms were small but appeared to be re-done recently.

We actually walked from Grand Central to the hotel (about a 1/2 hour walk) in slushy weather, but we braved it! We met more friends from London at Time's Square which probably took us about 10 minutes to walk to and partied at local Irish Pub's on 9th Street/Ave? which seemed to be less crowded than your Time's Square area (and cheaper). Felt safe walking in the area at night - there are a few late night/quick bite places nearby (hot dogs/pizza) on 9th. Room was yes, small, but very clean and we had no problems with the room at all. We tried to check in earlier than the 3:00 p.m. check-in, but that didn't happen, but when we returned, we got our rooms and were not disappointed with them (all 3 sets of us).

First of all, the location is great if you don't mind walking a bit. It is true that there are not a lot of restaurants or bars directly in the area, but a five to ten minute walk remedies that. The garage across the road is a bit of an eyesore, but the noise from it was minimal. At no time did we feel unsafe walking around the area. They validate parking at a cost of $21 a day (that's phenomenal) at a lot about 5 minutes from the hotel. The staff was extremely cordial and accomodating (we needed to switch rooms after one night, and this was done no problem); the rooms although small, were clean and very nice, and the CONTINENTAL breakfast was decent and very substantial.
