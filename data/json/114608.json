A rebranded historical hotel in downtown Chicago. Formally known as the Cass Hotel (that what all the cabbies call it), it is a 1920 hotel with the small room you would expect for something built during that period. The staff was outstanding , desk staff greated people by name, bell men were always around to hail a cab or take a bag, the housekeeping staff always said hello and smiled. Every request during my 5 day stay was met with a smile. For a older hotel the breakfast space was ample, and due to the location it seconds for a relaxing lounge space. If you have a group this would be the place to meet, the rooms are too small for guest to hang out comfortably. Food was hot and on schedule. They are having issues with the key cards. Many guest including myself had to have keys remade several times. I hope they fix this soon. It might be worth calling before booking if this would be a real inconvenience for you trip. Location could not be better. Just a few blocks north of the river, there is many options for food and drink. Catch the Second City History of Chicago show in old town. The hotel is two blocks from the red line. Using the subway it is less than 10 minutes from the door to inside the loop. The few homeless are found a couple of blocks south toward the loop area. It is customary in the area to have your left over boxed up and pass them to the homeless on your walk home. Just meet their eye and they will politely ask you if you have leftovers. I always received a warm thank you for my generosity. Parking is a bit expensive, $40 valet, and $39 self park. Taxi from the airport is only $38 and the blue line is only $5. So unless you need a car, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bring one.

The room is very high tech, huge TV, lots of outlets, night-reading lamps on the bed, brand new carpet, wonderful high-pressure shower head and even a safe.

There's no ramp to get the stroller up; I had to get help from either my husband or the doorman if he were available every time.

All of the staff over our entire 4 day stay were very friendly. The room was nice and clean. It would have been a great room if we didn't have a baby with us. It was too tiny for our family. We had to set up the pack and play in the hallway next to the door and the bathroom. Also, we had a ton of noise from the hallway. I'm not sure if it was a particularly loud group of people (they were shouting) or if the walls are that thin. The bathroom was kinda small, but serviceable and clean. There was a coffee pot in the room and a nice flat-screen TV, but no fridge or anything. There was also a nice little bench seat that gave it a cozy feel. Breakfast was good. There were quite a few tables, but they were kinda busy and not many empty ones. They had a good mix of hot and cold things.

We chose this hotel because one person in the group booked his room through an opaque site and paid about $120 a night. Booking through the Holiday Inn website, the same room was $206 a night before tax (and that was the discounted, noncancelable, prepay-in-advance rate). So one of the rooms was a great deal and the other two were on the expensive side. We were left with a bad impression of the hotel before we even arrived when one member of our group was double-charged for her room (she had paid in advance). When she saw the extra charge on her credit card account and called the hotel, the person she spoke to was totally uninteresting in helping her, told her that the hotel didn't have any record of the extra charge, and advised her to dispute the charge with her credit card company. She did that and got it removed, but I thought it was extremely poor customer service for the hotel to make a mistake and then tell her it wasn't their job to fix it. The property itself was very nice, and the location was excellent. After reading the reviews others have posted, here are my thoughts: the rooms are definitely small, but tolerable. I doubt many people stay here just to stay in their rooms all day anyway. The decor is very modern and up-to-date, and I liked that the hotel had character and wasn't just a cookie-cutter Holiday Inn. I know others have complained about noise, both from other rooms and outside, but IMHO it wasn't a problem. Our room was on the side of the hotel near the garage door that beeps every time it opens, but I don't recall hearing the alarm from inside the room. The front desk staff who checked us in were very friendly and welcoming, so it seems that this hotel does have good employees; the guy who wasn't at all interested in resolving the double-charge just isn't one of them, I guess. I was offered a late checkout which we didn't end up needing (regular checkout is noon, which was great). I used the valet service, which at $40 a day was expensive...but then again, what do you expect for parking in downtown Chicago? I did see that the nearby parking garage charged $33 a day for self-parking, so you won't save too much by doing it yourself. Also, the hotel valet service includes in-and-out privileges. The valet guys were friendly and reasonably quick. As for cleanliness, we had no complaints except one that was pretty inexcusable. One of our friends found nail clippings in his ice bucket. I don't know how the hotel reacted when he complained, but regardless - that's disgusting. In general, I'd recommend this hotel if you can get a good deal on it.

The hotel is located within walking distance of Michigan Avenue and many shops. The Navy Pier is also close by. The hotel may be a great place to stay for people who like to shop, but be aware that you might not have much room to store your purchases once you get back to your room.

These rooms are QUITE small. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about the size of a college dorm room with barely large enough space for two people to move around. I cannot imagine having a family of four staying in one room. We spent two nights in this hotel and it was enough. Our room had a small built-in couch where we had to put our suitcase because there was nowhere else to put it. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m certainly glad we only had one suitcase. The closet was small and included a knee-high metal dresser inside. With the dresser taking up most of the area in the closet, there was very little space left to hang up any clothes. The bathroom had a tiny shelf over the sink, but it was barely wide enough to hold a tube of toothpaste, a toothbrush and a comb. Most of the time, my stuff ended up falling into the sink. Sure while on vacation, people spend most of their time out and about seeing the sights, but when I come back to a hotel after a long day, I would like to have a little bit of breathing room. I felt as if my husband and I were constantly climbing over each other. When we first got into our room, it was very warm. I tried to adjust the air conditioner, but it seemed to be broken. I called the front desk and within ten minutes a maintenance man came to check on the problem. It turned out to be nothing more than a flipped breaker. I quickly discovered, however, why the air conditioner had been turned off. The system made a loud rattling noise which woke me up every time the system started or stopped. Even though our room was on the 11th floor, I got very little sleep during our two-night stay. There was constant noise from the street--late-night horn blowing and women yelling outside the hotel at 3:00 a.m. I have been to New York City on several occasions and the noise in Times Square isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as loud as what I encountered during my stay at The Hotel Cass.

The hotel is clean, the staff is very nice and helpful, but I would not stay here again if my husband and I were traveling by ourselves. The rooms are just too small and the constant city traffic noise can be quite annoying when trying to sleep. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind city noise or small rooms than this hotel is perfectly fine.

From check-in to check-out all the staff were exceedingly friendly - nothing seemed to be too much trouble, and everyone from door men to housekeeping all seemed keen to ensure things were just right during your stay. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor and layout of this hotel makes it somewhat unique amongst the normally cookie-cutter Holiday Inn Express chain - yes it's an old building, but that gives it some charm. The rooms are small/compact, but no more so than I've experienced in other cites such as New York. There are only two elevators, which means it can sometimes take a while for your call to be answered during busy periods (such as breakfast etc), but again that's to be expected in a property of this kind - it's unfortunate, but you have to be realistic. I loved the room decor, and the flat-screen TV. The bathroom was also nice, and the shower powerful. The free and functioning internet was also useful! The breakfast selection was pretty typical for this chain, with fruit, yoghurt, cereal, pastries. bagels and hot dishes (varying selections of omelettes, scrambled egg, bacon, sausage patties, biscuits, gravy depending on the day) with juices, teas and coffees - it was more than sufficient to start the day. The cinnamon buns are a definite recommendation. The location, right off the Magnificent Mile is superb, with tons places to eat, drink and shop. Combined with excellent transit routes, it meant that Chicago was pretty much at your fingertips. If you don't feel like eating out, check out Trader Joes across the street, or Jewel-Osco a block away for some cheap eat in options/snacks/sodas. One small thing which made me smile: the soda machine on the 2nd floor charged $1.50 for a 20oz bottle. Why I smiled? It was cheaper than the local stores.

PRICE: We actually booked through HotWire, so we didn't know which hotel we were getting until after we paid. It was only USD$59/night though, which is amazing value when you consider its location and star-rating (3 1/2). We checked the hotel website after booking and saw that rooms were going from $300 - so if you can get a deal like we did, it is excellent value. LOCATION: We took the airport shuttle which was expensive ($20 each, one-way) and took us more than an hour to reach the hotel (we had to drop other people off along the way). But the hotel is located just off Magnificent Mile, on Wabash Avenue. There are plenty of shops (and nice ones, too!) and eating places. It is easy to get to public transport and you could probably walk to a lot of places. ROOM: The room was TINY. Probably one of - if not the - smallest hotel rooms I have stayed in. The bed was nice and large, which took up most of the room and meant only one person at a time could walk past it. There was a narrow cupboard and a window seat (which we just chucked our bags on top of) and the bathroom again was tiny. However the room size did not matter so much to us, as we were there to sight-see and visit friends. Also, for what it lacked in size, it made up for in cleanliness. It was spotless, and the bathroom was sparkling. There was also a brand new LCD flat-screen television with free cable. The decor was contemporary and trendy (including the very interesting wallpaper in the bathroom!) AMENITIES: This hotel had a lot of extras that made our stay more pleasant. They provide a small coffee machine and free tea and coffee bags in rooms, which meant if we woke up late and missed breakfast we at least could make a coffee. There was a free hot and continental buffet breakfast every day downstairs, which meant we could fill up on that and not have to spend too much on lunch. There was complimentary high-speed wireless (we have a laptop) that we accessed from our room - and when we needed to print something we were able to use the free computers downstairs (and we didn't pay to print either). They have a fitness center, but we didn't use it. Room service is provided by a local restaurant between certain hours. We ordered in the first night and they delivered to our room door (just keep in mind that after 11pm you would have to go downstairs to collect the food as they won't let people up). SERVICE: The staff were always friendly and personable - from the doormen to the manager on desk. Every time we entered the hotel we were greeted cheerfully by the staff, which may seem like a small thing but it was really appreciated. The doorman also called a taxi for us on the day we left for the airport and negotiated a flat rate ($40) which would have been exactly what we paid for the shared shuttle - so make sure you ask if they can do that for you! One night our remote for the TV wasn't working; we called downstairs and they sent someone up within minutes with a new remote. The cleaning staff always did a nice job and the rooms were turned down daily and bathroom cleaned thoroughly as well. We travel on a budget, so if we could get this hotel again at such a great deal I would definitely stay here. One feels very safe here; after a certain time you need your key to enter the building and the elevator up to the rooms. Although the rooms are small (which doesn't matter if you are only sleeping there), the staff and the extras they throw in make the stay at Hotel Cass - Holiday Inn Express a wonderful place to stay.

General: The hotel occupies a small footprint of real estate. There are 16 floors indicated on the elevator. Everything is small, so keep that in mind.

However, if youare wanting to lounge around your room during the day, this is not the place for you. My room on the 4th floor was a king locaed on the interior of the building.

A flat panel TV was mounted at the side of the bed, best viewed from a small sitting bench. The bathroom was small, but comfortable. A very nice tub / shower was easy to access. A hairdryer was kept under the sink. The sink was a nice deep model with great water flow. As noted throughout the hotel, the room clearly had recently been remodeled. The room included a coffe maker, iron and ironing board, small closet and safe. Wireless high-speed internet was provided (free). Furnishings and decor: The decor and furnishings were bizarre. While the overall appearence is clean and well maintained, the furnishings are straight out of the 60's and the \"house of tomorrow\" look. Trust me, the furniture was ugly and uncomfortable in the 60's and it still is now. The bench in the room that sufices for a sofa was more uncomfortable than a pew in a Quaker church. The \"table\" in the room was a moveable flat top mushroom that might hold one plate. The hotel would be well advised to change decor soon. Staff: Helpful and courteous. The doormen were great. The desk staff were all efficient though not neccesarily warm. Value: The room rates went up $80 a night during my stay, so I am not sure the costs are any better than some other nearby well-known properties. You would have to investigate that more when booking. Overall: Clean, comfortable and quiet. Good breakfast. Small rooms that meet your basic needs -- not for lounging however. Elevators (two) are smallish. They are operated by your room key card. Expect a long wait during the breakfast time. Breakfast: The free breakfast is very nice with a good selection. On busy days, you may have trouble finding a place to sit.

The elevator was fast for me, but you needed to use your door key card. it sometimes didn't read on the first try, but one it did, the trip was fast. Elevator music included Bjork and the Smiths, to give you an idea of the type of customers they're targeting, or at least the tastes of the staff. A few minor nits: the breakfast was the standard HIE, but the first morning there was no yogurt and the two days they had omelets, many were overdone almost to the point of being burnt. My TV (HC LCD) had trouble with a few channels, one of them ESPN. And the square, flat sink basin ran a little slow (not sure if it was partially clogged or because of the design.) However, if you're only going to be sleeping in your room, it's a pretty good deal. A very convenient location with a variety of stores & restaurants nearby, and a subway stop a few blocks away.

The hotel staff we met were excellent, both the front desk personnel and the two doormen (the doormen were really top notch). We thought the breakfast was great for being included in the room price - they had all the regular colds (danishes/muffins/bagels/cereals/yogurt/fruit), plus bacon/sausage/gravy/eggs. The eggs were not hot, so that wasn't good, but the rest was very good. We walked to Ed Debovics (daughter loved this place), Giardano's Pizza, Lawry's Prime Rib, Michigan Avenue, the Lego Store, plus much, much more. Short cab rides (under $8) got us to Sears Tower, Navy Pier and Macy's State Street. This hotel is so centrally located, that for the price, unless you are claustrophobic, it is a definate must .", "Date": "December 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Pole, Alaska", "Title": "\u201cIt's easy to reccomend this hotel\u201d", "Author": "hoser9", "ReviewID": "UR11924045", "Content": "This property goes well beyond HIE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation of a Spartan & no frills approach to room amenities and locale. As a platinum Priority Awards member, I stay at many IC properties every year, and this was the best property I stayed at this year by far (sorry Holiday Inn SFO Golden Gateway). This property doesn't look like a Holiday Inn Express except for the \"Holiday Inn Express\" signage above the front door. A doorman opened the door and welcomed us, leading us to the very impressive and simple d\u00c3\u00a9cor in the front lobby. I arrived at 1000hrs and was promptly checked in with my traveling companion without incident. The front desk staff weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t snide or rude by any means, but were rather quite proficient and genuine I must say. Some properties you can get great service and understand how they can be rude to other travelers that submit reviews on here, but I really didn't see how that could be possible, with the front desk clerks that I dealt with, at least. The front desk staff were not abrupt or rude, neither were they obnoxious or phony. After the entire checkin process, they even asked if I have \"any questions about the local area\", and a map was offered. We were assigned room 605. The hallways were extremely small and cramped and so was the room. There was enough space to walk and leave my luggage. The usage of a flat screen tv (with HD channels!) was a good choice. Despite the small size, the room made very good use of space. The double bed was spacious, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all I care about. Remember that this is central Chicago, not suburban Kansas, so the rooms are going to be sized accordingly. The decoration of the room was incredible and way beyond what you would expect for a HIE. The bathroom was small but the usage of a wall mounted counter was wise. The shower was great but the inner shower curtain was full of mildew. Otherwise, no complains with the maintenance. The view from the room was, well, claustrophobic. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind it too much and I think it was kind of nice and a bit charming, to be honest. Everything in the room worked; plugins, 802.11, lights, climate control, everything. I always find holiday inn express hotels to have the best service due to the simple approach to the manner in which they operate. However, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Cass\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 went way beyond what I have experienced with past HIE properties. The property\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doorman acted way more professionally and genuinely than doormen that I have seen at a Westin or Hyatt. He would offer to summon cabs, ask if you knew where you were going, he would even say 'welcome back' when I drunkenly stumbled into the hotel at 9pm. Service all around was great. I wasn't very demanding this trip, however, so I cannot say how good the service can get. The breakfast area was superb; at any hour (even after drinks at the late hour of, yes, 9pm) you can help yourself to coffee, tea, milk, and yogurt. There were even two computers that you can use (gratis) which are hidden behind the breakfast lounge. What I think would be a nice touch for this space that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largely vacant 20 hours a day is if they had evening snacks, maybe even an honor bar? I know it's not very holiday inn express\u00e2\u20ac\u2122y, but it would be very boutique. The breakfast was also great, albeit of no nutritional value except the bananas. There was cereal, cinnamon buns, and a \"hot food coming soon!\" sign where the hot food should go. Along with the lack of any nutritional breakfasts, my beef is that this breakfast only ran from 0630-0930, but I suppose this caters best to their business traveler/middle aged tourist demographic that dominates this hotel. Check out was great. Hours before checkout, we asked for a late check out of 1600hrs, but we were told that we would have to pay a half day rate for this. I asked the latest free check out that we could get which was 1330hrs. I played the 'I'm platinum' card and they pushed over to 1500hrs. I think that was a fair compromise (although it's a long stride from the westin's 4pm no questions asked guarantee). The check out was under 60 seconds and without incident. The location was amazing, you had a jewel osco for your grocery and cheap liquor needs four blocks south west, CTA three blocks (grand/state station?) south and west, mag mile three blocks east, and lots of great places to eat within blocks. the Hancock Observatory and MCA are very close to the east as well. Tip with the Hancock Observatory: go to the bar and buy a $12 (triple) martini. Not only do you get a drink for the same price as one in Toronto or some other Scandinavian/Canadian city, you can enjoy it from the 95th floor overlooking Chicago in a very unpretentious environment (dress business casual at least, unless you want to look like an [--]). Besides, it's the same cost as admission to the family-filled observatory anyways. Apart from my suggestions that the breakfast should run later, evening snacks would be a nice touch, and that the shower curtain in 605 needs to get changed (badly), nothing could have gone better. This property will be my first choice for a future stay in Chicago at any rate. The managers here know how to run a hotel and it shows. Book this property, you will not regret it. And if the other reviews deter you: remember that this is a Holiday Inn Express, not a W. If you pay $150/night, you get $150/night in amenities. If you want the W, fork over $400/night.", "Date": "December 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berkeley, CA", "Title": "\u201cIt's hard to recommend this hotel\u201d", "Author": "dalialuna", "ReviewID": "UR11514749", "Content": "My friend and I stayed at the Hotel Cass in October 2007.

Otherwise, it would've been $330. Unfortunately, I saw nothing substantial that accounted for the mark-up. The rooms at the Cass are very, very small, ideal for small folks with little luggage. Despite its size, my room was newly redone along IKEA lines. But it was tight with 2 double beds. The rooms are so small they're uninviting. They're not meant to be relaxed in. The Cass made sense before as a budget hotel (then a room was $80 a night) that provided a place to lay your head but no more. Unfortunately the hipster decor couldn't remedy the situation. Also, half of my floor was still under renovation and big fans were working 24/7 to dry some paint. One morning, I woke up to an electric drill. On both mornings that I was there, I was also unable to open my door from the inside. Maintenance staff said the door was stuck to its frame because the paint wasn't dry and the old wooden door had expanded from the humidity. It was a lot of inconvenience for $220 a night.

One can be kind of finicky so he wasn't really thrilled with the hotel (until he found out how much money we saved, and used on good food and wine later!) and the other has traveled all over the world and is a little more forgiving. Make sure to take your own travel size shampoo and conditioner, and taking your own towel isn't a bad idea. Or just buy a Chicago souvenir beach towel on your first day and use that. The towels definately need replaced. The beds are small, but the linens are clean and the beds are comfy. My remote control didn't work great, I think it needed a new battery, but I didn't come to Chicago to watch TV, so I made do. The rooms are small, actually tiny. If you ever traveled to Europe during college on a budget, then you probably stayed at hotels just like this one. But the best thing about the hotel is it's location. You are only a block or two from some of the best food, shopping and nightlife in the US. Go with VERY low expectations and you won't be disappointed. The neighborhood is safe, the hotel is well maintained overall, and I felt very safe there. The staff was very accomodating. My purse was stolen (be careful...Chicago is a thief/scammer paradise...don't put your purse over the back of your chair, do NOT stop for anyone offering a shoe shine, and don't set your purse at your feet) and the staff was so helpful with calling the police, letting me make calls and use the internet to get all my cards cancelled.

The air conditioning worked perfectly, the beds were comfortable, and hot water was ready in seconds despite our location on the ninth floor. My wife brought her own towels, leaving me the hotel towels. Yes, they were thin, but two of them dried me just fine.

Discounted rate of $19 a day but we paid $35 a day for parking at another downtown hotel. The Cass is close to so many stores (you can see Nordstrom from the hotel) and restaurants and there are 2 Redline El stops within a short walking distance if you want to venture outside of downtown. I wished I would have known about the Cass Hotel before blowing all kinds of money on big name, big price Chicago hotels. My experience at the Cass was excellent and I have already booked a room for my next visit to Chicago.", "Date": "November 2, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat location on a Budget\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2792967", "Content": "It has no ammenities and looks a little sketchy when you first enter but the rooms were immaculate and the location is prime.

After finding the Cass hotel online, we knew it would not be five star accommodations, but the location looked good and the hotel was cheap ($94). We saw some of the negative reviews but gave it the benefit of the doubt. The rooms are tiny, dirty and disgusting. And yes, the towels are very thin and scratchy. To elaborate here is an account of the nine horrible hours we stayed at the Cass Hotel: After seeing the rooms, we complained and were moved up to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153suites\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the 16th floor. They will not tell you that they have the suites\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6they are reserved for the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family in case they come into town. The suites were actually nice with remodeled bathrooms. The pictures on the website are of suites and not the regular rooms. When we arrived one of the two elevators was being worked on. Later that evening, after it was supposedly fixed, it dropped five floors when we were in it. Shortly after someone else was stuck in it. Yet, we stayed on\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Even later that evening, as we got ready to go out, we noticed the fire trucks pulling up in front of the hotel. However, the smoke alarms were not going off, and we assumed it was for the person stuck in the elevator. Luckily, one of the girls went out in the hallway and smelled the smoke. After walking down sixteen flights of stairs we found out the water heater in the basement caught fire. We may have given the hotel one last chance if the situation was not handled so poorly. The management did not address the situation, no one said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are sorry, but the fire has been extinguished, you may now return to you rooms.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The front desk proceeded to check in other guests through all of this. After returning to our room, to pack up our belonging, we checked out the smoke detectors, which lacked one important item\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6a battery. This is the point we relocated to the lovely Holiday Inn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Navy Pier ($149). Paying the extra $50 was definitely worth it for piece of mind.

The room itself was decent size, the bathrooom was small but clean. The hotel was quiet, reasonable priced (69.00 internet rate). The hotel had a small bar that was busy, but more the packpacker style. The hotel's coffee shop serves a limited menu that is basic and reasonable. Hotel service was quite good, after several tries I have even received a larger room due to heating problems. A coin operated laundry facilities are on site and available for guests to use. Internet is available for some dollars, but I used the showroom-computers in the Apple Store on Michigan Avenue.
