Still, I booked and took my chance and my apprehension was confirmed upon arrival. The hotel entrance was extremely small, not to mention the reception desk and area. However, after receiving my room keys and heading for the elevator I was pleasantly surprised to find the back room resembling that of an old English country club. Roaring open fire, albeit fake, wing backed high chairs and a literary assortment of Historical English books fit for any library. Next the room, as usual with Paris standards, rather cramped, but very nice all the same. The one down point, if any, was the fact that the bathroom was again very small and very very cold. The bathroom floor being covered in slate like tiles was as cold as the winter weather outside. All in all a very pleasant experience, would I recommend this hotel? Yes, but go for a Superior room to avoid a tight squeeze, room 104 was perfect with twin beds.

Our room had a flat screen TV, mini bar, and Lanvin brand bath amenities. The location is perfect...about a block from La Madeleine in the heart of Paris, a two minute walk to the metro, and a five minute walk to large department stores. Best of all, there are wonderful restaurants within a three block walk, plus two great gourmet stores (Fauchon, Hediard) and Nicolas, the wine shop. The only drawbacks: 1. the breakfast was 23 Euros ( over $30) per person, and not a good value, so try the corner cafe or bakery. 2. the Metro line runs directly under the hotel and we could hear the noise and feel the vibration from our 5th floor room. If you are are light sleeper, ask for a room that does not face the street. The room might be smallish, but definitely quieter.

Definately worth avoiding this hotel, anything but luxury. Also as it was booked through an operator we could not get our money back and move elsewhere. It was however slightly entertaining as the matress was that bad that you rolled into the middle of the bed and bumped into each other!", "Date": "August 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location!\u201d", "Author": "LanceFan", "ReviewID": "UR3733647", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in July and thought it was great. The room we stayed in was small, but not tiny, but the bathroom was quite large and the tub was nice and deep. One thing I am not used to is not having a shower curtain - so this posed a slight problem for me as my \"bull in a China shop\" approach to bathing left the marble tiled floor quite drenched and extremely slippery. One of the people at the front desk, Pascal, was extremely helpful and friendly, but the others were a bit standoffish and cold. The breakfast was 12 Euros each, which was a bit pricey for no hot options, but the croissants were plentiful and very good. Very close to the Tube station (Madeline), and walking distance to the Concorde, Arc du Triumphe, Champs Elysees. Overall we were happy with this hotel.", "Date": "August 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cThe Hotel Opal-a quirky home base for your Paris adventure!\u201d", "Author": "cymbalineshalo", "ReviewID": "UR3491769", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Opal with another couple the week of May 2nd through the 8th. We had rooms 105 and 102, respectively. My husband and I had consulted this site before our trip and decided to book the hotel anyway, in spite of the mixed reviews, because we felt the Hotel Opal had a good combination of affordability as well as an excellent location. Our room, 105, was decorated in a blue toile fabric and had a ivory marble bathroom. I agree with the previous posters that the furniture was somewhat worn and beat up but it didn't bother us...it just gave the place more character. The two light blue chairs that were in our room were newer looking, and the heavy toile drapes and the fabric on the walls looked fresh. This room faces the street, but with the double glazed windows closed you couldn't hear a thing. Our co-traveler's room, room 102, was hung in a pale pink Moire that looked somewhat shabby, as did their carpet, and their furniture looked a lot more battered than ours. Their bathroom was beautiful black and white marble, however. The hallways were neat and I enjoyed the very Parisian feel of the hand-painted lettering on each door and the solid tassel and skeleton key that they gave us to open our rooms. The main lobby and breakfast area is very small, but just as charming as the website photos. The staff we encountered had varying degrees of helpfulness from extremely helpful to mildly grumpy, all spoke english (but prefered it if you spoke French). The airconditioning unit in our room did not work and it was difficult to communicate that fact and have anything be done about it other than one of the front desk clerks coming up to our room and showing us how to use the remote-which wasn't the problem-it was that the unit itself did not cool. Luckily the weather was only warm for the first day otherwise we might have roasted. We ate breakfast at the Hotel one day-on a Sunday when absolutely nothing else was open. For your 12Euros you get a lot less than what you could manage at the so-so cafe next door-Just rolls and some ham and cereal and the like. The better thing to do for breakfast is to go down to the corner and buy incredible pasteries and coffee at Pauls'-and then come back for an incredibly filling 4Euro hotdog for lunch! A lot of people have complained about the Metro noise and honestly, being on the first floor, I thought it would make for a lot of sleepless nights. Based on others' reviews my husband and I had braced ourselves for the loud, shake-the-walls-and-jiggle-the-chandelier kind of Metro noise but got...a mild rumble. A really mild rumble and a slight vibration. Really noticeable only when one is say, in the bathtub with no other noise in the room. Its the kind of Metro sound and vibration that you feel and hear almost everywhere you go in Paris. I have to say that my husband and I found the Metro noise to be completely underwhelming, as did our traveling companions. All of us slept like angels. In terms of location, the Opal truly was as ideal as we had hoped, right in the middle of everything. The whole area is filled with very tony shops, like the Cartier and Gucci stores. La Duree is a short walk just past the Madeline for some of the worlds best macaroons and chocolat chaud. There's a Monoprix just off the Blvd Haussman, as well as two small groceries just half a block away for quick and cheap snacks and in room munching (skip the insanely priced mini bar fare). The Metro is just steps away and can get you almost anywhere you'd want to go in Paris quickly and cheaply. In short, I think that the Hotel Opal is what you make it. If you're willing to accept that there are going to be quirks and are willing to just roll with what you find, you'll have a great time. If you're expecting George V at Budgetel prices, or you're expecting that things will be exactly like you're used to at home, you're probably going to hate it-but then why are you traveling, anyway?", "Date": "May 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cA Detailed Impression\u201d", "Author": "Reiser", "ReviewID": "UR3445170", "Content": "As most of us retain only 10% of our experience, we decided to write notes during our stay, here they are: THE ARRIVAL: We called from our previous hotel in the morning and was told that our room would definitely be ready at 2 PM so we should move then. When we arrived at Hotel Opal, the manager told us that the room was still being cleaned so we waited in the hotel till 3 PM. He finally suggested that we should just leave our suitcases and return at 4 PM as the cleaner was still backed up. The manager was nice but offered no apology at all. The lady receptionist who arrived in the late afternoon did apologize explaining that they had too many people checking out that day. We also like the german receptionist Monsieur Kerstner, he was quite friendly & helpful. THE ROOM: Room #405 looked nothing like the pictures at all, it's a very plain & spartan room with a double bed, so we requested for another room with 2 twin beds as we had requested in our reservation. Room # 305 looks just like the internet picture except the walls are muddy green. The room looks somewhat tired & worn out but the doors, windows & wall closet have a refreshing mint green paint on them. It has a certain charm with the brown carpet draped in busy pink flower design & the muddy green walls. The CEILING has multiple cracklines with some moisture MUSHROOM PROBLEM problem. In the evening, we could hear what the couple nextdoor were saying to each other as well as their TV quite clearly. THE FURNISHINGS: All the mini sized furniture have various different finish from walnut, mahogany to oak, some old & damaged, some new with a fake plasticky finish. We think they were all hand selected from a swap meet. The fake acrylic bronze painted chandelier & lamps (made in china?) and the 3 tiny & very old still oil painting with different colored frames convinced us further. The 13 inch TV sits on top of an old brown fridge while the modern portable air condition sits high on the wall. THE HALLWAY: Nicely black painted room doors gave a classy look but the dirty sheets/towels and garbage piled up against the wall by the lady cleaner during the day ruined it all. She seemed nice & friendly when I asked for towel sets & soap which she forgot to put in our room. The METRO SONIC BOOM: We found it to be tolerable as it never lasted more than 5 seconds each time, however, I would suggest requesting for the higher floors. We were more bothered by the sounds coming from next door. THE RETURN: Never again. Everytime we went back to our room we said to each other: It's like we died and went to hell....", "Date": "May 6, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "BEST WESTERN PREMIER Hotel Opal", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d219997-Reviews-BEST_WESTERN_PREMIER_Hotel_Opal-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$267 - $441*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">19 rue Tronchet</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">8th Arr.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75008</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "219997", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/d7/e2/d7e2c366ec31ed533cd00def776bf2cb3large.jpg"}}
