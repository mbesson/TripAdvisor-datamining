For our family room we had double bed and a single and although basic, it was what I paid for. The horror started when my young children had gone to sleep and I turned on my torch for reading and saw bugs crawling over the sheets and pillows. I squashed some in my utter panic, then started collecting in tissues, phoned reception and complained. At midnight I had to wake my children and move not only rooms but buildings. I didn't sleep for the rest of that night, unsuprisingly. The 2nd night I stayed awake and after the children were asleep turned on the torch and low and behold, more bugs. I took live ones to reception and demanded a different room, they let thelive bugs crawl over the desk, then eventually re-caught them and put them in the bin when I asked what he was going to do about them. Live bugs in an open bin...no wonder the whole hotel is infested. We moved to the 3rd room in 2 nights and checked out 1st thing in the morning. The hotel manager was rude, unhelpful and unsympathetic. I reported hotel to the council who promptly opened up a health and safety investigation. I have stayed in many many hotels all over the world and have never, never had bedbugs before.

The light over the 'dressing table' was disgustingly filthy and the double bed was made up with a not very clean single sheet.

I mean you get what you pay for right? I've been in my fair share of hostels, motels and hotels throughout the world but this was hands down the worst experience I've ever had at a hotel. On our first day there, we went out for about an hour and came back to find our room had been broken into and a lot of our things (electronics, money, cell phones, laptops, etc.) were stolen. The hotel offered no apology or refund and were extremely unhelpful with the police. When the police wanted to check the security cameras none of the staff knew how to work the recorder. When they finally got a specialist in they found that the camera hadn't even been recording. As the day went on, more people reported things stolen and in the end 5 rooms had been hit. The worst part? There was no sign of forced entry. I felt so violated knowing that someone would just walk into our room, rifle through our personal things and walk right on out. I'm sorry all of this - so many rooms hit, no broken locks, useless security cameras - just screams suspicious to me. If it wasn't an inside job, the hotel didn't seem at all concerned about the security of the place. When the maintenance guy \"changed\" the lock, we saw that it was in fact, the same lock (worked with the old key) and had to stand their watching him as he actually changed the lock. As a young female traveler, security is my biggest concern. When you stay at a hotel, especially one with seemingly working locks and decent reviews, you expect to be safe.
