He gave us very helpful, clear instructions and gave us a map showing all the points of interest in the city which was very helpful . that made it very easy for us to see everything. Then helped us with our luggage,also let us use the front desk computer and printer to print our boarding passes for our flight and to book the Vatican museum . he seemed to really like doing his Job, and enjoy doing it!!!!. unfortunately we don't know his name, but he looks like Richard Gere 20 years ago!!!!!!!!!and always smiling, really fantastic also the staff at breakfast were very helpful and attentive. Breakfast itself was very good, there was bread, ham, cheese, and orange juice, cookies, etc. The cappuccinos were delicious , lots of choice, The room was very pleasant and clean. It was truly well worth the price. These are small things which can easily be fixed,But the location, the spotless cleanliness, the atmosphere and the welcome- all make it a wonderful place . The location of the hotel was very convenient ,We walked everywhere from the hotel, all points of interest was within a reasonable distance.We even walked to the Vatican! If you want to buy beer, wine, cheese, bread there are many stores nearby. We checked out and our flight home was late. the hotel looked after our luggage for the day so we could spend the day sightseeing. Everybody who works there really cares for the guests and we were made to feel very welcome.

However it's fair to say that I was underwhelmed and quite disappointed. LOCATION The hotel has a relatively central location, within walking distance of the main sights, however any hotel in the city centre boasts this trait! You don't need to stay at the Saturnia for that! STAFF The reviews on hear state that the hotel staff are outstanding.. I'd have to disagree I'm afraid. On arrival the hotel staff were not overly welcoming, and after attempting to ask where a nice restaurant would be for dinner (and getting no help!) we quickly developed a bad impression of them. This was somewhat rectified the following morning when one of the staff members kindly helped us find our feet and plan our route around Rome. However this was the only time that we saw him and the rest of the staff just weren't up to the same standard. ROOM We had a standard double room. However it was not a double, it was two single beds pushed together. Now I work for a Travel Agent and I understand that this trait is applicable in Europe as you often get two beds pushed together BUT this should only occur when you book a 'standard room' if the room type is stated as DOUBLE that is exactly what it should be. One of the beds was also damaged, the shower broken and the heating in the room failed to work. FOOD The breakfast at the hotel was awful. I'm sorry but there's no other way to describe it. They had croissants, ham and coffee. That really was the extent of the breakfast. Needless to say I only ate the breakfast once. ROME IN GENERAL Rome however is amazing! And I'd recommend it to anyone! Beautiful city and so much to see! Me and my boyfriend went from the 3rd of February - 6th February and we experienced Rome in the snow which was so pretty! Unfortunately a lot of the attractions were closed due to the freak weather, but hey, how often does in snow in Rome?! Makes for amazing photos! :) TOP TIP: There are some amazing little restaurants near the Trevi Fountain definately worth a try, Al Picchio was our favourite. OVERALL I would recommend Rome to anyone! I just wouldn't recommend the Saturnia. If you're looking for a cheap but lovely little hotel perhaps look at the Columbia or the Amalfi (excellent 3* stars) or if you're looking for something more upmarket try the Capo D'Africa (4*+ stars).", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, CO", "Title": "\u201cWonderful service, great location\u201d", "Author": "CarrieinDenver", "ReviewID": "UR124154868", "Content": "I had the pleasure of staying at Saturnia for business for four days in January.

I felt worse for myself after having slept here for a few nights and the point of this site is for people to get real opinions. I've travelled all over Europe and North America and have never seen a hotel this bad. I have slept in cabanas and tents on beaches in Mexcio and am not a princess by any stretch of the imagination. The rooms were dirty, the mattress 20 years old, the floors made of laminate that were extremely noisy all night long. The floor in the room was actually partially tile and partially laminate with big gaps in between. The windows were uninsulated and the street noise was terrible. There was no thermostat to control the heat. This entire hotel needs to be redone and maybe should close until then. The doors to the rooms and the baths don't open fully; they hit the raised floors and scrape along. The pillows were the flattest I had ever seen and when we asked for extras, the ones we received were so old and dirty I was afraid to use them. Half of the outlets in the room did not work which mad me wonder about the wiring. The shower had no shelves for your soap and shampoo and was about 18 inches wide. For the price, I did not expect much, actually our expectations were extremely low but we were still dissappointed. I could go on but overall it was so bad it seems silly to go into every detail. This place might be okay for the backpacking crowd if they can get a bed for less than $20 a night that they will likely not use much. There are much better places for the same money very close by.

First, we arrived at the hotel only to have them tell us they had to send us to another hotel for a night because of some problems with the room. They assured us that the other hotel was of comparable quality, but it turned out to be even worse than Saturnia (see Hotel Tre Stelle reviews)! When we returned to Saturnia, we were given the smallest hotel room we had even seen, even by European standards. There was barely room to walk around the bed to the bathroom, let alone having space for our suitcases. The bathroom was similarly tiny, with a toilet, bidet, shower and sink all crammed into a room that could not have been more than 4 feet by 4 feet. We couldn't turn around without smacking into something. The bathroom also smelled awful, as though there was mold and mildew growing out of control. The shower was tiny & the shower curtain was broken and didn't cover the whole area so water went everywhere. There was no bath mat so we had to use one of our hand towels to mop up the mess. To make things worse, the toilet seat broke the first night we were there (and we are not large people - 140 lbs each). They told us they would fix it but didn't until the last day of our stay. It was also extremely noisy at night if anyone was talking outside the hotel. We could hear a man across the street from inside his apartment. It was ridiculous. This hotel is a terrible value for money in my opinion. We paid 129 euros a night and I have stayed in cheaper places in Rome in the past and had much better experiences. The only real positives this place has going for it (other than proximity to Termini Station) are the food options. The breakfast at the hotel was reasonably tasty and included enough food to fill us up until lunch (hardboiled eggs, ham, cheese, buns, pastries, cereal & yogurt). There is also a great gelato place around the corner called Gelateria Santa Maria Maggiore.

Make sure you know how to get to the hotel....we walked from the termini station (which is super close), but we arrived very late at night and the street names are not easy to read (this was true all around Rome, street names are etched into building sides) and we would have walked past the short little street it's on had I not seen pics of the outside of the hotel on this site. Hotel staff is super nice, very accommodating and knowledgable. Wifi worked great in the room and was included. Breakfast was also included and was not the best (not a ton of selection and pastries weren't wonderful) but over the few days were there I figured out what I liked and it was enough to get me going till a late lunch (plus they will make you little cappuccinos). Hotel seemed typical for Rome for the price...in an old building, no A/C in our room (although the fan we had helped when the window was open), close to noisy street (but once we closed the window the noise reduced significantly). Our room in particular was a little bizarre. We had a shared bathroom, which ended up meaning just a toilet down the hall because our room had a shower in the corner. Was not private so might be awkward for 2 friends, but was fine for me and my husband. There are minimal room amenities (no hair dryer, no safe, no coffee maker). However, it was very clean and safe, and someone came to clean everyday. I would stay here again for the value and we were about a 20-25min walk from everything except the Vatican, which took us a 40min. to get to walking speedily (found out metro was on strike so we had to book it to the Vatican for our tour). So if you plan to spend minimal time in the room and want to be able to walk everywhere (metro/buses are very close too) it's a good deal. But if you are more comfortable in a hotel with more amenities and more modern, don't kid yourself, pay more to stay somewhere else (but it'll be expensive I bet).", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cAmazing find in the centre of Rome\u201d", "Author": "sciscio", "ReviewID": "UR118948000", "Content": "I was here for 4 nights at the beginning of the summer with my girlfriend.

The rooms we stayed in were small but the hotel is an older style hotel and installing the bathrooms reduced the original size of the rooms. There is basically enough room to walk around the bed and the bathroom is very small however the beds were comfortable and clean, the rooms were well maintained and the bathrooms were reliable and clean. It's a base for exploring Rome. What makes this hotel is the quality of the staff. Tiziano is friendly, helpful, efficient and impossibly handsome!

I've stayed in some pretty seedy Super 8 hotels in the US and similar low cost hotels in Canada, and I've been to England, Ireland, the Netherlands and Cuba before - and have never left a hotel and taken a loss (388 Euro) before. My wife's last trip to Italy she stayed in hostels. I made the mistake of prepaying to save a little money which meant I was stuck. This was supposed to be the 3rd hotel in our Italy trip (stayed in 5 other hotels total, all good) but this one was so bad that my wife (we were on our honeymoon) literally sat on the bed and cried. We were supposed to have a double bed, air conditioning and a private bath, but when we got there the clerk (who was actually very nice, no complaint there) said that for the 1st night at least they'd have to give us a room for four as it was the only room they had left (really it was the only room with air conditioning and a private bath left). I asked if we had to move our stuff the next day and he said if we wanted to we could stay in the room for all 3 nights - at first, I thought wow we lucked out and got a bigger room. Well, the room wasn't actually in the hotel, he lead us out into the alley (the picture doesn't show it, but the hotel entrance is really in an alley) and opened a metal gate and walked down the stairs into the basement where he opened the door to our room - a decent size room with a bath and air conditioning, but NO windows, no other exit (so it was a fire hazard and wouldn't even be legal in NA, not sure about Italy but I assume it is), and the stench was absolutely unbelievable. It smelled as if they poured a few litres of cheap perfume in the room to cover up the smell of the mold. Although my wife has asthma I've never in two years seen it act up, but it did when we went into this room. So we asked if there were any other rooms and he said he had one that had no air conditioning and no toilet but we could have that. We decided to change rooms but the heat and noise from the other room was just too much. We told the bell clerk we couldn't stay and would have to leave and find something else. He urged us to come back the next day since the room was already paid for and he'd have another room available but really once we found another hotel and got settled it would have been a pain to have to only get the other hotel for one night in hopes that they had anything better (which I'm highly doubtful of) - and if they didn't we'd have to go find another hotel again. What a mess. Besides what I've mentioned above, I don't think the rooms in the hotel have been updated in 30 years or more. The lobby looked fine as did the breakfast area, but the two rooms we saw were awful. Here's the kicker - about 2 blocks away we found a Relais hotel, 4 stars, the Antico Palazzo Rospigliosi Hotel and the regular price of 130 Euros was the same as the discounted price at Saturnia.

I paid $13 extra/night for a standard double (attached bath was very important for us). The final rate included breakfast. The hotel also had free wifi which is the most important amenity these days. Room: I read a lot of reviews of Rome hotel both here on trip advisor and Expedia that got me a bit worried about the size of the room. I knew European hotel rooms would be small but how small? One reviewer said that their Saturnia room was so small they couldn't even properly open their suitcase in the room. That got me into panic mode. I need not have worried so much. The room was adequately sized for two people with two carry on size bags. (Frankly, I have experienced far worse much close to home in San Fran but that's a different review for another day.) Even though there is no elevator, we got a second floor room which was not too difficult to manage with the bags - stair case was standard width. The most challenging thing about the room was the shower stall. Very tight but in the end, manageable. And I would recommend that you consider taking a travel hair dryer although the room does come with one but it is awkward to use and not efficient (see photo and you will understand what I mean). Another small issue was that the bed had two mattresses side by side instead of a queen size mattress, and that meant that I, who tends to drift into the middle of the bed, always ended up on the spine and it did cause minor discomfort. The room had its own AC and even a small fridge. At night the road outside can be noisy. Just street sounds. You can close the windows and turn on the AC and be oblivious to all that. We chose not to - because the fresh breeze felt nice but Rome appears to stay loudly awake all night so this may not work for most people. :) We got used to it. Staff/Service: The staff were very friendly and helpful. On the day we arrived we were allowed to check in at 11 am. And then we were offered a cup of coffee. Very much appreciated after a long overnight flight. All except one desk staff spoke English. And the one who didn't - he tried his best to understand us and be understood. Very amicable. They let me use their computer to get tickets to museums in Florence and print out receipts. (Although I recommend that you do not go this route - make all reservations ahead of time from the US). Bathroom was small but had everything including a bidet. Breakfast was great - saved us both time and money every morning. Not the big greasy American style breakfast though - but lots of choices and healthier. Made to order coffee, various kinds of croissants, jams, nutella, cheese spreads, hard boiled eggs, rolls and yummy cheese slices for a quick sandwich, three kinds of cereal and milk, juice, and yogurt. Location: Best thing about the hotel is its location! Termini is a 5-minute walk. You will discover that this is the best amenity of ALL. BTW< in getting to hotel once you arrive into Termini from the airport (Leonardo express for 14 euro one-way, 30 minutes), do not follow google maps direction to hotel. Instead just find the Piazza del Cinquecento exit and get onto Via Cavour. Walk straigh down Via Cavour and Via Ruiniglia is on right (hotel has a sign visible from Cavour. Area amenities: Lots of eateries in the area (favorite hole in the wall - Forno da Milvio on Via Dei Serpenti - cheap, fast, but yummy food). Also in the neighborhood, one of the most charming places in Monti area - the piazza madonna dei monti. At dusk locals of all ages gather here and just sit and chat. Very cool. You can walk from here to the Colosseum in 10 minutes. There are at least three groceries nearby for water, juice, fruits, etc. As well as a pharmacy within a block. Area seems quited safe.

We were allowed to check in at 12.30 PM ( a rarity anywhere) and we were offered coffees while we waited. The coffee (regular, one espresso) were to die for! They perked up right up. The room was very clean and the lovely housekeeper showed up us. In my broken Italian I made out what she was showing us. The only minor issue is that the bathroom pipes smelled. As I had lived in China, this did not bother me at all. But we realized that if you left the fan running in the bathroom with the door closed, it faded away. The room was small. As was the bathroom. Very small. I am 5'7 and my husband is 6 feet and we found it cramped. But the room was very warm which was good as it was cold and rainy in Rome. We ran the air conditioner at night to remove the stuffiness of the room. Through no fault of the hotel, some guests decided to use the hallways as a meeting place in the middle of the night and were very loud. Fortunately for me, I heard nothing the second night we were there. The benefit to the noisy guests was, I could not hear any traffic noise or street noise. We were on the second floor, facing the back, beside a court yard and although there was noise during the day, it was quiet at night. We paid only \u00a398 for two nights in Rome and for the most important reason why I am rating this hotel well: location. You can walk from the main terminus or jump on the subway and go one stop. You can walk to the Colloseum as well. Variety of restaurants around the hotel, and an amazing gelato / pancake cafe nearby. The area felt safe, the people around the area were all very smartly dressed and generally one got a sense that the properties around the area were expensive. There were some posh little delis close by as well and small bars. Breakfast was continental but delicious. I had some juice (not sure what kind but it was ruby in colour and sweet). The pastries were very good and the coffee, amazing. If you have a budget or don't fancy a hotel further out of the city, I recommend staying here.

One of my first surprises was reservations via internet. Although their booking engine states that they will NOT actually charge your credit card and will only do so when you arrive, this was completely false. They charged me one night's stay in July (as soon as I made the online reservations, although we arrived in late September). I wrote them right away, worried about my credit card limit since I was out of the country at the time and did not want to have unexpected charges...they assured that the charge was \"reversible\" but that was false also, and to prove it, I took my bank statement with me, showing the one night they charged plus the foreign currency fee. Once we got over that initial bad impression, we were greeted late at night upon arrival, only to learn there were no elevators and we were in a unit in the fourth floor. Stairs are wide enough up to the third floor...but later, from the 3rd to the 4th floor, the stairs are challenging for anyone...spiral, narrow metal stairs. The rooms are very basic...barely any decoration and just o.k. Beds are simple and mattresses were a bit hard. Our A/C did not work and although a gentleman from the front desk came to check on it, it never did work. We were changed to the \"family room\" the next day, which was nice because it is on the ground level and more ample, but even more \"basic\".,nevertheless the bathroom was nice and clean and beds had mattresses just as stiff as the firs unit. A/C did not work here either. In summary, here goes my personal pros/cons list: PROS: - Excellent location, very close to public transportation and a walking distance to some attractions - VERY basic rooms which are clean - Santa Maria Maggiore church is half a block away, with a tourist center across the street and it is also a stop for all double decker tour buses, which are an excellent value in Rome - Free wi-fi - Great dining options nearby - Wonderful breakfast, with hot and cold selections although room is tiny - Staff is very friendly CONS: - They will probably charge you for one night when booking online, regardless of their reservation/cancellation policy!! - Avoid 4th floor if you have mobility issues - Avoid rooms facing the main street...there are a few restaurants with live music that can be noisy - Make sure your A/C is working and cooling as soon as you check in your room, if you travel in a warm season - Mattresses are uncomfortable Although in the end I was glad to have stayed in Hotel Saturnia, I will stay elsewhere in Rome next time I visit.

Rome will keep you so busy that you wont even realize you have returned to your small basic room . Its a budget hotel in a very good location (a really short walk to the colleseum and the train station )and doesnt try to be anything else. For us, Rome wasnt about the hotel and more about the sites. The bathrooms are tight but everything worked and was clean. The bed was a little uncomfortable but acceptable. The staff were very friendly and helpful - calling to make reservations or giving direction. side note 1 : the borghese museum requires a reservation a few days in advance but you can get cancelations at the door - we fell into that category - but well worth it. side note 2 : eat in trastervere - across the bridge- its way easier to find a table and cheaper. side note 3: there is a guided tour outside the colleseum for 8 euros that includes the pallatine and the forum. Im not a big tour group guy but it was worth it as the pallatines not clearly signed (in fact there are none) and jason our pallatine guide was excellent. So stay at the Saturnia if you dont mind basic and cheap. I thought the breakfast was good. I didnt look to see if the food was left out over night - but i dont look at kitchens in restaurants either - its easier that way. oh and ask for a coffee to be made at the bar its better than the machine.

I don't recall the amount of rooms in this small hotel, but my only suggestion would be to make sure you do NOT get a corner room. All of the rooms are small , that's acceptable, but the corner room we got was so small that once both our medium suitcases were on the floor we barely had a square meter to stand on. A double bed, a small closet, decent AC and a tiny but clean bath made this room a place to keep our luggage and go to sleep. Staying awake in it is not for the claustrophobic visitors. Wide-shouldered people will find the shower a bit problematic, but having as much hot water as I wanted was a good thing to have. Once that's over and done with I can say that outside the (corner) room the place was nothing but great. The people were nice, the breakfast was satisfactory and all our questions and requests were answered fast and with a smile. The staff in Saturnia are well aware of their weaknesses and work hard to even the odds with a good and thorough service.

Because of bags, we took a taxi--although it really is only a ten minute walk down Via Cavour to the hotel. Walking or in a taxi, the problem is spotting the side street that the hotel is on. I include a view from Via Cavour to help. Via Ruinaglia was in the process of being permanently blocked to vehicles turning in from Via Cavour, so the taxis either have to stop on Cavour or go down the parallel Via Urbana. It's not as complicated as it sounds. The street being blocked makes for a quieter night's sleep. Do not expect to sleep late however, as a school and a service entrance is directly across the alley and they start making noise fairly early. This would only affect party-types, not families and tourists interested in seeing the sights and getting an early start. Ricardo was very helpful from making Email reservations and throughout our stay as was Virgilio. The fact that there is no elevator made for good exercise getting to the breakfast each morning. The food was more than adequate, although it typifies the \"Continental\" style. Most Americans would have no problem satisfying their morning appetite. Coffee could be either self serve or made by the staff and I seemed to be offered coffee day or night as I often used the desk in front of reception or the breakfast room for editing my pictures and blog (better WiFi reception). Speaking of that, if the hotel's WiFi was down, there was good reception to a public network exactly at the corner by the restaurant on Via Cavour. The hotel is old--sort of like Rome is old. But the amenities are fairly new and work--the plumbing and electricity, that is. The staff are extremely helpful. My only untoward event was the loss of my primary set of eyeglasses. I attribute that to no one but myself, as I am careless about where I set things down--and remembering to pick them up. In this case I am certain that the stylish but small prescription glasses with non-glare lenses and thin black wire frame were swept into the trash but by the time I realized they were gone, so was the trash. Fortunately, I am a belt and suspenders guy, so I had a backup pair of glasses in my suitcase. As another reviewer said, many of the places to eat along Via Cavour cater to tourists and are expensive for what you get. Because of our long stay, we were treated to a meal at the restaurant next door. We ate there a few times and we learned that a small deceit was employed to increase the bill. If the charming waiter says, \"would you like to sample this?\" or \"try a taste of ... while you wait for your meal.\" He does not mean that it is really a sample or just a taste, it will be a charge on your meal. On the other hand watching the waiters flirt with every passing woman and even more with those at the tables was well worth the price of admission. Because I did not see this behavior regularly at other places we ate, I suspect it was mostly for show--but who knows. We found our least expensive meals by going into the neighborhood behind Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, where there were ethnic (and authentic) places, plus a few restaurants offering Italian regional specialties. We also ate at Turkish-run pizza stands on side streets and snacked at interesting wine bars. My opinions and findings are posted at http://www.travelblog.org/Bloggers/Advaitin/ if you are interested in more pictures and ramblings about Rome. Suffice to say that you can shop around and find reasonable prices both in the neighborhood of the hotel and in Rome. Much is within walking distance of the hotel, including the subway, which we rode once, and the bus system, which we used constantly, usually going to and from the bus station in front of the Termini. I would be remiss if I did not mention the gelato stand just a block down Via Cavour on the right. Perfecto! Also the Gelato place on the right side of the Pantheon as you face the entrance.

Like most hotels in Europe, rooms and bathrooms are small - you can book a room with a shared bath or a private bath - we went with a private bath. Plenty of hot water, soap, shower caps and towels. No washcloths. Small flat-screen tv's with satellite. The staff is what makes this place extra special. No surly service here; everyone is so nice and willing to help. I was a woman traveling alone with a 13-year-old daughter; we spoke no Italian and it was our first visit to Rome. The staff speak very good English and were super helpful with info about getting around Rome and to Pompeii and Ostia Antica. Free in-room internet is nice; ask at the desk for the access code. About a 15 minute walk to Termini (the main rail station) and to the Cavour Street stop on the Metro (subway). Also, those huge double-decker hop-on/hop-off tour busses have a stop just about a block away, next to Santa Maria Maggiore - very convenient if you want to take a tour of the city and you can purchase a tour bus ticket at the hotel's front desk. It takes about 15-20 minutes to walk to the colisseum from the hotel. There's a tobacco shop nearby on Cavour where you can purchase bus/metro tickets. The hotel is actually located on a narrow slip of a sidestreet, just off of busy Cavour Street. The street is blocked off from traffic. The hotel faces the wall of what appears to be a small convent. The hotel itself is quiet, but the church bells peal loudly every morning at 7:00 a.m. You can also hear the garbage trucks come rumbling along Cavour St. in the middle of the night, especially if you have your windows open, but they're gone soon enough and I think this is the case for many hotels. The first night, we stayed in a room on the top floor, which was kind of neat because there are only two rooms on this floor - one was our hotel room and I'm not sure about the other - the door is simply marked 'Private' and has no room number. This top floor room has its own small balcony that looks over the walls of the convent and across some rooftops, which is a pleasant place to sit. This room also has a large king-size bed and a very small bathroom with what has to be the world's tiniest shower. But this room is on the 5th floor (they call it the 4th floor, but it's actually the fifth) and there is no elevator, so it is NOT for people with lots of heavy luggage or who have difficulty climbing long and steep flights of stairs. Definitely a cozy and private little nook, though, so ask for the 4th floor room if that's what you're looking for. Apparently it was booked for someone else the next night, so we were moved to the second floor, and that was good, too. No balcony, but the room was large enough and the shower was a bit larger, which was nice. This place is small, cozy, intimate and very clean. The staff takes a lot of pride in their service to guests and in the overall quality of this hotel. There's a great little restaurant just down the street - about a 15 minute walk in the direction of the colisseum, across from the Metro stop. You can dine outside on the sidewalk or inside. Intimate and cozy, very clean, beautiful and great service. The staff is super pleasant and we thought the Fetuccini Alfredo was great. They also have pizza and many pasta dishes and the menu is in Italian & English. We dined there twice and both times were the only Americans - everyone else appeared to be Italian, so this isn't your typical tourist trap.

Unfortunately these things alone, won't make for a good stay. I was here for 2 nights earlier this month, and the second night was hell!!

I was informed that my reservation for the second night, which was made 3 weeks prior to me arriving, had to be juggled a little cause of \"system errors\". They would have to move me to a smaller room, but at the same rate?? i didn't want to deal with it, as to not waste any time, so i figured \"as long as i have a place to sleep\". When i returned, a little bit after noon, sure enough my things had been moved to a much much smaller room (rm 104), but i was content to have a place to rest in. I relaxed for a bit and got ready to head out again. I turned my key into reception once again, and when i returned at about 10pm, i asked for my key (rm 104). I was informed that room was occupied by someone else!!! Where are my things?! i asked. They had to scrammble until they figured out where they were. By the time everything was resolved, it was almost midnight!! Fortunately, Virgilio, the man at the front desk, was extremely helpful. He refunded me for the second night stay and paid my cab to the airport the next morning. Aside from the confusion, this place is in a great location and has great rooms.

I got a big hug good bye and kind of got teary eyed to say good bye to the wonderful staff. The bond was immediate! Great shopping, so bring some extra bucks girls! Public transportation was fairly simple as well. No wash clothes, so bring a spongy for the shower. Rooms were quiet only heard the noise of other guests once in awhile.

Booked via the website without issue. The hotel is nicely located about 9 blocks from Stazione Termini, and a few blocks from Cavour subway station. The neighbourhood is safe and it's quiet in the rooms because the hotel is located on a short street off Cavour. I arrived on an extremely hot day, and after checking-in & realising that I had one of the 'basic' rooms without A/C or private bath, I returned to the desk where I was helpfully offered an upgrade for an additional \u20ac20 per night. This second room did have A/C, a small private bathroom, and a generally improved finish over the basic room. (Having now returned and re-consulted my original booking, it seems as though I did in fact book the upgraded room to begin with, so not sure why I had to pay the extra on arrival. Water under the bridge - this was still a cheap stay.) The rooms were clean, and although there was a bit of mildew around the shower door as others have described, it's nothing to get excited about. As the private bathroom is small, and has to include a bidet, the shower is therefore quite tiny (one thing it could benefit from would be a shelf to put soap/shampoo on). I can't imagine anyone even remotely obese being able to use it. The bed was certainly not the most comfortable I have used, but it did the job. Some of the reviews have mentioned the staff, and I have to give a shout-out to Riccardo. He was always smiling, welcoming and spoke English quite well. He also set me up at a neighbouring hotel during the following week when I would be back in Rome and Saturnia was fully booked.

Breakfast was included and we were pleasantly surprised about the variety of cereals, breds, even mortadella, eggs and cheese as well as juices.
