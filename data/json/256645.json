Just not true. I am over hotels pretending to be what they are not. This a a boutique, apartment style hotel around 3 stars. Great for what it is. Pros Fantastic location. Bed and pillows fabulous (for me one of the main things to get right) quiet and clean if a little dated. Shower over bath with strong water flow and hot. Staff on reception helpful. Apartment style rooms spacious with tvs in both lounge and bedroom Well stocked littlekitchen for eating in. Cons Dark room as our window looked out onto other rooms. Hallway smelt dank and musty but note that the rooms were just fine. No full length mirror to prepare for those Sydney nights out. Poor bathroom mirror lighting and no make up mirror. Summary Not 4 plus stars but if you get it at a good rate you have found a really well located bargain in the heart of Darling Harbour. Walking distance to Paddy's market, Chinatown, Entertainment Centre, Convention centre, Darling Harbour. 15 to 20 min walk to Star City and we even walked all the way through the city centre to Circular Quay....that's a good walk we took over an hour to do stopping and looking.

The cooking facilities could be useful, as one downside to this hotel, is that there is no Restaurant or bar on the premises. Having said that, the hotel was on the edge of Chinatown and there were plenty of restaurants and bars close by. We found the bar at the nearby 'Holiday Inn' to be very good and the breakfast was lovely (open to non residents). My only other criticism was that the hotel was linked to a noisy shopping mall with a door leading directly from the reception area and where you could hear the loud music and general shopping mall noise, although to be fair we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear it in our room.

The Seasons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 location was perfectly central to much of Sydney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attractions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Chinatown, Darling Harbour, Entertainment Centre all very close by. Reception staff were professional and helpful. Lovely and greatly appreciated to have later check-out (noon) offered to us at check-in. Travelled by train and it was an easy walk from Central Station. Easy access to other public transport if required. Arrived early and it was great to be able to leave our luggage at reception and wander off to Chinatown for lunch until check-in time at 2pm. We were delighted with our room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c extremely spacious for such a central location and reasonable price. We found our room very clean and tidy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no issues with housekeeping for us (except see another comment below). While we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a chance to use the kitchenette facilities, it looked very adequate for a longer stay if self-catering \u00e2\u20ac\u201c microwave, two hotplates, dishwasher, etc. Requested a quiet room and would have to say it was probably the quietest room we have ever stayed in the Sydney CBD. Had no views from our windows but that certainly didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t detract from the room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the quietness was the winning feature. Even a little balcony for fresh air. Comfy bed was greatly appreciated also. Great blockout curtains as well so room was very dark and encouraged a good sleep-in. Only issue was that when we woke up at 11am (it was a late night!) we found our entrance door open - we assume it may have been housekeeping who retreated when they realised we were in room and did not shut door properly but was a concern as our wallets, camera, etc. were on a table right next to the door. With compulsory self-closers on all doors, we know we had not left it open ourselves. There was an envelope under the door with our account for quick check-out. Luckily nothing appeared to be missing but it was a little unnerving to know that someone had been in our room while we slept. Maybe we should have put the \"do not disturb\" sign out (but then we had found in the past at other accommodation that this is an invitation for other guests to knock on door and run...). Mentioned the open door to reception at check-out but they couldn't explain why door would have been left ajar... Enjoyed using some of the recreation facilities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c roof top heated lap pool and spa were just great, as was the steam room and sauna. These are located on top of the adjoining residential block with separate access keys available from reception but well worth the journey to get there (there is internal access from Seasons so not really a problem getting there) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c lovely views of the area from the roof top as well. Spa was not working when we were there and the concierge from the residential block was most apologetic and attempted to rectify the problem straight away \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was still lovely and warm to sit in spa and admire the views !! Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t utilise the gym but it looked more than adequate with views from its full length windows (have to get separate access from residential block concierge to access gym). Overall, would highly recommend the Seasons Darling Harbour \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very comfortable accommodation at a reasonable price = good value.

A seperate bedroom for the kids so we could sit up at night and enjoy some adult time, the proximity to the monorail (on all the maps I checked it was located within the same building) as we were not confident of good weather and thirdly for the reasonable pricing. I called the hotel a few days before to enquire about the views from the rooms and was advised we were already allocated a room looking out over the chinese friendhsip garden and the ferris wheel - effectively toward Darling Harbour which I was pleased about. I had also called to ask about any car or limo service they might recommend from the aiport rather than using taxis as we have toddlers who require car seats. The hotel advised on this poin they could not assist. At check in our rooms were not ready which was ok as it was only late morning. No offer to call us when it was ready was a little disappointing. I also found a flyer in their brochure rack for town cars airport limo service! We ended up using \"arrive in style\" Joe was EXCELLENT and it was worth the extra money to have our kids in car seats and the lack of queuing for a taxi and safer driver was a must. We actually had a huge day of sightseeing that first day- disappointingly on a miserable sydney day we discovered the monorail station at the hotel had been closed so we trapsed the couple of block to the next arriving a little colder and damper with the kids and prams in tow. We arrived back late to the hotel and were checked into our room. To my dismay the room overlooked the entrance to Chinatown and oh boy did we hear that late at night, had it been earlier in the day I would have requested a room change but at 8 oclock my two and three year olds were stuffed! Revellers screaming at the top of their voices had me laying awake for hours at night - no fault of the hotels but something to be mindful of when booking ask for a room facing Darling Harbour. Both the bedroom and the lounge had TV's but no digital TV so no ABC kids or foxtel childrens stations so beware of any expectations in that area. Our bed was very comfortable no problems at all as cited by previous reviews however the sofa bed the kids slept on was frankly awful; the springs pushing up terribly and unfortunately they couldnt sleep well in it so four of us in a queen bed did not leave my husband or I in a good mood at all. In all honesty I guess you get what you pay for but I feel the service was very ho hum which was vastly different to the telephone contact I had with the hotel. The point of most concern to me and of note to any family travelling with young children is that I discovered all of the windows open with no screening at all - I worked this out when I discovered my 3 year hanging out of the window. Very very scary indeed. I did call reception to advise and they said they would see if housekeeping could lock them. I probably wouldnt stay here again mainly because I feel we need a bigger space and also I would choose a new location in Sydney to explore better other parts now eg the Rocks. I can see value for the money we spent and probably now better appreciate the extra touches of the hotels we have stayed in before that do go the extra mile and charge accordingly.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cUpfront charge for minibar ludicrous\u201d", "Author": "margsch", "ReviewID": "UR108377732", "Content": "I have stayed many times at Seasons Apartments including last week, I was dumbfounded when told at checkin that $100 would be charged immediately to my credit card for minibar and refunded in maybe 5 days.

We paid A$199/night for a 1BR suite, which we felt represented good value during high season. That said, we ended up being pretty disappointed in our four-night stay. The room was a bit tired (see photo of bathroom vanity). The bedding seemed to be constructed of a seried of flat sheets that got tangled and pulled up in a huge annoying mess. Our Air Con stopped working at one point, as did the key card lock. The advertised rooftop pool turned out to be not quite what we had in mind. There is a pool, but it is actually located in the connecting building next door. To access it, you have to go to Level 7, and then walk down a long corridor, through the budget serviced apartments in the next building, and then take another lift to Level 18. Every time we went to use the pool, we found it chock-a-block with 19-year-old European travellers, clearly staying in the cheap serviced apartments. Suddenly $199/night started feeling pretty steep. Indeed, when we checked the website, the Season's Darling Harbour was now advertising rooms at $189/night, so the day before we left, I asked the manager if she could kindly adjust the rate for us. She said that this rate was only for rooms at the back of the building. I explained about the Air Con, the door lock, and the poor condition of the bathroom vanity and asked her to please extend this rate to us as a courtesy. She refused, and after quite a bit of back and forth, finally gave me $20 off our final night's stay. I thought this was petty and extremely poor customer service. A sign in the lift advertised re-furbishment rates of A$99/night in 2011 during the hotel's refurbishment. I would recommend this hotel at this rate, as the the access to Chinatown is amazing. It's also close to the monorail and light rail at Paddy's Markets (Chinatown stop is now closed, despite what it says on the maps.) The last straw was when we asked for a wakeup call and for a taxi to be ordered for our early start on departure day. The wakeup call came ten minutes late and the taxi hadn't been ordered.

The location is amazing - 5 min walk from Darling Harbour and many restaurants in the area (right beside Chinatown). We chose this hotel as they were offering a 'stay 3 nights and save' sort of deal on their website. We believe the reason for their lower rates at the moment may be due to their recent change in management and also renovations (we were not affected by any renovation noise while we were there). We booked a 1 bedroom suite - had a kitchenette, small eating area, lounge area with flat screen TV, sliding doors which open to the bedroom that had its own smaller flat screen, and a separate ensuite. Decor was modern - could tell it had recently been changed. Windows opened fully which was a plus however at night while they were closed we could hardly here any of the traffic below. Not much of a view - this was not an issue for us as we were hardly in the room other than at night. The only issue we had was with the bathroom. The shower was over the bath - which is fine however the bath ledge was pretty high and some people with any leg/knee disabilities may have problems getting over it, especially as there is no safety rail to grab onto. We also found the shower head to be EXTREMELY low. My partner had a very difficult time, being over 6 feet. I'm 5'6 and still had a rough time, the shower head came to my chest. We did address this issue to reception and were advised they were still in the process of renovating the bathrooms. Pool/gym access is available however it is shared with the hotel next door. You have to ask reception for a special key to access it. The pool area was great - very clean and was on the roof with a pretty nice view of the surrounding areas. Service was great. The only thing we found odd was 10 minutes after we checked in we had someone knock on our door to ask if they could check if the shampoo needed to be re-filled (it didn't). My partner told the guy I was sleeping (I had been awake since 4am due to an early flight into Sydney). The guy told my partner that we should have put the DND sign on our door - fair enough - but we also didn't expect anyone to be knocking on our door after we just checked in. Why they didn't check this beforehand, I have no idea! Overall it was a good stay and we would stay again.

The breakfast supplied was a pack of cereal, UHT milk & fruit juice in a box, with no choice given. The cereal provided for my husband & myself contained nuts, to which I am allergic. These were obtained from reception so my Son had to travel from his 16th floor apartment down to the ground floor, walk around the corner to our access, collect the packs, then trace his steps. The furniture & fixtures in the common areas, especially above the ground floor, were worn & dirty with some of the upholstery badly frayed, showing the frame underneath.", "Date": "August 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cGreat location - pity about the staff attitude\u201d", "Author": "nomadMelbourne", "ReviewID": "UR37899186", "Content": "Generally we enjoyed our stay here for 4 nights in a 1 bedroom suite for the Wotif price of $99 including $10 parking and daily monorail ride.

Unfortunately I could not find a single positive aspect to comment on at the Clarion Suites, it was all \"extremely\" negative. We booked a 2 bedroom apartment, supposedly the \"Junior Penthouse\". We arrived at the hotel to find the 5 minute check-in carpark at the front was full, after our 4th lap of the block and 45 minutes later the same cars were still in the carpark, due to utter frustration and a screaming baby in the back I decided to park on the footpath with my hazard lights on whilst I checked in. We were given directions to the Hotel carpark and told we could check in after we parked- the directions given were wrong and after another 30 minutes we finally found the carpark which had absolutely no signage whatsoever to indicate it was the Clarion carpark. After check in we made our way to our room and found we had to swap elevators on the 11th floor because the one in the lobby didn't go as high as the 13th floor where we were staying???. We arrived at our door to find that the lock and door handle were half hanging from the door and the keys wouldn't open it. When we finally got the door open we were almost knocked over by the hideous stench coming from inside- a mixture of cigarette smoke (non smoking room), stale alcohol and rotting food. To go with the stench we found the room to be disgustingly filthy, stained carpets, grubby seats you wouldn't let your dog lie on that seemed to be encrusted with something white like vomit-or worse, alcohol and/or vomit on the walls. The worst thing of all was to find that the toilet in the main bathroom had been used, the lid was up and there were pubic hairs on top of the bowl. We immediately complained to the front desk and demanded another room only to be told the Hotel was totally booked out, they offered to come up and look at the room and clean up as best they could. Whilst we waited for the staff to arrive we attempted to find another 2 bed (or 2 x 1 bed) apartment in the city but we were unable to due to the fact the City to Surf was on the next day and everything was booked solid. We decided to open a bottle of wine to cheer ourselves up a little, I opened the cupboard to find there was 1 wine glass between the 4 of us, 2 coffee cups, 3 plates and 2 filthy glasses. What a joke- it appears there was a party in the room the night before and everything had been trashed, the room should not have been let out for the night and was only done so because they had no other rooms to move us to. No one should have been subjected to the filth of that room let alone our 5 month old baby. How they could call this their \"Junior Penthouse\" is beyond me, I have slept in overnight sleeper trains in Vietnam that are cleaner and of a higher standard than this place. When we spoke with the assistant manager the next morning we got the feeling that she didn't really care that we were upset and that it was just the norm to have their guests complaining about the poor service and standards that are provided in this dump. We were told that we would be contacted by the higher management, but this never happened.

Would have been a perfect spot for sightseeing around Sydney or seeing a concert at the Sydney Entertainment Centre. As it was, its a good location for the Sydney Convention Centre (although I must admit that other hotels are closer, the advantages found staying here more than made up for the extra five minutes walking). The room itself was very quite, after pulling out the microwave power cord I had a great nights sleep on a comfortable bed in a dark room. As noted by many others the bed was amazing. The other facilities of the serviced apartment style were great even though I didn't get a chance to use them. We all left over bags at the hotel on the last day of the conference and had no problems. The room was locked at the time we returned and we had to hand over the card we were given before they got them so they may have added additional security after the problems another reviewer had. The disadvantage of my room compared to some of my colleagues was that the kitchenette/lounge was not separated from the bed (hence the reason for disconnecting the power). On the other hand when I have friends in the room after going out to dinner there was plenty of room for us to sit around watching TV. I also had trouble access the pool and gym in the neighbouring hotel. For some reason, even after getting the appropriate access from the front desk, I was unable to get up to the relevant floor. The other problem is that after returning the pass it means that you have to outside and back around to the Clarion entrance as you can't use the lifts. I also wasn't a fan of the liquid soap in the shower. The products themselves were very good but I do like having a bar of soap to wash myself and given that I was staying at a hotel hadn't thought to bring on from home.

The location really was great. The monorail was right at the building and very convenient. We could walk very comfortably to many shops, rail stations and attractions, and of course China town. When we checked in we were told we could not check into our apartment as it had been damaged the night before from previous guests. We were put into two1 bedroom apartments till the next day. Although an inconvenience it was ok for 1 night and the beds were so comfortable. We went out on our first day of being tourists and the staff transferred all our bags and food from fridge to our apartment. They were very helpfull and polite. We had a 2 bedroom apartment on the 16th floor with excellent views from 2 verandahs. The room itself was large and yellow. It certainly needs a paint job. A few nicks and scrapes on the walls but no big deal. We had no frypan or toaster in the room but they were quickly sent up to usby friendly staff . The main problem we had was the \"Cloud 9 bed\". Not in the 2 bedroom apartments we were told after we went to our room and sat on the bed. It was more uncomfortable than a bed in a budget style roadside motel .After reading all the Clarion Suites web sites bragging about these great beds and intending to stay for 12 nights we wanted a comfortable bed. we were told they were only in the 1 bedroom apartments not the 2.

This was basically a 5 star bed without the price tag to the room rates. It is quite rare to experience this bed outside of the 5 & 6 star Hotels. This is a sign of things to come in our refurbishment...\" When I contacted management I was told they could not do anything about it and did i want to move back into two 1 bedroom apartments that had the cloud 9 beds. Yeah right, we had 2 kids for 12 nights. Not a good idea. He said he could help us move to a different hotel if I did not like where I was. The whole \"cloud 9 bed\" thing is very misleading and dishonest, the bed was so bad to sleep in. I spoke to management re the 100% guarantee satisfaction or refund of 1 nights accommodation flyer in the room and was told \"next time you come to Sydney we will give you 1 night free. What a joke. we came for 12 nights and spent a fortune, do you think we would come all the way back for 1 night free. The 100% satisfaction guarantee is a lie also.

The hotel (with the 1brm suites) and a separate adjacent building with the apartments. That doesn't seem to be clear anywhere. The pool is in the apartment buiding and to get there from our hotel it's a quick little jaunt thru the unfinished shopping plaza, out onto the street, and then into the apt bldg. Keep this in mind. However during the course of our stay (later rather than sooner) we found a way on our 7th floor by following directions to the \"executive rooms\" and catching their lift to the pool - no outdoors that way. They didn't tell us this way so presumably they don't want anybody using it. Location: At the entrance to the Dixon St mall in Chinatown with some great eating places. Not good for us as our fussy kids curled their noses up at it all. About 10 min walk to Town Hall Rail Station, and about 15min walk to Central Railway. Only 3-5 mins walk to World Square Shopping Centre, and enormous shopping complex with full-service Coles supermarket. I'll just add here that you're still in chinatown so it is like walking around in downtown Hong Kong, fun. MONORAIL station within the hotel/apt complex, very handy. Room: 1 bedroom suite with fold down sofa. Bar fridge (broken, leaking constanly), sink, dishwasher, 2burner cooktop, microwave. Wotif stated only one child in this room, so I rang hotel who advised it is quite OK and suitable for 2 small children, just put a remark in the bkg, which I did. When I followed up with hotel later about another matter they were rude and told me my bkg was \"illegal\". Long story short......they said they would honour the bkg (oh big thanks!)....I said, maybe train your staff with your product. The sofa bed was atrocious! Yes even for a kid! The base was a canvas trampoline thingy with no support underneath, but with a thin foam mattress on top. How even 1 adult could sleep on it is beyond belief. My kids kept rolling together and ending up either fighting in the midst of night or not sleeping well at all. Very disappointed. We ended up with kids in with us most of the time. Having said that, our bed was a dream, literally. Best bed I've ever kipped in. Everything in the rooms is tired/old/dated and in need of refurbishment. 2 TVs, of which only 1 worked. The bedroom wall mounted TV was only tuned into 1 station. We tried to fix, they tried to fix, but there's no fixing that one! Very disappointing. I might just add abouth the shower over bath combo. The bathtub is narrow at the bottom so it's really difficult to stand when showering. Cause your feet are at an angle it gets mighty slippery (our kids slipped over several times), they need to put in some grips there. Also the bath is high to climb into. Parking: Valet only at the cheap rate. That means you must hand they keys of your expensive car over to the 18yo manning the front desk. The car park is such a secret hideaway that you can't even drive your own vehicle to even accompanied by the 18yo. Very disappointing. And just where do you stand with your car insurance on this one?

The hotel provided \"facilities\" for the rest of the guests. This was 1 washer and 1 drier situated in an non-airconditioned room off the basement car park. The drier was broken for the whole of our stay which meant wet clothes drying around the apartments. The apartments themselves were simple and clean but in desperate need of some TLC. This goes for all the common areas as well. It is certainly not a 4* establishment. Our complaints were never resolved during our stay despite complaining several times over the 4 days we stayed there. We submitted a letter of complaint to the travel company when we returned.

I paid \u00c2\u00a349 a night, which is less than you would pay for Premier Lodge or Travel Lodge in the UK. For this you get a I bedroom apartment. The rooms had basic amount of furniture which would appear to be the original items form when the building opened ie about 8 years old. The hotel is currently undergoing a refurb, and I did have a look at the completed rooms. I have to say they looked a bit better than ours as it was all new, but it really was a paint job and up to date chrome microwave and kitchen stuff rather than white but thats all. The hotel is located in a excellent position to get around. Easy for CBD, Chinatown and the Central Station and Gay district if thats your thing. The staff were helpful, thought to be honest we didnt really need their help to get round Sydney as it is easy to navigate. We didn't have a problem with road noise as our room was 8 floors up and our bedoom didn't face on to the roads (room 839 or 836 i can't remember) . I would guess that if you had a front facing room it might be noiser, but you are in a city centre so that has to be expected. The gym was not open at the time, as it was on a floor that was being refitted, thought i did sneek a peek, and found it consisted of a cross trainer ,cycle and running mill and shower. I don't think you would want to share the gym as it was so small. The picture on the web site I think relate to the old gym, which is now the contracter's work office on floor 13. The only gripe we had was the fact the TV was broken, and took two days to repair. Apparently, as part of the refurb digital TV is being installed and they are having teething problems with it. I would not say the place was 4 star but more like 3 star but for less than \u00c2\u00a350 a night for a room thats good value. Other than that we found the room spacious, clean and suitable for most people. I would have no problem recommending this place to stay in.

Can walk to Oxford Street if the bar scene is your thing. Convenient store right next door, shopping areas and Chinatown within walking distance. Nice Spacious rooms, even has a decently equippied kitchen with tools, pot pans, utensils and china. The kitchen is probably the best thing about the room, it's more like being in a one bedroom apartment, so if you are here for a long time then it's more homely than a normal hotel room.

The Bad: The bed is the most uncomfortable I have slept on in god-knows-how-long. Just couldn't get a good night sleep at all. Super flat pillows and paper thin comforter didn't help. Temperature in room was impossible to control, actually don't even know if the Thermostat really worked, it didn't seem to make a difference what I turned it to. TV worked ok at the beginning but one day just didn't work anymore, asked the reception and they said it would take 2 days before I get it back. Had 2 fire alarms during the one week I was there, around 5-6 pm both times. The staff seemed to think it was quite normal I wonder if this is a frequent occurrence here. No internet, not even if you want to pay extra charges. The rooms here just aren't equipped with cable or DSL. Had to walk 2 blocks to a decent internet cafe. Tried stealing people's bandwidths on wi-fi but no success in this building. Overall: Not bad.... don't know if I would come back the very next time. Might have to try out 1 or 2 other places first to see if there are better places out there for the same price. Don't think it would be impossible if you look hard enough.

Slight downside was the distance to circular quay just after the new year celebrations but on other occasions we managed to get taxis reletivley easy. The location is close to the central buisness district and the night life of Sydney, one thing we had a gripe with was the monorail station was closed. In conclusion, we found it quiet, relaxing and well worth the money.

Quite a disappointment for a number of reasons: 1. The hotel is a VERY long building. The little reception is one end. To get to our room at the other end we had to take an elevator to level 7, then along a corridor, through a building connecting door to another set of elevators then up to our floor then along a very long corridor (not a very appealing one - like a tenement block) to get to the apartment. Just terrible with lots of luggage. 2. The air conditioning was broken down in the hotel and it was a very warm night. 3. The outlook over Chinatown was uninspiring to say the least. Nice view of lots of other people in their apartments though. 4. The apartment, although large, was a maze of small rooms and felt strangely claustrophobic. The kitchen had been cleaned with a smelly cloth and all surfaces needed a full wash down because they stank. 5. The elevator keys stopped working for us in the morning so we couldn't get back to reception since we couldn't do our little transfer at level 7. A real pain with a flight to catch. Based on the apartment we stayed in I couldn't recommend this hotel. Even the location is relatively poor. You're in a noisy part of town (traffic noise and people exiting the Entertainment Centre late at night) and apart from Chinatown and Darling Harbour the main sites are a long walk away. The waterside in Darling Harbour is over 10 mins fast walk, and Darling Harbour is hardly the \"real\" Sydney that new tourists want to see although it is a reasonably pleasant place. I can only assume that the people who have written the reviews haven't stayed in many other Sydney hotels.

As it turned out, there were several positives, including the apartment's facilities and courteous hotel staff. Also, the location across from Chinatown was a plus. However, there were also some negatives, depending on your apartment location and whether you are sensitive to noise. We stayed there a few weeks ago, and we had a very nice room with balcony facing Chinatown. It seemed like a great location, but it turned out to be very noisy -- traffic from the hotel's location at the intersection of two heavily traveled roads, and street noise (people laughing and shouting) until well past 3am. The hotel staff were able to relocate us to an interior room, and we had no problems with noise after that. The immediate neighborhood is also going through some sort of evolution -- a building across the street is being renovated (construction noise), while the large high-rise building behind the hotel (and shown in the hotel photo) is completely empty.", "Date": "March 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat position\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3006528", "Content": "I had a great stay at Clarion Suites in November 2004 but was very disappointed as there were no facilities at all.

So the staff member stood out in the middle of the road to flag one down. Getting himself totally drenched for about 15 minutes until a cab pulled up. That's dedication to service.

Although requests had been made for non smoking, we were advised that requests could not be guaranteed! This may have had something to do with a booking being made online. The reception staff were obliging when alerted to the seriousness of an unfulfilled request.
