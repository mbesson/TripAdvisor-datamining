I stayed for two nights in two different rooms then moved to a different hotel. The whole place is run down and I was advised by a local not to walk around the area after dark. The rooms are not as they appear to be in the web photographs. The two I stayed in were dingy, badly lit and the dark, dirty carpets and stained dark grey wallpaper did little to lift the mood. What look like cottage windows in the web photographs are mirror tiles. The d\u00e9cor is 60's, the beds were uncomfortable and in both rooms the sheets were stained. The windows open onto either busy, noisy streets or a dirty backyard where the open bins had an odour which bordered on indescribable. In the first room the bathroom was dirty, the shower stall was stained yellow and brown at every joint and the stall was not wide enough to stand in in any other way but diagonally. Also the door lock had been broken in and was hanging loose and the mirror light did not work. In the second room the 'bathroom' was a cupboard containing a toilet, wash basin and a shower head but no separate space for showering. In this second room the desk was in the alcove next to the shower/toilet cupboard and with all of the room lights on it was not possible to read the letters on the computer keyboard when it was on the desk. The entrance door hit the mattress edge and it was not possible to open the wardrobe door without standing on the bed. The only good part was the in-room breakfast which has to be pre-ordered the night before. This hotel is nowhere near good value for money, no matter how little they charge. My recommendation is to avoid it like the plague.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest, Romania", "Title": "\u201cA good hotel\u201d", "Author": "Neostream", "ReviewID": "UR124926927", "Content": "The hotel is small, I think it only has 10 rooms, but it's close to Termini station and minutes from Coliseum.

Every night you should fill in a paper with what you want for breakfast for the next day and specify the hour to be served. But all in all it was good and plenty to start the day. People from the hotel were nice and friendly, they all tried to help us with every need we had. Only one lady who served our breakfast one day, I didn't get her name was rude and cheeky.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cPleasant Surprises!\u201d", "Author": "MissingCubaAlready", "ReviewID": "UR116483409", "Content": "Being seconds from Termini station, and minutes from the Coliseum was ideal.

Hotel room itself was nice and clean, although on the small side, but that\u2019s Rome in general. We stayed here only one night because it was close to Termini station and had a flight to catch the next morning. With that being said, the hotel served its purpose. I would not recommend this hotel to people trying to explore Rome or to stay here for any other purposes other than travel convenience. As many other travelers mentioned, the neighborhood is very seedy, poor and run down. It really doesn\u2019t feel like Italy at all. So if you would like to explore the city, pay some extra money and stay in a different neighborhood.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "oxon", "Title": "\u201cBlink and you miss it\u201d", "Author": "hesdin007", "ReviewID": "UR66807588", "Content": "Very close to termini so not far to walk with your luggage.

We were a family of 4 all cramped into one room. 2 singles beds together as a double and two singles in one room. Barely any room between beds. Neighborhood is run down. We booked this room for convenience to the train station which it had. Neighborhood was disappointing but we did not spend much time there except as a sleeping point. Next time, I would choose a hotel in a better tourist location close to a subway stop. The Termani is the central train and subway station so all subways get you there, close proximity to the actual station is not required. Live and learn. Neighborhood is in poor condition and offers little (contrary to their website). You are at least a mile walk from anything Roman....not a short walk as they say. Their location is by Piazza Vittorio Emanuel, a rundown city park.", "Date": "May 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGood location but lack of facilities\u201d", "Author": "karen057", "ReviewID": "UR16973808", "Content": "The best thing about this hotel is its central location. It is within walking distance of the main Roma Termini station and the nearest Metro. I would say this was a 2 star, not a 3 star hotel because of the lack of facilities. There is no reception area, no lounge, and no bar. You walk in off the street and straight up the staircase where all bedrooms are on the first floor.The room was clean and the linen was changed daily, but there was hardly any storage space and no room to put anything - not even a towel hook - in the bathroom. The room was small, dark and dimly lit. Breakfast is served in the room, and this was good. The staff on the desk are helpful and friendly. Unfortunately there is virtually no soundproofing and you can hear the breakfast trolley trundling up the corridor from 6.00am so don't expect to sleep late in the morning !", "Date": "June 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zh", "Title": "\u201cDumped by the Hotel Mamiani\u201d", "Author": "SMMcL", "ReviewID": "UR13520521", "Content": "I arrived at the Hotel Mamiani only to be told that my room, which had been booked for well over 3 weeks had been given away to another guest and there was no room for me there. Instead, the concierge booked me into a sister hotel called The Osimar which was well out of the heart of Rome but he told me he would pay the taxi fare for me to get there. When I protested that I didn't want to spend the weekend so far away from the major attractions I was simply told that the concierge himself travels one and a half hours each day to get to Rome and that Rome is a big city. While he apologised to me I could tell he was merely waiting for the taxi to arrive and take me out of his sight. I got into the taxi and with a little help from my husband promptly booked myself another room in a Roman hotel I had stayed in the year previously. The entire experience was extremely stressful and I am thankful that it was not my first time in Rome therefore was able to tell how far the Hotel Osimar was from where I wanted to be and also was able to call another hotel and book myself into it.", "Date": "February 13, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Mamiani", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d796339-Reviews-Hotel_Mamiani-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$79 - $216*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Mamiani 28</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00185</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "796339", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/7e/a9/7ea984f3d56008fb28c0bdb3176a2efb3large.jpg"}}
