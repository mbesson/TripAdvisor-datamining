The hotel is lovely, very modern and beautifully decorated, the staff were all very helpful and the food was great. I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a good 4* in a central location. We stayed on B&B and the breakfast was good, there was a buffet with a good selection of food from hot breakfast to pastries and fruit, something for everyone. The rooms are quite small but this is to be expected in a city centre location, but very well equipped. We had a room on the 6th floor at the back of the hotel which was very quiet, except a noisy neighbour... but that cant be helped! The bathroom was spacious with a large shower, there was also a safe which is free of charge to use in the room, the coffee machine was a big plus too! There is a nice wine bar area at the hotel and a restaurant which we didn't actually eat at but the food looked great. The trams are the best way to travel around the city and there is a stop a minute or so down the road from the hotel and another just round the corner which will take you to pretty much anywhere in the city. The best thing to do it get the train from Schiphol airport for about 8euro per person return and then get a tram pass from the GVB ticket office outside central station, we got a 48hr pass for 24euro. This way you can jump on and off the trams as much as you like during your stay. The staff at the hotel are able to give you tram maps, and also offered to make us any dinner reservations or book excursions for us (At the same price as the shops on the streets which I thought was very handy).

The next day, we were out for the day and on return our room key was blocked. The receptionist then informed us that we have not paid the city tax so the key was blocked. We told the receptionist that we were not aware of any tax. However, they asked for 5 per cent of the room rate so we setteled the bill and we were advised that there would not be any further charges. The next day the same thing happened which was at this point very frustrating!!! We complained That we should have been advised of this on arrival and shouldn't be harassed during our stay! Then to top it up, on the last night of our stay the receptionist called our room at 9:30pm asking for 100 Euros for deposit for the room!

We arrived early (1100) and due to many checking out at that time our rooms were not ready so we stored our luggage and with the instructions and map provided by the very helpful desk clerk set off sightseeing. The clerk had given us brief instructions on use of the city tram system, which we found very useful and helpful given our ambitious agenda for the day and the temperature outside was quite cold as well (-6 C) for walking. We spent the day touring the Rembrandt House, Anne Frank House, and the Van Gogh museum. All were fantastic and well worth the special stop over we made in Amsterdam following our Mediterranean vacation. We returned to the Hotel Albus at approximately 6 p.m. and our rooms were ready. The desk clerk even assisted helping bring the luggage to our rooms. The rooms are a modern decor, which is generally not to my personal taste as generally I find modernism a cold and sterile environment. However, I found the Hotel Albus decor modern yet inviting, warm, and comfortable. The rooms have coffee makers in each room, which my husband and our traveling partners took advantage of and enjoyed. There was also a complimentary bottle of water in each room. The beds were extremely comfortable with wonderful down comforters. I received the best night sleep of our whole 11 day trip (although the generous dose of fresh air and activity also contributed). I enjoyed the rain shower head despite the lower water pressure, it was novel to me and did the job it needed to do. The heated floors were an extra plus! The hotel lobby also sported a modern decor and due to the cold weather we really appreciated the gas fireplace and the wonderful warmth that was generated. We did take advantage of the 15 minutes free wifi in the lobby to touch base with our work. This was useful, but so many of the hotels that I have frequented now offer free wifi in the rooms without a time limit. Even the old fashioned Hotel Gaudi in Barcelona offered unlimited wifi with a similar boarding rate as the Albus. Not sure if there are differences with wifi installation and charges between the countries that contribute to the difference? There was also an extra charge for breakfast, which we found a bit spendy (19 Euros) and did not partake. Majority of the European hotels we have stayed in always provide the breakfast as part of the room rate. I did peek in the restaurant where the breakfast was provided and it did look nice, but I am not sure if worth 19 euros. The night before we had a fantastic steak dinner at the little Italian restaurant next door for 11.95 euros. We did have drinks in the Hotel lobby bar and the prices did seem reasonable at about 4.50 euros for a nice glass of wine. After check out and requesting a van to take our group to the airport we had not realized that taxi's (esp vans) are not as readily accessible as in other European countries. After a bit of a wait we found out that the van was stuck in traffic and we ended up having to have to regular taxis called to transport as we were not going to make it to the airport within the 2 hour international flight guidelines. Our traveling partners took the first taxi as their flight departed earlier and thanks to the wonderful driver (who arrived 5-10 minutes later) that we had the opportunity to ride with we beat them to the airport! Overall, we had had a very nice stay at the Hotel Albus and I would definitely recommend as a place to stay and would stay again in the future!

Which we NEVER received a letter or a note regarding it as hotels usually do when leaving any messages; we were only informed about it next day during check out when we were so tight in time for our plane.

Knowing that no one mentioned the warning during our check in, the receptionist didn't say anything and she manipulated us by asking for our credit card & signature without explaining anything about it, it was our mistake not reading what we signed for but we expected a verbal notice as well when it comes for something essential.as hotel services we expected helpful employees to guide us through the hotels extreme policy (Helping the customer should be number 1 priority at any hotel) We spoke to the person we checked out with regarding this issue for almost an hour, She said that \"we apologies for not informing you clearly and not sending a letter to your room that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our mistake \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.

The point is that the hotel failed to complete the nonsmoking policies correctly toward the guests, by informing every guest about it very clearly upon check in.

The hotel rooms aren't the biggest in the dam, but they're absoultely top quality and the shower is lovely. If you can get a room with a balcony, it certainly adds the wow factor too!

It was a combination of the location, the claims of a comfortable bed and the in room expresso machine that won me over. It was the staff and the cozyness of the place that I fell in love with once I arrived. The lobby and coctail bar are a combined room and lead into the small dining area that is the Senses restaurant. The restaurant has its own intrance and is good enought to have a customer base that is not made up of hotel guests. It is pricey and the resident chef changes the multi-course special nightly. The one dinner we ate there was awesome. The bed was as advertised and we slept well every night. The curtains are very dark making it easy to sleep late in the morning.(no alarm clock in the room). The bathroom has a switchable outlet for 110V and 220V devices. The shower head is huge and takes some getting used to. There is also a smaller sprayer attached to the tub spout and a retractable wire for hanging cloths. (came in handy the one night we got rained on). The expresso machine was stocked to make 4 cups each day. The staff is what really makes this hotel. From the time we arrived till we walked out the door to leave I felt welcome. All request were met with polite enthusiasm and all of them were fulfilled. Some side notes. there is a small grocery store just south of the hotel and an electronics store just north on the same street. The train station is a 25 min walk from the hotel(if you dont make any wrong turns) We walked from the train station to the hotel when we arrived and took the shuttle on the return trip to the airport.

Let me start by thanking Mr Boumann, the reservation agent, who patiently replied to all of my (many...) questions prior to our arrival, and who on arrival presented us with a compliementry bottle of Prosecco, as a welcoming birthday gift - truly wonderful touch. Hotel is beautiful, clean, modern, in a perfect location. Our room was upgraded to the Stunning Suite, and my, stunning it was!! I have travelled a lot, around the world, but this was one of the nicest rooms I have ever stayed in. Exactly as you can see on the hotel's website. Especially the bed, so heavenly comfortable we had problems dragging ourselves out of it in the morning. Bathroom was not as modern as the room but perfect nonetheless - I loved the choice of two showers (rainforest and a \"standard\"one). I didn't hear any noises in the morning. NOT AT ALL. And cleaning staff was there at 10 am, not 7, as the person few reviews down suggests (looking at the date, we were at Albus at the same time). Advice to people who complain about the noise (from the street, trams etc etc) - just don't spend your holidays in the city if you can't put up with the city's noise! Or stay in hotels in the suburbs, not in the centre. Staff at the reception was also lovely, very helpful, ready to answer any querries, always with a smile. I was really sad leaving, this is how welcoming the hotel was. I will recommend it to all of my friends (and anyone who reads this review!) and I hope to be back there in the near future.

We had quite a few options for hotel but somehow ended up picking this one. Came over to spend 2 nights for Valentine's day. As we're only here for short 3 days 2 nights and my boyfriend hasn't been to Amsterdam before, therefore, I've planned quite a busy schedule for us to see the most out of Amsterdam within those 3 days. Arrived Amsterdam Centraal around 12, as we know, check-in is at 2pm, therefore, we walked around sightsee abit with our luggage to kill time and have lunch. Went into the hotel to check in at 210pm, expect the room will be ready. But disappointingly, receptionist staff said our room is not cleaned yet due to the previous customer has checked out late and they're busy to clean all other rooms. Which wasn't a good start as I expect to quickly get ready in the room and go out and spend the rest of our day sightseeing. We ended up sitting in the lobby to reschedule or plan since we've lost another hour or so. Ended up our original plan was ruined because 2pm the room wasn't not ready. We didn't get to have our room til nearly 245pm!! Perhaps for some, an hour or so, not make any difference, but when you've a tight schedule to see and do the most, it's a lot. We've booked a smart city room and I've been trying to find out before we arrive if bath-tub is included or not as we do fancy a nice bath after a long day out. Even had an email respond saying bath-tub is available in some smart-city rooms. So when we check in, we asked for one, but ended up, the staff said we'll have to pay 10EUROS extra per night for that kind of upgrade. We didn't take it as most times we're not gonna be in the room anyway, but just a pitty charging extra if you want bath-tub as well. Mind you, they couldn't give us a room on time for a start then still want to charge 10Euros extra if we want a room with a bathtub. Kind of disappointed service. Most other hotels if things like this happen, would be offering us the room with a bathtub since the room was free and available and rather than keeping the customer unhappy and waiting in the lobby for their designated room to be cleaned. Bad start - then when we walk into our room, was shocked, how small it's compare to the photos we've seen. At least the room is nicely decorated and comfy bed and pillows. The room was so dark, as there's no ceiling lights, only 2 bedside lamp which you can move it up and down but 1 of them the cable was lose, only on in certain angle. The table lamp doesn't even work!!!! So we only had the 2 bedside lamp and the dimlights from the back of the TV wall. VERY DARK indeed. It's still daylight, and our room was at the back, even had all the curtains open, still dark! Bathroom - I should say SHOWER ROOM instead. VERY BASIC - like some people were saying, the bathroom/shower-room certainly doesn't match with the rest of the room as the room is modern contemporary style, but bathroom is very basic standard! Worst thing about the bathroom/shower-room is, there's NO HOOKS to hank your towels or clothes. The only hook is behind the door, which there's already a bathrobe hanged and also the door isn't technically close to the shower is. So if you hang your towel there, you'll have to walk a few steps to get your towel when you're soakingly wet. Of course no hooks to hang the hand towels. The only place you can hang your towels besides the door hook is the rail above the toilet, which is extremely stupid to put it there because all the towels were original placed over there, and 2 hand towels on top of each other. When I pull 1 hand towel off, the other one also slide and guess what.. drop straight into the toilet!!!! Embarrassing to say, it NEVER HAPPENED to me in my entire life of travelling! They really should invest some money on improving their facilities in the bathroom/shower-room. The shower also is very annoying. It's nice to have a head shower, but, it's fixed and there's no other way of getting water from the shower besides from the top of your head. Walk in shower without door or anything just half blocked by the wall, the water still splashed everywhere, makes it very wet and messy on the floor. We already opened the window, and the steam from the shower, just stays in the shower-room for ages! when I say ages is at least good half an hour or even longer. Ended up I have to clear the mirror with towels! Perhaps installing fan in the bathrooms will be ideal too. Lights again in the bathroom is very yellow and dark as well. So after a long day out and back to the hotel ready to sleep at 1030pm - thought we will just drop dead and sleep like a baby til morning. WRONG! First the next door irresponsible Spanish tourists - been so so so loud and noisy for good hour or so, the noise sound so abnormal, then we went outside to check, their door was wide open, and we've noticed, it's not some party nose. We did not exactly see what happened but there's few people in the room, banging, screaming and smacking someone. Then we've noticed someone was drug overdose. Either was passing out or dying whatever that is. We had our TV on still can hear them so loud, got to a point we want to sleep, but they're just getting louder and louder. We called reception - the staff was polite, but obviously knows something going on, and said next door someone is very sick, waiting for ambulance. We're dying for the ambulance to turn up and take that irresponsible disturbing neighbour away from us. The whole incident was a good 2 and a half hours long until it goes quiet. Alleluia.. as we slowly fall asleep.. me and my boyfriend were taking turn waking up by some knocking sound, banging sound throughout the night. Perhaps is Valentine's night, you expect people will be up for some romance. I must say, Albus hotel walls are seriously thin like wafers. Never stayed in any hotel that you can hear noise all night long which isn't coming from outside the building. Can hear people walking on corridors either outside our room/upstairs/downstairs. Knocking or Banging whatever on the wall and strangely the noise do pass from the back of your head on the wall. As if you're wearing some earphones surround sound keep hearing knocking. Strange thing is our room is the last room at the end of the corridor which there's no right hand side neighbour. But the sound sounds like it's from the right hand side of the room. Kind of creepy as we thought, it's the end of the building and not attached to another building, where is the knocking come from? some kind of ghosts? lol. That's how bad it's about the walls in this hotel. My boyfriend woke up 3 times in the middle of the night thinking someone was knocking on our door. I woke up 6-7 times throughout the night because I just couldn't stand anymore. TERRIBLE night! DID NOT SLEEP well and much at all, waking up feeling worse than not having any sleep. Doesnt even matter how comfy is the bed and pillow anymore. It's all these noise killed our night. Then we thought shall we ask if we can change room for our 2nd night. But then we've unpacked our stuff, will be annoying to pack and unpack again since it's just 1 more night and also we dont have all day, on tight schedule as a tourist. If we stay more than 2 nights we would of asked to change to another room. So we thought forget it, perhaps, it won't be as bad on the next night. Which was better than 1st night, but still some knocking noise throughout the night. Like some people were mentioning - breakfast not included and they gave us 25% off if we want to purchase breakfast but it's such a rip off, cafes, mcdonalds are just few steps away, not worth taking breakfast here. Saying it's a 4* hotel, internet is not included which's disappointing and it's so crazily expensive is another ridiculous thing. We've regretted choosing Albus Hotel as we could of pay the same money for same convenient location, same standard, include breakfast and free wifi. Sound is another thing which maybe other hotel will still have the same issues. But at least you get more out of your money after all. Tourist like us in a tight schedule needs a good night sleep which this hotel didn't give us at all. Having said about all these negative things. I also want to say some good things about this hotel to end my review - 1. Nespresso coffee machine in the room - can't get any better in a hotel room!! 2. Location is fairly central which going to anywhere is just walking distance. Saving money and time for transport! 3. Lobby is modern, nicely decorated. 4. Room is very clean.

There is information on that on the hotel website. We booked the hotel as a package incl flight through easyjet, for about \u00c2\u00a3219 PP not including breakfast - but there is plenty of choice for food walking around the city so this was not an issue. We had a deluxe room as there were 3 of us staying, the room was very big and quite clean - despite cigarette burns in the quily cover. There were tea and coffee making facilities which were reguarly topped up, and the amenities were good - some nice aloe vera body lotions etc. The only things that were wrong with the room was the shower kept going hot and cold, one of the lights flickered on and off a lot even though the bulb was fine and it was very warm at night even with the window open. But otherwise I was impressed with the room, there was a nice table and chairs to sit on. There is building works on at the moment, and despite saying the work began at 10am to minimise noise disturbance, it started more 9:25ish - we were usually up at about 8:30 anyway but on the last day we allowed a lie in and it was too noisy for this. The staff were friendly at check in and provided us with a map - we had lots of amsterdam leaflets in our room too which was good - They were helpful when we asked for more tea and coffee and booked our shuttle bus for our return. We did not have to speak to the staff much but I get the feeling they would have been helpful with any queries we had.

We had a really nice time there and would recommend the hotel to any one travelling to Amsterdam. The staff at the reception desk are very friendly and helpful. A few points to note however, we had booked three non-smoking rooms yet we all ended up in smoking rooms where there was a very strong smell of smoke. There is no safe in the room which I did not like and to leave valuables at reception costs \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.50 a day. Now,a potentially big problem:This hotel accepts stag/hen parties. We were lucky as there was a gang of English guys who did not make a sound and did not wake us but not everyone might be so lucky! When they say breakfast is served until 10.30 at weekends that means you must be in and seated with your breakfast in front of you at that time......don't arrive at the last minute as we did or you'll be turned away(we had gone by the clock on the T.V. in the room which was slow). Some of our gang went for breakfast one morning and felt that it was not particularly good value for what they got and did not go any other day. The hotel in well situated anyway with lots of nice cafes and restaurants nearby. (Do NOT go to the Italian next to the hotel....poor food, dreadfully slow and an unpleasant whiff from the loos!). The rooms are very hot with no A.C. so be sure to leave the window open during the day to keep the room cool. If you enjoy walking around a city then you will love the location. Although a few minutes south of Dam Square it was not far at all and was quite near the Heineken Brewery so we could walk there too. It is just around the corner from the Flower markets(lots of nice little cafes here, try the first one on the left \"Amaryllis\" for breakfast).

The one big drawback was that it was a gorgeous day for sightseeing, but that meant our room on the top floor of the hotel was extremely hot because of the lack of air conditioning . We survived and would go back there again. Upon checking out there was a shuttle bus for 12 euros each heading to the airport. We picked it up across the street.
