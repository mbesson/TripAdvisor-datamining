They serve a delicious breakfast in the room, but best of all, the staff is awesome. Mr. Luciano welcomed us to Venice by recommending one of the best cichetti restaurants on that side of town. He and his business partner consistently recommended excellent dining establishments, interesting places to sight see, and provided us with friendly and helpful directions along with maps. When I broke my arm at the end of the stay Mr. Luciano even made a trip to the local Farmacia for me.

My girlfriend and I spend 3 days and 2 nights in Venice and I was recommended the hotel from another hotel I tried to book initially and I was very happy with the recommendation. The hotel is small, personal and atmospheric with old style Venetian interior. We has a big double (nr. 8) with direct view to the Canal Grande and the Accademia Bridge and with nice bamboo chairs and a small table for great breakfast experience. This was how I wanted it just me and my girlfriend alone for breakfast looking out on the Canal Grande with its sights. Breakfast was served at the room punctually and just outside our room the hotel had a complementary minibar containing water and sodas for free. (such a small thing just adds so much value) Everything we wanted to do was within short walking reach with several vaporetto stops (besides Accademia, Zattere is less than 5 minutes on foot away making for easy access to Guidecca), San Marco just a short walk 10 minute walk away and my personal favorite the walks in the small street, squares and canals of Dorsudoro and San Polo beginning right outside the door. The staff was very nice and helpful with our questions and had good recommendations on eatering (my girlfriend still claims the gorgonzola and spice sausage pizza we got recommended was the best pizza she have eaten). We could leave bags at the hotel for the third day (we had a late flight-so we had a full extra day) and when we accidentally passed the hotel in the middle of the day, they let us use the toilets. If I have to point to any downsides I have to think hard. The only, but obvious, that comes to mind was the price. It was rather high, but that is Venice and if I have to be honest I do think the price is much more reasonable for such a good location in Venice than what most other hotels can offer. If I have to be really, really picky the reception staff recommended us to take line 15 to Burano whereas I wanted to take line LN. We made it with line 15 (after 2 changes and some waiting on a isolated island) but line LN would have been faster (we took it back), although it was far more crowded - so maybe the nice, less crowded but slower trip was what the receptionist had in his mind. If so I guess he deserves credit for trying to give us the prettiest and most comprehensive sightseeing trip of the two (and eliminate what ever slight irritation I may have had). The most importantly is if you are happy with what you got, and we were. I definitely would recommend the hotel especially to couples looking for a romantic breakaway.

I must have reviewed about 400! Hotel Galleria seemed to offer exactly what I was looking for - a central location, small number of rooms, elegant (not over done) decor, an affordable price - plus it was part of an old palace, which was appealing. It's facilities were limited (breakfast served in the room) and not all rooms had their own bathrooms. There were so many glowing reviews of the warm and accommodating hosts and staff - and of the hotel generally - that I decided that this was the place for our special holiday. We were returning to Venice for our 25th Wedding Anniversary, having Honeymooned here in 1984. So - I really hoped I'd made the right choice.... I couldn't have made a better decision! I booked their best room - Room 10 - which is huge, is decorated with antique furniture and has a fabulous stucco ceiling (and does have its own bathroom!). It has two sets of windows which look out over the Grand Canal - in one direction straight to the Accademia Bridge. Locations in Venice don't come much better than this! A delicious and ample breakfast was brought to us at a time of our choice - and there was plenty of room to comfortably sit and enjoy the meal in the room. And for the morning of our departure - at 5am - the gentleman manning the reception overnight kindly prepared thermos flasks and pre-packed food so that we wouldn't start our day hungry and thirsty. A mini bar in the corridor provided unlimited free still and sparkling water, as well as a variety of fizzy drinks. I have never come across such a provision anywhere else and it is a thoughtful touch that will always be remembered by guests, I am sure. Everyone at the hotel - owners Luciano and Stefano and all of their staff - were unfailingly helpful and friendly. They were on hand to recommend and book restaurants, look up weather forecasts, provide umbrellas and just generally add to the joy of being in Venice. Yes, I know I'm gushing here - but really - our stay at Hotel Galleria couldn't have been happier or better. From the occasional views I had of the other rooms, I would say they are mostly quite small, but I heard several other guests saying how happy they had been with their stay, so they are obviously satisfied.

But Luciano, the owner, told me that it's right by the Accademia bridge and he was exactly right. I went in, and the place while small is tastefully done to every detail. It's an old palazzo that they converted into a 10-room hotel. I got a room with no private bath and it was the first time I did that. I was quite worried about common T&B but this one was good. It was always clean and it felt like I was the only one using it. Breakfast was served in the room, which was excellent. I had a small Venetian window that looked out partially to the Grand Canal and the Accademia bridge. It was postcard-perfect. I could people-watch as I ate (while they watched me too) and see the moving boats and gondolas. It was a great reminder every morning that I was in one of the most fabulous cities in the world. Luciano, one of the owners, was truly helpful with tips and all. I asked for a recommendation for a good last dinner in Venice in an non-touristy place and he pointed me to Restoteca Oniga in Piazza San Barnaba for authentic Venetian cuisine and I must say the restaurant did not disappoint. In fact, I recommended it to a Client who went to Venice two weeks after I left and she had the same great reviews. Luciano also gave me a tip on where to eat in Florence which was my next destination-- a place called Mario's right by the central market in Florence. Nothing fancy, just a hole in the wall eatery but my oh my their Florentine steak was to die for! Anyone who goes to Florence must go to Mario's.

The noise was not really a problem after the first night and consisted mainly of vaporettos coming and going at the very nearby Accademia stop - I think it gave a kick to some riders to see us drinking wine and eating cheese and olives on our windowsill!

We booked the room well in advance after reading reviews on Trip Advisor and other similar sites. We booked room #10 and could not have been more pleased. It is a huge room with two large windows which open right on the canal. You cannot get any closer to the canal or the Academia Bridge. We didn't spend a lot of time in the room, mostly to sleep and shower and change clothes throughout the days. We were glad to have the largest room in the place, but felt it would have been completely acceptable to have either room 8 or 9, as they seemed large enough for our needs, yet I think only have one window in each room. We were able to check our bags early (10 AM), but our room was being readied so we couldn't 'check in' which was no big deal, we were anxious to check out the neighborhood, which we did, then about 11:30AM decided to head back to the hotel area (literally the foot of the Academia Bridge) and have lunch at the pizzeria next door also against the canal and on the first floor of the building that the hotel is in (the hotel consumes the 2nd floor of the buidling with a private residence on the 3rd and fourth - typical venetian). The food at the pizzeria was decent, and like everything else in Venice a little expensive - but you must know if you are going to Venice it will be a little expensive. They didn't charge for a table (per person at some restaurants like 1 or 2 euros) or add any service charge (again like some other restaurants - typically 10%); it was included in the price of their food (~7-10 euro per pizza and drinks at ~3-4 euro). The two breakfasts we had were adequate and typical european, and served when you asked for it and on lovely pewter settings. Dorsoruduro is an excellent locaiton in Venice and you won't be dissapointed for not staying in San Marco or any other area in Venice. Rialto market is only 10-15 minutes walk away (depending on how long it takes you to make it past all the shops). Right down the closest street towards the Peggy Guggeheim is the tronchetto to the area nearest St. Mark's square; the Zatterre on the Guidiecca Canal is literally right down the street with Nico's (ice cream) and La Pescina - a great seafood restaurant (which is at the John Ruskin House and La Calcina Hotel, which is also highly reccommended on this site and which I contacted as an alternative to Galleria - which when all booked up actually gave me a discount at the restaurant for contacting them - 11%. The hotel is in the best location, one of the few hotels within 20-25 steps of a valperetto stop, which should be extremely attactive to anyone with even one or more bags, as nothing was more sad than seeing tourists schleeping their bags up and down the canal bridges, trying navigating the tough streets of Venice in search of their hotel. The staff is equally awesome at Hotel Galleria. The desk is staffed around the clock and you have to ring to get the door opened, very safe. We were recommended restaurants and sites by the staff, etc. There is a cool little bar as you head towards the Guggenheim called the Corner Bar with three stools that sit on the sidewalk. Good beer and coca-cola on tap - a locals place and really neat to sit outside for a beer or two. Don't think twice about reserving a room at the Hotel Galleria - you won't be dissapointed and you will be equally pleased with your decision to not spend $200-300 more per night at a place that doesn't come close to the ammenities that this place has.", "Date": "October 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cWow\u201d", "Author": "Leimen", "ReviewID": "UR5890276", "Content": "We loved.

It had a fan to make up for the lack of air conditioning. The room was very well presented and clean and had a stunning view of the Grand Canal and Accademia Bridge, which most people would have paid good money to sit in a cafe for. The hotel staff were very welcoming and helpful. The only downside of the room was that it was next to the communal bathroom so there was some noise late at night and the shower would occasionally change in temperature without warning. There was work going on to the exterior of both buildings adjoining the hotel.

The double paned windows do a good job of shutting noise out, but the construction is not the view we wanted. also, in 2 wks of touring Italy, this was one of the softer mattresses we encountered.

Yes, small rooms but they're long and skinny so you still have a decent amount of space, just not quite in the places you'd like it! Sitting out on our window ledge, feet dangling over the Grand Canal, eating bread and olives and drinking Prosecco - I feel sure half the people on the passing vaporettos were wishing they had our room! It's in an ideal spot if you want to explore both the typical tourist sites and sample some Venetian local favourites. And the map they gave us in the room was better than any of the ones in the guidebooks we brought. As for the noise from the boats, well...it's part of the territory in this city really but we found if we really couldn't sleep we could close the shutters, keep the window ajar and use the ceiling fan for ventilation, no worries. On the whole a perfect hotel for a romantic getaway - would definitely recommend to friends. On a practical note, getting there from the airport is easy. We took the 11 Euro Alilaguna boat, takes about an hour and 10 minutes and you get a great view of the islands, get off at the last stop - Zattare, then walk straight through to the Accademia bridge, the hotel is on your right.

The quintessential view of Venice! I doubt there's another hotel in Venice with this view, at the rates you'll find here. Our room was miniscule, but I could live with that.

Maybe rooms on a higher floor would be a better choice. Other than that, the location is great - just steps from the Accademia bridge, museums and restaruants.

It was a single room with a twin bed. The bathroom is on the same floor and very clean and charming with a carved wood mirror above the sink. There is no bathtube. If you come from a big family, lived in a dorm or had a roommate it will not disturb you. Most of the time people are going to the restroom or shower at different times so it isn't such a big inconvience. Breakfast is serviced between 8am to 930am. It is a contential breakfast, but very generous. You get a pot of coffee, good size glass of orange juice, yogurt, baked on location hard roll and crossiant stuffed with apricot jam. That is not all, there are rusk type slices, wedge of cheese, jams- apricot & strawberry and butter. It is all delivered to your room at the hour you specify. It is just to the right of the Accademia Bridge and Gallery. You have less than 1/2 a block to the vaporetta stop. The view across is a lovely old palace that is painted white and yellow that is now a museum. Just to that building's right is another old palace that once housed, Monet, Whistler and where Henry James finised \"Wings of a Dove\". If that is not enough, the Peggy Guggenheim Museum is just a block's walk away. The area is surrounded by small boutique like shops, as well as a shoe store that sells fusilli and a expresso-pasterria. The staff goes out of their way for you. You couldn't ask for more.
