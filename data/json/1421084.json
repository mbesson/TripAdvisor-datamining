My friends and I had no problems upon checking in and the rooms were very clean and very chic. Staff helpful. You get your value here. The hotel is located right in the heart of everything, right off of the famouse La quinta (5th Ave.) Where there are many restaurants and plenty of night clubs. Its the best place to stay in f you plan on having a good time and party at night! the best clubs are right on 12th. Plenty of restaurants and shopping along 5th ave. The beach is a short skip and jump from the hotel as well! The front desk people don't seem to know too much about the happenings in playa but they tried....

In playa del carmen are really old and I mean those one that the average night in 100$ and down. If you looking for hotel in 130$, that look chic with European style you find the right place: \"Infashion boutique hotel\". About the rooms: I'm speechless about the rooms. Although we took the petit suite it's not was so petit lol. . I just love it! All the designer furniture was incredible, the suit is big and comftable everything styling in white and with a liitle bitt of touchups of red. In one word-authentic!@&! I just want to mention that hotel is in front the \"coco bongo\" and the palazzo the famous clubs of playa So if you looking for quiet in the night- forget it! It's gonna be noisy. But if gonna be drunk you're gonna be just fine. There is a wifi in the rooms-really strong. The hotel is located in the perfect location of playa. All the best restaurants and clubs are under your nose. Everything in the hotel are new and impressive. So it's worth the money that you pay. I hope youl enjoy from your vacation.

I was staying here to celebrate NYE 2012. We arrived, they didn't have my reservation. I of course had a copy which I had to email the lady on reception. I was given the last room. Lucky me...or so I thought. I had to go back to reception three times as the key didn't work (turned out I didn't need it anyway as all we had to do is push the door hard and it opened) For several hundred U.S Dollars you would perhaps expect a toilet seat? If the room has a plasma screen it would make sense to have a remote (don't bother calling reception for it thou as it will never arrive) I thought I might go to the gym to work of some steam, I asked for a Map of the area so I could get to gym. It was my first time in Playa Del Carmen and indeed Mexico. No maps. I was pointed in a direction and told it was about three blocks in that way. Some effort or more assistance would have been nice after a long flight. What they also failed to mention is that the club downstairs has music playing until the early hours, even with ear plugs the rumble of the bass can be felt through floors and deep into any nightmare. Thankfully me and my friends moved into an apartment first thing in the morn. Of course there were problems checking out, they apparently charged me $30 less then they should have. There was no way I was going to hand over any cash to the reception staff after the horrific hotel experience. They told me they would just charge the card used for a reservation. All I could think about was getting out of there. In Fashion hotel? Outta your mind.

The hotel is very modern and classy, and we loved our spotless room with an amazing bathroom, and the rooftop deck with view and pool. The staff was always very friendly, smiling and hospitable. The hotel is close to the beach and Quinta Avenida and every price range of restaurants imaginable....we ate lots of delicious Mexican food! We had a rental car and even found street parking without a problem. Unfortunately we booked a king and got a room with two double beds (apparently the hotel was sold out for New Year's weekend). Also, we were given breakfast tickets the first day (to a Brazilian restaurant around the corner with a delicious breakfast buffet with all sorts of options, both sweet and savory, Mexican and international, tropical fruits, etc., and we thought it was a one time thing - free breakfast). On our last day as we were heading out to see Tulum (pyramid site) early in the morning, the concierge asked if we wanted breakfast tickets. I asked why we weren't offered them everyday, or given them all at the beginning, and was told because people lose them. But nowhere did it say breakfast was included daily. Shame on us for not asking, but it would have been nice if somebody had told us just in case! So...if you book this place, make sure you know there is a rooftop area to hang out, that breakfast is included, you may not get the room you requested, and that it is not in a quiet area at all.

It is a hotel with a night life and it is very close to large clubs like coco bongos which I thought would make this place too noisy but we slept beautifully. The staff at the hotel are accommodating and friendly and I will recommend also the day spa. Karen in the spa is lovely and offers beautiful relaxing treatments.

There's no room service in the hotel but they have a menu from a \"partner\" restaurant, but apparently they forgot they are partners cause once u call to order they have no idea of what are you talking about, so u might as well forget about your room service. They send you for breakfast to an external restaurant, don't go! It's the worst breakfast I've ever had!!! Oooh and also forget about sleeping, you can hear the music and screams from the clubs next to the hotel until 8:00 am, a total nightmare. The only good thing is the location, but given everything is close and you can walk everywhere in Playa, it's not a superr plus they have, and you cannot even park on that street.

We were able to walk right out the door and around the corner to 5th ave. and just a cpl blocks to the Beach and our fav. Beach club Zensi where we spent every day we went to the beach.Was also not to far from Walmart and the Mega store if you wanted to you could easily walk both ways without much effort.With this location we were also right down the street from Coco Bongo and a cpl other night clubs a few steps out the door,depending who you are that could be a good thing or a not so good thing,as we are day people and go to sleep typically early before the party gets started we brought with us some ear plugs as we had been aware of that fact before we went and were able to have good nights sleep each night as the beds and pillows and bedding were quite nice. The staff was very friendly and always with a friendly greeting especially the front desk staff both morning and evening,they were helpful with local tips and helped me locate a hairdryer.There was always someone at the front to open the door for you as well. The breakfast offering was quite good as well,better then we expected Ipanemas grill had a nice spread with good fresh fruit,yogurt, two kinds of Chilaquiles,different stlye eggs,cinamom french toast,breads and some sliced meats and other stuff, also included Fresh OJ and coffee or tea,My husband is Gluten,dairy and egg free and was able to have enough to eat each morning and That brings me to the other breakfast option at Tropical which the choice was either egg dish or pancakes niether of which my husband is able to eat so we had to leave which was to bad it looked like a nice place to enjoy breakfast right out in the open on 5th ave. and also this seemed to upset our waiter a little bit,Not sure if he understood that it was because of food allergies that we had to leave, something that we notice in Mexico is not a common issue with them as almost everyone we mentioned it too thought is was odd,honestly I thought it was to until personally had to deal with it and came to appreciate it probably has to do with the way the food has been processed and the addition of GMO's in many cases. We never did have any drinks in either of the bars or swam in either of the pools so could not comment about that other then the pools looked very clean and attractive we just preferred the beach for our swimming. The rooms were nice and clean and kept that way our whole stay,they even had an evening turn down service,we thought it was a little odd however that they came in and cleaned despite the \"Do not Disturb\" sign on the knob,oh well,not that big a deal for us just didn't leave a tip that day as we didn't expect them to come in.We also noticed that the lighting was always dim which served to make one always look a little more attractive and the the room with its art as well.The shower took a while to get warm which was o.k. just turned it on a did something else for the minutes it took to get warm also thought the dual shower heads were a good idea.

We loved it! The hotel, which was impeccably clean, is like a modern art museum. The reception staff, especially Edith and Pablo, were very welcoming and quick to offer dining and beach club directions and recommendations. Although we were never disturbed by the maid service, they visited our room, made our bed, and replenished our towels twice a day. We stayed in petit room no. 205 and did not have any noise problems. We expect this should be true for all of the petit rooms because they line the inner courtyard of the hotel and do not face the street. Our room was spacious and the bed and pillows were so comfortable we checked the brand in case we wanted to purchase for our home. Our room amenities included: refrigerator (with room to keep some of your own items), iron, ironing board, 2 bottles of water, 2 glass drinking glasses, Keisi shampoo, conditioner, lotion, bar soap, comb, shoe cloth, shower cap, sewing kit, and cotton swabs. Our two-headed rain shower had consistant hot water with decent pressure. Our room could have been improved by adding a hair dryer and better lighting near the sinks. Also, when we first arrived our room was programmed for minimal air conditioning which we were unable to override with the room's thermostat . We told the front desk and within minutes the temperature was reset to a comfortable level. For $108 USD a night (including tax - booked through Orbitz.com), this is a hidden gem and a great bargain of a hotel, especially because of its proximity to the beach, shopping, and nightlife, and because it includes breakfast at your choice of two restaurants. We preferred Indigo's at 14th street and the beach (three blocks walk from the hotel). The easiest route to Indigo's is take 12th street toward the beach, take a left at the Blue Parrot, go straight until you get to 14th street, and take a right. The hotel also provides complimentary blue and white striped beach towels and a beach club pass for free chairs at Wicky's. We did not check out Wicky's but instead followed fellow travelers' recommendations and camped out at Mamita's beach club (28th street and beach). At Mamita's, we rented 2 beach chairs and an umbrella for $9 USD per day. The service here was good, crowd diverse, and swimming beach excellent. We are world travelers and generally stay at hotels ranging from $200-$400 USD per night. We believe that In Fashion Boutique is competitive with other reputable boutique hotels and, once discovered and demand increases, could easily justify higher rates. For authentic, affordable Mexican cuisine, try Carboncitos at 4th Street between 5th & 10th Avenues. For travel to/from the Cancun Airport, take the ADO bus. If you arrive at terminal three, after exiting the terminal building, take a right and walk 30 yards. An ADO bus representative sitting at a small wood podium near bus lanes 2 or 3 will sell you a ticket for $22 pesos or $2 USD a person one way. We purchased our return tickets at the same time. This ADO bus will also make a quick stop at Terminal 2 before heading to Playa Del Carmen. Do not get on the ADO bus to Cancun - it's a different bus. It's about a 30-45 min ride to Playa Del Carmen's main bus terminal at Juarez Street (the equivalent of 0 Street) & 5th Avenue. You will exit the bus and take a left onto 5th Avenue. From here, you will walk on 5th Avenue until you get to 12th Street. At 12th Street, take a left and In Fashion Hotel is mid-block on your left.

We stayed here for 5 nights. We were overall happy with our accommodations. The rooms look exactly the way they do in the pictures. The service was fantastic. They cleaned the rooms twice daily and everyone was helpful and very friendly. The dual shower heads was awesome (heat and pressure was just fine). The beds were very comfortable and they always left little candy at night. It is close to everything, two blocks from the beach, close to 5th Ave and 10th Ave (if you want cheaper foods). Complimentary breakfast at Indigo was really good. You also get free chairs at Wicky's (which I would skip and just hang out at Indigos, better chairs, etc). You also get 50% of at the GYM which is a great place to take spin, yoga, pilates classes. You do not, however, get a discount at Coco Bongo. The CONS: (1) Please skip the spa, the massage was terrible. The worst I've had ever and definitely not worth the $83 USD nor their promotions. (2) If you want quiet accommodations, this is not the place for you. Though we didn't have trouble sleeping (mostly because we were so tire of our days activities), you can definitely hear the music bumping from nearby clubs/lounges. And it only gets louder as it approaches the weekend. If it weren't for the inconvenience of changing hotels (especially when we booked online), I would have done it because I really wanted my R&R. (3) No hot tubs unless you book the spa suite. And the two pools they have are extremely cold (as are all unheated pools during this time of the year in PDC). (4) Many of the rooms do not have a window (like 1st and 2nd), some may have a balcony (it is the way the building is designed and the fact that it is in the midst of other buildings abutting it). Luckily it was not busy and we had a room with partial ocean view, no balcony.

The water in the pool was freezing!! Also the pool has very shallow . The cleaning staff were like a gaggle of geese, just when you though you might get a bit of shut eye by the pool they were laughing , joking and being really loud as they cleaned the rooms.

We found In Fashion while walking down 12th and were curious because it looked so interesting. Alehandro Del Rio greeted us and offered to show us a room. It was decorated minimally with great art and a very well laid-out bathroom. He also took us to the roof to tour the pool area. His friendliness and enthusiasm for the hotel was infectious and we decided to change hotels as soon as we could. We ended up staying at In Fashion for 6 nights and loved being there! The staff is super helpful and friendly. Our room was a standard with an ocean view, cost less than the hotel we left, and included a full breakfast. The bed was very comfortable with fabulouse linens and lots of pillows. There was a double-headed shower and 2 marble sinks in the bathroom. All the lighting is recessed and has dimmers. Not your typical hacienda look! It's on the same street with Coco Bongo and other night clubs, so we were worried it would be loud. But the rooms are so well insulated that it really wasn't a problem. The location is so good! They gave us passes for the beach club, Sensi, which included free chairs and 10% off our bill, and is only a very short walk away from the hotel. Make sure and try Sensi's Ceviche which was the best I've had in Playa. The hotel breakfast, which is included was very good. However, the service is slow, as is often typical in Playa. There is no doubt where we'll stay next year.
