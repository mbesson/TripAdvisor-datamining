Booked 3 rooms at The Omni for 5/26 and then began the nightmarish ordeal of attempting to book our spa treatments. Called and had to leave a message on Thursday, called promptly at 10:00am on Friday and had to leave another message. Tried calling throughout the day Friday and Saturday. Finally reached someone on Sunday and was told all weekends were fully booked thru June10th. Found that to be a bit over the top, that a pa would be fully booked every weekend for the next 60 days! After rearranging our plans I called back on Monday morning and was told all weekends were fuly booked through October. Which is the date of the expiration of our Travelzoo certificate. I then called the hotel and Left a message with the director of rooms as no one else in management could be reached or wouldn't take my call. At this point I plan to cancel my 4 Travelzoo certificates, cancel our 3 hotel rooms, file a complaint with Travelzoo and with the Omni Corporate office. I have never had his issue with The Cresent or The W hotels and spas. I feel that the Mokara Spa is trying to scam he Travelzoo Certficate and forces holders to only use their certificate during the weekdays.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham", "Title": "\u201cWow!\u201d", "Author": "cmnix", "ReviewID": "UR128406111", "Content": "Loved, loved our stay at the Omni Dallas Hotel.

I called the 800# from my car and inquired about rooms. The young man I talked to sounded a little confused about which hotel I wanted. I told him the Dallas Omni, the new one at the convention center downtown. He found it and said the rate was $99. I was surprised and asked if that was the hotel on Lamar, donwntown at the convention center. He said yes. So I headed downtown to claim my room. The hotel driveway was really crowded and kind of chaotic with people directing traffic and confusing traffic barriers. I left my car with the valet ($25) and went to checkin. The nice young lady behind the desk couldn't find my reservation so I showed her the confimation # that had just arrived on my phone. She said that there was a mistake and I was booked at the Omni in Richardson...grrr. I told her that I needed to stay downtown. She said they had rooms for $169. I asked if she could match the price I was quoted, she said no and apologized. I was running late for an evening appointment so I took it. The lobby is huge and impressive and was full of youngsters attending the weekend volleyball event at the adjacent convention center. My room was on the 7th floor. When entering the room there is a key port that contols the electricity inside the room( like most other countries) The room was average size and very stylish. It had several modern amenties like a motion sensored footlight that lights the floor for a night time trip to the bathroom, an in-mirror bathroom tv, floor to ceiling windows, a nice desk with two chairs, coffe maker and refrigerator but no mini bar, safe and robes. The bed was very comfortable and the entire room was cozy and had nice decor and accents. It was also really quiet, even with the young volleyball crowd crawling the halls. Overall it's a really nice hotel but it's huge and built for conventions. Other than the convention center there is very little around it that is appealing but if you need to be on the southwest side of downtown, at the convention center or Belo this is a much better choice than the Hyatt.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAmazing place to stay!!!\u201d", "Author": "ErnFinch", "ReviewID": "UR127985178", "Content": "This hotel is by far one of the most impressive places I have had the pleasure staying at on my business trips to Dallas.

It is a brand new hotel in Dallas and lights up the skyline at night. The light show reveal as a work of art. When you pull up, you can either choose to valet park or self park. I think the valet uses the same garage. We chose to do the self park and walked into the lobby and were promptly greeted by very professional staff. The lobby is spacious and adjoining it, is the hotel lounge where there is a fire pit and comfy seating perfect for cocktails. The elevators are tucked inside a hallway and easy to miss. There are separate elevators to different sections of the hotels depending on the floors, reminiscent of vegas style hotels. Once we arrived on our floor, you will notice the breathtaking views of the city. Our room had a view of the WFAA tower (tv station) and the pool. (not that impressive). The good: Our room was very welcoming, very modernized. The television displays a welcome with your name and soft elevator music welcomes you into the room. There are two modern chairs and a nice decor welcomes you in. THe bathroom is spectacular with stand up shower large enough to fit 4. There is a electronic mirror with a television inside it! That was very nice as well, to be able to get ready and watch the news of the day. The Bad: The toilet was uncomfortable, I am not sure if these are ADA toilets, but seat height was very high, almost uncomfortable to sit for a 5'5\" person. Also, the water pressure for the shower was soft as well, there was no way to turn up the pressure from the shower head. We found only one robe, so had to call for second robe, but this was brought up promptly. Also had to call about the \"chiller\", as I referred to it as a refrigerator and was educated that it is a chiller. Although, I didn't have time to call back and tell the front desk it wasn't chilling. Amenities: 1. The pool: Awesome view of the city, a must see! The chairs do fill quickly so you must go early to claim a good chair. The pool is heated and was quite comfortable. There is also a small jacuzzi but I didn't get to use it since there were already 5 people in it, hogging it for an hour. There is a bar there but when we went up at 11, we were told it was not open yet and we were turned away. The same happened to two other couples. I think they opened on that saturday around 1130. 2. Gym: The typical treadmills, elliptical and bikes with tvs on them. There are some weight machines and free weights. It was not crowded when I went and I enjoyed the privacy. Water and soft towels, headsets available. 3. Starbucks : inside the gift shop. Makes your usual lattes. 4. Gift shop: some cute items inside, from jewelry to candles, lotions, wine, and everyday travel items. and local texas items as well. 5. Restaurants: bob's steak house- a known Dallas steakhouse. Did not get to try but saw there was a huge (size of wall) screen, good for watching games!

The rooms are very nice, we really liked the modern amenities such as built in TV screen into the bathroom mirror, motion-detection lights near the bed, and a super-nice shower with excellent shower head. Each room also comes with free Wi-Fi. When we checked in, Ian gave us a free upgrade, no doubt because it was Easter weekend and the hotel was not busy at all. We went to our room on the 20th floor and someone had been smoking there even though the hotel is smoke-free. The room stunk. So we had to return to the front desk and get a different room. We were given a room on the 16th floor. So essentially we lost our upgrade because a self-centered person decided he wanted to smoke illegally in his room. Thanks for that. The room was fine. But, our reservation said we were supposed to get a top three floor room (there are 23 floors). Plus, the bed seemed to a queen even though our reservation said king. I asked and they said it was king, but if so, it is a king for midgets only. The person who had the room before us set the alarm clock to go off at 2:30am. Very funny. We were dead asleep and were suddenly awakened. The wife reaches over to turn off the alarm. We start to drift back to sleep. Wrong, she only hit the snooze button, so 15 minutes later I have to get up, turn on the light and turn off the alarm. Just hilarious. Now it is really hard to get back to sleep. I am drifting off about 45 minutes later when a drunk jerk starts yelling on the floor and slams her door. Again, thanks for that, and oh, are you aware that other people are on the floor and may actually be trying to sleep at 4am? So basically we lost our upgrade and had our night ruined by selfish, centered jerks. It's not the hotel's fault, but the experience was not a good one. We had a reservation for Texas Spice for breakfast, but we got up early and just went home. Ian was great and comped part of the cost of the room, and that is why I am giving the hotel 4 stars.

The room was well appointed, modern, and spacious. The seating area arranged near the floor to ceiling windows was a very nice touch and made for a nice place to enjoy the view of the city. The bed was very comfy with plenty of pillows, and the room had everything else that might be expected in a luxury hotel (safe, iron, mini-fridge, coffee station, etc.). After we got settled in the room, we were able to explore the rest of the common areas in the hotel and found them all to be excellent. The fourth floor houses the pool, spa, and fitness center. The only improvement that we could have asked for is it would have been great if the pool bar was open in the evenings. This area seems like it would be the perfect place to hang out, but it closes early. We were also able to try two of the restaurants during our stay. We went to the breakfast buffet at Texas Spice. The atmosphere and service were just great. However, we felt like the food was average and the selection was below average. We had higher expectations for the price. Lunch was at the Owner's Box.

We had planned to spend our second morning there before our meetings began and were disappointed to have a letter under the door the next morning telling us the pool would be closed the entire week for some maintenance. The hotel did arrange for us to visit another hotel (Aloft) just down the street, and even though it was nice and front desk very helpful on our visit, the pool did not compare to the Omni! Loved the rooms, very nicely appointed, the only challenge was with the Hotel being a green hotel the lighting was not very good. Add to this that the windows were being cleaned and we were asked to keep our blinds closed while in the room, and the room was VERY dark.

Not their fault that it happened to a be a high volume day, but not the best start to the stay. There was no \"privacy\" sign, so we had to make one of our own. I called for an extra comforter and got a light weight blanket that was questionably clean - not visibly dirty, but wrinkled and didn't smell freshly laundered. On our first whole day, the room wasn't made up until we called to request it at 6pm. At that point, I asked housekeeping for an extra comforter, and they brought one, so that was one problem solved. Also, the housekeeping staff were extremely friendly, which was definitely nice. Unfortunately, when we had arrived the day before, there was exactly one tissue in the tissue box. Both of us suffering from seasonal allergies, tissues were a must, and although we asked the friendly housekeeping staff for tissues two days in a row, we never got more than that one sad tissue. On our last full day, I turned on the shower and nothing happened. I waited and eventually a trickle came out. Eventually that trickle turned into a cold, low pressure stream - enough for me to take a cold shower. I was just able to rinse off when it stopped completely again.

With the exception of one particular screw up (which was eventually made right), we were very pleased with the Omni. We stayed in room 1320 which has a view of that lighted ball thingy that's a Dallas landmark. Here's what kept this review from being 5 stars: When we checked in, we specifically asked the young man at the desk (we don't remember his name) about getting a refridgerator brought to our room. He said that every room had one but that it wouldn't freeze anything. Since we didn't need anything frozen, we were fine with that. So we get to our room and get everything unpacked, including a few bottles of water in the \"fridge.\" It turns out the \"fridge\" is actually a wine cooler. But by the time we discovered it and called the front desk (about 9:30 at night), we were told there were no mini fridges available. The Omni sent someone from Engineering to be sure the wine cooler was on its coldest setting. Here's the good part...The engineering guy (we don't remember his name, either. He was a tall african american guy and very helpful) asked if we wanted a mini fridge. We told him that the front desk told us there weren't any left. He just asked again if we wanted one. When we said \"yes,\" he said he'd be back in about 5 minutes. Sure enough, he came back with a mini fridge. It turns out the guy that probably gets paid the least was the most valuable person to us right then and there. Well done, Engineering dude, well done! The next morning, I asked the concierge (I think his name was Jeff) to help me with our flight check in. He had us checked in and our boarding passes printed in no time. Nice! The room was very nice. The little floor light that automatically comes on when your feet hit the floor is a great idea. No more stubbing your toes or fumbling for your slippers if you need to get up in the middle of the night. Speaking of lights...you have to keep your room card in a card reader to activate your room lights. I suppose this is an energy conservation thing. Again, if they hadn't messed up the mini fridge thing, this would have been 5 stars. But had the engineering dude not been so helpful, it would have been 3 stars. Would we recommend this to friends?

The room was spacious and quiet, beds were comfy and true queen size as described. We all slept well and made for a relaxing trip. Weather was cold and rainy the first night, so we were going to rent an in room movie. But they only have some Starz movie network rental deal and the selection was very limited. I think there was 4 or 5 family movies, and some of those movies we never even heard of. No new/recent movies like we're used to seeing at other hotels. Used the pool with the kids twice. The first time, it was early evening before sunset and there was a staff at the pool to pass out towels. Second time was after dinner, there was no staff at the pool and we didn't know where to get towels. Checked the gym, no pool towels. Had to go back down to the lobby to request towels. Pool area was nice with more great views of downtown. Water was heated warm enough to enjoy even on a cold windy day. Ate at onsite Texas Spice restaurant twice for breakfast and twice for dinner. Breakfast buffet was good but didn't have pancakes. Our waiter had some pancakes made for us and they were delicious. Dinner was ok, I would say it was just average. The flat bread pizza under appetizer was good. The main courses were ok ... nothing to write home about. We did not like the Texas molasses tart but did order the chocolate chip cookies and milk twice. We wanted to try Bob's Chophouse, another onsite restaurant, but they didn't have a kids menu.

The black pepper buttermilk biscuits are most excellent, as were the Dublin Dr. Pepper ribs and the sweet chili brisket. The beet carpaccio with goat cheese and quail eggs on top was also a very nice treat. The service was attentive throughout the hotel, I would never have guessed it was opening day if I did not already know. They have a great sports bar called the Owners Box. I can see myself there many times in the future watching the full slate of NFL games. They also have a high end steakhouse, which is legendary in Dallas, called Bob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Steak and Chop House. I did not eat there, but if it is anything like the other Bob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in Dallas, it will be amazing. On the fourth floor, they have an outdoor terrace and infinity pool, all with exceptional views of Dallas. Mokara Spa is also on this floor, and the treatments there were some of best I have experienced in that past few years. Product wise, this is the best in the state right now. On the service side, they tower over notorious offenders like the Anatole, and actually treat people well.

The one thing that stands out the most for me about the property is the excellent service I received. All of the staff that I interacted with were both very professional and cordial, giving me a feeling of them \"going out of their way to please\" type of service. The hotel while a larger convention type hotel, had service as personable as a boutique hotel during my stay. The bellhop followed me with the luggage from car to check in to the room, so I didn't need to call down to have it brought up. Different valet attendants remembered me and my name throughout the course of my stay during the weekend. I was very impressed with them immediately remembering my name and not even having to look at the tags attached to the key. Before deciding on this property, I contemplated several other properties, most notably smaller boutique properties in the downtown and uptown area, and nearby Marriott properties since I have status there. In the end, I chose the Omni just because I wanted to stay at the newest hotel in town and because I've been very happy staying at other Omni properties in Texas. My reservation was made through their website and a day before check in, I was offered an excellent deal to confirm an upgrade to an executive suite, but declined since I was not going to be in the room much. I reserved a double queen bed and got just that. I wanted the double queen instead of the king so I would have the bathtub/shower combo instead of just a walk-in shower. Had a view facing the downtown skyline but didn't look out too much. There were a lot of pillows on the beds, and they were very comfortable, both really soft and supportive at the same time. HDTV had enough channels to keep me entertained. The clock radio was an IHome one, so it had the iphone/ipod dock which was great! The nightstand between the two beds has an infrared sensor with an LED light, so that when it's dark and you hop off the bed, the LED light shines a beam on the carpet so you can kinda see where you are going. The wi-fi in the room worked seamless. The bathroom was decent sized, a little larger would have been nicer! Tub had a curved shower rod and there was quite a bit of space when taking the shower since the bathtub had a ledge with almost a foot of room between the tub and the bathroom wall. The lighting in the bathroom was fine, and everyone has already commented about the built in tv in the mirror. I didn't order room service so I won't be able to comment on that. I didn't dine on property, except for having a few drinks at The Owners Box. When I went in, it was busy, with hardly a seat at the bar. Perfect place to watch a sports game, as there were tv's and HD projections galore. Pricing was typical for a hotel bar, but it didn't feel like the typical boring hotel bar. Each time I called down to have the car brought around, the time estimate was spot on, with it usually being about 10 minutes.

If you plan on sleeping at all, this is not the hotel you want. I actually live in downtown Dallas so if you're visiting this might help you decide. Occasionally I will spontaneously check into a nearby hotel, turn off all communication devices and get away from a stressful week. I normally do this a few times a year so I've stayed at many hotels. For me, I prefer the Hotel Palomar but wanted to try this one out because it's new. I was warned by a friend about the amount of people that go through there but I've stayed at larger hotels in Vegas with no issues. My room for two nights was a superior on a high floor facing downtown Dallas. The room was very cool with a tv in the mirror, lots of modern electronics, and a large shower. I don't ever use the glassware in hotel rooms but I still look at them (they were dirty on the inside). The service was excellent with every person I talked to. Room service was fast and friendly even if the food was not very good. The spa there is one of the best I've been to anywhere. My problem with the hotel, though, overshadowed all of that. The windows and walls are extremely thin. Even from a high floor I had trouble sleeping from the people in front of the hotel and the hotel is situated away from all the nightlife. I knew the majority of the names of the people in the next room because of the thin walls and I could clearly hear entire conversations from anyone in the hallway and peple were always in the hallway. I'm a very heavy sleeper who has even slept soundly on second floors facing entrances to nightclubs in Madrid and Barcelona. I've slept soundly facing busy streets in Paris and the ground floor next to a hostel in Istanbul. I've slept through an earthquake. I probably got about six hours total while at the Omni. The only other problem I had was both times I went to the gym. The first night, the door was strangely wide open and while I worked out a maintenance man was giving tours of the facility (this was at 11 pm). I would be in the middle of a set and random men in the group would come within inches of me and just stare into my face! Other people with backpacks would walk through to go to the pool door, realize a room key was needed and then walk out. I don't think any if these people were staying there. Some even got on the machines in their jeans and wearing their bags. The second night the door was closed so you had to use your room key. Both nights the maintenance guys would wander by and stop to work out! With their full trash bags next to them! It was just really strange and uncomfortable. Overall, as great as the service was and how cool the rooms were, they can't fix thin walls and windows. Only go here if you want to be close to Dealey Plaza and have really good ear plugs.

I think this being a brand new facility, they need to work out a few kinks, that being said.. we had a tremendous time, it was wonderful. Rooms: We had a beautiful room with a view of IH35. The bathrooms were very clean, and nice sized. My husband and I did not sleep well at all. It was the first time to be away from our kids in awhile and we were hoping to get some much needed rest by sleeping in, but the room would not cool down to a comfortable temperature. The bed was really uncomfortable and had really hot covers. Finally on the 3rd night, we stripped off all the blankets to try to at least be comfortable but we still did not sleep very good. It was just too hot and the beds too uncomfortable. Bathrooms have great toiletries - fyi you won't need to bring your own. Plenty of hangers in the closet I am usually cold natured and freezing everywhere I go. I'm the type of person that has the heated seat on in the car even in the summer if my husband has the AC down cold. So, I was really surprised, that I was hot the entire time I was there. (I did not leave the hotel for 4 days). The conference rooms, restaurants, etc were too hot. Granted, we had a huge amount of people there for our conference, that could have had something to do with it. Pool / Fitness I am training for a triathlon right now, so it was important to me to have a pool and decent fitness center. It was very nice, the pool large enough to do laps in (although its not square), it was adequate and beautiful. The fitness center is really nice and stocked with plenty of equipment. I thought it was a nice touch that they had these pretty water features, bar and fire pits right around the pool, so my husband could hang out and relax while I was swimming. We also headed up to the hot tub late at night, and had a great time, can't say enough good things about the pool area. I wish the bar had been open later. There are two restaurants and a coffee/snack bar. You can expect hotel prices there. I didn't think any of them were very good. I'll review Owner's Box and Texas Spice separately. Conference facilities: Rooms were hot, everything else was first class. The food was great, the service was excellent. We had a couple of big parties in addition to conference rooms, had a great time. I don't know if the hotel did our production (lights, audio/video, chairs, etc), but it was also first class. Check in / Check out: We had some problems with our bill. They had charged us for the valet, when we self-parked. They charged us for Internet when we were Omni Select guests. It was quickly taken care of, but you may want to double-check that everything is right. It ended up being over $100 in charges that got removed. Service: Very friendly and helpful staff, what you would expect in Texas :) We are Omni select guests, and they will give you two complimentary drinks each day. It was very nice, since they are normally $3 in the gift shop, a nice value-add. We forgot to hang the order on our door one night, so my husband called down that morning and they sent them up a few minutes later. That was really over and beyond - I was delighted. Overall, I would say aside from my complaints, it is a very nice, beautiful hotel. You should see it all lit up on the outside, I'll attach some pics. I would recommend it and will stay here again.

We had checked in online so as soon as we walked up to the check in desk, we were presented our room key and on our way. The entire valet and check in process literally took about 45 seconds, it was wonderful. When we arrived to our room, we had been given an odd room which meant that we had a GORGEOUS view of the buildings in downtown Dallas. The room still smells new and everything is so fresh and clean. I am one that refuses to take my shoes off in hotel rooms, but the plush rug in the bathroom was one of the most incredible things I have ever stepped on. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s white so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m almost certain they clean it in between each guest, but truly felt like you were walking on clouds. The beds were the perfect amount of softness and the pillows were just as wonderful. Oh my goodness, the lights! When you first enter the room, you have to put your room key in a little slot in order to turn the lights on. When you leave and take your key with you, the lights turn out automatically after 30 seconds, it was really neat and a great way for the hotel to conserve energy. Also, when you have to get up at night when it is dark, there is a motion censored light underneath the night stand in between the two beds. This was one of the coolest features I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen as it was just enough light to help me find my way, but not too much to wake someone else up. It is a genius idea that I hope many other hotels begin to implement. The fitness room was state of the art and the roof top infinity pool was heated, which is very nice if you want to swim anywhere in Texas this time of year! The only negative thing I have to say about this hotel was the price of parking. Valet is $25 a night (pretty standard) but self parking is $18 a night. We had 4 vehicles that we had to park for the evening and parking turned out to be more than what we paid for the room. I should have called before we arrived and maybe we could have carpooled, but unfortunately found out to late.

Awesome perks and upgrades if you ask. We were treated to Larry and the Hotel town car to run a quick errand (must be in a 2 mile radius) but Larry went out of his way to make sure we found what we needed for the conference booth @ Radio Shack.

Fluffy Robes, GREAT 10th floor view of downtown skyline, amazing artwork, decor and cool features like lights on the floor when you got out of bed all totaled for a hard to beat Hotel experience, Staff was friendly and location ideal for short cab rides to other areas of town, e.g. Deep Ellum for nightlife and entertainment. Dinning choices abound at the hotel and tried 2 of 3 restaurants for every pocketbook and choice of beverage. Nothing like a Shiner Bock in warm evening temps outside by the fire-pit @ the awesome sports bar lounge. ALA was the largest crowd the Omni has seen since its opening.

However, they need to ramp it all up more quickly than it is now. Good points: Great customer service lovely lobby TV in bathroom mirror (!) quiet rooms fast elevators great ambience good business center Points that REALLY need to be worked on: Lighting in hotel room is abysmal. I know it's a green hotel but very hard to work in or even navigate the hotel room with the lighting. I heard many, MANY people talk about this on the elevator. ... Speaking of the elevator, if I had to hear that cheery elevator quasi british/australian voice say \"going up\" or \"going down\" one more time, I was going to go postal. I would have gladly had the elevator plummet to the ground rather than hear that voice one more time. I wasn't the only one complaining, it was THE talk of whomever was in the elevator at any given time Only 2 little towel hooks in the bathroom-no towel bars. If you REALLY want to follow green guidelines, you need someplace to hang your towels up so they don't get washed daily. This is especially important if you are sharing the room with a non-family member. The hooks couldn't hold a wash cloth without it falling off. The water in the shower was never CLOSE to being as hot as the bathroom faucet. I complained about this 3 times and the water only got marginally better. Nowhere near the heat of the faucet. I think this could be solved by taking off the shower faceplate and moving the heat off the safety setting. The customer service was great in both the hotel and restaurants, but the timeliness of getting food ordered, receiving it, getting a bill, having the bill picked up etc. etc was frankly lousy. MAJOR training needs to occur for the food servers, busser's etc. The hotel employees also need to know the hotel better. I was waiting for a friend who said they were in the bar. When I went into the sports bar and didn't see them, the hostess told me they were the only bar in the hotel. WRONG, there are 4. Took me another 10 minutes of wondering and several texts until I found my friends. The housekeeper didn't know where the fitness room was, the business center employee didn't know you could pay and print off usps labels in the business center and then just take the mail down to the front desk to be sent out via usps NO SIDEWALKS!

One neat feature was a floor light that was motion activated, so if you had to get up in the middle of the night you could see where you were going. Genius! The bad news....the service on many fronts was not good. When we arrived, a guy stepped forward to pick up our bags from the trunk of the taxi and promptly retreated. Not sure why, but our taxi driver heaved them out, grumbling the entire time. We had dinner at the sports bar one evening and there were four of us dining. They got half the meals wrong in one way or another. There was a mini bar in the room, but it was not stocked (price list was there, just no products). I ordered two beers from room service, and 45 minutes and one phone call later, they finally arrived. We had a group staying at the hotel and many reported similar things happening with meal service and other amenities. Staying at a new hotel you kind of expect them to take a little time to work the bugs out, but this is an OMNI...a chain that you would expect to run as smooth as silk. The bathroom was lovely, with a TV embedded in the mirror, but pretty much right in the middle which was a little annoying but I worked around it. I would've expected a grip rail in the tub but there was none. The shower was OK...I've stayed at lower end hotels that had more water pressure. There is in room coffee service but they did not fully stock everything each day I was there. Again, hit or miss service.

The hotel is nice, new and shiney, I liked the feel of the main lobby area. We also took the escalators up to walk around the open common areas by some of the hotel conference rooms. It was also very nice. It would be a great place to have a conference. The rooms were new and nice as well. pretty high tech when it came to a tv in the bathroom mirror and the room welcoming you when you first arrive. We got a room with a view of the city, and knowing Dallas, I would recommend that over a view facing the other direction if you have a choice. The hotel is next to the convention center and set off a few blocks from the bulk of downtown which actually allows for some pretty cool views of the Dallas skyline and none of the rooms should really have blocked views, although higher is still better. There were three main restaurants that we saw in the hotel. One is Texas Spice which is supposedly local ingredients that come from within 200 miles. Not entirely sure what the menu genre is though. Also there is a sports bar called the Owner's Box which was really neat and had a great feel. Tons of giant TVs. We went in and had a drink before dinner. The drinks were very reasonably priced for a brand new hotel sports bar. The other restaurant is the Bob's steakhouse in the hotel which is where we had dinner. Bob's is one of the oldest and most famous steakhouses in Dallas and now they have a couple locations besides their original on Lemmon Avenue. It is a nice and expensive restaurant. The food was really good and truthfully better than I remember it being at other Bob's locations. The feel of the restaurant was nice. The oddity was the restrooms. To go to the restroom as a restaurant patron, you have to leave the restaurant and walk half way across the main lobby to the common hotel lobby restrooms. For a ground up new construction, someone should be fired for making this happen. In some places that are historic or older, it is kind of quirky and fun that the restrooms are tucked away in an odd places becuase of a strange remodel, but for a very nice resturant in a brand new hotel to have to walk what seems like the distance of a football filed to go to the restroom is ridiculous. The location of the hotel is on the least developed side of downtown Dallas, which the powers that be hope will help spur development in that direction. It is walkable to the main parts of downtown (Main Street, the West End, Dealy Plaza,Victory, etc), but depending on where you are going, the weather, etc, it is also a very short cab ride and you won't be missing anything along the way. I would probably say walk if you are going to Dealy Plaza or the Nieman's on Main Street, but take a cab if you are going to the American Airlines Center or the Arts District. I think this hotel will serve the convention business very well. It would also be a good option if you want a nice hotel in or near downtown. If you are going very high end on a hotel, I would recommend, the Mansion, the Crescent or the Ritz, but it you are going one half star less, or are coming to Dallas for business, than the Omni would be a pretty good option.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cCool, new modern Omni\u201d", "Author": "islasisterchick", "ReviewID": "UR121425618", "Content": "I stayed here for one night over Thanksgiving weekend.

Check in was quick, but I had really already checked-in online so all I had to do was pick up my key. The hotel was busy due to the Turkey trot 10K the next day. The decor is very cool and cosmopolitan, lots of travertine and cool fireplaces everywhere. The sports bar is awesome-huge screens and TVs on every open space and an upscale crowd. If you can't see the game you want to watch, you must be blind. The rooms are small for an Omni, but very nice. My husband loved the TV in the bathroom mirror. I thought I'd never get him out of there. The pool on the 4th floor roof top is divine. It was heated, but too cold for me when its 50 degrees out. My hubby loved it. I stayed in the hot tub and watched the sun set over the Dallas skyline. Lovely. Of course, it's off-season for the pool, so the huge pool bar was closed and we had to hunt down towels for the pool. Unusual, as normally Omni staff would have them on all the chairs regardless of time of year. We ordered room service for breakfast and the crunchy french toast was incredible. Food was hot on arrival and right on time. Kudos to the room service staff! Front desk staff was incredible. The sports bar seemed understaffed and overwhelmed. But the TVs kept us occupied while waiting. I was disapppointed that there wasn't someone opening the front door for us and offering to assist with bags on arrival. That is very strange not to have that at an Omni. Parking is $18/nt for self-park and $25 for valet. This is standard in any downtown area for hotel parking.

It was after 6pm on Saturday, November 19, we pulled up to the valet drive area and waited 10 minutes and no one came to take our car or assist with our luggage.We then went to the self parking area and parked our car and hauled our luggage into the hotel ourselves. After waiting 20 minutes we were assisted by an agent, very friendly, she said this was her first hotel to work at. I don't recall her name because her hair covered up the name tag. 903 was our room and we never were approached by a bellman to assist us with us luggage to our room.

We came back to the hotel afterwards, we have eaten at Bob's in Dallas, so decided to try the other restaurants, Texas Spice the wait was 45 min. at 8:45pm. We waited 1 hour and still no table. We asked the 2 nice young men hostesses how would they find us when our table was ready and they said they would come look for us but we would have to keep checking back with them. After 1 hour we went to the Owers Box and another 45 minute wait. We walked through the restaurant and found a three tables available inside and also outside there were alot of tables available.We sat outside but never got any service. It is very apparent that they need more servers. We left and went to the Westend to eat. We came back to the hotel after 11:15 pm and went to the pool area to relax, very nice atmosphere, they have a great bar area but no service?I would have loved a cocktail outside. . It was sad to see that the ppl that are staying there are not taking care of the hotel, as there was a wine glass inside the jacuzzi, beer bottles, and many towels left.

We arrived at the hotel at 1 p.m. on Saturday Nov. 19, 2011. We went to check in and requested a balcony at the time we made reservations. They did not have that request on file but stated it was not a problem but the balcony rooms were not ready. We waited until 2:45 and the front desk phoned us to say our room was ready. We were in the Owner's Box Lounge waiting. We went to the desk the Bell Man carried up our luggage and we were given a room with no balcony. We phoned down to the desk and were told they would move us but the balcony rooms still were not ready. At 3:30, 4:oo, and 4:30 the room still was not ready. Finally, the room was available at 4:50. In the meantime, the hotel was holding our luggage. We got to our room and had to rush for a 5:30 reservation at Bob's Chop House. Once we rushed to shower and get dressed my husband went to get his White Shirt and it was gone. No one at the hotel did anything about it except to say, sorry we don't know what happened to it, we had a lot of luggage carts in the lobby with luggage due to rooms being unavailable so someone may have taken it by mistake and the Bell Man say's he don't have it. Well, that was a no brainer we never thought the bellman did have it. They did not check the original room we were placed in or even follow up with us.

IT was exciting to be one of the first guests at this new convention center hotel. It was also a bit disappointing on a few levels. The hotel is new, and the staff if green, so I would hope improvement will come, and soon. The hotel opened ahead of schedule and has already had a couple of groups, one hosting over 700 rooms, so the business if off and running! Architect Design wise, the building is stunning. A new addition to dominate the Dallas skyline. The location is great, not just for conventions (it is connected to the convention center), but also being in downtown, you have easy access to most everything Dallas and the DFW area have to offer. The staff, in most areas, needs a lot more training. The hotel is new. Perhaps this is the first time for many to be working hospitality. Still, the attitude displayed in many departments (valet, bellman, front desk, restaurants, housekeeping, spa( all need improvement to be acceptable. My observations: The staff seems more interested in chatting with each other than watching out for the guests. Upon arriving and driving up to the valet entrance, I had to get out of the car, after waiting an several minutes, watching the valets talk amongst themselves to get attention and turn the vehicle over to them. This was after popping the trunk and making, or eye contact with two uniformed men. Finally, a girl valet came and gave me a ticket for the car, but no offer of assistance with luggage came until we had unloaded the car and walked to the door. Then the same girl asked if we wanted assistance. We could manage, and having gone this far, declined. We did struggle with the door, and after we got it opened and picked up our bags again, she held the door. Really too little too late. Hope this is just a training issue with new staff and not the way things will be on an ongoing basis. Not the best first impression. The chit chat amongst the staff continued at the front desk. We arrived shortly after 3:00 PM and there were no other people waiting to check in. As part of the reservstion process, I was able to \"pre check in\" on line, and was instructed to simply look for the key board to the right of the front desk, where my key would be waiting with my name on it. I was excited, and skeptical, about this service. I was concerned about security and :1) Could just anyone come and grab a key packet? and 2) would anyone be able to look and get names of people staying in the hotel, and perhaps room numbers, etc. This turned out not to be an issue as the key board is not set up yet, so I had to go the the desk. Two women wre talking about their plans for after work, and after a couple of minutes, stopped so one could assist me. The gent ws pleasant. She explained about the key board just not being ready yet, and since the hotel IS new, I can accept that. However, the reservation call center should be aware of this and sadvise upon making the reservation what the status is, and that an automated email will be sent offering a service that is just not quite ready yet. Oh well.... The agent did have all my information correct, which is refreshing. She also explained about the GREEN HOTEL, and in an effort to conserve resources, one has to place the room key in a special holder next to the door to power up the room, the electric outlets, the air conditioning, the television. Hummm......I am for not wasting resources, to an extent, but this sounded a little too controlling. I like to have some choice about what I might want to conserve, and when traveling, might want to luxuriate in a little flagrant indulgence. I asked for a third key so we could keep one in the power port at all times...IF we chose to. The agent complied. We made our way to the bank of elevators that took us to the top floor, 23, and found our room, 2355. I had reserved a king bed, and this room was a double double, but we decided not to make an issue and enjoy having a bed to ourselves. It is so exciting to be one of the first guests in a hotel. IT is exciting to try anything new! I like the style of the decor. Southwest elements are reflected in the color scheme, along with a contemporary design in the furniture and art work. The art is all about Dallas and Texas which is welcoming. The room was spacious enough, but seemed a bit odd in layout. There were two desk chairs, side by side, at the long credenza like motel console space: no free standing desk. IT seemed somewhat classroom style. Perhaps this was done with the idea of business/convention people sharing a room and giving individual albeit cramped, work space. My travel companion suggested perhaps the two chairs were for room service, when a travel table cart is left. There was an additional semi lounge chair by the window with a small table at the side. Also at this long credenza console was a bench. This came in handy as an ottoman for the chair, and I guess would substitute for a luggage bench as there was no bench in the closet should one care to place a suitcase on one. The mini bar, while present, was not stocked. At first we thought this was just something the hotel had not gotten around to, yet should for rooms placed in inventory. Later, while speaking with the concierge, we were told that there is a list where you can indicate what you want in the mini bar and it will be stocked for you. This is designed to cut down on disputed charges so often associated with the hotel mini bars, and to save labor hours if someone does no want a particular item, like alcohol in the room. Well and good if you are staying multiple days, which most convention goes will be, but not for the one night stay as we were. No five dollar coke to indulge this trip! The coffee bar is set up here with the mini bar, along with the very small ice bucket. There were two (2) glasses here. There were no glasses in the bathroom set up. Odd. Troublesome when I went to brush my teeth, and no glass to rinse with. The bathroom was well laid out, nice towels, nice amenities, including a jar with cotton balls, and a bathroom rug. Little touches like this make a big difference in comfort when traveling. The view from the room is spectacular. You see Dallas for all the grandeur it is! Floor to ceiling windows. There is a night light that automatically comes on located under the bed side table, which we really liked when we had to get up in the night. Upon entering the room, the televison was on with a personalized welcome message addressed to me. Nice touch. We found the television system a bit challenging to use however. Too high tech for us middle aged baby boomers not up on all the latest technology. I am sure the younger gereration will love this, along with the IPOD docking station. The room first seemed clean, but upon inspection, on the floor of the bathroom were three long hairs. Black. Now I am bald, with a shaved head, and my travel companion has brunette hair and had not been in the bathroom yet, so I knew these hairs were not from her. This does not speak well for housekeeping. Also, the bed linens, while clearly new, also looked fresh out of the package with creases where they had been folded. This will probably go away with laundering, but a little steaming or pressing would make a better impression. May sound petty, but just my observation. Are any of these issues a deal breaker for this hotel, for a repeat visit? No. But as an Omni brand, I would hope some changes (i.e. more glassware, stocked mini fridge, luggage bench) will be made. We went out for the evening to a party, and returned about 9:15 PM, hungry and looking forward to relaxing in the bar and having a late dinner. We thought surly the hotel restaurants would be open until 10:00 PM. But when we ventured into the Texas Spice restaurant located just off the lobby, which is the venue for breakfast, lunch and dinner, we were told the kitchen would be closing in 15 minutes, and there were two parties waiting for a table ahead of us. The unspoken implication was we would not be served. Could not be served. We looked around and saw many open tables, along with many dirty tables. We pressed and sked directly, can we be accommodated here for dinner or not. If not, just ay so and we will go elsewhere. The host said we could still have dinner, we just had to wait, as there were two parties ahead of us. Okay. We would go wait at the bar. The bar was crowded, no two seats together there. My companion suggested I sit and wait at the bar while she investigated what else the hotel might have to offer for food. I took a seat at the end of the bar, where I could observe some other diners and the several open tables. It seems we could have been seated at one of these emty tables, even if we had to wait to be served. We could have been studying the menu and be ready to place an order before the kitchen closed. The staff does not agree, wo here I am, waiting at the bar. N one comes to take a cocktail order. I make eye contact with the two people behind the bar. One female bar tender even comes and goes from behind the bar, greets me with a \"how ya doing\", but never offers to serve a beverage. I waited the 15 minutes the host advised it would be for a table, then cut my losses and made my way back, past the many open tables, to the host stand. Oh, and let me mention, while waiting, a man who appeared to be a manage, in a suit, asked, \"was I waiting for a table\" to which I replied \"yes\", but no response from him. He made his way to several of the empty tables, touched the tables, made his was toward the kitchen where uniformed staff (waiters? Bussers?) stood, chatting with each other again as we observes the staff on arrival, but doing no work. The manager sid this round of walking to the table, touching the table, walking to the staff by the kitchen, walking back to the tables, touching the tables, waking back to the staff, while managing to get nothing accomplished. So I go the the host, who is speaking with my companion, still not making an attempt t seat us, and we leave. We are both beginning to get provoked by the service, or the lack of any service here in the hotel, and decide to test the concierge out. The lady concierge on duty, a delightful and friendly young lady, was very calming and welcoming and presented some options, including the venue of Bob's Steak and Chop House. Bob's is a mainstay in Dallas, very good reputation with their original location in the Oak Lawn/Uptown area, and now opening on Omni hotels. It is now almost 10:00 PM, their closing time at Bob's, but the concierge telephones and speaks to the hostess and clears the way for us to be accommodated. She then comes around from behind the desk and escorts us to the dining room to make sure we are taken care of. VERY impressed, as I think most would have just given directions on where to go and be done with us. She talks about the hotel, the design, the art, the outlets with great enthusiasm. I is great to see an employee so excited about where they work, their job, their guests and their responsibilities. We are feeling better now with this attention, and once we reach the restaurant, she makes introductions to the hostess, who again seems genuinely pleased to have us, and they both escort us to a table in the bar area and make introductions to our server. We asked the concierge about the location of a breakfast meeting we are to attend in the hotel in the morning and confimring the times. Now she could have left a voice mail message on our room telephone, or slipped a note under the door, but instead, she found out the information and came back to the restaurant, to our table, and spoke to us in person! I was very, very impressed. I wish I could remember her name, as she is an excellent concierge. It started with an \"M\". She also spoke to the hostess and our server (which was Julie) to make sure things were going well. Things at this point were going very, very well. Bob's is all about service and quality. We had the best time at dinner. Great food, great service, and the other diners were clearly enjoying themselves as well. Conversations were struck up with the table next to us, and with a group at the bar, who turned out to also be in the hotel for the same breakfast meeting we were going to attend. One of the best dining experiences I have ahd, anywhere. I look forward to returning just for the opportunity to dine here, even if I am not a guest in the hotel. Now Bob's in a pricey steakhouse, with entrees in the $40.00 ++ range. Not every hotel guest would want to have this fine dining experience. The casual Texas Spice venue needs to get their act together for options for guests. We also think the casual restaurant should be open much later, certainly until at least 11:00 PM. A convention hotel needs to have viable options for the guests. Having both restaurants close at the same time seems poor management planning. There are two sports bars where bar food could be had, but the atmosphere is loud. Both of these venues were busy, which is a good sign for a new hotel. People are coming out here, both guests and locals. So what began as a challenge and provoking dining experience ended up being a pleasant and fun night. Now we return to the room, where apparently turn down had been done, as the curtains were closed, and two little bottles of water were left by the mini bar. THis is the oddest, and most superfluous turn down I have ever experienced. The beds were not touched, not turned down. The bathroom was not refreshed. Just two bottles of water and the curtains closed. Oh well... The next morning we are awaken with a gentle knock on the door where complimentary coffee for two along with the morning paper has been left for us. Very nice. Also, the wake up call and follow up were performed by a live person. A nice touch from the automated calls now done in so many hotels. We get ready to go down to the breakfast meeting we were in town for. Two people getting ready is just a bit challenging. Water pressure is very low, and the tub does not drain well. I would expect issues like this in an older hotel, but not new construction. I hope engineering can get this corrected. We proceed down to the third floor where the Trinity Ballroom is located and where The Dallas Convention And Visitors Bureau was holing its annual meeting and breakfast. This is an annual \"dog and pony\" show, which is entertaining and enthusiastic. Attending really makes one proud to and excited to be in Dallas, a part of the hospitality community! Much was made about the presence of the new convention center hotel and waht it means for the Dallas/Fort Worth area. This will be a great hotel to host city conventions, especially when utilizing the attached convention center. The hotel has beautiful meeting space. I would be excited to have a convention here, and in Dallas! Tours were offered after the meeting, so we saw other features of the hotel. The pool and wet area are attractive, but the pool and hot tub seem very small to accommodate 1000 hotel rooms and all the guests that might want to utilize these areas. The spa is beautiful as well, and how great to have a spa in the hotel to indulge oneself. Again the staff on duty just does not measure up to acceptable standards. knowing a group of people with the CVB are coming to tour the hotel, I would think and expect the hostess in the spa tp be welcoming and enthusiastic. This woman just stood behind the desk, said nothing, no welcome, no direction as to where to view the facilities. Eventually our group just made our way around and took in the space, with no explanation of just how extensive spa treatments are. I trust this is a full service spa, but cannot confirm that as no information was offered. Check out time is at 11:00 AM, where most upscale hotels offer at least 12 noon, or even 1:00 PM. We made our way to the front desk and reviewed the bill. The morning staff was much more on the ball than the afternoon staff. Each time I called down for the car from valet, it was ready and waiting, which is nice. All in all, it was a pleasant stay, and I look forward to having an opportunity to return. I hope the service issues I mentioned are improved for a return visit. Is anything a deal breaker for considering this hotel? NO. But it will be nice to see improvement. I am excited to have this hotel as an option in Dallas. I would be very happy to know a convention I was attending is booked at this property. I would feel good as a meeting planner booking this hotel. However, if I were a meeting planner, I would stipulate in the contract that staff would need to be beefed up and instructed how to display gracious Texas hospitality. With the exception of the concierge and Bob's Steak and Chop House, all ares of the hotel need improvement. If the hotel wants to keep the Omni name, it needs to meet Omni standards. for anyone reading this review, I hope it helps you, and I hope your visit will be pleasant.
