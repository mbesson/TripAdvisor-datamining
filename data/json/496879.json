When I got home, I checked with the booking agency, and they insisted that the hotel should not have charged me for the first night. Finally, after threats of involving MasterCard, the hotel agreed to refund the spurious charge. The hotel was very noisy.

This hotel rescued me from a disasterously disappointing experience at another hotel. I walked in and the kind English-speaking woman at the front desk was sympathetic and even though I needed a place for 6 nights, she said they would figure out a way to accommodate me. They said I might have to switch rooms once during my stay (although ultimately I was not asked to do so). My room was large, had excellent heat and air conditioning, had a nicely tiled bathroom, a comfortable bed and--most important--was very clean. The cleaning staff is to be commended because they really cleaned the room and bathroom every day. The staff was friendly and helpful. They allowed me to store my luggage the first day because I arrived before check-in. I did have a shower curtain which didn't operate correctly and a toilet which ran all of the time but when I checked out they reduced my rate for me (and the original rate I was paying was very reasonable). In addition, the breakfast was just wonderful. There was ham, cheese, rolls, 3 types of pastries, yogurt, coffee, tea and cocoa. It was served in an adequate 2-room dining room with each table nicely set. The best part about the breakfast was the woman who brought out the food as well as the tea, coffee, etc. She was such a cheery helpful person I looked forward to seeing her each morning. It should also be said that the reasonable room rate does include the breakfast each day. I would definitely stay here again.

We were met by the lady of the house who showed us to our room and explained all its facilities (a coutesy you almost never get at a 3 star hotel).
