Since Premier is local small chain (part of EZ8), I was unsure of what to expect. The reviews online were all positive, so I booked. Oh, yeah, since i was a bit short on money, the price was definitely an enticement. It is hard to find a hotel in the $40-80 range in San Diego on a good day, but in July it is impossible, but the Premier had rooms in this range. The rooms are large, full basic cable lineup on the TV. Showers were nicely built walk-in types (not tubes). Fridge in each room. They also have a hot tub that people seemed to really enjoy. The hotel is on the bus line and about a 15-20 minute walk to Fashion Valley mall. The bus ride is about 5 minutes. Be careful, though, because the bus does not run on Sundays. Only downside, is that they have free internet in the lobby on some old computer! In your room you have to pay $5 per day. But apparently you can also pay $10 for a month of service that you can use at this hotel, other hotels, in airports, on planes, etc. So I suggest just paying the $10 if you will be here more than one night.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cNo frills, no complaints.\u201d", "Author": "Hawaiigirl44", "ReviewID": "UR115137702", "Content": "The hotel is conveniently located close to Sea World.

I read somewhere the rooms smelled funny but I didn't experience this. I have stayed here 3 times. I am and have been satisfied with the quality of the hotel for what little money we paid.

In addition, the smoking in the hallway by individuals was not to our liking, and finally, it took three tries to get checked in. We were first told by phone(before we began the trip) that checkin in is between 2 and 3 pm. I indicated we would arrive a bit before two. We were told we would have to wait for that bit of time. We arrived, and attempted to check in at about 2:30-NO ROOMS WERE READY. We were then told by the toothless woman at the reception desk that rooms would be ready about 3:30 or 4. I indicated that we were not happy and had an elderly person with us who needed to rest, but agreed to come back then. Thankfully, I called ahead again and was told NO ROOMS WERE READY at 3:45 ish. Finally, 2 of the 4 rooms were available at about 4:15, a little more than an hour before our event at 6pm. The next two rooms became available shortly after that-the young lady who handled the check in at that time was professional. The arrest, however was upsetting to two of my party who were in the office drinking coffee Saturday morning. I plan to go to San Diego again, but with what happened at Premier Inn, I am not convinced that is the place to stay. Office staff was hit and miss-a tooth-challenged, poorly groomed woman was almost helpless as a front desk person and not personable or friendly, while the replacement woman later in the day was professional. The continental breakfast left a lot to be desired, including-NO child friendly beverages, only sweets, no proteins. Parking was almost non-existent, and the hotel should NOT be a AAA club recommended location. Even at appx. $55/night per room, my money was not well spent. I requested a refund upon my return from our event, and am STILL WAITING! Still waiting for a refund, after 3 complaints-one to the desk about slow availabilty of rooms to be ready, one to the reservation company, and one to corporate of the hotel.", "Date": "March 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, NV", "Title": "\u201cHotel services are not as advertised\u201d", "Author": "eZWest", "ReviewID": "UR21728825", "Content": "I run a small business and I required internet services while on this trip.
