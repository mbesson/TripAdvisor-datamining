I was originally booked for a hotel in Bur Dubai nearby Meena Bazaar area. But I was informed by the Thomas cook guys few hours before my departure that my choice of hotel was not available and they were going to put me in Hotel Regent Palace. I checked the hotel's review at tripadvisor and I was a bit apprehensive whether to go for it are fight it out with the Thomas Cook guys and look for some other option. I agreed with them to stay at Regent palace for one night and in meantime asked them to arrange for some other option(especially after reading some really negative reviews). I must say I was surprised with this property. It was my business trip hence I was not expecting something exceptional for my stay but regent palace was way ahead of what I had expected. The location. The hotel is located right opposite Burjuman mall and the metro station is just a minute walk. This excited me because I was suppose to travel everyday to the Dubai convention and exhibition center and best way to travel there is Dubai Metro :-) The main market of Bur dubai is walkable distance. The Property The hotel is very well maintained. The rooms were comfortable, spacious and neat(much against what many of the travellers have complained). Service Well, the service was not exceptionally good but it was not bad either. It was quite reasonable and I was absolutely fine since I was not going to stay in the hotel for long time throughout my stay. However, the can certainly do a lot to improve the service. For instance, one of the days they had some maintenance work with the hotel airconditioning system(which I came to know later). As a result, there wasn't enough cooling in the room the whole night. I kept on calling the housekeeping, front desk, room service and they could not figure out the problem. Finally, a maintenance guy came and told me that the chillers of the central airconditioning had some maintenance that day and it takes few hours for them to start functioning normally. Food Since I use to be away the whole day, I did not try out their restaurants. However, I did take their breakfast coupons and it was a standard breakfast. You would find a lot of options in the breakfast and you'll see a good variety of Indian food on their menu. I guess this has to do with the fact that lot of Indian travellers, both business and leisure stay at this hotel. I saw many of them (including me !) Other than the above, there was nothing much to review about this hotel. Though they claim to be a 4* hotel, I wouldn't rate them above 3*. Will I prefer this hotel next time I travel to Dubai?

The staff were really friendly, we had had a night flight and landed in Dubai at 7am in the morning, check-in was not until 2pm, but after arriving at the hotel for about 9 - 9:30am, we were told that we could pay for an earlier check-in. Needing to shower and change clothes we agreed and they asked us to wait for about 20 mins to sort the room out. We ended up waiting over an hour, but had the early check-in charge waived, so we were extremely grateful for that. The disco is VERY loud, reading other reviews before we left, we had requested a high level floor, but even on the fourth floor the disco music from the ground floor was making it to our room ! At 10:40pm on our first night, yes we were in bed, totally wiped-out from the flight, we had a call asking us to move rooms, as they had to complete some emergency work right above our room. Not happy, but not a lot of choice, we dressed, packed and went to see the two rooms we had been offered. They said they would send someone up, they didn't, waited and waited, went down to reception, told them we had picked the room on location (far away as possible from the disco) and wanted the new keys, waited and waited. Went back down to reception and told them just to give me the new key, we would move ourselves. Although a bit of a nightmare, worked out for the best as we could not hear the disco from the new room. Breakfast was ok, plenty there but standard wasn't brilliant. Egg Chef would do anything for you though and he was very good at knowing who was next in line. We didn't pay any extra for breakfast, so can't really moan.

We went out to the Renaissance Hotel one night to the Spice Island buffet (absolutely amazing you must go!) and that area seemed to have more going on around it, that you could walk to if you wanted.

Ask for a room on the upper floors to get away from noise from the clubs. Water was warm but not hot. I'm probably the only one who wants hot water in the desert. Breakfast was quite varied and very plentiful with food suiting various cultures. The staff was helpful but limited in their knowledge of English. We were never able to get the Internet to work, and tech support couldn't come for days, but a few blocks down the street we found a free wifi hotspot with excellent croissants. Having a mall across the street meant we always had a cool place to go, important during a summer visit. There were several nice restaurants and a food court as well. I did walk to the Old Town from the hotel, but you could take a taxi for under $7. As a female alone while my husband was at business, I felt safe walking in the area. The pool was minimal, at best. While I have no complaints at all about the hotel, if I went back during the summer months, I would probably book a room at the luxury beach hotels (I mean the 6 and 7 star hotels!) instead. During the off-season, you can get those hotels for the same price.

Please read the entire review I know its long. 1. Rooms are VERY VERY noisy due to two loud bars , rock bottom ( which is terrible ) and another phillipino bar both with bands and worse LOUD DJ's. This goes onto 3am EVERY night and any room floors 1-3 WILL feel it and hear it. 2. They restored the managment offices for 3 weeks directly under my room and this was jack hammers at 4am , drills , hammering which of course travels nicely in concrete to the base of your bed . Ear plugs in , you can still hear it. They followed this with MORE banging in other parts of the hotel all day and most of the night. 3. Buffet in the sea food resturant WILL give you diarear and / or make you sick as it did for me most days until I stopped eating there. 4. Room cleaners are not bad , but are slow , and hardly ever use a vacume cleaner on the floors. 5. Staff in most cases are grumpy and slow , totally disorganised. and don't care about your sleepless nights . 6. In - Room internet is dial up slow and costs a fortune and when it breaks , it stays broken for 3 days until the useless tech guy decides he is ready to fix it. 7. I was moved to the fourth floor during the noise , which simply meant I heard different banging from different parts of hotel , in addition the room was so damp there was condensation on the mirrors 24 hours a day . When I walked into the service stair well to see why it was so damp , all the floors above 3 had moisture dripping from the walls not good for your health. 8, Management here are without question the worst I have ever seen , from lovely 2 star hotels in bali to 5 stars in Korea this makes even the worst of those look pretty good. 9. GYM , the staff are just plain creepy. NOT one day of going to the gym was I not bothered by a female staff member coming in , turning on the big screen TV LOUD and sitting down and watching an Indian soap opera. On top of this ,imagine using the running machine and some guy comes in and cleans while you are excercising , spraying some cheap and nasty cleaning products directly around you , i didnt have to imagine that it happeneded more than once. My female co-worker also staying here reported the same female staff member attempting to walk into the female changing rooms to see her naked on a number of occasions. My advice .
