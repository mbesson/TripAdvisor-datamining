Starting at check in (at least 3 hours early and yet we got a room immediately) and throughout our stay our experience was outstanding in so many ways. Our simple but very clean and nicely appointed room was a perfect place to relax after a long day of enjoying the Paris sights which literally start as you walk out of the hotel. The location of Hotel de Seine could not be more perfect as Rue de Seine between Rue de Buci and Boulevard St. Germain is virtually pedestrian only and easily as authentically charming as Rue Cler or other Paris market streets. The Bar du Marche is a few steps up Rue de Seine and this is a true neighborhood cafe where by the third day of our visit the waiters knew what we wanted for breakfast and the food and cafe were delicious. The Louvre. Ille de Citi and Jarden du Luxembourg are just 10 minutes walk away from the the hotel and Plas de St. Germain is 3 blocks away, so this location really cannot be more ideal. Hotel de Seine's incredibly kind, personable and efficient staff added greatly to our stay and we cannot say enough about how welcome Aubrey and her coworkers made us feel. The efficiency that I mention came into play when we decided to extend our stay and Aubrey was able to find us two room nights when most of the hotels in St. Germain were overbooked. On one of our last nights Audrey encouraged us to attend a concert at Saint Chapelle and she was able to get us front row seats to an incredible performance by a baroque chamber orchestra and operatic singer that was one of the highlights of our trip. I can safely say that we will stay at the Hotel de Seine whenever we visit Paris and I cannot recommend this wonderful hotel strongly enough.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Aust", "Title": "\u201cwill visit again\u201d", "Author": "angie R", "ReviewID": "UR119824671", "Content": "we had a twin room and it was beautiful.

I mailed the hotel for a rate, but they didn't get back to me very quickly so I had to book online - at nearly 30 euros a night more than what the hotel finally offered - so not the best start. However, I was told that my stay there would be 'astounding' and I hoped for the best. Arriving in a thunderstorm late on Saturday night I was shown to what I can only describe as an utterly atrocious room - it stank of cigarette smoke, was tiny and very, very worn. It also overlooked a dark and very unlovely courtyard - the roof outside my window was full of cigarette ends (it's described as a non-smoking hotel). I cried. I felt physically sick. I went straight down to reception and complained (pleaded in fact for another room), but was told I couldn't have another room until the next day, so I couldn't unpack and had to sleep with the window open all night to try to lessen the smell. The man on reception was very kind and helpful - he showed me a new room next morning, which ordinalrily I would have thought ok but rather ordianry, but on this ocassion I thought it was great - it smelled nice for one thing and it overlooked the Rue de Seine and it was a trillion times better than the dump I'd originally been given. I did have a look around at other hotels in the area and most seemed nicer than this one (and when I asked the price most were cheaper than my rate too). Positives - The staff were very pleasant and friendly, the hotel was quiet and my second room was clean. The area is fantastic, great for shopping, sightseeing, mooching, eating and drinking so what more can you ask. Just find another hotel or, if you must book this one, make sure you see a picture of your room first - and don't get stuck with room 12 whatever you do.

It was very enjoyable and busy and not too pricey. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel although it is available we preferred to hit the local cafes and sit in the sunshine watching the world go by. A great short stay at Hotel de Seine, thanks very much.", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cReally an excellent choice\u201d", "Author": "ChiChiinEurope", "ReviewID": "UR55054796", "Content": "We stayed in this very reasonably priced hotel for 4 nights as we transitioned from living in France to returning to the US. The rooms are elegant and beautifully done, though they are in an old hotel, so don't expect the huge US size hotel room. The breakfast wasn't really worth the money, so we didn't take it after the first day, but I heartily recommend getting coffee and tea in your room. The convenient location lets you have access to fabulous breakfast just down the street so that isn't a problem. Not to mention the other great restaurants, including gelatto and crepes or very french multi course meals. Make sure you take the Paris Walks guided tours in the area, and the helpful hotel staff make great restaurant recommendations and can help you find whatever you are looking for.", "Date": "February 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cSimply LOVELY\u201d", "Author": "spinach", "ReviewID": "UR28374480", "Content": "In the middle of it all, yet just a bit away from the evening revelry.

My room was cleaned daily and was kept very clean, the bathroom has a hairdryer and the little elevator is convenient especially when you have luggage. WiFi access is available in the room, I think it was 5 or 6 Euros per day and the connection was good. This area of Paris is so charming and lively -- great restaurants, shopping and markets.

Everyone and their brother told me the hotels in Paris leaved much to be desired, so maybe my expectations were low...but when I walked into my room and saw how big and clean it was, I couldn't have been happier. My room was on the 5th floor, was plenty big for 1 or 2 people, and had a great big bathroom as well. In the interest of full disclosure, here's the negatives: A little expensive. I probably paid more than I should have for a hotel, but I didn't feel \"ripped off\" at all, and it was balanced out by the location, which is fantastic. Water problem - they did have a problem with the heater, which only affected 1 shower for me. The staff was very apologetic and nice about it. Decor - there's a lot of pink and general \"fruffiness.\" But I thought it was funny, personally.", "Date": "November 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cTop location, average hotel\u201d", "Author": "Peta123", "ReviewID": "UR7624946", "Content": "If you want to stay in the middle of it all, then this hotel is a good bet. We loved being in this lively area (St Germain de Pres), amid all the shops, cafes and restaurants and within walking distance of many of the key attractions. However - and here come the negatives... the hotel did seem to be in dire need of a refubishment. The quaint 'antique' look which they are trying to achieve in the hotel doesn't work (other than the main entrance rooms, which are pleasant) and the place just seemed dirty and dated. Our room was on the top (6th) floor and was relatively small and dark and covered in the craziest bright red and yellow fabric that you've ever seen. There were hairs in the clean bed linen and the carpet and bathroom could have done with a good clean! It was also a road facing room and (on a saturday night) very noisy, so if you want a quieter room then ask for one facing into the courtyard. This meant having to sleep with the windows firmly closed - okay in May, but I imagine unbearable in August. The walls seemed pretty thin too and we did hear a lot of comings and goings throughout the night and early morning. Our friends were on the first floor and were right next to the lift shaft and said that the noise of the old lift kept them awake at night unfortunately. Having read the other reviews on here we didn't bother with breakfast in the hotel (11 EUR I think) and instead went across to Paul (6 EUR) and had great breakfasts there - highly recommended. All in all, I would recommend the hotel if you want somewhere very central and with character and are not too bothered about getting luxury or high levels of cleanliness. But our room was 170 EUR per night and this didn't seem like particularly good value for what felt like a very basic experience.", "Date": "May 15, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel de Seine", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d236539-Reviews-Hotel_de_Seine-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$193 - $289*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">52, Rue de Seine</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75006</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "236539", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/86/59/0e/entrance.jpg"}}
