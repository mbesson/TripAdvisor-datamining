Advice: -if your there for a weekend. Drop off your bags (of just carry them like we did) and go park in the 75th street parking garage (its not on 75th street look it up before you travel) for $15 all day parking on Saturday. Same price for all day Sunday. (there's no extra charge for overnight, if your car is there till Sunday at 12:01am then u just pay for Sundays all day rate) Cheapest around.

We travelled down from Toronto by plane on Friday afternoon and within minutes arrived at our hotel, The Bostonian Millennium. In choosing this hotel I was most interested in location. My chose proved to be a good one. Right outside the hotel doors is Faneuil and Quincy Markets along with an abundance of Irish Pubs with plenty to see and do right there. To the east was the water front and two blocks northeast Little Italy. Macys and other retail shopping is a 10 minute walk away. I would definitely recommend this hotel on location alone! Prior to arriving I had a small request regarding our rooms and Mr Rivers, the GM, looked after it personally to our complete satisfaction. The front desk staff also should be commended for their dedication to Customer Service. Everyone one of our requests was met with a smile and positive results. Finally the Chief Consignor, Gabriel Toussaint, was able to assist us in all of our restaurant reservations and also worked endlessly to assist me in finding a specific item in Boston. Thanks Gabriel! The hotel itself is remodelled and clean. Shower in bathroom is huge and our room also had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153makeup\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd area right at the entrance to the bathroom. Our room overlooked Faneuil Hall and part of the Boston skyline. Room cleaning was prompt and efficient. We ate at Fisher Hall, Legal Seafood and a quaint Italian place in Little Italy. All meals were excellent, though a little pricey, (but we were on vacation). I believe we could have spent the entire weekend, (or weeks for that matter,) in little Italy...our travelling companions had just returned from Venice and they felt that the selection and quality were on par.

The hotel is beautiful, the location was perfect, especially for the purpose of our trip which was to attend a Bruins game. My daughter and I were able to walk to the Hard Rock Cafe for dinner and stroll through Faneuil Hall, while my husband and son attended the game at the TD Garden, also within walking distance, which was very much a relief considering our original experience with arriving in and driving through Boston. My family and I missed the exit for 93 and spent an hour driving around the city before finding our way back to 93 now in the early stages of rush hour traffic. We arrived in Boston to realize we had forgotten to bring the directions to your hotel and not having a navigation system contacted the hotel for assistance. I would like to express my sincere appreciation for three members of your team who were incredibly helpful in assisting us in arriving at your hotel and making it to the game on time. At the time of our arrival, after what should have been a two and a half hour drive from North Conway that turned into a five hour ordeal, I don't think my family or myself completely expressed our gratitude to Eyassu, your doorman, Paul, your valet or Brendan your valet manager. Both Eyassu and Brendan assisted us with directions to the hotel, Brendan even stayed on the phone until we actually arrived at the front door. When we arrived a little frazzled and running late for the game, our car was unloaded, we were escorted to the check in desk, our bags were carried off to our room and Paul was waiting for us outside the doors to our units when we arrived up on the 3rd floor. Paul made sure we were settled, gave an over view of the room, set the heat to our liking and left us to decompress after our adventure. My husband and son arrived at the game on time and had a fabulous night. My daughter and I had a lovely evening at the Hard Rock Caf\u00c3\u00a9 and Faneuil Hall, within walking distance of your hotel. Every time we exited or entered your hotel we were greeted very warmly by Brendan and Eyassu.

They placed a $100 hold on my account for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153incidentals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd i.e. room service, mini bar, internet which they return if you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use or buy anything. Internet service was $10 for 24 hours. Also, our room overlooked a outdoor fresh produce market that took place on Fridays & Saturdays behind that was a street (though we did have a nice view) and we heard a lot of noise from the market and the street (tons of sirens). While the noise did not bother us, but I can see how it would bother someone who is a light sleeper. Pros: LOCATION! The location of this hotel was perfect for us. Right across from the Quincy Market with tons of shops, restaurants, entertainment we practically walked everywhere we wanted to go! You can walk to the market, to the North End where all of the Italian restaurants are, to the Old State House and the site of the Boston Massacre. We made reservations at the Union Oyster House one night, which was right around the corner. We also walked to a stand where we were able to buy tickets for the Old Town Trolley Tour, which was fun. A quick taxi ride from the airport as well (cost about $25). The staff was very friendly and helpful. There was also complimentary Starbucks coffee in the mornings and warm apple cider in the afternoons which was great during the cold month of December. The fireplace in the lobby was on the entire time as well\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 making the lobby nice and toasty. Which felt great walking in from the cold. The hotel is decorated nicely as are the rooms. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use any amenities so I cannot comment on those. But we found the rooms to be very nice and clean.

I liked the setup of the rooms sharing an entrance door from the hallway with a shared entry area, but then each room had it's own door off the entry area. It allowed a little more privacy for my husband and I than the room-to-room doors. While the hotel didn't have a pool (which is normally very important to the kids), there was so much to do in the area, we didn't seem to miss it.

The lobby was very updated and decorated in a modern traditional style. The front desk staff and the doorman were super helpful and nice...it took the desk less than 3 minutes to get me checked in and sent on my way. Once I arrived to the room I was blown away with how large the rooms were...was I really in Boston with a room this size? There was a very large closet, a separate space for the sink and bathroom, and I had a balcony overlooking the Clock Tower, the Pier, and Downtown Boston. The true king size bed was very plush and amazingly comfortable with large firm pillows that provided for excellent sleep throughout the night. I decided to order room service and it was a bit costly but the food was excellent and sometimes you have to indulge. The next morning I woke up pretty early and opened my balcony door to be greeted by the Farmer's Market right in front of the hotel. Wow, what an amazing site to see and smell all the fresh fruits, vegetables, homemade desserts, and fresh baked breads.

My early perceptions were largely correct when I finally stayed at the hotel over Labor Day weekend while back in town for a wedding. The hotel's greatest asset is its location, across the street from Faneuil Hall and Quincy Markets it is right in the center of what most tourists come to Boston to see. It is a short walk to the North End, Boston's Italian neighborhood, and to the New England Aquarium and boats that will take you on whale watching trips. You are at almost the middle of Boston's freedom trail which goes by the corner of the block the hotel is on. The hotel is easily accessible by car from the airport, the train station or from the highway (which is a plus in Boston's colonial era mish-mash of streets). The lobby is nicely appointed and the front desk is fairly helpful and efficient. The bellmen were very helpful in getting us a cab when we were leaving and taking care of our luggage. Our room was a superior plus, but was still relatively small. This is probably to be expected in a city hotel, though I have stayed in other hotels in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood that were more spacious. The room had a small balcony and looked out on Fanueil Hall. This could be concerning as in the evening the area can be noisy, particularly on weekends, but the windows were well insulated and it didn't bother us. The bathroom was nice with a good sized shower (no bath) with one of those rain-like shower heads that was great. The layout of the room was also a bit weird, with the closet basically in the bathroom. The room was also in a second building connected to the hotel which required a twisty walk to get to from the elevator. Not a tremendously long walk, but the housekeeping cart was always nearly blocking the narrow hallway and there was a maintenance closet next door that they seemed to be working in regularly. Small complaints to be sure, but it did detract somewhat. We didn't spend too much time in the room itself, but the a/c unit wasn't the best and the cable signal on the TV was terrible. You shouldn't be staying here to watch tv, but it was annoying when you had the tv on in the morning or evening. We tried the hotel restaurant for breakfast on our last day. It was very good though expensive, like most hotel restaurants. As another poster mentioned, you are close to a lot of good restaurants in the area that you may want to check beforehand, but you won't go wrong if you do.

First I will start off with the positives. 1.Mostly everyone was very friendly 2. You can not find a better location in my opinion. We were directly across from Quincy Market/ Fanueil Hall and the haymarket. Also very close to the North End/ Little Italy (if you like cannolis you must try Mike's Pastries in North End), and the aquarium (did a whale watch here but we did not see anything.. money wasted b/c we had to return home the next day and could not use the vouchers) 3. I must not be a light sleeper b/c the haymarket was right below us and yes they are loud early in the am but we only noticed it on Sat and we are on vacation to get up and sight see/not sleep in, so we didn't mind. I really didn't notice too many other sounds but you are in the city and yes, there are police cars and emergency vehicles. 4. We paid for connecting rooms (one w/ 2 doubles which had a great view and a small balcony for one person) and one room w/ a king. All rooms were very well appointed although 1 very small towel rack, which I thought was absurd.. We had no where to hang our towels. The rooms were very clean and had everything that one might need. (except for places to hang towels. .there was one very small rack but you can't hang 4 towels on that when there are 4 people in a room) 5. I called a few months ahead for a reservation and chose to do the AAA Advanced Purchase rate which could not be cancelled or changed. Closer to the date I realized that the price had lowered drastically. When I called and spoke w/ someone at the front desk to see if I could get any sort of credit I was repeatedly told NO. However, I later phoned Garth in reservations and he was more than happy to accommodate me. Although I could not get a refund, he was very pleasant about issuing me a 'credit ' to use in the hotel. With parking being $42/day we were able to apply some of the credit here. Now, for the bad points 1. I had noticed repeated reviews on TA commenting on the A/C not working. When we arrived the a/c in the one room was fine but we noticed it was very warm in the connecting room. The temp was set at 68 and it was 78 in the room... not too uncomfortable but it was getting warmer by the minute. We notified someone at the desk and were told that is 'how the unit operates' and that we should simply turn it off, wait and turn it back on again.. WE did this and it worked for about an hour and then stopped working again. We called the front desk again and they sent someone up immediately. He looked at the unit and cleaned out 'black water' from the tube, hoping that would help. He was extremely helpful and friendly. We went out but when we returned, it was even hotter. That evening we had to get up almost every hour to 'reset' the thermostat. When we told the morning staff at the front desk, we were again told \"that is how the unit works.\" They sent another engineer to our room who told us that we MUST keep the unit set on 68 and it will keep the room at 68. We explained that was way too cold for us. Although we were hoping to keep it around 74 we were forced to keep it at 68. Reluctantly we set it at 68 just to have it eventually creep back up to 80. Again, back down to the front desk to complain. It got to the point where we got the feeling they were tired of hearing our complaints. We heard \"I'm sorry.\" but that was it. During the third day the same thing happened again, at which point they sent the engineer back who had been there the first day. He said there was definitely problems with the compressor but it could not be fixed until Monday, the day we were checking out. The problem continued all 4 days that we were at the hotel. Finally the manager did offer to move us but we had a connecting room b/c my parents have medical issues and they were in the other room so we couldn't move. I don't fault the hotel for this b/c they did offer to move us but I am upset and a little unnerved that they refused to believe there was an issue and we were treated like it was no big deal until the engineer himself agreed that there definitely was a problem w/ the compressor. At this point the manager did offer to refund one night. We greatly appreciate that but it was very annoying being told multiple stories by the front desk staff just so we would stop complaining. It was obvious they had no idea what they were talking about. 2. Another huge annoyance- the room keys provided worked the first time we entered the room but not after that. We had problems with the keys not working EVERY time thereafter. We would attempt to enter the room just to find the key not working. At that point, I would once again head to the front desk to get another key made, to bring it up and find that key didn't work either. Finally one of the gentlemen at the desk came up with us and realized that we were right and none of the keys were working. Although this seems like a minor problem it gets very annoying to have to get keys reprogrammed 4+ times a day. 3. When we had the multiple problems w/ the a/c and the key cards one of the gals at the front desk was very apologetic. She expressed how sorry she was and wanted to offer us a free breakfast on one of the days. She said that our letter offering such would be put under our door that evening. We awoke on Sunday and nothing. Same with Monday-nothing. Yes, we could have asked for it but she was not on duty when we realized that she had made an empty promise. 4. Parking $42/day and they park you on an open lot next to the haymarket. At least we could see our car but at that cost I would hope it would have been in a garage somewhere. Wifi- $9.95/day. My son needed this to finish an online course so he had to go to a fast food restaurant to use the free Boston Wifi. Overall this very upscale hotel basically has the location going for it. Mostly everyone was pleasant but I eventually felt like I was being a huge inconvenience b/c I expected our keys and a/c to work. We were in room 615 and were told the a/c would be fixed on Mon so hopefully for future travelers the hotel will take care of it.", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Whitesboro, New York", "Title": "\u201cConveniently located and well appointed!\u201d", "Author": "Kathleen9726", "ReviewID": "UR116746235", "Content": "We were in Boston for college visits and some family time.

First off, let me start off by saying we booked a room with two double beds. My first complaint is these were the smallest double beds I have ever seen. Myself, my twenty four year old nephew and 13 year old son were hard pressed to make this work as the beds were THAT small. I went to the manager at the front desk and to her credit she acknowledged this complaint from others numerous times and she gave us a roll-a-way bed for our room at no charge (normally it is $20.00 per night for one). She really did right by us and I appreciated it. The other issues are of personnel choice as and nothing the hotel did wrong. Anytime we wanted ice we would need to call the front desk and have it delivered to us as there are no ice machines on any floor of the hotel.

At night, on the way back, you find some unsavory characters. One followed my wife and I for a block and sort of ruined the night. Later that same evening as we tried to go to sleep, the noise from the street below was pretty bad. We stayed in a superior room which has a tiny balcony. You can hear everything...ambulances, cars, general traffic, etc. The hotel needs some sound proofing. The following night (7/16) a security alarm went off in the night twice. It went on and on and on. LOUD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The hotel said it was from across the street, but it's hard to believe. Let me top this review off by noting the fee for overnight parking is $42.

I stayed here with my two small children and would not reccomend it for families! First of all there was a \"prank\" fire alarm that woke us up at around midnight and scared my two children. In the morning no apologies from the staff and I would have thought a \"sorry letter\" to appear under our door would have been a classy touch to a \"4 star\" hotel, but no just our overpriced bill! Again no aplogies even when we checked out the next day. Also the street is rather noisy so once we woke up it was hard to get everyone back to sleep. Even still we awoke at 9 am to hear a \"squeaky bed\" going at it in the room above! Again not really classy especially for children! Another thing I noticed was when our room was being cleaned the service lady washed our used glasses in the sink and once she left you could see our lipmarks still! Gross! Again not very 4 star! Okay so now we are checked out and waiting for our car which we valeted. Not a wise decision perhaps! It took over an hour when the ticket says about 20-30 minutes! Even at the 30 min mark we were brushed off and so finally at the hour it took 3 hotel staff to figure what went wrong even though we were waiting right in front of the front desk the whole time! You would have thought they would have noticed something wrong, but no again, the hotel fails at customer service. They were nice but not too good at their jobs something you would expect for the 4 star rating. So here we are at home and noticed we were charged twice! I called but got a machine. Again not very professional in my opinion they should straighten out mistakes like this right away and so we will see if it will be anything like our car! I already expect the worst at this point!

The room itself is furnished as you would expect in this class: granite and marble bath, dark wood and soft surfaces all in rich materials, a comfortable king bed strewn with pillows, and a flat screen TV.

It was a lovely place to lay one's head. The area surrounding the Millennium Boston has also enjoyed a substantial upgrade with the removal of the elevated central artery highway... Ten years ago, this hulking, rusting green monument to bad city planning cast a literal shadow over the Haymarket-Fanueil Hall neighborhood. Now, the area seems much lighter and brighter. The air just seems, well, clear. A few words about Fanueil Hall: I lived in Boston and environs for 20 years, and Bsotonians love to sneer about Fanueil Hall as a tourist trap no Bostonian would stoop to visit... Which never accounted for why you'd run into friends and colleagues having fun there every time you would visit. In spite of the \"down economy\" -- or maybe because of it-- Quncy Market was packed with people both Thursday night and Early Friday morning during my visit.

You could stay here and never use a car and have an amazing time in Boston.

The subway stop is right around the corner, and will take you to locations such as Harvard or the Charles River in a few minutes. We hold off the fifth star for the following reasons... - Friday night is just very noisy in this area. If you want serenity, go elsewhere. By the time the last partiers were winding down around 2:30 AM, the first vendors for the farmers market were arriving to set up their awnings for Saturday morning. The noises were non-stop all night long. So take ear plugs...what do you expect when you are in the middle of Boston fun? Saturday night was much more quiet since there is no market on Sunday. - We were advised to allow 20 - 30 minutes when requesting our car from valet parking, but a 45 minute wait on Saturday evening almost caused a missed dinner reservation.

Was skeptical but don't like to make a fuss. But, same problem. Just gave up and did the on off thing. Then, around 2:30am there was a lot of noise outside with some guys shouting, things scraping across the road, \"beep beeps\" from trucks backing up and so on. Had a look out and right below they were setting up canopies and unloading crates from trucks. This went on till after 4:30am and it was impossible to sleep. I asked the receptionist in the morning what this was and it seems there is a farmer's market or something setup during the night on the sidewalk for Fridays. Not sure what months this occurs.

The staff - front desk, concierge, bell, bar and restaurant - were very pleasant and helpful and the service was very good. The food in the restaurant, North26, was excellent. We ate breakfast and lunch there at some points during our stay. Our room was quite spacious, though the closet was very small and directly to the left, at right angles, of the bathroom door. Directly to the right, and opposite the closet, was a small table with a lamp and a stool - presumably for make-up etc. The problem was that anyone wanting to go into or out of the bathroom couldn't get past if someone was sitting on the stool or getting something out of/putting into the closet. A very poor design, in my opinion. The safe in the closet was so high up you couldn't see what was in there and anyone who is short would have to stand on a chair to open and close it. The large shower head was excellent, but there were no grab bars and the bath ws fairly slippery - a potential danger for those who have physical disabilities. I was not too happy about all the extra charges made for services which many comparable Boston hotels provide as standard - e.g. charging $9.95 per night for internet/wi-fi access, $4 for 10 minutes computer time in the business center, and $20 for a refrigerator in our room. Having taken the wi-fi package the service was very unreliable, disappearing and re-appearing with frustrating regularlty. The front desk did what they could to help, as did the engineer, but it didn't improve. They gave me a phone number to call for more advice, but it was constantly busy and I gave up after a while. Our room overlooked a narrow alleyway, and the noise from the market place just across the street was quite loud during the day, and at night it was noisy from people walking through the alleyway.

We loved that there are several restaurants nearby so you're not wandering confused, and hotel itself is decorated beautifully, even the rooms. The Con's. We only stayed two nights, but found it rather uncomfortable. The fire alarm went off twice, once during a downpour, and the other time right before we headed to bed, I think around 10-11ish. The message on the alarm said to take the fire exit and walk down, but then a live person came on and told us to stay where we were while they figured out what the cause of the alarm was. I don't know about anyone else, but I've always been taught that when a fire alarm goes off, you leave the building. It was disappointing, so much so that people were just standing in the hallways confused. In addition, the first morning there, We stopped off at the front desk to grab a map. The receptionist was helping someone in front of me, which we understand, but then a group came in to check in, and rather than help us, she finished up helping her customer and turned to the new check-ins. I don't know about service but we waited about 5 - 10 mins. Finally we got so annoyed, I had to step in and tell her that we had been waiting before them. For a morning where only one person was at the front desk to help and only one person was in line, I figure she wouldn't think we were standing at the front desk for fun. Lastly, the wireless internet which was working for us for about an hour decided to cut off, the maintenance person came up, and unplugged and replugged a few wires and when that didn't work they told us to call tech support. Tech support couldn't figure out what was wrong so no wireless. They didn't charge us for the wireless, but when we look for a hotel one of the requirements is wireless.

It often has very good promotions and packages available which justify the relative cost of this (as well as any Boston) hotel.

But the infrastructure and maze-like design of the hotel is a challenge which seems to lead to inconsistency in room attractiveness. This last trip, I was given an \"upgraded\" room on the fourth floor with a nice view of the marketplace and a fireplace (in May???); I didn't get to the room until late in the evening and then found that its geometry was such that its king bed took up most of the entryway, and the tucked way bathroom (very nice) was designed so that it also included the clothing closet (odd). But the real issue arose when the HVAC system turned on. It was binary, either on or off, so no adjustment in fan speed was possible, and when running it sounded like a small aircraft was operating in the room. To worsen matters, the placement of the vents produced vast torrents of air which you couldn't escape given the room configuration and the crammed bed placement put your head within three feet of the noisiest component. I was forced to turn the system off, crack the patio doors to get some fresh air, and listen to the sounds of Boston through the night and early morning. Given the time of arrival and the sold-out status of the hotel (and city), I didn't try to change the room, but would have been more than happy to revert to the standard room I'd booked and stayed in and enjoyed previously.

Perfect location for Fanueil Hall & Quincy Market (directly across the street), Freedom Trail, Aquarium, etc ~ all within a 5 minute walk. Hard Rock Cafe is next door with a parking garage above with reasonable rates. (Hotel does have it's own valet service as well, if you choose.) Plenty of restaurants, shopping and history nearby. Excellent choice when staying in Boston!!! I'd give more stars if I could!! Only one disappointment though ~ no free WIFI ~ $9.95 per day, per laptop!! That was unexpected and annoying, but even so, we still give it 5 stars - truly great place!!", "Date": "February 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hartford", "Title": "\u201cThe very best location for North End and Quincy Market; Very friendly, top-notch service.\u201d", "Author": "NuffSed", "ReviewID": "UR55404212", "Content": "Loved it!

Nice fireplace and seating area in the lobby, where they serve hot cider in the afternoon and good coffee in the A.M., also complimentary Globe and Times. Our major gripe was that the Haymarket sidewalk produce vendors, which are adjacent to the hotel, leave a mess on the street, both during and after their sales hours. However, being next to the vendors afforded a fantastic people-watching experience and a chance to grab some great buys on fruit for our breakfast in bed. It is real slice of city life to see the locals stopping by the stalls on their way home. Other than that, our only gripe was that the hallways were too chilly, partly because of the large windows and because the temp was set too low for comfort in frosty February. As an added plus, the North 23 Restaurant was superb for dinner.

Upon entering our room, we were greeted by a funky, what-the-heck-is-that smell, prompting some quick window-opening maneuvers. After looking at each other, noses crinkled and grimacing, we decided to call the front desk to request another room, preferably one without an offensive odor. The apologetic guest services rep called a short time later and offered to upgrade us if we were willing to move to a lower floor. I booked an upper-floor room after reading in my trusty travel guide that this area of the city might have some lingering construction going on, and an upper floor would be more quiet. Of course we jumped at the better room, which had a little balcony and overlooked Faneuil Hall, rather than a dreary back street. The rep personally showed us to our superior, pleasant-smelling room and opened the curtains to expose a lovely view of the twinkling lights around Quincy Market. Ahh....much better! I do want to warn the light sleepers out there that this was not a quiet room. Haymarket, a bustling outdoor marketplace, is directly outside the hotel, is open Friday and Saturday, and vendors set up their stands well before dawn. That said, the location of this hotel is hard to beat; it is convenient to all parts of the city and adjacent to the shops and restaurants of Quincy Market. This is a boutique hotel so don't expect to have employees fawning all over you. The staff that is present is efficient and cordial. We only came into contact with doormen and the front desk clerk. That was fine with us. Oh, I almost forgot. The fire alarm went off late one afternoon as I had just pried the shoes off my Freedom-Trail-weary feet. A recording told us to stay put until further notice, saving us from hobbling out into the street, now filled with fire engines. I downgraded the cleanliness based on the funky smell in our first room and my husband's discovery of some crud on the down comforter in the second. Otherwise, it was very clean and housekeeping kept our room tidy, replenishing everything each day. Concerning value, my husband commented he has stayed in nicer Hilton Garden Inns and Marriott Courtyards. Frommer's rates this hotel two stars in the \"very expensive\" category. Expensive, yes, but it does not measure up to Four Seasons or Fairmont hotels. Finally, we found it interesting that there was a cigar bar located seven floors below our original room.

The shopping street with Macy's dept store is a short walk as is the water front... in fact I walked most of Boston center happily. Tip for a cheap and early breakfast was a few fast food places within a few hundred meters, coffee and Danish or Mc Muffin etc. Also check out the sun deck they have, I spent hours just sitting taking in the sounds of the city while relaxing with a few beers, which the bar bought up to me!

I found a great $159 deal on Travelzoo for a \"superior\" room with a balcony, and booked a room for 9 nights through Millennium's website. I specifically mentioned that I would need a rollaway for my daughter, and noted that there was no fine print about cancellation fees or charge for a rollaway. After making the reservation,. I called the hotel a couple times to inquire about any such fees. I was told by a pleasant woman that usually there was a fee (I think $25) for a rollaway but I could probably negotiate that with the manager when I arrived. When I later spoke to a manager if I could still have the $159 rate if I left for a couple days (to go to Cape Cod) and returned, he rudely told me that he would \"not advise\" my leaving the hotel and returning. Only after I pushed him further on the fact that the promotional fine print didn't say anything about fees for modifying the reservation did he agree I could have the same rate upon my return. On the date of my arrival, I called the hotel from the airport in LA to tell them we would be arriving around midnight late and make sure they would have a rollaway I got stuck with the same manager (easily recognizable due to his British accent). He put me on hold, sounded like I was bothering him and basically just said my reservation was on file. About 7 hours later, when we were checking in, the front desk clerk spent a long time saying they were short on the type of room that I was entitled to and which could fit a rollaway. It turned out that the rude manager was standing next to the clerk (I recognized his voice and accent). I politely addressed the manager, reminded him of our earlier conversations, including my call from the LA airport. Not only did he refuse to acknowledge our conversations or even say the customary \"Welcome to our hotel\" greeting, he just gave me a dirty look and failed to assist in the booking. Eventually, the clerk found a \"junior suite\" for us, warning that this was only for the first couple nights and that we would have to move to another room on the third day. When I was asked to sign the registration papers, I noticed there was a $50 \"early departure\" charge as I had told them I was leaving after 5 days. I then had to argue with the clerk to say the fine print on the reservation email and also the manager had said nothing about such a fee. He then finally took the fee off. The \"junior suite\" was nice and clean, but not really a suite. It was very clean and had a sitting area with a fireplace. The bathroom had a great shower and separate tub. The only problem with the room was lack of drawers for storing your clothes and not enough towel racks. As others on this forum have pointed out, the electronically wired mini-fridge (with usual outrageous charges) made it impossible to store your own drinks as just moving something would result in a room charge. We were lucky our room was very quiet as it faced an internal courtyard and not the side with the weekend outdoor marketplace. On the morning of the third day, we were told by the front desk clerk we would be moved to a different room. Later that afternoon, when we returned, we found that our new room had a king size bed but no rollaway. It also had no balcony, which we were supposed to get. I was willing to forego the balcony but called the front desk to ask for a rollaway. After some time, Housekeeping called to say they were looking for a rollaway but if they could not find out, we might have to get a \"specially made\" bed. I had no idea what that meant. I called the manager on duty (luckily not the rude guy). This manager was pleasant but then delivered the stunning news that we might end up with an air mattress as they had no rollaways. I told him that would not be acceptable and they needed to find a room with 2 queens or possible give us a second room. I questioned why they would have taken away the rollaway as we had already stayed there 2 nights and they knew we would need one for the next 3 days. He said he would work on it and call right back but didn't. After an hour, we stopped by the front desk to talk to him in person. He was very polite, professional and pleasant but told us they were now looking to borrow a rollaway from a nearby Marriott but had to find a van first. If not, we were going to be stuck with the air mattress. I told him that in all of my 25 years of business and vacation travel in hotels around the world, I had never heard of a hotel making a guest sleep on an air mattress. He acknowledged this but said that the hotel had no other spare room (hard to believe, in this economy, that any hotel has 100% occupancy....).Since we needed to go out for dinner, I gave him my cell phone number, and told him to call with an update. Throughout dinner, we did not hear from him and had no idea what the hotel was going to do. When we got back, we were so relieved to find a rollaway in the room. Although some people might say, \"all's well that ends well\", this whole thing definitely put a big damper on our stay. I did complain about this on the hotel's questionnaire and got an email apology but nothing more - such as discount coupon for future, etc. which I have received from another leading chain when I complained about something minor once. After we returned from Cape Cod, we stayed at the Copley Square Courtyard by Marriott and had a much more pleasant stay.", "Date": "August 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newport Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location!\u201d", "Author": "notsofrosty", "ReviewID": "UR38942746", "Content": "We ultimately chose this hotel, over some 5 stars, because of two reasons, its great location and its recent (under a year) complete renovation. The location is amazing. It's literally across the street from Faneuil Hall and Quincy Market and right in the middle of the Freedom Trail. The North End and wharfs are just a short walk away. And the nearby subway station (Gov't Center) makes the rest of Boston easily accessible. The new decor is stylish and room is extremely clean. The large bed, luxury Italian Frette linens and German Grohe fixtures definitely make a difference. The bathroom was spacious and has its own dressing room (which does take some space away from the main room). We did not have a tub (which may be an issue for some) but I found it marvelous. The shower is tiled in beige marble, has a seamless glass enclosure (no gross shower curtain) and a rain-style shower head with a separate handheld. We had a 5th floor balcony with an amazing view of Quincy Market/Faneuil Hall. Note that this is a large entertainment area and as such can be noisy at night, particularly on Fri and Sat. Even with new, dual glazed windows, be prepared to hear people, traffic and firetrucks. It's downtown Boston afterall. I thought it might be a problem, particularly for my young children, but it wasn't. In fact we found it added to the character of the city and my children found many things to observe, including surprise fireworks over the North End. If you need more quiet, request a room on the opposite side of the hotel, but note that the trade-off is the view (empty lot or colonial alleyway-which is sort of interesting in itself). We found the staff extremely helpful and friendly. Internet connection was $10/day and our taxi fare from the airport was a little over $20 with toll. We found we did not need a car in the city but wanted one for a day trip to Cape Cod and Newport RI. Enterprise Rental Car is a few blocks away and will deliver the car to the hotel for free.

My husband pushed me around Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market, but the cobblestone and bricks made it a bit rough in a wheelchair.

It was also right across from McCormick and Schmick's and the Hard Rock Cafe. The Aquarium was close by and you can pick up the Duck tour there. There was a spa right next door as well. On Friday there was a little Farmer's Market right out front! The doormen were very helpful getting taxis for us ($18 to Fenway Park, $12 to the Prudential building).

We were given a room with a single king bed, but our group consisted of two adults and two teenagers. After several conversations with different personnel at the front desk, we learned that: 1) When you book through an online site (I had booked hotels for this trip through Expedia, Orbitz, and directly through hotels), it turns out that it doesn't matter how many people you enter as a total -- Orbitz does not request the number of children, Expedia does -- they don't pass that information on to hotels, just the number of rooms you're reserving. I thought at first that this was an Expedia booking, so I was confused as to why they didn't know that we would need a room with double beds ... it turns out I was mistaken and the booking was through Orbitz., but it wouldn't have mattered which one it was in the long run. 2) I was informed that this hotel has a limited number of double bed rooms, so in the morning when room assignments are made, getting a room with double beds would be basically a matter of chance -- even if I had called to request one there would have been no guarantee of a double bed room. Given our conversations with different people at the front desk -- the first person said she was sorry, but we could have a rollaway bed for $20 a night (a manager waived the fee when I expressed reluctance at paying that) ... the next person assured us that there would be NO problem switching to a room with double beds for our next two nights ... and then in the morning a manager who told us that our reservation was \"correct\" (meaning \"not our problem\", I guess) and that we could switch to a double bed room for the second night (and pay an additional mystery amount for the privilege) but we would have to switch back to a single king room the next) -- my feeling was that there must be a heirarchy involved with room assignment, and online bookings would be at the bottom of the list. Just a guess. We chose to stay put, and one of my daughters slept on the floor with a makeshift mattress made from the comforter from the king bed. That said, the hotel was centrally located ... across the street from Fanueil Hall and Quincy Market, near plenty of restaurants and eateries, on the Freedom Trail, and walking distance to Boston Common, the Aquarium, and the subway. Our room was not facing the street and so had no view (except for the sometimes annoyingly squeaky mechanicals of the hotel in the back), but we often paused at the view from the picture window on the way to the elevator, which was some consolation. We didn't notice any noise at all from the street on the higher floor and location we occupied. The hotel has been recently renovated, and the room was nicely appointed. The bathroom area had a separate dressing area/vanity & mirror, with a closet where we could stash most of our luggage and a cleverly designed door that could double as a privacy door for the dressing area. The shower was a large walk-in and the vanity and sink area was roomy (though oddly, no towel bars except the shower handle and a robe hook). And if you want ice, you'll have to call Housekeeping to get it. Really.

It's a short 5/10 minute ride from the Airport & on arrival the hotel looks ok but hardly impressive externally. The lobby has been created to provide the guest with a warm, cosy feeling with a small contemporary-style library in one corner which in fact contains a lot of rather impressive coffee-table type books. General decor throughout the hotel was modern & recently refurbished. The room we were allocated was as impressive as we would expect in a major city centre hotel without moving into the realms of sheer luxury which brings a much heftier price tag. Very tastefully appointed, the bedroom was large, with a lot of light filtering in through the large windows which opened up onto a balcony overlooking the always bustling Fanueil Hall & Marketplace. The Hard Rock Cafe was directly ahead with rock music blaring out adding to the hustle and bustle but once you'd closed the baclony doors the outside sound was virtually non-existent & after 10pm outside noise was at a minimal level anyway. The bed, bedlinen, pillows etc were heavenly. We had a \"Dressing Area\" bewteen the bedroom and bathroom consisting of large wardrobe/closet with free digital security safe & Dressing Table & Stool with space to store luggage, this was a lovely touch when travelling with four large items of luggage. The bathroom was very impressive, all fixtures were top quality with a huge shower & all very modern. Location-wise we felt was impossible to beat. As first time vistors to Boston, we considered three different areas to stay but on extensively checking out each of these areas when visting, we were extremely pleased we stayed at the Marketplace. A whole array of shops, restaurants & the amazing food on offer at Quincy Market is steps from your room, The Waterfront is 5 mins & Downtown Crossing is approx 10/15 mins walk as is Boston Common. Most places you'd want to visit are well within walking distance although if you did want to walk to say Fenway Park I'd guess this would probably take upto an hour perhaps, we visited when doing a trolley tour & walked to the Prudential Centre from there. We had considered staying at the Fairmont Copley Place & 2 other Copley Square hotels but whilst I'm sure they were fine, we were extremely pleased we'd gone with the Millenium. We'd also looked at the 2 Marriotts & Hilton and again were glad we didnt stay there. We found Reception Staff to be great & the guys at the door were always on hand with an umbrella or to help with luggage & cabs without coming across as tip-hungry. We didn't use the hotel bar, restaurant or mini bar as there are so many alternatives on your doorstep. Cost-wise we found most hotels of what we'd call a 4 Star level to all be around the same cost ($150 - $200 per night) during our stay & we were pleased with what we got for our money. Overall, we were delighted with our stay at the Bostonian and are staggered that as of July '09 it's only rated as thirtysomething in the list of hotels rated in Boston. This must reflect many reviews during a refurbishment or something similar as there is no way there are 20+ hotels better than the Millenium in this relatively small city. We weren't looking for a pool, gym, extensive number of public computers, \"cool\" coffee shop in the lobby during our stay.

It turned out to do that and more. The biggest unplanned part of the trip was the weather. The day after our arrival we had 8 inches of snow in half a day. We may not have been ready but the hotel was. From help-yourself hot apple cider in the reception area to several people outside helping open the doors and get you through the entrance, we felt so looked after. The reception was warm, welcoming and relaxed with a lovely 'library' feel. Breakfast was excellent as was the service. With all the snow the location really paid off. We were able to go out, shop, eat and be entertained within 3 blocks of the hotel. When we had adjusted we even went to the park with cheap toboggans bought locally. and took in a movie, being able to walk back to the hotel easily. We all agreed how relaxed we felt in the Millenium. As we left to go to the airport, without us asking, the receptionist even looked up our flight for us to see if it was delayed. The small negatives are few. The room wasn't enormous, (though it took us comfortably), the views aren't great, we looked out over the market, but for a city hotel it wasn't bad.

Was put in a room on the 3rd floor very close to the elevators and a restaurant/bar. While the room was pretty spacious for a city, soundproof is something that they did not have. My first and last night there I was awakened only after being asleep for 2 hours due to some noise outside, and stayed awake until around 4am. Throughout the time I was awake I could hear the sound of the vacuum cleaner (someone must be cleaning up the restaurant upon closing), of door closing / opening of adjacent rooms as well as of the elevators. While they put a nice 40\" or 42\" flat screen TV in the room, It did not appear they have any digital cable service as the picture was crappy. Also the TV volume was preset and the only way you could either turn it up or down would be to call someone. I can understand them locking the volume so you cannot turn it up beyond a certain point but to turn it down?? The bathroom was lovely, spacious and clean. That was probably the thing I liked the most about the hotel. They also provided good quality amenities, including a 1875W hair dryer (some places I know only provide 1500W). The shower head was really nice, it was removable and its height was adjustable. The only thing is, the shower head was located on one of the longer sides of the tub (had not seen such arrangement before). Nice area, lots of nice little places to eat and shop nearby.

Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what I can say about the Millennium Bostonian. For the leisure traveler who wants to be in the heart of Boston, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think of a better hotel to be in. After seeing all of the lousy economic news and knowing that it meant that hoteliers would start discounting like crazy, I waited until the last minute to book a midweek room. When my 50% off rate at the Westin Waterfront still ended up being $225, I went for the Millennium, knowing from the Tripadvisor reviews that it was under construction. My $200 rate would be discounted to $150 if I made my reservation non-refundable, which I was willing to gamble on. However, I did splurge and spend an extra $30 to be on the better side of the building, and I sent a little note asking if I could get a good view of Fanueil Hall. All of this for what I presumed would be a $400/night room once the renovation was complete, and I was again willing to take a chance on the noise. That extra $30 was the best money that I spent during my trip to Boston. The room was absolutely outstanding. I was in a corner room on the 6th floor with a balcony (which was equipped with a lovely flower box) overlooking Fanueil Hall and Quincy Market, and we could see the Custom House and the Old State House as well. For my 10 year old, this couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been better. Now the noise which didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother me was the music, drum circles and general hubbub from the streets below, and that pretty much died out by 10 pm. The location was ideal in another way because you are so centrally located to everything in Boston, particularly because you can walk to any of three different subway lines. We were also in one of the newly renovated rooms which were very nice. I would describe them as boutique hotel contemporary. Not way out there, but tasteful and refined. What I liked were the bigger-than-it-had-to-be-but-I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m-not-complaining flat screen TV, the comfortable bed and sheets and the seating furniture in general. The clock radio had an i-pod hook-up as well. One disappointment was the $9.95 that they wanted for wi-fi access. The highlight of the room, however, was the bathroom. I give the shower an A+; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the nicest I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve used anywhere. My son who rarely takes showers actually took two in eight hours. The limestone tile and oversized shower area gave it a luxe feel, but the kicker was the Grohe hardware \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a combination raintree showerhead with a separate hand washer. It took a little while for the water to heat up, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably because of the low occupancy. Other than the shower, the bathroom was a bit small, and they could\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve actually claimed some room where they have a closet so that there would be a place to put my toiletries down. As it stood, the sink was the width of the room so my bag went onto the floor. Another amusing part of the room was the toilet which had a suction so violently strong that it could probably take off a limb. Finally, they had these frosted glass sliding doors separating the bathroom from the bedroom, probably to make the bathroom seem bigger, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re tough to keep clean so you see all the spots. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind the lack of a lobby or the fourth floor check-in. The areas which are being redone certainly needed it to get rid of the last vestiges of the motor lodge/rounded-high gloss-dorm room wood aesthetic. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try the restaurant since there were so many better options around. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really ask much of the hotel since that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not why I was in Boston, but the service level seemed serviceable enough. Which takes me to the noise. I knew there would be noise, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m someone who prefers a fan when they sleep because the noise puts me to sleep, but I have to say that I know of many other hotels that tell their contractors to not start until 8 AM when many guests could be sleeping, particularly those from the west coast who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fall asleep until 2 AM. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t complain if the contractors worked until 8 or 9 PM because most people are out enjoying the city, but starting the hammering at 6:30 AM seems pretty ridiculous. So I was awakened by this huge vibration vaguely reminiscent of the 5.4 earthquake that we just had in Los Angeles, followed by incessant hammering, and not the loud whacks that my next door neighbor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contractor back home uses at 7 AM to frame their McMansion. No, this was more of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tap tap tap tap tap tap\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with a 10 second to 2 minute delay, then more of the same, ad nauseum. Then housingkeeping came by at 8:13 AM, by which time the hammering was perfectly acceptable, in my book, other than the fact that my son was still asleep, but fortunately the paper thin doors tipped me off and I opened the door just before the housekeeper knocked. What kind of housekeeping person comes by that early? In any event, it allowed me to see that the contractor had ripped open the ceiling a few feet outside our room. I said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Good Morning\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the tapper, and he tapped right back at me. In the end, tapping or no tapping, I would definitely stay at the Millennium again because the positives definitely outweigh the negatives. What I will say is that that I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take my wife during construction because I know she would be furious based on how she feels when the contractor next door gets a little over eager at 6:53. Also, I wonder what happens to the Millennium when the new Ames hotel which I can also see from my window opens up (Ames, of the Hudson/NY, Mondrian/LA uber-swank fame).

A couple of steps down you enter the \"main area\"--to the left was a small hallway with a safe, an ironing board and two fluffy bathrobes. There was also a separate sink/vanity and then the bathroom. I was rather disappointed that I didn't get one of the hotel's mini-round tubs, (like I have before) but the bathroom was excellently stocked with plenty of useful toiletries and fluffy, fresh, clean towels. I had a fabulous view of Faneuil Hall at night. Interesting skylight windows. I felt I was in a loft. By far, the best thing about my stay was how accommodating and professional the staff was. I had no car, and arrived at the hotel at 10am, expecting to drop off my baggage and check back later to see if there was a room available. I was really surprised when the front desk person told me that she had a room available for both me and my friend, on the same floor, just down the hall. It was nice to be able to drop my stuff off, clean up a bit and get going for the day. The only complaint was the ridiculous amount I had to pay for a phone call that lasted less than three minutes. (I had misplaced my cell phone). But I don't think the price was any different than any other hotel. The hotel is in the middle of renovating and I'm expecting great things.

At the last minute, I cruised the web and found that the Millenium had a room that night for $130! The hotel is right across the street from Quincy Market/Fanueil Hall and just a short walk to the North End (Italian area). We could even see Haymarket, where vendors of vegies, fruits, assorted cheeses and such, gather outside Friday-Sunday. The prices are a steal for you bargain hunters. Pomegranates for 50 cents! The hotel is hard to find from the outside, a pretty non-descript brick building. You drive into an enclosed rotary at the main entrance to check in and to valet your car if you want. We did. This convenience costs $40 for overnight parking till 2PM the following day. We ended up leaving the car till about 5PM the next day for an extra $12. We just didn't want to deal with parking. But, if you want to save some money, you can try other parking nearby. It will not be cheap, by any means, but it will be less expensive than leaving your car with the hotel. Or you can take the train to the hotel and ditch the car altogether. Boston, especially this area, is a walking city. The lobby was very tasteful and mellow, the four star rating showed. There was a concierge immediately available. The front desk was a place you could sit at, very nice. The employees, including the valets, were very courteous and friendly. They really added to the stay. There's a nice bar, with a special martini of the week. We peeked into the restaurant but didn't eat there. The North End called to us. I have read that the rooms vary a lot. Ours showed its age, particularly in the rug, but the furniture, drapes and such were of good quality and everything worked. There was a large floor to ceiling window. Ours was a handicapped room by chance. So there was the occasional mark on the wall from a wheel chair, nothing more. The bed was low, nice to see since it amazes me how many handicapped rooms have beds so high that it would be very difficult for a person in a wheel chair to get into bed. Everything a traveler needs was there, an easy outlet for your laptop, a safe, an extra pillow, a robe. Most surprising was that the tap water was delicious! We never drink hotel water, but always try it. This water was great! It was ice cold and nicely aerated, really a treat. Free, drinkable water! In the bath, there was a walk-in shower, a heat lamp, good brand toiletries, and very absorbent towels. I have long hair so I notice the towels. I didn't have to use the hairdryer. In the bedroom, there was a love seat with a coffee table, a desk, an entertainment center with drawers and a mini bar with snacks and drinks. The bed was just okay comfortable, but the sheets didn't set off my allergies, nice for a change. They must have been rinsed well. There were only two things I would change. The television was too old to have a video jack to plug our iPOD Touch into to watch movies. I know I am being picky, but we were looking forward to using the Touch, a Christmas present. The mini bar snacks were boring. Mostly just stuff that you could pick up at a convenience store. If there had been more upscale chocolate, like Godiva or Maine Cottage Foods, I would have sprung for the $4, but for Hersheys and M&M's, no way. A four star hotel with 1 star mini bar. In the end, we are really happy to have found this hotel. Just for the chance to stay in a great location at this price in Boston is excellent.

I'd like to preface my review by letting it be known that I work at a nice hotel as a Front Desk supervisor, and have some idea of how things on this level should run. We were impressed as soon as we arrived at the hotel- there were more than enough valets on staff, so checking the car in was a breeze- we waited no more than 10 seconds before we were being helped. Check-in itself was very smooth. I had seen a few mentions about the Front Desk being two small desks, and was curious as to how that would work out. I thought it ended up being a very nice setup, it was pleasant to be able to sit rather than stand in line during check-in, and the gentleman working the desk was very polite and helpful. We had room 631, which had a small balcony overlooking the front of the hotel. I thought it was a lovely room. There were some small signs of wear and tear, carpet had a few small marks on it, as did the curtains, but it didn't bother me at all. I have a great deal of sympathy for hotels, because I know how hard it is to keep them immaculate with a constant flow of (sometimes destructive) guests coming through. There was a large basket of snacks in the room for us, and turndown service was very nice and prompt. The location absolutely cannot be beat, we were right across from Quincy Market and had a great time walking around the city- everything was so close! The concierge that I spoke to on the 15th (a nice older lady) was so helpful in showing me where things were on the walking map- I had no trouble finding everything I needed to as I walked. I had booked the hotel with a small amount of trepidation because it was quite expensive for us (we are younger than most of the crowd I saw there, in our mid 20's) and I was worried we would stand out or get treated differently due to age, but the entire staff was excellent. I would absolutely come back to this hotel- it was quite pricey, but everything in Boston is going to be. I'd be much more inclined to return during the winter season when the rates are a bit lower- as I'd book for 2 nights and would be able to do more in the city.

We had booked two rooms and requested that they be adjacent, as well as a rollaway bed, and all were accommodated with no fuss. Now the downside: the hotel room is nowhere near what you would hope to get when paying $300+ a night. The bathroom doors are like shutters and have no locks, so there is no privacy. The bed in our room had a rock-hard mattress that sloped in the middle. The bed in our kids' room was better, but less than the quality of a Marriott Courtyard or Hilton Garden Inn.

I was very excited to get the $109 travelzoo rate that I just discovered a week ago. It was perfect for me. The location of the hotel is incredible, directly across the street from Faneuil Hall in Boston's waterfront area. There are a number of restaurants and clubs that are right on the street below, as well as in the Faneuil Hall complex. If you are someone who does not party hard at night, having a room directly on the street(blacony rooms) might be difficult with the news and commotion that I witnessed at 1am on Friday/Saturday night.

When I thinnk of the dives that I have stayed in during my trips to Manhattan, I cannot beleive the luxury and the cleanliness of the room, as well as the two-part bathroom with an incredibly big tub. There were some annoying parts of my stay. There is no shuttle to the airport. There is coffee only during the week and not on the weekend when I desperately needed it. When I quesitoned the staff about this slight imperfection, I received two different explanations(at two different times). The first was that they needed the restaurant staff for the morning breakfast,. What??!?!? The second was that, on the weekend, there is a fresh produce market in front of the hotel and people walk in off the street to have coffee. What?!?!?!?! An upscale hotel like this does not offer coffee to its clients. Why can't they put the coffee on the fourth floor where the breakfast restaurant is located? This was disappointing. Thank God for the DUNKIN DONUtS next to the hotel. A positive and a negative was the free internet wireless access only in the lobby. To have internet access in the room, there was a DSL line which was not free. Why, in 2007, is there no wireless access in a hotel room, in a luxury hotel? I did spend time in the lobby doing my business when I needed to be in my room. There is a very nice bar/restaurant off the lobby and a breakfast restaurant on the fourth floor. The buffet was not at all attractive in the breakfast restaurant and I would have expected much, much more for the high price of $24. The staff, however and the decor were excellent. The service, apart from the quality of the buffet, was otustanding with very friendly waiters. There is no gift shop and no refreshment machines, so be prepared to purchase what you need in Faneuil Hall, before reutrning to your room. The convenience of the mini-bar was nice, but I could not afford any of the products sold. Overall, the proximity to the T line and the location of the hotel made my trip an interesting one. The hotel room, bed and facilities in the room were very comfortable. The woman who served as the concierge was very helpful and the desk staff, for the most part, were wonderful. However, it's hard to find someone in the lobby in the middle of the night, and you have to call out behind the desk area to get someone. Do not expect an expanse of a lobby, if this is your thing. There is a quiet area near a fire place that is nice. My checkin was very quick, in spite of the hotel having only two desks to check in clients.

My brother and his wife had recently visited the Millenium as well and got lost driving into the city. Joe stayed on the phone with them for 25 minutes until they arrived in front of him.

We had a three night stay at the Millennium Bostonian as part of a flight/hotel package through Opodo, a European travel website operated on behalf of a number of airlines. It's really easy to get from the airport on the 'T' subway, and my recommended route at busy times on the roads. It's about 150 yards from State Street station, and right on the Freedom Trail too. Check in was most efficient, and my spirits rose when the clerk told me we were on a private floor (8) with its own elevator from floor 7. I already could see the \"Howard Hughes slept here\" plaque on the door to our penthouse suite. Sadly, it was not to be. Floor 8 turns out to be a 6 room section perched on the top of the annexe, and while the room was very nicely furnished, it was, in US speak, a \"European size\" room. Perfectly adequate, and comfortably furnished, though the bathroom was definitely one person at a time size. Clearly designed by a man too, for the dim lighting in there was definitely not putting on make-up friendly! We were also above the main a/c units for the lower function rooms, so we had steady noise which could disturb some light sleepers. That said, the hotel was fine, though terminating the complimentary coffee in the lobby at 7.15am seemed a little hasty for non business guests! The Atrium Lounge had some reasonable light food options, though the choice outside at Quincy or the Italian quarter of North End will probably interest you more. We didn't try the Seasons restaurant which has a top reputation. I would love to give a 3.5 mark to this hotel. The room location, quite far from everything in the hotel, and its size, leads me to lower the score on what would otherwise have been a very satisfactory stay in a very central and handy location of an most interesting city, and therefore a sure fire 4 score.

I wanted casual elegance, where you can feel comfortable wearing a suit or jeans. And I got all that at the Millennium Bostonian. Room service is speedy. Some of the selections are yummy. Their cheese selections are delectable as is their flat iron steak sandwich and club sandwich. And though there is no ice machine, call for ice and you get it straight away. Everyone at this property aims to please. The maids all greet you warmly in the morning and the sit-down check-in is most civilized. The step-out balconies overlook a historic square and the hotel is in walking distance of Boston's most historic sites. It's also one of the closest hotels to Logan Airport and yet none of the plane noise is heard. The superior plus room, while a little bit more expensive, is the way to go--rustic beams on the ceiling, a huge oversized bath, and it's much more elegant than the standard rooms. If you're looking for romance, definitely spring for the superior plus room. Seasons Restaurant is where the power brokers of Boston go to breakfast. The eggs are great and the bacon is cooked to perfection. For an extra ten dollars, you can have room service breakfast. Ask for the bed and breakfast package. I've never heard of a breakfast/room package where you could get breakfast sent to the room...and for ten dollars only...what a value! I just love this property. Very homey, the address to stay at when in Boston. Whatever you do, at least, get the superior room with step-out balcony, but again, spring for the superior plus.

We did have breakfast in the restaurant the following morning and although a little pricey, you are in downtown Boston, the food was excellent as was the service. The restrooms on the first floor are very convenient when walking around and may be accessed only with a room key which is nice. There are places to have a drink right around the corner, a Dunkin Donuts and McDonalds right outside the lobby for something quick in the a.m. if you choose. The Old Time Trolley station was right there too. There is a concierge in the lobby who will help you with just about anything your heart desires with a smile. I would stay here again if I had the chance to come to Boston. The city is just getting better and better.

We should have been tipped off when the front desk staff, who were normally friendly in the past, did not even acknowledge us when we entered. And we were the only ones waiting. One front desk person was busy with a guest but the other one was just chatting to another employee. 1. The first room we stayed in had a shower that did not work. Unfortunately, we discovered this the morning after arrving and spending our first night there. As a result, we had to be moved to another room that morning. 2. After being out and about all day we arrived back to find out we had no clean towels nor housekeeping service. 3. When we tried to call to report this, the room phones were not working (they worked that morning.) 4. Then the lock to the room failed and took them over an hour to fix!! They offered to move us to another room but we were leaving the next morning and did not want to change rooms again. They solved all of the repair problems and made an allowance on our bill. 5. But the next morning, upon checking out, we noticed a minibar charge on our bill when we never used the minibar. All this in only 2 days!!!!!! The decor in the hotel and rooms is lovely. And the location is wonderful. The lounge is beautiful. The bartenders and waitresses are the friendliest people in the hotel. The hotel certainly did not meet up to its prior standards.
