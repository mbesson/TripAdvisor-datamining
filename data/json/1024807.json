Based on that information, we booked (and prepaid) for a room facing the inner courtyard. During our stay, the hotel hosted a large party for more than 100 in the inner courtyard. The party featured a very loud DJ and a lot of screaming, cheering, etc. The noise in our room from the party was so loud that it exceeded the top volume of the room's TV. The party continued until 2:00 a.m. After the party, the hotel staff cleared tables, dishes, etc. which, while not as loud as the party, was not exactly \"relaxing.\" I complained twice to the front desk (at 1:00 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.), and I was told that nothing could be done for me. (However, when I told the man at the front desk that it would be easier to sleep at Termini, the main rail station in Rome, he nodded in agreement.) When I checked out the next morning, other guests were complaining about the noise from party. Because I was literally unable to sleep at the hotel, I asked for a refund or a partial refund of the $450 I paid for the room. My request was refused. Because of the configuration of the hotel, its use as a late night party venue is totally inconsistent with its use as a \"relaxing\" place to sleep.

The building itself was designed by Francesco Borromini so you feel like your staying in a special place before you consider the service and accommodation. The inside has lots of Boroque detail and marble flooring. You get a feeling of luxury and space when you walk in from the hot Roman streets. It\u2019s easy to drive past because it is behind some high walls but this affords the hotel a bit of peace and quiet from the streets outside. If you\u2019ve been to Rome before and seen some of the main tourist sites already then this would be the place I\u2019d recommend to stay. However if it\u2019s your first visit, I\u2019d suggest to stay somewhere closer to the \u2018action\u2019 ... like somewhere near the Pantheon. Not because of the hotel, but because of it\u2019s location. Staying in Trastavere means you have to either walk a fair way to the main sites ... or work out the transport system (which is easy to do but takes a bit of effort). Trastavere is definitely lively with lots of great restaurants and activity in the evening so if that\u2019s what you\u2019re into this is a good hotel to stay in. The reception was a little disorganised when we arrived, mainly because they were busy when we first arrived (in the morning), but they organised for us to leave our luggage at the hotel and we came back to check in around midday. The reception area was far more organised at that time and someone was then able to show us to our room and then brought up our bags for us. The room had the air conditioning running so when we opened the door ... it was instant relief from the heat (after walking around Trastavere for a few hours prior to checking in). (It was really hot in Rome that day.) The hotel staff all wore very smart uniforms which was a nice touch. I also recall the ladies all wore stockings (when it was so hot)! Poor things! The rooms were smallish (but what you\u2019d expect in Rome unless you're paying a fortune). Despite their size, the rooms have a feeling of elegance and I love the French doors that open out onto the courtyard. (We were on the second floor.) We came home after experiencing a great night out at one of the many restaurants of Trastavere to find that there was a wedding being conducted in the courtyard. We had a flight to catch the next morning so this concerned us. However with the French doors closed, we really didn't hear anything (amazingly). The bathroom is very stylish and the shower head enormous! After the hot days in Rome, the shower was perfect to refresh yourself. They had a good TV (which we could work and watched some programs briefly in English! yeh!!!) We finally got to understand what was happening in the Tour de France which we were interested in (and couldn't quite fathom in Italian)! The terrace roof top was beautiful to check out the roof tops of Rome and gives you a 360 degree view of the area. We were lucky enough because it was summer to have our breakfast in the garden. This was simply beautiful and we felt very special. The gardens are lovely and it is nice to have such a nice space to start the day in busy Rome. The breakfast on offer could not be faulted. There was everything you could want and excellent coffee. The service was always attentive. All in all we really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would recommend it (and hopefully stay there again).", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florence, Italy", "Title": "\u201cGotta love the Donna.. see you next year!\u201d", "Author": "Andrew W", "ReviewID": "UR118176879", "Content": "My fiance and I spent three nights in Trastevere just on the outskirts of Rome in August this year.

I prefer to stay in Trastevere when I stay in Rome. It's a little bit of a walk to some of the sights and the train station but at night it's THE place to be with plenty of very good reasonably priced restaurants close by. Also on a Saturday night it's full of people and lots to do. The good part is this hotel is actualy in a quiet part of Trastevere. As others have noted it's in an old monastery building which I guess is cool but depending upon where in the hotel you stay it can be tricky to find your room. I paid 185 Euro a night on a weekend in July which considering location and time of year was a decent deal for the pretty good sized room I had. The place feels like it should cost more. Breakfast was good but not outstanding. Wifi is free but only available in the lobby area. It was arguably the best wifi I had in all of Italy however. Rooms were large by European standards and room & bathroom was very clean. Staff was generally helpful. Only really downside was that it felt a bit 'stuffy'. Not stuffy as in snooty but just kind of quiet. In other words it still felt kind of like a monastery, with several nuns walking around just to complete the effect.

It's a little more neighborhood-y and a bit less tourist-y. Read about this hotel on Trip Advisor and stayed here while on business in early July 2011. Since I was in Rome for 2 weeks, I decided to mix things up. Stayed near Via Veneto one week and shifted over to Trastevere for the 2nd. (Stayed at Rose Garden Palace the first week. Had also picked it based on very good TripAdvisor reviews, and found those reviews to accurate.) Donna Camilla is a comfortable, gracious, charming place; a modern hotel wrapped within the walls of one-time convent. Check out their website, which has handsome photos and will give you an immediate sense of what the place is like. It's very clean, the staff is abundant and helpful, the quiet courtyard is a delight for an outdoor breakfast. Stayed in one of the smaller singles facing the walled driveway. It was a Saturday night and therefore a bit more traffic-y on the roads than usual, perhaps. The buzz of scooters heading up to the way top of Via Garibaldi where there's a great city view and outdoor bars. The next morning, decided to upgrade to an \"Executive Room\". Larger, quieter, faced the inner (breakfast) courtyard. A/C was abundant (this was Rome in July -- a bit toast-y though better than, say, New York City's muggy summer swelter). I was there with a bunch of colleagues and we walked to some memorable restaurants in the area. One was Taverna Trilusi, evidently a popular spot with Rome's soccer stars. A longer walk (or a short cab ride) is a Trastevere must: Roma Sparita, where Anthony Bourdain did his episode on the quintessential Roman pasta dish Caccio e Pepe (sp?). That is an amazing pasta, and everyone I was with (a bunch of not so easily impressed New Yorkers) loved their meal. Back to Camilla: only drawbacks -- no wireless in rooms (plug); they say that their thick stony walls make wifi ineffective. For wifi, you need to sit downstairs in the lounge area. I cannot think of another negative. Oh, yes: internet is not free.

We chose the hotel based on a review in the Travel section of the NY Times, as well advice of friends who travel to Rome frequently. We were not disappointed. The hotel is absolutely charming. We had a lovely room overlooking the beautiful courtyard. A renovated convent, the hotel's decor is simple and tasteful with nice touches of luxury. Stone walls and floors with beamed ceilings, high thread count linens, fluffy towels, robes, slippers, flat screen TVs, nightly turn-down service -- we were extremely comfortable and even a little pampered. Yes, the rooms are not large, but hotel rooms in most major cities are usually small. If you want a giant room, pay for a suite or spend your next vacation in Omaha. The continental breakfast was one of the best I've had in Italy. In addition to the traditional breads, pastries, cheeses and fruit, they also had bacon, eggs, and sausages. The pastries, in particular, were delightful. The staff was very charming and provided excellent restaurant recommendations, arranged car service for us, and met our every request. My one negative: no free WiFi or internet access in our room -- in this day and age, that's just simply unacceptable. Why hotels continue to charge guests for this very basic service is beyond me. In fact, most value-priced hotels offer free WiFi; It's insane to be charged 12 Euros a day for internet access. The only unfortunate experience during our stay was that we witnessed two different incidents where irate guests were berating the desk staff. The first was a gentleman who was clearly deeply disturbed and got \"all in up\" in the face of the desk person in charge, wagging a pen very close to the clerks eyes and shouting at him. The desk clerk remained very calm and polite, and handled the situation very well. The other incident involved another guest who had been given directions to a restaurant by the desk clerk only to arrive there and find it closed. By the time this guest returned to the hotel, the clerk was at dinner. The guest insisted the clerk return to the desk and apologize to him in person. Seriously? I don't know if either of these events were signs that something wasn't right with the service at the hotel (our service experience was outstanding) or that people are just plain crazy and arrogant. They reminded of us that we are all human, and even on vacation mistakes happen. And there is no excuse for being a jerk.

You also have the choice to sit outside in the courtyard to eat it which is great when the weather was as good as it was when we were there.

This means that it doesnt get any of the noise of the town area and remains peaceful and tranquil at all hours of the day.

Marble covers the floors and in certain areas baroque interior design is featured in such a way that we found ourselves taking pictures of the hotel as if it were a museum in its own right. Our room was newly renovated and large for Italy. There was a nice modern sink, bath, and shower. Our room was one of the few to feature a small terrace, and it was pure joy to awake to the sound of Rome`s churchbells though our open terrace doors. DCS has a great breakfast spread and a professional staff, and it has a beautiful interior garden in which to enjoy this breakfast. The garden is also a fine place to retire to in the evening with a bottle of wine after a long day of sightseeing. While DCS has no dinner restaurant of its own, it is located in bustling and authentic Trastevere which features a multitude of reasonably priced eateries. It takes about 15 minutes of walking to reach the Campo dei Fiori or the Colosseum from DCS, but it is certainly closer to the historic city center than all of the high priced/low charactered hotels by the Piazza Spagna. In short, we really enjoyed DCS and would love to return one day. It is a unique hotel in Rome`s most vibrant neighborhood, and I highly reccommend it. P.S.- for all those art/history buffs, Bramante`s famous Tempietto is literally just around the corner from DCS, tucked away in a Spanish church.", "Date": "September 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLove this hotel - calm relaxed atmosphere and great place to be!\u201d", "Author": "-OKMrEd-", "ReviewID": "UR76968367", "Content": "My young lady and I spent 3 nights in this hotel based solely on the feedback on Tripadvisor.

If you are a fish lover as are we then the excellent Antica Pesa is only metres away down the via Garibaldi and even better has a marvellous choice of superb Sicillian wines and to finish off a tempting choice of eighteen desserts. This dining spot is frequented mainly by locals and the understated entrance belies the quaintly decorated tardis like interior. Comfortably replete we retire to our hotel for a cool quiet nights sleep and then refreshed wake up and make our way down to sample the superb and ample choice of breakfast fare which we enjoy out in the main cloister garden.

The only explanation was some convoluted story about their computer system going down, though it was working when we arrived and they had a manual printout of our pre-paid reservation (as did we). They pretended not to be able to speak English as soon as I expressed dismay, though I then heard them speaking good English on the phone a few minutes later. We switched to French and I had to spend a great deal of time and energy getting them to put us up in a decent hotel nearby and refund us the difference in cost between the two hotels. I still doubt we got the real difference in cost because they refunded us the difference between what we paid them and what the other hotel cost on the Internet, and I'm sure that they got a discount on the room, but they would not reveal what they had paid, claiming they did not know what the room was costing them. At first they wanted to put us in hotel Ripa which is rated about 300 places lower than Camilla Savelli on Tripadvisor. When I said I refused to go to another hotel until we could use their computer and read about it on Tripadvisor, they shifted to saying \"oh no, we aren't putting you in Ripa, we're putting you in Trilussa Palace.\" We looked that up to find the rating (about 20 places beneath Savelli) and check the prices. The location is not nearly as nice as Savelli; it's on the main drag and quite far from the part of Trastevere where all the restaurants are. The manager apologized profusely and drove us to the hotel herself, but we are terribly disappointed that we are not staying in the special place we researched and booked in advance, and for no apparent reason. It also seems quite dishonest to be told on arrival that no room is available when we paid for it months ago and plenty of other guests were able to stay in the hotel. I'm not sure why this happened to us and not other guests; we arrived on the late side *6 pm* and are two women traveling together; or maybe there really was a computer glitch.

We were so glad we did; in fact, we are still congratulating ourselves for this decision. The hotel used to be a convent whose original architect was no less than Borromini! The renovation has managed to preserve the beautiful original details while allowing for a harmonious blend of modern conveniences and stylish comforts. Our room was spacious, sparkingly clean, and filled with light; it overlooked the beautiful interior courtyard and even had a view of St. Peter's in the distance! The AC worked beautifully and hummed quietly. The breakfast buffet was abundant in both quantity and variety and was very elegantly and brightly presented. Even more impressive are the public spaces: exquisite tiled corridors with arcaded spaces running in parallel where fauteuils are discreetly placed with magazines and daily newspapers for guests' use; ancient wide staircases with marble steps --but there are also lifts if one is so inclined! Gorgeous ancient water fountains and wall sculptures turning up in unexpected corners. As previous TA posts have noted, there is such a sense of tranquility at Hotel Donna Camillla Savelli, due in no small part to the 2 courtyards, one right after one leaves Via Garibaldi behind but before the reception office, and the other is interior and landscaped where breakfast is served. After a day of sightseeing, the Hotel really is an oasis to which one returns. We were lucky enough to be there at the time of mass and were able to see the magnificent chapel. We weren't just staying at a hotel; we were staying amidst the architectural splendor of baroque Rome! Service was absolutely top notch: quietly solicitous and helpful; straightforward restaurant recommendations and directions; reliable taxi reservations at very good and honest/uninflated rates (45 Euros to Fiumicino for 2 passengers). The location was perfect for us who wanted something on the quiet side. We ourselves like to walk everywhere, but for first-time visitors to Rome who may want to see the major sites at Piazza Navonna, the Coliseum, etc., it may be worth looking into bus or metro routes. Close to the Hotel are some fabulous restaurants: Antica Pesa is literally 20 steps away; Da I 2 Ciccioni is right behind the hotel, if one is after the trattoria experience; Antico Arco is a slightly longer walk up the hill. We opted for the newly opened Ristorante Minnetti which is just across the street and which is actually run by the daughter of Roberto Minnetti, himself behind the famous Ristorante Di Poggio Antico in Montalcino. In fact, the chef at Minnetti himself had come from Poggio Antico. All that we can say about our absolutely fabulous dinners at Minnetti is that we are now planning a trip to Poggio Antico in the near future! (And the service at Minnetti is very, very personal and warm, with very thoughtful recommendations and explanations.) In all, Hotel Donna Camilla Savelli is a very special place with an exquisite sense of space and history and with outstanding services. One will not be hounded by intrusive invitations for must-see tours of Rome or pre-arranged airport transfers for 70 Euros, etc.; instead, one will be looked after very warmly and with a refreshing touch of class.

It is conveniently located as long as you don't mind walking 15-20 minutes to the major attractions in Rome such as Vatican City, the Roman Forum and Colosseum and for another 5-10 minutes, the Spanish Steps. The area around Travestere is a little dirty and there is grafetti everywhere (also around the Pantheon and the Colosseum) The Hotel serves a very good buffet breakfast. The only hot food served was scrambled eggs and pancetta (bacon) and some type of sausage. The rest was several cold cereals, numerous pastries, yogurt, various sandwich meats and cheeses, some fruit (whole and cut up) and about 4 different types of breads and toast. They should consider offering more than just scrambled eggs in our opinion as you can get tired of that after 4 days. Since they have a kitchen available to them it would be wonderful if they started offerering sandwiches, etc...during the day for those times when you just don't want to go out. The room size was probably around 15' x 15'. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom is small but was absolutely one of the most beautiful marble bathrooms I've seen. The walk-in shower was terrific -- huge 8\" waterfall type showerhead. We had a beauitful window that overlooked the courtyard. You could open the window/shutters which was really nice in order to get the fresh air in as well as hear the many church bells that rang during the day and night.
