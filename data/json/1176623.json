When we stay in Orlando, we basically want a hotel for a base, store our stuff, sleep. We don't look for a place to hang around, and that is why this hotel is perfect. Rooms are basic and the norm - TV, fridge, table & chairs etc - but with a few things you wouldn't expect like free wi-fi (which was surprisingly excellent) and a very good safe. They were kept very clean during our stay, never had a problem with fresh sheets and towels. Facilities are great. Two big pools (didn't really use them but can imagine those with kids would love it), an excellent bar ($5 for a four pint pitcher, thank you very much), a handy shop etc. Never ate at the resturant but it looked fine to me. A few folks have mentioned it's no where near anywhere. Couldn't disagree more. Could maybe be an issue if you haven't got a car (although free shuttles are offered), but if you have a car you'll have no issue. About 10-20 minute drive to all the major parks. Near by there is a Target, a Publix (a very cheap and huge supermarket) and several places to eat for varying budgets. A few folks also seem to be very picky considering how much you are paying. This place is very cheap, and is worth every penny. Will be returning next year.

This is an old time resort right out the the 1970's. multiple 2 story buildings with Outside doors, and the big windows over an AC unit. The property shows its age, no matter how much effor is put in to keeping up appearances, think of that past-her-prime single lady at the bar with the over dyed hair, too much makeup, and a dress style that is 2 generations younger than her. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but know what you are getting going into the relationship and you will both be happier for it. More speciifcs - metal railings (which have been repainted) stilll show rust and corrosion in multiple places - watch running you hand under the hand rails. teh gates to the pools are not level and scrape teh conrete making a racket everytime they are opened - even worn grooves on teh concrete. the metal fencing around the pool not very sturdy or straight. the door to our room was hard to shut (had to use key even when leaving) and still had to really force it to close. The condensation from the AC unit made the carpet near the door damp. Just to give you quick idea of the age issues. On the plus side - the rooms were clean. I was a bit skeptical of the cleanliness and did a \"white socks\" test by rubbing feet across the carpet with the whitest socks i had on. they came up surprisingly clean. There was a suspect light stain on one sheet. bathroom was clean. Teh grounds, altough dated, were clean. The pools were clean,and there was not trash around the complex. It had some nicer amenities, like a kids playground, multiple pools and hottubs, a \"natural beach\" with paddle boats, plus ball fields. I would not go to this property specifically for these amenities, but could be a plus for the right person. Teh number one advantage to this property is price - it was CHEAP!!!!! we paid less that 40 per night. For a just a place to rest your head after a long day at the theme parks, it was a great value. It was evident that was what everyone did, because the place was empty all day but the parking lot was full late at night. Take this same property and place it in most other cities, and i'd very suspect of the clientele. but i never felt nervous with a sketchy crowd. In fact, mostly newer, nicer cars in teh lot, and no nefarious looking types were ever seen hanging around. It was about a 15 min drive from disney - even with traffic, but would be on teh wrong side of town to be convenient to sea world or universal. There are lots of stores and restaraunts very close by. In summary, if you are looking just for the cheapest, but safe and clean, place to rest your head after a long day at the theme parks, this is not a bad choice.

The bar was great, the meals were superb and I can't recommend the steak highly enough - a huge slab of meat for not a lot of money.

The transport to the theme parks was really straightforward (if rigid in timing) which was great, but if we wanted to go elsewhere it meant a lot of expensive taxi rides. It is worth considering before booking just how you plan to get to the places you want to visit. This location is great for Disney, but less so for Universal and the retail outlets.

The Champions Resort pushes my limits when it comes to where I am actually willing to sleep. Tired doesn't even beging to describe this place. (However, I don't believe one can give a bad review based solely on appearance.) I checked into my room and when I opened the door i was hit with the smell of a moldy wet towel. The room was saturated with the scent. It was totally overpowering and gross. As I ventured further into the room, it was just plain nasty, stained couch, marked up dresser.... As I went to climb into bed, I pulled off the duvet cover and found that the blanket underneath was merely the remnant of another blanket that had once existed. The satin border that it was obvious that the blanket once had, was cut off and the blanket was still being used! There were only two pillows provided. I will give them kuddos on the pillows, they were comfortable. However the beds were incredibly tiny! I am a small person there is no way a second person could have fit into the bed as well. The grounds of the hotel are incredibly shabby! While there are two pools, I felt that I would need a full round of vaccinations before I swam in either of them. Not to mention that the furniture by the pool was disgustingly filthy! You could not pay me to go anywhere near either of the pools! Speaking of outside, the real low point in my stay was seeing an employee push a stolen grocery cart from the Target store down the street as a utility cart around the grounds! This place was what nightmares are made of! No joke. While this hotel was incredibly nasty in appearance, it was evident how hard the housekeeping staff worked to make sure my room was clean.

I loved the heated pool and the patio area where you can just lay back and relax after a luxurious swim. I\"m definitely making this hotel a yearly stopover. The front desk staff provided excellent customer services,as well Margarita at night very helpful when we asked questions about tickets, breakfast, as well furnishing us with a taxi to the airport.

When we entered the lobby, we were greeted by two of the receptionists. They were very nice and quickly checked us in to our rooms. Upon getting to our room, we did find it clean. Yes, the rooms are dated but it met our basic needs - a clean place to sleep! You can tell that this is an older hotel by the decor, tv, carpet and squeaky beds. We did not find any types of bugs during our entire stay and the maid cleaned our room every day. The beds were kind of small and they do not seem to have any rooms with just one king bed so my husband and I shared a bed which seemed to be a full size - and was kind of squeaky and not as comfortable. The rooms also had a small microwave and mini fridge which are useful. What can I say about the Wi-Fi......a piece of crap. It took about 10 minutes just to get logged into the wifi and then we could not access anything else or it took about 10 minutes to change screens. My husband really needed the wifi because he is an online professor. The 2nd day, he finally went to the lobby and had no problems getting a connection and being able to do a little work. There are limited channels on the TV but the restaurant in the lobby had more channels including ESPN. They also do Karaoke Friday & Saturday nights, but we did not participate in that. One of the hotel guests also said their food was pretty good as well. The pool area looked nice but we did not go swimming during our stay. There is plenty of parking on the grounds.

The comforters and blankets on the beds were stained and appeared to be very worn out and old. I immediately removed them from the bed and placed them on the old stained couch, in this so-called \"Deluxe Room.\" Our room lock would not lock automatically at times and the extra security bolt was dangling on by one screw. When we called the front desk about the bolt and lock they said it would be taken care of, but in our 3-night visit it was not repaired. The grounds were not well maintained and the pools did not appear clean. We did not even venture in them because the water was not crystal clear and it was nearly impossible to see the bottom.

I'm presuming the room we stayed in was a refurbished one as almost everything looked new. The accommodation had a new beds, furniture and the paintwork throughout was spotless as though it had just been decorated. The bathroom looked new as there was no staining or anything anywhere. There was a sink unit in the bathroom and another just outside - handy when travelling with a family. The room facilities included a microwave, fridge, coffee maker, hairdryer, iron & ironing board and toiletries. We had maid service daily and the rooms were always clean and tidy when we returned from a day out. My only issue was the carpet, it was very rarely vacuumed and looked dirty. If it was vacuumed daily, I think it would help eliminate this issue, although I do think it was in need of a good clean. I have read a review on this site stating care needs to be taken with valuables due to theft by house keeping staff, we had no issues whatsoever with regard to this, in fact we had on a number of occasions left valuables and money on show and they were not touched. The covered pool was clean and heated, very welcoming and soothing after a day walking around theme parks (open 8am - 11pm). There is a further pool in another block also clean and heated, which is quieter than the covered pool. Reception staff were friendly and helpful, check-in smooth and quick, we had no issues. We did not use the hotel's restaurant, bar or shop so can't comment on this. We did use the laundry $2 per wash and $2 for the dryer. Handy if you're travelling with a family and not as much laundry to do once you're back home! We had a hire car so did not use any of the transport the hotel provides to the theme parks, so can't comment on this. There is a bus stop just outside the hotel which goes to all the attractions nearby and on International Drive, etc if you do not have your own transport. There are shops and places to eat nearby and some within a couple of minutes walking distance - Dominoes pizza, chinese buffet, MacDonalds, Walgreens, Seven Eleven. I would say though, a car is a must for quickness and ease for visiting anywhere in Orlando. The hotel grounds are a little sad - gardens could do with a bit of tender loving care. Surrounding area's are clean and tidy and we regularly saw hotel staff cleaning and tending the grounds but the hotel is old so walkways and stairwells are showing their age but there's nothing much the hotel can do about this. All in all, do not worry about the bad reviews. The hotel is being refurbished so if you are in an old room, ask to move to a better one! If you want the Ritz, go and pay the money.

The location is extremely useful for those with their own method of transport but if you don't plan on hiring a car you can still get around if you plan your journeys. From the hotel you can get the Linx bus to Walt Disney World but you have to change twice..it is only $2 though so well worth it. Or the hotel runs free shuttle buses, 2 there in the morning and 3 returning at night. Often we would get the return service at night but make our own way there in the morning using the bus route as it gave us chance to stop at local shops on the way and get some lunch. The hotel is a 5 minute bus ride from Walmart and in the other direction a short drive to many restaurants, mini golf sites and shops. You can also walk from the hotel to local stores such as Dominos, Subway, Pizza Hut, McDonalds, local amenities and a chinese takeaway too. We had just stayed in the All Star Resort at Disney for a week and in comparison to this hotel we found the rooms were very similar. (Although the price was a lot lower at this hotel) This room offered an included microwave, fridge, built in safe and dining table. The rooms were very large for the two of us. We even had a larger tv here with additional channels. The reason this hotel doesn't get top marks is for a few reasons.. The hotel felt unsafe, it felt very like the motels you see on the American horror movies.. The pool was rather neglected; we never saw anyone in it. The hotel was very quiet with not many guests walking around and so felt a little discomforting. The view from our room was of a car park and busy road. The men who drove the shuttle services didn't speak very good English and so often we were unsure of where we were going and if we were on the right service. The maid would often knock on the door despite us requesting no room service. And finally the rooms felt a little unclean, we changed rooms on the 2nd day as ours smelt very strongly of tobacco. A cockroach even fell out of the air vent one night which made the place a little frightening to stay in for me. I wouldn't really recommend this hotel to families with children but if you have you're own car and you just want somewhere cheap to stay if you're visiting Disney or I-Drive then this hotel is perfect.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNEVER COMING BACK!\u201d", "Author": "kcmyers13", "ReviewID": "UR116679644", "Content": "This hotel is old, rundown, in definite need of remodeling and didn't allow a good portion of their amenities to be used.

Finally when he did make it back to the car he told me he was in there arguering with them because they said we didn't have a reservation for June 18th but showed one for June 22nd. So my husband mind you is from the islands and he can have a short fuse if someone continues to tell him something that is not true like WE DON'T HAVE A RESERVATION FOR YOU. Now mind you we didn't book on priceline, expedia or hotels.com we booked directly from there website. After my husband spent way to much time talking to clerk she went to get a reservation staff in the back that came and said WE DON'T HAVE A RESERVATION FOR YOU TO CHECK IN ON JUNE 18TH. Needless to say my husband in now asking for a manager, however, the manager will not be in till 6am tomorrow morning and we are here at 9pm at night. Well my husband gave her the confirmation numbers from there website and she said she couldn't pull that up.........WHAT?????? Ok my husband explaing to lady look we tired you need to go call for a manager because we have already paid and not paying twice. The reservation lady told my husband I'm going to prove to you there is no reservation, she went back and checked name and confirmation number again and guess what LOW AND BEHOLD, our reservation is there. The reservation lady proceeds to come back and tell my husband she found it with no apology or nothing. For all the time my husband spent talking to them he asked for an upgraded room with pool view, with microwave and refrigerator, due to all the problems reservations lady said done, no problem. When he gets back to the care I asked what was the problem and he began to explain. We finally get to our room, that was pool side, with microwave and refrigerator but low and behold once you walk in the room the SMELL IT WAS A VERY HORRIBLE MUSTY MUSTY MUSTY ODOR.

We unpacked and went up the road to eat, got back to room showered, now the bathroom was ok........it was clean we had two sinks which helped out alot, however once we showered and got into bed we went to sleep this was day one at the so called resort.

Now I'm wondering what's going on. Days has turned to nights and the next morning woke up with bumps all over my legs..........BED BUGS BED BUGS BED BUGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my gosh it was horrible, I read some reviews that said the same thing.......but I'm here to tell you the BED BUGS ARE THERE!!! There's only two good comments for this MOTEL, they give you free WI FI and they had two sinks that's about it. So people stay here at your own Risk!!!! Remember if you decide to stay stop off at the Target that you are going to past and pick you up a large can of LYSOL and spray comforters, the raggedly blanks and sheets supposedly that smoothers bed bugs!!!!

When you come to this area, most people don't live in their hotel, and if you do you might as well just stay home. We had a poolside room on Block E, which was separate from the main part, which was fine with me. The pool and hot-tub were just a few feet from our door. They close both daily around 11:30 pm so noise was not an issue. The ice machine worked great and was just around the corner from our room. Our room was very clean and bright, even the carpeting..never had to worry about dirty feet the entire time, and had a fridge and microwave as I requested. The cable for the tv was not the best, but we weren't there to watch tv...and it is near impossible to get wifi. That really didn't bother me, cause I was with my teenage daughter and this was our last vacation before she leaves for University in september, so we had lots of quality time together... The beds were very comfortable and the rooms cleaned daily. This is the first hotel I have ever stayed in where the pillows were actually like real pillows...not just 1/2 stuffed, even fresh towels every day.

We never used the restaurant or bar during our stay as we were out early every day. The location is great, lots of restaurants, shops and activities just down the strip. We never used the shuttle as we rented a car so we had the freedom to go wherever, when ever...so I cannot comment on that.

All the security disclaimers that we signed at check-in should have tipped us off to the safety of the area. We did not feel comfortable leaving anything of value in the room and would basically repack every morning. Bed linens were awful but there were plenty of pubic hairs included at no extra charge. Cable TV did not work but was promptly fixed after a call to the desk. at 11 pm. No such luck with the internet. Carpet was so filthy, I would not go without shoes or socks. Apparently the residents before us enjoyed Cheetos because many were left behind. The building that our room was house in was not part of the original property. In fact the front of our building had all the windows broken out and the back part of the building was deserted and very run down. The FREE SHUTTLE to Disney World is a joke.

Our room was on the back side of the property, and I was scared to even go out to my car without my husband, as the parking lot was poorly lit and was run down. The doorframe to our room was bent and looked like someone had tried to break in before. The TV was fuzzy with very poor reception and had only a few channels. There was hair in the shower and the ceiling tiles were crumbling. The carpet was dirty and the room overall looked dingy with few lights that worked. I have stayed in Motel 6's that were nicer and where I felt safer. The ice machines did not work, and the wi-fi would only work when sitting in the front lobby. The pools and hot tub were about the only enjoyable part of our stay. Needless to say, we spent as little time as possible in the room and a lot of time touring the area!

However, I think that in this case, it is important for people considering a stay at Champions to read this. I arrived at Champions at 12:30 hoping for an early check in. The Agent informed that I would not be able to check in since there were no rooms available and it was before the scheduled check-in time. I informed him that I would have to cancel the reservation and go elsewhere as I was sure there were hotels with vacancy nearby that would appreciate my business. He then immediately gave me a room key. So, I was of course happy to be checking in 2 hours early, but I was also left with a sour taste that this man lied to my face. I then brought my luggage to the room, turned down the thermostat since it read 79, and went to explore the property. The grounds were very nice. Everything was clean, and the pool area was inviting. Upon return to my room, things went a bit downhill. I turned on the light in the bathroom and found 2 cockroaches in the tub. Then I checked the thermostat, and even though I turned it down, it now read 80 degrees. I gave it another 20 minutes to see if it would cool down, and it didn't. Oddly enough, I didn't hear or feel any air coming out of the vent. At that point I had enough. I told the front desk agent I'd like a refund. She asked me why. I told her the air conditioning wasn't working and they had bugs in the room. She offered to get the room looked at. I said no thank you, I'll be going elsewhere. Since it was a 3 night stay, I would expect a full refund for all 3 nights. She only offered a refund for 2 nights. A refund that I have not seen post to my account, even though it has been 6 days. Obviously I find it offensive that this place wants me to pay them when they initially lied to me, gave me a room with cockroaches, and a non working a/c unit. I afforded them the opportunity to make things right, but now that it has been a week and I still haven't seen any refund, I find in necessary to let others know what kind of a business they run. It's really too bad, because I liked the property, the rooms look nice, and the location is great.

I did call the front desk at 10pm since it was so loud I couldn't even sleep with earplugs. They sent security over right away and the noise by the pool died down shortly thereafter. At 12 o'clock at night I could still hear the people above us banging around while I had earplugs in, but I didn't call security for that.

Our room opened straight into the carpark area, which some teenagers were loitering in when we arrived. Every time anybody pulls up in the carpark, we could hear it, anytime anybody walks past talking, we could hear it, loud and clear. The room was very basic, good size fridge, microwave. The bed was very comfortable, and the TV had a good selection of channels. The bathroom looked quite dirty, stains on the bottom of the bath, filthy sink and plugs etc. But we were there to spend our days at disney, and it was a cheap hotel, so weren't too fussed. Halfway through our holiday, we were awoken at 2am by a man being arrested directly outside our room. We ended up being evacuated from our rooms due to their being a 'meth lab' 2 doors down, and were not able to return till 8.30am. (Search Champions world resort drugs on google etc.) We also noticed that a room across the carpark had its window smashed which wasn't a great sight. The hotel is on the bus route if you decide to use the LYNX buses, as the free hotel transfer was too overcrowded and not often enough. a daypass is $4.50 for the bus, and the bus drivers are all willing to help you find your way. As we checked out on the last day we were faced with a $159 phone bill, however we only made 2 complete calls. We were told that if it rings 3 times it will charge you, however there was a call on the bill that only 4 numbers had been dialed, (so it couldn't have rang) and we had been charged $14.40. The manager reluctantly removed it from the bill. SO I would advise against using the hotel phone. The hotel has 2 swimming pools and a hot tub, which we used one day, and did enjoy. Overall, the hotel isn't great, but I guess you get what you pay for, and we didn't pay much.

We didn't get a credit for that night, but I absolutely wouldn't expect any resort to do that with such short notice. Anyway, we requested a room by the pool when we made our reservation and ended up by their second pool...it was great because the pool was literally right outside our door. It was sort of odd because it almost felt like we were in an entirely different hotel from where we checked in, but it was just fine. The thing is, when you stay here, you cannot go there expecting it to be a 5-star resort, because it is not. You cannot expect to get shown to your room or to have someone help with your luggage. If you want that kind of service, you're going to have to pay more than what they charge here. The room had 2 double beds and there was lots of floor space...very roomy. The toilet and bathtub were separate from the sink/mirror so someone could still be getting ready while another person was in the shower. Lots of space to hang clothes too. I was also VERY impressed with their quality of towels, nice and thick!

The shower and sink water would only come out scorching towards the end of our holiday (please beware of this with children, the water was boiling temperature, it burnt the colour off of the sponge that was hung in the shower. after 10 minutes of trying, if we were lucky we would get a cold water coming out. this was the same with the sink, therefore we could not refill our water bottles which was annoying. there is a microwave and fridge in the room which was useful. i cannot comment on the restuarant/gym/pools as we did not use any of these. but the covered pool always looked busy so im guessing it was OK! although we looked at the restaurant menu one night and it looked very limited. shuttle services to the parks were always prompt, friendly, helpful. they pick up at 3 more hotels though, so can get really crowded and hot. but they're free, so can't complain. information available in reception for parks/buses/directions is helpful, can find all park maps and stuff there. Most reception staff were helpful, but there were a few unfriendly, snappy ones. one day when our room card key wouldnt work and we needed to get our bags before getting on the park shuttle we were asked 'why we needed to go back to our room' 'what our bags were for, why we needed them'. this was annoying, as we only had 2 minutes before the shuttle left and were facing an inquision! Across the road there is a chinese buffet (walked in then out, food looked greasy) there is also a dominos and pizza hut, pharmacy and a chinese takeaway. we made use of the dominos and pizza hut most nights! ok, so the one HUGE problem we had throughout our stay was with the phone in the room. In the room above us, we had an hotel employee named Michael. the phone lines had 'somehow' been crossed and we recieved a call one morning (6am!) asking for michael. we simply thought this was a guest who had rung our room by mistake and forgot about it and went back to sleep. we recieved these calls every morning for the last 5 days of our stay. they were at 6am, 7am, 8am, sometimes 3 in one morning. after complaining over the phone, telling them they'd got the wrong room, and then officially complaining to the reception who apologised and said they'd fix it, THEY CONTINUED! we even got messages left on the phone for Michael, from other employees, talking rudely about other guests at the hotel! not nice! two days before we left, the phone rung, as usual at 6am asking for michael, i was so mad and frustrated at being woken up AGAIN, that i shouted at them and told them that this was not his room and that i was very 'pissed off'. i guess then, they got off their arses and knocked on his door if they wanted him, as on our last day they didnt ring (yay.) the only other complaint was, it was my boyfriends birthday during our stay and i asked at reception where i could purchase a cake (this was my first time in orlando) i was told the restaurant could help me out. the restaurant manager wasnt there, i was asked to write a note and put it in an envelope and it would be given to him. i got no reply, no cake. obviously not bothered about enhancing their guests stay. check out was: 'were checking out' .. 'ok, your bill is..' they didnt ask if we had enjoyed our stay, if we'd had a good time ect.. overall, good cheap base for visiting theme parks, but i did not recieve any exceptional customer service here.", "Date": "April 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Casselberry, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Time\u201d", "Author": "Soregood", "ReviewID": "UR104409438", "Content": "After reading some of the other reviews we were not sure about staying here.

The hotel has several pools but we mainly used the covered pool, which was beautifully clean, as warm as a bath, open until 11pm and a good way to relax after a hectic day at Disney.

The bar is kid friendly and has events most nights (live music, quiz, karaoke etc.) it also serves food (including a kids menu) until 10pm, which is handy when returning from Disney late in the evening. They are not expensive and have special drinks promotions. The staff are lovely and really made a fuss of my 7 year old daughter. The restaurant also serves breakfast - you can choose from a continental through to a full buffet style - we ate there a few times. Within 5 minutes walking distance of the hotel there is a lovely Italian restaurant called Brunos (also has a great kids menu), a buffet style chinese restaurant, Subway, Dominos Pizzas, Pizza Hut, McDonalds and a Seven Eleven shop.

This was great for us but I'd imagine that in the summer they would run additional services.

The food is very good, they make a lot from scratch, the taco salad bowl is homemade and was great! We were there 2 nights and I would say again. We didn't go in the pool however there were a few people in the one evening and the pool looked really nice. I don't usually write reviews but because I was so afraid after reading some of the reviews before we went I want to ease the minds of those that may be thinking of booking a room. I noticed another row of empty rooms and was told those will be renovated in the future and will then be booked also. I could see that anyone that stayed before renovation would have a problem as I do think the old rooms would have been in bad shape. Nice place, as I said, I would stay again. Hope this helps anyone with a reservation. The beds were new and comfortable also.", "Date": "February 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGo to the lounge and you'll see ...ask for Pam or jonh best customer services ever there just there....and ...great pools.\u201d", "Author": "dionnyspily", "ReviewID": "UR98296965", "Content": "Get the price on line or call do not walk on in ..

One was not immediately available but we were told to come back after noon. There was still not one available. We asked the next day and a different front desk person (this time male not female) said one was not available but \"let's see what I can do\". He did his computer thing and switches some things around and we got a great ground floor room by the pool. So, sometimes it is not the hotel but who is at the desk that counts. We stayed 14 days and found the staff very friendly and helpful (except for the 1st female desk person we encountered). We stayed around the hotel for 4 of the 14 days and just used the pool which felt like a warm to hot bath. The spa was great and the one time it was not very hot they fixed it within the hour. We used the laundry twice and it was not very expensive with quite a few machines. We did not have to wait either time. Yes we could complain about the noise outside, but that was just kids having fun and if we wanted quiet we would not have chosen a room by the pool. We could complain about them closing down the pool when the bacteria count got to high but they treated it and reopened by the next morning and this is better than making us sick from the pool. I read the reviews before we left and found most of the complaints had no validity. You can not blame the hotel for the weather or guests noise or attitude or behavior. So all I can say is all the staff were friendly and most were helpful. The rooms were clean, the towels were fluffy. The price was certainly right. The hotel is not fancy but neither is the price and from my point of view we got much more than we paid for.", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDo not consider it\u201d", "Author": "marieanddon", "ReviewID": "UR97671789", "Content": "Stayed only because part of holiday package.

We can proof that we didn't booked that hotel because we check-in miles away in another hotel.

We have stayed in many hotels and motels in Florida for the last 20 years and can honestly say this was by far THE WORST - Do not stay here. Room had no fridge, we had to ask twice on first day . Safe closed shut so unable to use it. Hairdryer did not work right, had to hold button in and it was crackling so not safe to use. The noise here is horrendous, there are hundreds of kids in all three pools, and running along the walkways until the early hours. The few parents we saw seemed to be mexicans or cubans shouting to one another across the complex. Doors banging and kids/people screaming until 3.17am and then started again at 5.00am. The health authority closed the jacuzzi/ spa as notice said it not good for our health! No wonder, the spa and pools were never closed for cleaning etc. We told the reception we were checking out for a few days ( to get some peace ) and asked them to leave the fridge ( which we eventually got delivered ) in our room. Came back after a week hoping all the kids had gone home, and found place was even worse. Someone had also removed the fridge again ! Complained to reception and was told one would be brought back up ( never arrived so nothing to keep food and drink cool ) Came back to room later on to find the card not opening door. husband went to ask twice for another and they didnt work either. Eventually they sent a man to take lock off which took him an hour with my husband helping him. Tried sleeping there again but it was an absolute hellhole with all the noise. After 2 hours sleep I went to reception to complain and told them we were checking out for good as the place was terrible. Asked what happened to the fridge and was told they were still looking for one ( after 24 hours ! ) I told her no-one should have removed it in the first place as we were paying for the room etc. The stuff in room was old and odour not pleasant. Never offered us a refund so told her, the place was a terrible dump and we were going to find a decent place.

Our favorite hotel was not available for our new travel dates, of course, so I logged on to travelocity and prayed. I found several hotels in my price range, which is budget, and then logged on over to TripAdvisor to compare the reviews. Champions World Resort had the best reviews of my selections and so I called and booked it. Since I don't rent a car, the hotel I use has to have shuttles to the Disney Parks, Seaworld Parks, and Universal. Our 10 day vacation got cut to 7 days with the new flight arrangements and the girls, my daughter, her best friend, and granddaughter were already dissappointed. I wanted to find a hotel they would enjoy, with a pool, gameroom, playground, etc. Champions had all of the above. Since I have to hire a ride from the airport to the hotel I inquired of Champions if they had a service for airport arrivals. They had me call a local service that they use that gives Champion's guests a discount. Of course I shopped around, and the rate by USA Tours that Champion told me about were the lowest, about $20 less per trip. I was very pleased by that even before we arrived. Our poolside room had a microwave and fridge, and that was great! Plus, it overlooked the covered pool. The girls barely dragged their suitcased into the room before changing and heading out to the pool! They had a great time, and even got to swim one warm day that was too rainy for the parks. The room was clean and cozy, although a bit old. The beds were comfy and the coffee maker worked. I was very happy! The lobby had a diningroom that offered a very reasonable breakfast buffet with kids free. It was quick and convenient for the days we were going to the parks and the coffee was very good. I got a cup to go most mornings for the shuttle ride. The shuttle to the various parks is such a convenience, and a must for me as I don' t rent a car. It saves a ton of money! It was always exactly on time! The ride to the parks was about a half hour each way. The lobby also had a little store with pre-packaged foods and snacks, milk ,etc. And thank goodness, razors, for 25c each. The girls did not bring razors and they planned to sunbathe at Aquatica so it was a minor crisis averted. I was able to log on to the free wifi on my laptop with no problem, but it was a bit slower than I am used to. The staff was amazing! Rodrigo, who was in the lobby most nights and answered the phones was always friendly and helpful when I called about shuttle times, pizza delivery, quarters for the onsite laundry room, etc. The gentleman who worked in the lobby store was helpful with restaurant suggestions and came to the rescue with shampoo and the 25c razors! There is Dominos and Subway right across the road, and a gift shop next door. For not having a rental car the location was quite nice with everything we need a quick walk away. The girls loved Champions and had a great time. I would definately return again for the price and the service!", "Date": "March 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlington, VA", "Title": "\u201cPlace is a dump\u201d", "Author": "fawlcon", "ReviewID": "UR58043457", "Content": "Spots of mold in room & bathroom.

We decided that was the responsibility of this hotel and we called the front desk instead. This was after 2 hours of not being able to get our children or ourselves to sleep. After approximately another hour of these very loud people outside our room, someone finally showed up to request that they quiet down. I can only assume we were not the only ones who complained. Yes, this was a less expensive place to stay but not worth the aggravations and everyone in our party being exhausted the next day.

But do not avoid this property because of the price, it is a true value compared to other hotels in the Central Florida area I have found priced between $20 and $30. While there we notice larges patches of dirt everywhere. Areas which probably were once home to nice green lawns and some pretty bushes and shrubs. Overnight someone places dozens of plants and bushes in the patches of dirt; this showed us that Champions World Resort is working on improving their resort instead of watching it decay away like so many other dated hotels along 192. Surprisingly to us, the hotel room was extremely roomy. We have traveled a lot to the Orlando area recently and Champions Gate World Resort was one of the largest rooms we have had yet for a standard hotel room. Even the bathroom, which sometimes seems like a jail cell in some hotels, was rather big and did not feel cramped at all. While on the topic of the bath room, one of the only complaints I had of the resort was the complexity of adjusting the knobs in the bath tub. It took a few tries before I was able to have a nice warm shower without it being extremely freezing or overly hot. The room its self was a standard hotel room complete with the chest of drawers, television, coffee maker, iron, table and two chairs. Even with these items in the room there was still lots of space allowing for lots of mobility in the hotel room. The hotel features three pools on the premises, the largest being the covered pool located next to the main building. During winter we were told this pool is a heated pool, but since it was the summer/ fall time it was somewhat chilly seeing how no sunlight ever hit the pool due to its location under the large covering. Next to the covered pool is a children\u2019s pool. There is nothing special about these pools, no water slides, no water sprayers, they are just pool, but those looking for a bargain hotel are probably willing to sacrifice amenities such as those in order to secure a hotel room for sometimes under $25 a night. The other two pool are located in different areas of the property, one even includes a hotel tub which we did not visit on this trip. The other pools are your standard rectangular pool with plenty of lounge chairs circling the pool. The pool we visited had an area for an outdoors bar which looked like it had not been used since the Village People scored their last #1 hit back in the 1970\u2019s which was a shame. My fianc\u00e9 made a note of how even more awesome the resort would be if they had the pool bad open and served drinks for the guests. Perhaps in the future they will because it was very apparent there were lots of renovations taking place all over the property. Speaking of the property, the over grounds looked somewhat dilapidated but as we mentioned, it was obvious they were in the midst of improving the over look of the hotel with new landscaping, renovations taking place in several of the building. Give this resort some time and the end result could make for a nice, rather affordable place to stay. While Champion\u2019s World Resort calls itself a resort, it lacked many of the amenities one would find in a Central Florida resort including a gym, tennis courts, scheduled activities, children\u2019s areas, and an arcade. Maybe over time these resort amenities will be added but for now, Champions World Resorts lacks the above listed items to truly call itself a resort. The $3 Resort fee guest pay seems to only include use of the pool and free internet while visiting the property, which is a bargain since many other resorts in the Central Florida area charge sometimes over $20 a night for Internet and do not have that many options for their pools in the event they become over crowded at one. The Restaurant/bar area was above average compared to some mid-ranged hotel in the area. They seemed to always have drink specials and the restaurant looked somewhat like a Denny\u2019s overlooking their covered pool area. The Lobby area was extremely nice and it was apparent that this was one of the first areas that was remodeled when it was reopened as Champions World Resort. Beware of the people in the area trying to pressure you into seeing time shares though. While they are aggressive, one no is all it took for them to leave us alone. Perhaps the biggest draw back of Champions World Resort is their location. It is approximately 7 miles from the back entrance to Disney World and close to 10 miles from I-4. The drive to and from the hotel could get old very quickly for the vacationer staying for more than one night at Champions World Resort even though it is a comfortable and affordable place to stay. If you are on a strict budget and do have a car accessible to you or do not mind traveling to the theme parks based on the bus times they provide for you (yes, they do offer complementary bus service to all the theme parks) then the distance can be overlooked seeing how there are several places to eat in the mornings and evenings within walking distance of the hotel. In conclusion, Champions World Resort is definitely a work in progress. While other out-dated Orlando area hotels charge a relatively small fee for their rooms, you usually get what you paid for (dirty rooms, noisy neighbors, rude staff) but not at Champions World Resort. If you can overlook the distance from the attractions, you will easily find one of the most affordable and comfortable thrifty hotels in the Central Florida area, just do not expect a Disney style resort when you stay at Champions World Resort.", "Date": "September 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lincolnshire", "Title": "\u201cShould be minus 3*!!\u201d", "Author": "Sophie15", "ReviewID": "UR39841235", "Content": "This hotel has to be one of the worst places I have ever seen.

While there were a few things that irritated me they were minor, but the overall stay was nice and the kids truly enjoyed the 3 pools onsite. The check in process was smooth as we arrived early and was able to check in at noon versus 3pm which was a definite plus for us...so we truly thank Champions for that convenience. The few things I didn't like was the fact that you basically get harassed by folks trying to sell you timeshares in exchange for $75-$100 if you sit through a 90 minute presentation. Now in my opinion...if that was something I was in too fine, but most folks on vacation don't want people HARASSING them to sit for 90 minutes for $75-$100...we're on vacation and would like to enjoy it, so this little service they can do away with. Another thing that I didn't like was having to pay for internet $3.00/3 minutes and $0.39/cent each additional minute and if you want to print anything its $1.00/page, so using the internet for 3 minutes to print boarding passes cost me $5.02...again...something minor but something I didn't like and think they need to upgrade immediately. The staff was courteous and helpful which was a plus and really went out of their way to help make your stay enjoyable.

I arrive mid-afternoon and check out around 8:30 Sunday morning. The first time I stayed there, I chose it because of location (it was in an area with which I was somewhat familiar and I did not have to depart from it in order to get back on my route) and appearance. Going to the counter to inquire about a room that first time, I met Juan Carlos who was the soul of accommodation and hospitality. Since I stay there alone, I prefer a room near the front so I am not in a remote area and he always sees to that. (Now they all do.) Subsequently, in addition to Juan Carlos, I have had the pleasure of meeting and being helped by, Eurina, Rodrigo, Luis, Haley, and most recently, Jenny Vasquez (and when I have actually called ahead for a reservation, Shirley and I believe, Myra). In December I had foot surgery and when I was allowed to get the surgical site wet but not yet stand on my foot, I asked for 101, a handicapped room with a bench in the shower and was also given that room subsequently while my foot was healing. I very much appreciated that extra consideration. Many places of business have a slogan; some fit and some don\u2019t. \u201cWelcome home\u201d certainly fits your place. When I walk in the door, since I am there so frequently, Juan Carlos sometimes calls across the lobby, Welcome home, Madam. He said that since I am there so often, when I walk in the door, I should just say, Juan Carlos, my key, please! Sometimes I have done so in fun. We initially choose the places where we do business on the basis of different things. Sometimes it is location; sometimes it is service; sometimes it is price. But after the initial visit or contact, whatever the place of business, it is the employees, the staff, who determine if the customer or client will return. It is the people who make the difference. I have driven extra miles to go to another branch of my bank to avoid the personnel at the branch nearer me and to go to the other one where I prefer the attitude of the personnel there. Both branches of the bank provide the same services but it is the personnel of the one which cause me to forego one and choose the other, farther away. Your facility is beautiful, wonderfully and conveniently located for me; also very important, I feel secure there; I have appreciated the rate I have enjoyed; but more than all of that, I appreciate those I have named above. They are definite assets because there (just as they were when it was Howard Johnson\u2019s) they are the face and the Spirit of Champions World Resort and they represent it well. They are the ones we see; they are the ones who make the difference. You should be very proud of them and appreciate them greatly. Sincerely, A.

On arrival the receptionist requested a credit card deposit - we declined becasue we had prepaid holiday and would not use in room telephone. the receptionist accepted this. Our room overlooked the covered swiming pool and had a fridge which was excellent. Rooms cleaned everyday and towels changed daily. Excellent - yes but the rooms are not cleaned properly and lots of dirt and grime arround the walls and floor covering, which made us feel really unclean. The pools are excellent but the pool areas, grounds and stairwells should be cleaned as the hotel grounds really are filthy. One note of caution - a rancoon (yes that is what the other guest told us was the name of this strange creature with a pointed nose) was scavaging around usually after 11pm - I was scared as not used to such animal in the UK, a cat was also walking around the grounds and we were not sure if this was the hotel pet or stray - so quite frighting. The guest who had pets ensured their animals where carefully attended to. In summary, the hotel is an ideal location and parking is free, we only spend 1 day in the hotel and was quite bored but my daughter loved the covered swinming pool. It is very good value and I think it would be cheaper to book indpendant from a travel company. Also, witht he money saved one good do more shopping and also have a holiday somewhere else. We would return to this hotel but only if 1. we were guaranteed a room overlooking the covered swiming pool and on the top floor ( crawlies are reported to occupy the ground floor rooms). 2.
