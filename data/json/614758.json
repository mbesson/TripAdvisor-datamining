I had never stayed there before so I was just going by the reviews that I had seen on Tripadvisor. I seen that there were mixed reviews so I deceided to stay there based on the cost of the room and the close proximity to the downtown area. Upon check-in, the young lady at the front desk informed me at 10:00 a.m. that the room was not ready. My flight had got into memphis early a.m. so I was hoping that a room was available. When I asked if the hotel was completely sold out (6 cars total in the entire parking lot, and one of them was mine) she unkindly said yes, which was hard, if not impossible, to believe. I asked if there was any one else I could speak to and she called the shift manager. I spoke to her and she kindly said that she would get me a room immediately, which she did. (duh?) What's up with that, \"unfriendly girl at the front desk\"? Nice intoduction! Yeah you, the one with no personality. At any rate, after the rocky start, I found my room that was unbelieveably clean and quiet at night. No noise which means a lot to travelers, especially me. I stayed there for 3 nights over Labor Day weekend. No problems at all, except for that small hiccup on the first day. The other staff members, except for Miss Congeniality on the 1st day at the front desk, were very helpful. There was a small fitness center with a treadmill, etc and a business center with one computer. The breakfast is nothing to write home about. Waffle maker, yogurt, bread for toast, bulk cereal, watered-down undrinkable orange juice, etc. Very, very basic. They could do better in the breakfast department. But then again, I didn't stay there because of the breakfast so this was just information for future guests. Overall, I would rate this hotel a 6 out of ten. I'm just glad that the other employees at the hotel weren't nearly as unpleasant and uncaring as the 1st one I encountered at the front desk. Recommend for close proximity to town. Not as bad of an area location as a previous reviewers portrayed. Recommend for quiet. Not recommended for breakfast. Go somewhere else. And last recommendation to Hotel Gen-X. Please consider sending front desk girl to customer relation class. Nobody want's to be greeted like that. Thank you.

We both had made reservations to stay at the hotel with our family during the 4th of July holiday weekend. I had made reservations for three rooms for a three night stay. My cousin proceeded to tell me that the desk clerk at the Best Western was very unfriendly, the sofas in the lounge were dirty, the hotel smelled like mildew and paint, the hotel was located in an unsafe area and she was hesitant about staying one night in the place. She further stated that the desk clerk refused to cancel our reservations because of their 24 hour cancellation policy. Neither one of us were informed about their policy when we made our reservations. After we finished our conversation, I immediately called Best Western\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s customer service line to plead our case, but again our request was denied. Eventually my cousin decided to call one of our uncles to pick her up until I arrived in town. When I arrived at the hotel my family and I checked in because at that point we had no choice. I still had three rooms reserved on my credit card at $119 per night and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t relish the idea of paying over $600 for rooms we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even stay in. A couple hours later my mom, my brother and my nephews arrived at the hotel and they also refused to stay at the hotel because they were concerned about the location and the cleanest of the hotel. Instead they checked in at the Holiday Inn located on 3700 Central Ave., in Memphis for the same rate I was paying at the Best Western, so my husband and I agreed to join them with our kids the following morning. At the Best Western, the carpet in our room was dirty, one of the walls had stains on them, the wall paper around the window was peeling, the furniture in the room was extremely dusty and my daughter discovered black foot prints in the bathtub, so much for southern hospitality. This hotel was truly a dumpster dive. My cousin and I were both deceived by the pictures of the hotel on the internet. When I woke up the next morning I immediately went downstairs to check on my car while my family slept. To my horror, the front passenger window had been broken out and glass was everywhere. Then I noticed that van that was parked next to my car also had a broken window. This should have never happened because both cars were parked in a well lit area and close to the building. Furthermore, the parking lot was small, both vehicles were parked in the direct view of the security cameras, and a night attendant was on duty. I checked my car to see if anything was taken. A few items were stolen from both vehicles, but nothing that couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be easily replaced (i.e., dvds, tapes,). When I reported the incidents to the night clerk, she claimed she was unaware of what had transpired that night. Someone please tell me what was the purpose of the hotel security cameras? Later on I found out that a third car had been broken into and possibly more vehicles. This particular vehicle was sitting in the parking lot less than 50 ft. away from the front office and once again it was in a well lit area. So, when I asked the night clerk had she notify the other guests concerning their vehicles, the night attendant stated she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know which guests owned the vehicles. Imagine their surprise when they eventually saw their cars. I found it quite odd that the hotel didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t record the car tag and driver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s license number of their guests when they checked into the hotel. Maybe I am wrong, but I thought this was a standard practice at most hotels and motels around the U.S. today especially during this post 911 era at least it use to be. When I spoke to the manager that morning, she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem at all surprised about what had happened to my car nor did she seem to care about my family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current predicament. In fact, she was very cold and totally removed from the entire situation. However, she did agree to refund me for one of the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on my credit card. So while my husband was cleaning out the glass of our rental car (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Thank GOD we have GEICO insurance!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) I gave the staff at the hotel a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153HUGE!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd piece of my mind and I proceeded to tell every guest at the hotel about our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153WONDERFUL!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd stay at the Best Western. Fortunately, I was able persuade several customers (10+) from staying at that hotel. At the end, I felt slightly vindicated even though I lost all of my cool points for the day. Later my husband told me that the people who worked in the building behind the hotel informed him that our incident was not uncommon at this hotel. In fact, guests were often robbed at this hotel. Furthermore, the building that was located on the right rear side of the hotel was a crack house. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how true this latter statement was, but I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprise. The building did look suspicious. On another note, the company that I had rented our car from was Budget Car Rental. When I called the company to report the incident they were very friendly and understanding. We were able to trade the Nissan Sentra in for a Jeep Compass without any additional charges. The SUV had excellent gas mileage for a vehicle of its size. So after our ordeal we checked in at the Holiday Inn where the rest of my family was staying. The rooms were extremely clean, the hotel was in a safe area and the staff was very helpful and friendly. Best Western should really take a lesson from Holiday Inn. Later that evening, I called customer service at Best Western\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters to report the entire incident. They finally removed all of the charges off my credit card, but not from my cousin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit card. This really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make any sense to me because everyone that I told our story to at the hotel canceled their reservations and the charges were immediately removed from their credit cards even without a 24 hour notice, this is definitely double standards. Customer service at Best Western further stated that the hotel in Memphis would be given 7 days to correct all of complaints that we filed against them. Will they improve the quality of services they provide their customers at this location? Who knows, but one thing I do know for sure is that my family will never, ever, ever stay in the Best Western on Madison Avenue in Memphis, Tennessee again. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hats off to Holiday Inn!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jackson, Mississippi", "Title": "\u201cOne of the worst BW, we have stayed at.\u201d", "Author": "krzyvern", "ReviewID": "UR114840354", "Content": "This is a very small hotel.

The sheets were 100% thick cotton (this is important to me!) and the rest of the bed linens were natural fiber as well, no unpleasant polyester here! The beds were very comfortable, with fluffy nice pillows. Both the room and the bathroom were spotless. I consider myself to be an expert in this area, as I used to work as a housekeeper at a hotel myself. I even checked the baseboards behind the beds - not a speck of dust! The housekeeping crew here is great. The bathroom was modern as well, with a huge showerhead, and the hot water came on right away with no wait. The towels were fresh and fluffy, seemed new as well. True, the neighborhood is pretty average - if you are on foot, you probably won't want to stay here - we didn't think it was much different from the other main streets in terms of crime etc, but there's not a lot around in the way of restaurants and such. If you have a rental car (recommended in Memphis anyway), no problem at all. Just a 5 minute drive down Madison Ave and there's drug stores, restuarants and more. The free breakfast was very satisfactory - they even have a waffle maker!!! I had a great waffle with maple syrup and some bottled juice while I read the paper in the cute and stylish dining area. The staff was great - friendly and helpful. My only criticism of the Gen X is they didn't have a box of tissues in the room - I wouldn't normally notice this, but I had a hayfever attack that day - springtime down south...

It was the end of the summer season but still exceptionally hot in Memphis. We did not have a car, but managed to make our way around many of the city attractions without too much trouble. We booked our accommodation via the hotel directly, & confirmed a place to stay for the duration of our holiday. On our arrival (via plane) we had to take a taxi to the hotel, as it was a Sunday & the airport bus doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t run then (go figure). The hotel is fairly close to town (about 2 miles), but it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really in a very nice area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are a lot of parking lots & a few abandoned buildings around. There is not much to do around the hotel itself, although there are a few fast food restaurants & a Walgreens about 5 or so minutes walk away. There is a hotel car park, which offers one or two parks per room. We were checked in by a young Indian gentleman who was incredibly slow at serving us \u00e2\u20ac\u201c considering we had already paid for the room in advance, the 30 minutes it took to be checked in was a bit much really. There are two lifts (although only one was working when we were there), which would help any older guests that might wish to stay. We were given room 506, which was quite nice & fairly spacious \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we had a king-sized bed, a small fridge, flat screen TV (with several channels but no Sky/cable), DVD player, ipod docking station, desk & chair, sofa chair, wardrobe & private bathroom \u00e2\u20ac\u201c everything was new & in really good condition, & the shower was hot with OK water pressure. Our room was very tidy, but we did spot a cockroach in our bed at one point!! We ventured downstairs & asked about the internet, as I had a lot of work to do online, but the guy who checked us in said he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know anything about the internet, so we were unable to use it (if it was even available at all). He seemed more interested in talking about the football that he was watching on TV than about helping us. We then asked him how to get into town so that we could urgently go to an internet cafe, & he told us where to catch the trolley from (the stop is a few minutes walk away) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we had heard him assure another patron earlier that the trolley would be running, despite being a Sunday evening. When we reached the trolley stop, the same guy we had seen earlier was still waiting for a trolley (for over an hour), & after 40 minutes waiting ourselves, we all gave up & went back to the hotel (it turns out that the trolley doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t run after 6pm on Sunday nights). We were tired & frustrated by this point, & when we returned we noticed that the same desk clerk had a bunch of his friends over, & they were all eating pizza & taking up the chairs & couches in the lobby. Some other guests arrived & asked if there was free pizza, but the boys just made fun of them (because obviously the pizza wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t free, or for guests). It was incredibly unprofessional & uncomfortable. The next morning breakfast was provided \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it mostly consisted of packet pastries & coffee, although there was a little bit of variety. Breakfast was served in the lobby & there were only about four tables there, so if you are in a large group then this may not be suitable. Despite the lack of space in the breakfast area, this hotel would suit people of all types, including older visitors or large groups. However, you will need to have a car if you wish to access Memphis easily or if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to walk around the area at night (I definitely wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do it alone). The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website seems to claim quite a few things that aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t true, so just be careful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there was no free bottled water available (that we could see \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there were bottles for $1 in the lobby though). There was also no internet access (maybe there is, but we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get any), & no \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchealthy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 breakfast (unless you consider the 1 apple & 4 bananas available at breakfast to constitute being healthy). In the evening when we returned to the hotel, family of the employees were gathered in the lobby watching TV on the couches, & there was nowhere to sit. It was all a little weird for us. All in all, if you are after a fairly clean, spacious hotel & don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care about the neighbourhood, the service, internet access or breakfast, then you might find this hotel OK. If we are ever back in the Memphis area then we would consider returning here for comfort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sake, but not for any other reason.

On the morning of Friday August 1st, we found that our vehicle had been broken into. The driver's door window was shattered, the interior covered in broken glass and the contents ransacked. My stereo receiver / CD player and mounting kit was stolen along with a digital camera from the glovebox and a small amount of cash that I had hidden in the ashtray, mostly in coins. There was a fair amount of incidental damage caused by the broken glass as well as the items being removed from our vehicle. I had my door glass replaced so that I could drive home. That was $245, of which I paid $100 deductible and my insurance company paid the rest. My glass was tinted whereas this is clear and I'll probably have to pay that expense out of pocket. The contents that were stolen are covered under my home owner's policy which means filing a separate claim and paying another $100 deductible. Memphis Police responded within ten minutes of being called (there is a precinct one street over on Union). In all, three officers arrived on the scene, including a sargent and a lieutenant. I have absolutely nothing but praise for the Memphis Police Dept, as all three officers were extremely helpful and did far more than I expected of them. As for the Gen X Inn, they have been made aware of existing security issues as this is not the first case of guests having their vehicles robbed (see previous reviews). There is no security guard on premises, the cameras are few and not monitored as they should be and there is no fence around the parking lot to keep out intruders. That area of Memphis has a large population of homeless people, several of whom wandered in and around the hotel lot while we were there. The hotel owners never offered to reimburse us for our loss or to comp our stay. Fortunately Hotels.com did refund the remainder of our reservation without any penalty. The rooms themselves weren't bad and if not for the security issues and location, I would probably have given a better review. However, I cannot in good conscience recommend that anyone stay at the Gen X Inn due to the lack of security, especially if you're planning to park there overnight.

Not a bad hotel, but really not as exciting as I had envisioned.", "Date": "September 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cSuccess!!!\u201d", "Author": "Spleakie", "ReviewID": "UR8612664", "Content": "On a trip to Memphis with my 7 siblings, who careers ranged from business owners to an exective vice president of a bank, booking this unknown hotel was the scariest thing I had ever done. My siblings are pretty five star when it come to their regular travel, so I was really nervous about some of the other reviews I read because I just knew I was with an even pickier crowd. However, when we got to this hotel, we found the decor to be very pleasent and comfortable. The process of checking in was really smooth. The rooms were HUGE! Like many hotels, you don't have a lot of room to walk around but that was not the case with this hotelroom. The bathroom was great with a wonderful waterfall shower. I actually heard my brother(exc.VP) say that the Gen X Inn was more comfortable then many other 5 stars he had been in. The bed was so wonderful and cozy. There was a plasma screen tv in the room that made all the difference in the experience. Since we reside near downtown Chicago, the neighborhood near the Gen X was actually \"quiet and safe\" to us. I thought I would be angry that Beale street was 2 miles away but that was actually better because we drove and it was a straight shot to the action , with no crazy traffic to have to listen to all night long. My only small problem with the hotel was the continential breakfest. It really was continential! Packaged donuts, fruit and boxed cereal. The kids would love it adults will be pretty hungry. However, the coffee was GREAT! If this hotel could add a breakfest like other 2 star hotels, it would have been a five state experience. Nevertheless, it was great and I will definately stay here again.

The hotel was a little hard to find. There wasn't a large sign; I only recognized the hotel from the picture I saw online. We got there a few hours early and were charged $25 to check-in early. Boo! The manager was very nice. The building is pretty weird (I think it was an old apartment building). The decor is interesting but for being \"Gen X\" there was no wireless internet in the hotel. There was a plasma in the room but only cable hookup for internet. I was a bit concerned about the neighborhood. The trolley station is about 2 CITY blocks away from the hotel. The neighborhood was a bit scary especially late at night, but Memphis is a tourist town, right? Don't be fooled by the continental breakfast. It was an Otis Spunkmeyer muffin, coffee, and orange juice in a styrofoam cup. My husband paid $1 for a can of soda and $1 for a bottled OJ in the morning. I wasn't too impressed but I would stay there again. I will however try another hotel the next time I'm in Memphis.

Only complaints I had: the coffee cups in our room would not fit under the coffee maker in our room, so I had to go downstairs for a cup of coffee; We did not have any hangers and they were unable to supply us with more, since they were stolen from the previous people in the room; The room was quite noisy - we could hear loud clunking of shoes in the hallway and neighbors using hair dryers.
