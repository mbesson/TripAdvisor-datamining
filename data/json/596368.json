AC worked a little loudly. Breakfast standard Italian. Staff at reception could have been a lot more helpful - we asked what sites were worth seeing in Prato and she told us to go to Florence! However the duomo, complete with Fra Lippi's amazing frescoes (get the audio guide) is a major highlight of my tuscan holiday. The other churches in Prato and the prison are all worth walking by.

Desk person did not properly coordinate cards with the door locks, and I was unable to access both the main building door and my room door. Had to make two separate trips back to the lobby to get this straightened out. Was directed to park under the hotel, but that access was closed (I wonder why the desk didn't know that) and I just left the car out front. The room was OK (I don't particularly care for ultramodern decor) and was comfortable.Breakfast the next morning was a sham. It was supposed to be an American breakfast, but eggs were undercooked, coffee was apparently instant and terrible, and the room was taken over by a large tour group of [--] who were rude and pushy.Not a pleasant stay, by any means.", "Date": "Oct 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR122553438", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "RareBear"}, {"Content": "Great hotel close to Florence We stayed here in June for 4 nights and found the Wall Art Hotel to be great value with excellent (and huge!) rooms.We booked on Expedia and paid about $120 Canadian a night for a 2 room unit with 2 full baths that slept 4 very comfortably. The room was very clean and modern (think IKEA type furniture and style). The hotel is great for those with a rental car (free parking and relatively easy to find) who want to visit Florence and the Tuscany area. They say it is a 10 minute walk to the train station in Prato, which has frequent trains to Florence (to avoid driving and parking). I would say it is more like a 15-20 minute walk, unless you're jogging at a fairly fast pace! We found the breakfast quite good - scrambled eggs with cheese, bacon (not quite cooked), sausuges, yogurts, juices, pastries and a coffee/cappucino machine. The only drawback I would say is there are no restaurants that are close to the hotel. You have to walk at least 10 minutes to get to the nearest restaurant or grocery store. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for anyone with a car looking for a clean, reasonably priced hotel with good sized rooms.The", "Date": "Jul 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR751008468", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "DWalker207"}, {"Content": "OK, but nothing special A decent but unspectacular choice.
