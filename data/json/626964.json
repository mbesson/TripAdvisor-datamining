The location is excellent; right on Taksim Square. this isnt the main tourist location, but it is central to the city. Getting around on public transport is very easy and efficient. Arguably Sultanhammet is a better location, because it is the centre of most of what you would like to see, but Taksim is pretty good also.

The hotel is a typical city/downtown 4 stars hotel,in the best location (Taksim Square) but still very quiet. The rooms are spotless, modern and some of them (like ours) have view to the Bosporus. However, they have no balconies and they are quite small. Bathroom is fine, but the A/C system is a bit hard to interpret (for instance it somehow started in the middle of the night!!) One thing that was a bit disapointing, was breakfast. Even if it was buffet style, the hotel owners should enrich it...don't expect much.. Reception works perfectly, these people are very friendly and they can help you out with your transportation, answer all kind of questions etc The price we paid(110 euros/night) totally worth it, we have a feeling that value/money reached 1/1. In general i would recomend this hotel for buisness travels or to people like us, who wanted to walk the city, go sightseeing and been to the streets nearly all day. .

Easy access to Metro. Hotel was clean and efficient, although air conditioning was hard to interpret. View from my standard room was terrible (side alleyway). A problem (common in the Near and Middle East) is that the call to prayer can be heard very loudly: the hotel is not particularly soundproof. Breakfast was included in my room rate and was adequate but not exceptional, and clearly continental in style (hardly any meat, etc). My biggest difficulty was the cost of the room: over 200 euros per night. I have stayed in much better hotels in the heart of major European capitals for less than this. Not sure why the hotel is so expensive (has the Turkish Lira appreciated a lot against the Euro lately?).
