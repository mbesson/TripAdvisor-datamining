{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Come on - Entirely Overrated American Express mistakenly had this hotel rated as a 4 star property which was the only reason I booked it. I went to the Hotel website before booking which is entirely misleading. All the rooms seem to be facing a busy street leading to the Frankfurt Hbf. And sorry, but closing the windows does NOT block out the noise. The A/C did not work in my room and the staff really didn't care. I asked for a fan and the desk clerk almost laughed at me. This hotel is about 2 blocks from the red light district. Great location for that and the Main Train Station if those are your goals. I was in town for business and paid 140 Euro - OUCH! Couldn't wait to get out. The bathroom stunk and all and all, I definitely will not repeat.", "Date": "Apr 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR696205415", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "texaholic"}, {"Content": "Close to station, phantastic value for money       Single room 255, hotel Atlantic Frankfurt", "Date": "Sep 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR153578448", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Gernereiserin"}, {"Content": "Avoid at all costs Leaving aside the fact I had 2000 euros stolen and another guest had 5000 euros stolen from our rooms by one of the staff I arrived back one night to be told to pay the bill there and then.When I explained I had left my money and cards at another hotel due to the thefts and would pay in the morning the police were called and I was thrown out of the hotel into the night while my luggage was kept until I paid.I am a seasoned traveller but have never come across anything quite like this hotel.Stay there if you must but dont say you werent warned.", "Date": "Jul 5, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR396432766", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d232636-r15327845-Atlantic_Hotel-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "232636", "Price": "$311"}}
