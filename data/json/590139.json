Being a thorough kind of person I researched all possible hotels beforehand on the internet, and I picked this one. And I wasn't wrong! It's in a very good location, close to downtown and even better: close to Balboa Park. The hotel is relaxed and the staff very, very friendly and helpful. Being European we thought the breakfast was a bit too sweet (pastries), but there was bread to be toasted, cream cheese and fruit in this complimentary breakfast too, and we bought a loaf of darker bread, tomatoes and hard cheese ourselves which we took to breakfast without a problem. So breakfast became a lot of fun. The selection of tea was nice as well. The breakfast room is a bit small, but you can take breakfast to your room if you want. The free bikes were wonderful. We ride bikes in our country (Belgium) all the time, so it was great to try it in San Diego. The slopes are a bit steeper, though! My sister took her laptop to work on her presentation and she could use the free internet connection. We loved having a kitchenette in the room, so we could use the microwave to prepare some food and the crockery and cutlery provided to eat it. The small fridge was great to put in the food and drink we bought. The showers were across the hallway and always spotlessly clean (and available; we never had to wait one minute). We could do the laundry at the hotel too, which was lovely because you don't have to walk the streets with your dirty clothes in tow! And then there were complimentary apples and newspapers at the reception desk; what more could you want? And now for a comparison: colleagues of my sister were staying at one of the very expensive hotels close to the convention center (I've forgotten the name, but it had two tower blocks). They had a swimming pool, yes, but if they wanted to rent a bike they had to pay something like 10 dollars an hour or 30 dollars a day. Breakfast was not even included in the high price and after having delivered 1 (one!) message the reception desk complained this should not be a regular occurence! We were so pleased that we had chosen this hotel when we heard my sister's colleagues describe their hotel!

My husband and I recommended our guests to stay at this hotel. Not only was the price unbeatable but the location was perfect as our wedding was in Balboa Park and no one had a car. So with all of this in mind it was the perfect place! The hotel also did a wonderful event for us the Friday before our wedding. We had our rehearsal dinner here and it was absolutely perfect! The decor, set up and food was just wonderful. Rose, one of the managers created a delicious menu full of apps and hors d'oeuvres. We couldn't have asked for a better event! The rooms themselves are fully equipped with sink, refrigerator, TV/DVD player and microwave. You also, had free access to their beach cruisers to go explore the town! I am not sure what the person below is talking about 'run down' neighborhood. He clearly doesn't know the area. My husband and I live in Hillcrest which is about 10 minutes by bike from the hotel. The Occidental is perfectly situated in Bankers Hill one of the BEST neighborhoods in San Diego! The comment about 'feeling unsafe' blows my mind! Located on 4th and Elm is perfect and a short walk into the gaslamp district, little Italy AND Balboa Park where you are bombarded with excellent cuisine and nightlife. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to visit San Diego. I can't stress enough how wonderful the staff were, attentive, helpful and kind and the hotel itself is immaculate. Of course the price is just unbeatable. I and my husband have done extensive travel around the world. We have stayed in every imaginable form of accommodation and this definitely goes down in our book for a wonderful place to stay. If you want to pay 100 or more a night to stay in a 5 star hotel, go for it. There are plenty in downtown, but nothing compares to the Occidental in terms of price and standards!

Was told there was one at the corner liquor store, which made feel unsafe to say the least.

My mom got sick because the whole time we stayed there the A/C was running constantly and we had to call the front desk to turn it off. In the morning, they turned it on again and it ran constantly, and i had to call the desk at 7 am again to turn it off, because there weren't enough blankets on the bed to keep us warm. The continental breakfast was typically mediocre. Their pastries were stale. This is a hostel, not a \"European style boutique hotel.\" Furnishings were the absolute cheapest - the least they could have done was to go with colorful, cheap IKEA furnishings to make it look more bright and cheerful like some European hostels do. IKEA mattresses certainly would have been a higher quality. Many kids rooms have better furnishings than this. The actual reception held by this hotel was also mediocre, but i was told it was a good price...Im sure considering the amount of money this hotel got from all the guests that stayed there...I started noticing hotels nearby. There was a Holiday Inn and a Motel Six that offered better value. BTW even at the cheapest hotels I got a receipt showing my charges.

They had complimentary bottled water, popcorn, coffee, and kleenex, plus plenty of DVDs to borrow and play on the DVD/TV. I arrived early and they offered to store my luggage till check in at 2pm, and gave me map/instructions to visit Little Italy (~15 mins walk). On Saturday, Little Italy has a 'mercato' from 9:30-1:30, which had lots of fresh food and stuff to buy. Yogourtland was a great make your own dessert place, that only cost $0.30/oz. Balboa park was technically only 2 blocks away and about 15 mins walk to the official entrance and museums. Park had a nice variety of sights, but you should get there early, else most museums close by 4:30pm. If you're going to a convention, you can sometimes get 50% off exhibits, like the DaVinci exhibit. Was also able to borrow a cruiser bike, lock and helmet to bike down to the Marina boardwalk next morning. It took about 1.5 hour to travel down thru the Marina, seaport village, marriot hotel and return back via downtown/gaslamp district. Breakfast was a great selection of cereal, pastries, toast, bagel/creamcheese, coffee, juices and bananas. This was comparable to the $15 continental buffet I had at the Marriot.

It is obvious from the hotel's own website that this is not high-end luxury but a comfortable 'guest-house' style of accomodation. The rooms are wired for internet and there is no charge. The hotel is almost directly under the approach path of planes for the airport as is Balboa park and much of this part of the city. The planes are however not a problem in my opinion. I was on the second floor and found the sound-proofing/double-glazing meant that there was no disturbance at all. This hotel is about 15mins walk from the central business district & 25 from the conference centre. If walking use the western side (right-hand sied on the way in) of 4th Ave as the junctions are easier to negotiate. Taxis are not expensive and you can get to the airport for $10-12.", "Date": "May 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kamloops, British Columbia", "Title": "\u201cHard Beds!!\u201d", "Author": "bctravelers9", "ReviewID": "UR30112129", "Content": "I wish i could give a better review to the Occidental -- the staff were great, it was very clean, if basic, but we actually moved to a different hotel after three nights because the bed was so hard and uncomfortable.

But I have to say, I was very pleasantly suprised when I arrived at the Occidental, everything is well kept and super clean. the breakfast is good, and open 7-11am!

Ok, this hotel is not by any means a hostel. Yes, the bathrooms are outside of the rooms, but they are private and immaculately clean. This is typical European style, and save considerable costs for the hotel that translates to cheaper rooms. The hotel is in the city, but a little outside of downtown, but the area is not a war zone or anything. It is also very close to the interstate, making it a 15 minute max drive to pacific and mission beach. the entire place is extremely clean, and comfortable; the rooms are small yet include a sink, microwave, small counter space, midsize fridge and cubby-like shelf space. Sound can be an issue I guess, but you are staying in a city, and close to an airport. The patio, smoking area is very cute. They have coin-washers and always have fruit in the lobby. Breakfast was good, although not hot food. Staff was very attentive, cleaning staff was very thorough. Here's a breakdown: Price: Excellent for what you get. get over the disconnected bathrooms, you're not going to run into anyone in the hallway, they are well maintained, and you can lock the door. There are also enough of them where there is typically no waiting for one. Free wireless, free beach cruiser rental. Rooms: Bright, simple, very clean. ample space to stay the night, if you're spending any more time in the room in San Diego there's something wrong with you. Go to the beach for god sakes. Kitchenette in the room with sink, microwave, small fridge, dishware and towels. Cubby like shelves and hanging space. A decent desk with reading light close to phone. Free wireless, also a cat5 port in the phone. Food: Pretty good included breakfast. Pastries every morning, bagels with cream cheese butter or jam. Hot coffee or hot water. 4 choices of cold cereal, assorted oatmeal. OJ and apple juice. Bananas, apples. Instant coffee and tea, 2 bottles of water and a microwave popcorn in the room. Vending also available. Apples in the lobby. Staff: Cleaning staff were really nice, very thorough. Never had issues with the room, or the bathrooms, i think they cleaned the bathrooms a couple times a day. Front desk person was 24/7 and always helpful and sweet. Rose was very cool. Location: not super, but not a war zone, was upper area near Balboa park, quick access to the highway (15 minutes tot he beach!!) Cons: parking is difficult to find. They have a couple of spaces but its $10 a day. Street parking is metered 8am to 6pm, there was a garage available but i didn't use it. I spent the days at the beach so it wasn't so much of an issue, and parking enforcement seemed to be lacking in the area. It would be nice if the room had a thermostat, but you can deal with it, I dunno what temp it was but it was even and tolerable. If I can't stay on the beach, this will be my new usual spot.

The staff was very helpful (especially Eric) and gave me lots of hints about what to do and how to get there since I had to give up my car after a couple of days. There was also a young man that worked at night mostly that I never got his name. The young people that work there do need some name tags. He helped me to get a place to park once and went out of his way to do that. I go every year to San Diego during the hot month of the year at home to get a bit more moderate temperatures and relax a bit. There was also a young college age girl there at the desk that was very nice and went out of her way to make sure I was well taken care of and was always busy tending to others who needed assistance. It is not their fault really, but I made the mistake of renting a car like I always do, but this hotel is not really set up for people who have a car. They have some spaces (4 to 5 only) and it is on a first come first serve basis, and then they charge you to park! I finally gave up trying to get the space since I was on vacation and not planning to come in early every night to park the car, and later turned the car back in to the agency. After that I felt much more comfortable and used the public transportation, or walked. Do not depend on the places around there to park. The street parking here is fully covered by parking meters, but you have to be up at 8am to move your car or get going or you get a ticket. Everything is close by. I walked to the Italian district for dinner, took a trolley to the Old Town district, then a bus to the beach. Horton Plaza provided me all the shopping I needed and it is within walking distance. There are many things to see and do once you get to the trolley and that is about 6 blocks away. If you are able to walk and enjoy the exercise then it is great. The weather was very cooperative since I am used to much hotter weather this time of year at home, this city was so refreshing. They seem to have very little problems with traffic, unlike my home. I did get caught one time in some traffic trying to get back into San Diego from north of the city though. That was a bit of a pain. San Diego is very tolerant of homeless people, which is nice until you have to negotiate your way through them to get anywhere. They seem harmless and are more a hazard to themselves then other people, but they seem to be concentrated around this hotel. There is some sort of a center for them close by that attracts many of them during the day and when that place closes it is like rush hour for street people, they are suddenly everywhere on the streets around the hotel screaming and yelling. They never bothered me except to ask for money but if you are not familiar with this sort of thing then it can be a bit scary. I never heard any planes fly overhead and I stayed on the second floor on the inside of the hotel. This was not a problem for me. The free continental breakfast was nice but the place where they displayed the food was overrun with some sort of gnats or fruit flies that made me want to get in and out as soon as possible. Everything was covered up due to these flies but they were very aggressive and wanted to dive bomb into my cereal quite often. Not sure what you could do about that. If you are staying there for a while, like I did, then it is nice to have the laundry facilities and I did use them. They make you pay for the ice you use. Never had that at any hotel I ever stayed at in my life. It is coin operated. I had a room that had a toilet and a sink but the shower was next door to my room. I just put on my shorts and went out to use it and never once in the whole week did I ever have anybody even in the hall when I went there or using the facility. I had no trouble with that. I have not done this in a long time, so I was unsure what the rules are for coming and going with that. Since most Americans are unfamiliar with this it would be nice to have some hints beforehand.

Although I stayed here in early June, my experience has just ended yesterday. I was moving from the East Coast to San Diego and I knew I needed a hotel with weekly rates to use as a home base until I found an apartment. I discovered Hotel Occidental online, being from far away I could not see any hotels before staying there and this was one of the few options that had real reviews and information beyond a name, address and phone number. Despite having shared bathrooms, this place seemed clean and safe. It was. After reading on the website that there were rates starting at $200 a week, I called the hotel. I was informed that the cheapest weekly room they had was $285. When I inquired about the $200 a week rooms I was told they were all booked. I asked the difference between the two rooms, I was told both had shared bath, kitchenette and a twin bed. I was told the $285 room was \"quite a bit bigger.\" I was suspicious as soon as I checked into my room, I don't imagine there was any smaller room in this hotel. I could describe it, but I will let the pictures do it for me. There was no desk like described in another review. The room had no clock. No place in the room to hang wet towels. There was a counter with sink/microwave and cabinet with 1 dish, 1 plate, 1 fork, etc... The bed was more like a cot than anything. Although comfortable for my short, week long stay, it was far cheaper than almost every hotel bed I've had up to this point. All these things were minor and wouldn't give a hotel a 1 star review, Everything went smoothly the day I checked out. Around 11am I saw the maid near my room and when she asked, I told her I would be out of the room soon so she could take care of it. Everyday she had been in there to replace the towels and make the bed. I gathered all of my belongings and took them down to the lobby in a few trips. On my last trip down the stairs the maid was by the door and we exchanged pleasant farewells, and she entered the room to begin cleaning. The checkout process took about 10 min and then the woman at the front desk called a taxi for me upon my request. About 15-20 minutes went by as I waited for the taxi to arrive. Nobody on the hotel staff approached me or acted as if there were any problems. My taxi came, I left for my new apartment. The next afternoon I got a voicemail on my cell phone. It was the nice woman who owns Hotel Occidental. Apparently I left red ink stains on the carpet of my room. Due to this, they took the liberty of charging $300 to my Visa card that was used to pay for the room!!! I immediately went back to the hotel to address the matter. I explained that I had no red pens, markers or anything else that would have caused this damage. I assured them that before leaving the room I looked it over and there were no damages whatsoever. The owner and Ms. Mendoza (who ironically enough posted her own comments on this site the same day as my departure) would not believe that these damages were caused by me. They told me \"You were the last one in this room, these stains weren't here before you stayed. Someone has to pay for this damage.\" It was too bad that neither of them could explain to me why I wasn't stopped and shown these stains before I left the property the previous day. Not knowing the laws and my rights, I nervously told them I would be disputing this charge with Visa and they told me \"That's fine, but we already charged the credit card and we're getting our money.\" For nearly 3 months I have had this $300 charge in dispute on my credit card. It caused me a great amount of undue stress. I truly believe the Owner and \"Project Manager\" of this hotel are trying to take advantage of people to make this new hotel successful. Being a young person they thought they could take advantage of me. They got away with overcharging me on the room. I could accept that. Lying about stains and committing fraud is inexcusable though. Now that Visa has confirmed this was illegal activity, I will be reporting this hotel to the BBB. Don't be surprised if you stay at Hotel Occidental and are told \"I'm sorry, we can't accept Visa\" In closing, if you decide to stay at the Hotel Occidental, be sure to inspect your room thoroughly upon check-in. When it is check-out time, request a member of management come to your room and inspect it with you. If they did it to me, they could do it to you just as easy.

I travel frequently to San Diego on business and although born and raised in San Diego, I often have difficulty pouring hard earned money into the larger monolithic hotel chains. In this case, the city was near capacity. I happened upon the Occidental and was surprised to have a private shower and komode when I had booked a shared bathroom. The Hotel exudes elegance and charm! The interior decorator cleverly captured the era of the hotel by hanging art work of snapshots in San Diego history. I was especially impressed with the posters of 1916 and 1935 California Pacific Exposition showing some of the decades old Balboa Park architecture (Still standing, left over from the state expo). The room was simple, but the amenities had been thoughtfully planned out: A mini-kitchen including refrigerator and microwave...and best of all a DVD player built into the TV. This room is only what college freshmans dream about. High tech in design, but comfortable. A great, quiet location that is 2 blocks from almost every cultural and recreational activity. Undoubtably, the Hotel Occidental will be my home away from home address for future stays. A true destination hotel with real international appeal. If you are tired of over-rated five star oppulence and want to live like a local with a comfy (Glad to be back home) feeling, then this is the hotel for you.", "Date": "July 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles, ca", "Title": "\u201cA great FIND!\u201d", "Author": "foxglove10", "ReviewID": "UR5516695", "Content": "I was a little hesitant about staying in a European-style hotel with some shared bathroom and shower facilities, but I have to say this was a great little hotel with a charming feel and a wonderfully helpful and accommodating staff. The amenities are quite nice - each room has a microwave and refrigerator. Some rooms have a WC (just a toilet) and some have a full shower - you pay a little more for them. When they say \"shared showers,\" I initially had visions of gym class in high school, but these are private showers, one person at a time - it's just that you may have to wait your turn, just as if you were staying in a home. My travelling companion has travelled extensively in Europe, and she assured me this was exactly like those, only cleaner. The housekeeping staff is amazing - the guy who said there was no maid service must have had a Do Not Disturb sign out or something, because our room was spotless every time we returned to it. We loved the fact that breakfast was set up every day from 7am until 11am, and it was much better than the usual hour-long 7:30am - 8:30am continental quickie offered in so-called \"upper level\" hotels. The later end time allowed us to truly enjoy our VACATION by sleeping in, rather than getting up as early as if I were at home, dressing and rushing out to grab a stale croissant and coffee, like other places we've stayed, resulting in needing a protein fix an hour or two later. Here, breakfast is fresh fruits, fresh danish and croissants, muffins, cereal and milk, orange juice, coffee - a nice spread offering a breakfast of some substance. They also have a nice laundry facility if you need to wash some clothes during your stay. Lisa, Giselle, Ricardo, and Lauren were all very attentive to our every need, had great suggestions for us, gave us directions when we needed them, and were generally great. There was a little snafu with our reservation the first night, but we dealt with it and were upgraded to a nicer room for the remainder of our stay (although the first room wasn't really bad - it just lacked a private shower, and this turned out to be no problem). Upon checkout, we found we'd been comped the lower price for all four nights of our stay - we didn't ask, nor expect this, the staff simply did it for us as an apology and a thank you. The one negative thing I could say is that there's not a lot of parking on the property, but the offset is that there is a ton of residential parking nearby, which is free. Downtown, Gaslamp, the Convention Center, loads of restaurants, Balboa Park, and the Zoo are all in walking distance if you're fit, or short cab ride if you prefer an easier pace. Simply put, the Hotel Occidental offers a lot of value for your money. And I didn't even mention the bikes you can borrow. I'd say a lot more positive stuff, but I'm afraid I've already done too much - once everybody figures out that this place is there, I think booking a room is going to get a little tougher. It's a great find in a crowded vacation spot!", "Date": "July 27, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Occidental", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d590139-Reviews-Hotel_Occidental-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">410 Elm Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92101</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "590139", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/22/2e/80/freshly-trimmed-trees.jpg"}}
