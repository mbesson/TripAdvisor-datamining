The main reason we chose it was a good price and a location close to tube station. The hotel itself is nice, even though some small repairs should have been done, but overall was staying there a nice experience. The staff was pleasant and the service of the hotel bar good. The only problem I find is the location - the Grand City name couldn't be more inapropriate as it is situated in a very tacky neigbourhood. There were a few homeless people on our way to a hotel and once you enter, you feel in a completely different world, but then there is the walk from hotel to tube again and... well thank god I was with my boyfriend because I would have been very scared to walk around that area alone in the dark.

A bit further away from central but was easy to get around by train. The hotel is much nicer than the area that it is in. Rooms are larger than other hotel rooms we've come across in Germany. When we first got there, we opened the bathroom bin and there was rubbish in there from the previous guest. The second day we went out and left a \"do not disturb\" sign on the door. This was ignored and housekeeping came and made up the room anyway. I advised reception who apologised and said they would follow it up for me. All went well until the second last day we were there. We put the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door as we had done previously and it was ignored by housekeeping again. We had also left a bottle of wine in the room next to a used glass and housekeeping filled the glass with some of the wine. No idea why. I called reception and explained that housekeeping had come in again and the response I got was \"ok...\" followed by 5 seconds of silence. I asked why this had happened again, told them it was a privacy breach and said I had private things in the room. I finally got an apology and was told that they would follow up with the duty manager. I don't appreciate the fact that the staff did not respect our privacy and they didn't seem particularly worried when housekeeping disobeyed the sign. I want to leave a hotel during the day knowing my belongings are safe and this hotel did not make me feel this way.

This hotel believes in the concept of 'you don't ask - you don't get'. Which is ok, but when you ask for a tray with tea / coffee and a kettle, it would be great if the dirty cups were taken out of the room during service the next morning. It's one of those weird hotels where the 3rd floor is on the 3rd floor of the lift and then you have to walk down a flight of narrow stairs - remember the don't ask don't get thing? - well, there are no offers to help you carry your bag to your room, either. I am not a princess (although I am partial to being a drama queen from time to time) and I do like a firm bed - I actually left the hotel with a backache, and I wrote a letter to the Manager while I was there - I asked and I didn't get, so I guess it makes no difference either way.

The hotel feels like it is in dire need of renovation. The reception area is fairly ok but once getting up to the rooms it is apparent that it has not been renovated in many years. I was also a bit surprised of the lack of a/c in the room. Berlin in August is rather warm so would have been good to have a/c. The room was otherwise ok, had a decent bed and was clean. The bathroom was also as expected. There was a desk to work at and it would have been useful if the wifi had worked. The main issue I had was however with the wifi. It was of course not working at all and the staff were entirely uninterested helping me.The attitude was appalling and they could not even bother to suggest a place in the area which offered wifi. They made not attempts to fix anything but simple stated that they could not really do anything. When I explained that I had specifically asked if there was wifi when I booked since I needed to work they merely restated that they could not really do anything but that I could perhaps wait a day or so to see if it would work then (which is an interesting statement since I just checked in and the person knew I was checking out the next day).
