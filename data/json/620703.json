After calling around for vacancies during one of the busiest conventions of the year ,we found a room at IC Boston (thank God).

The rooms are very spacious ,well appointed and CLEAN. The shower is separated from the bath and you even get a scale and loads of fresh fluffy towels.

Bigger than Christmas. Bigger than Birthday's. I propose to you that Valentine's Day is the Holy of Holy for your lady. I know this because my wife has told me so. And she is right...Right! Ok, so for you gentlemen looking for a great way to spice up the relationship or impress that beautiful someone the InterContinental is the place to do it!! First, the rooms are exquisitly decorated. When you walk into the rooms the warmth of the dark woods and \"Film Noir\" lighting speak of the pending \"heat\" awaiting the lucky couple sharing the room. The bed--most important here because you should be spending most of the time in it--is splendid. Filled with large crisps fluffy white pillows and white bedding it is truly falling into clouds-- you don't want to move. Now, I have stayed there with my Conejolita (that's my wife of 30 years as of this June) three or four times. Each room had the same set up with a sliding panel above the bed that when opened revealed the bathroom. But, not just the bathroom but a stylish large tub with jets and decorative hardware...it fits TWO. Now, if you plan ahead GENTLEMEN--that's a hint. If you plan ahead, get yourself some great wine(more then one!), cheese, grapes, humus, dark chocolate, fresh made bread and a bit of hard salami and put together a small basket. Now don't forget the napkins and plates. Book one night at the InterContinental and you will be a hero. Because you rescue Romance from the grips of sitcom tv and the couch! Here's the catch, to take true advantage of the InterContinental's beauty and location you need to check in around 3pm (this is normal). But to make the date truly romantic, you need to have your lady in the room by 4pm...Why? Because you are not only going to give her an afternoon of hot tub, pampering, and love making, but you are going to watch a \"chickflick\" with her after the fireworks and then later you are going to take her out on the town and give her the nightlife. And don't give me that \"I don't dance\" stuff. The InterContinental has a great bar downstairs that is super-stylish. It has a fabulous selection of excellent wines, cushy atmosphere and good music light ly playing in the background. You should stop there for a drink around 9pm. Have one, then head out the front door into the world of great dining. You only have to walk 100 yards and on the water is a plethora of great restaurants. I am not going to tell you in this review where to go--(hahah)--but will say any place around there is a great choice. That's the point...the InterContinental allows you to have maxium \"Romance-ability!\" So, after a great dinner, it's about 11:00pm now you walk down the street to the \"Livingroom.\" It's a swanky club with two large bars that are arty. The place is loaded with couches and chairs over-stuffed and soooo comfy. There is music playing and lights flickering giving you that \"city-night-club-I-am-out-with-the-hip-people-crowd-thing.\" And the funny thing is that you are!!! Now, have a martini, or something. Then order their Calamari and sit back and enjoy the view. It is a great place. Whew, now...it's 1:30am. Your lady has her hand wrapped deep in yours. You can hear, in the silence as you walk back to the InterContinental, her complete happiness and contentment. You, my good fellow, have wooed her right tonight. You get back to the room. To that amazing bed and you tumble into the fluffiness awaiting. And your lady rolls atop you all smiles and kissy and says \"what do you have planned for next year?'\" And you look at her, cause she must be crazy. And you say cooly. \"The InterContinental of course!!\" And you will, because it is a great place to stay.", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Foxboro, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cWhat a treat!\u201d", "Author": "kelleigh1", "ReviewID": "UR123080510", "Content": "We had the opportunity to spend a night here following my office holiday party.

The hotel is luxurious in every sense of the word. From the marble lobby to the granite bathroom, and jacuzzi-like bathtub, to the doorman, it deserves every one of its Four Diamonds. We found the service to be wonderful. The receptionist at check-in was very friendly and helpful, the doorman allowed us to park our car out front while we took our bags upstairs. And when I needed salt at 10:30pm, room service graciously had it sent up to our room within 60 seconds. The only drawback I can think of is the size of the rooms and the mini-fridge. We got a standard room which basically fit a bed, long dresser, desk and 2 night tables. There wasn't too much space (drawers) to put our stuff. We had food to put in the mini-fridge, but it was already filled with snacks that we'd have to pay for if we moved them. We managed to squeeze in 2 yogurts and a water bottle. Also we officially got a water-view room, but in actuality it's a view of the other part of the Intercontinental, and if you squeeze all the way to the left, you can catch a glimpse of some water. The gym is huge and better-equipped than any gym I've been to. We didn't actually visit the pool, but from the gym you can see it's clean and modern, and a nice size for swimming laps. The gym and pool are surrounded by glass, so you won't get much privacy. Parking: With parking $40/day, you can park at 75 State Street or Central Parking a few blocks away (4 min walk) for half the price. Overall, we'd definitely come here again, although not for a family vacation, since the rooms are too small, not enough storage space, and the financial district is not that exciting.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "DLE E", "ReviewID": "UR121883004", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for the first time after staying at other hotels in downtown Boston.

So it came as somewhat of a surprise when perk after perk was offered to me during my stay! First off, I had booked a king bed. I get to my room, and it's a corner suite overlooking a channel and beyond to the Harbor. Absolutely gorgeous views! I had far too much space for just one person, but it was extremely comfortable, with a wonderful bed, terrific linens and a bathroom with a huge jacuzzi tub and full shower. Clean, well cared for, and well designed room that was also very quiet and private. The public spaces are very modern, and the lounge offers a nice menu and impressive list of wines, beers, and spirits. I got in quite late and needed to unwind, so I went and had a glass of wine and a club sandwich. It came with french string fries that were cooked in truffle oil and delicately spiced with salt, pepper and a bit of chive. AMAZING. The service was great and everyone very friendly and attentive. One perk that was absolutely wonderful was late checkout at 4pm! Since my flight didn't leave 'til the evening, this allowed me to invite some friends over to my suite and have a lunch, giving us enough time to visit in comfort. We ordered from room service, we all had grilled cheese and those fantastic fries, and it was just a great time.

So maybe that's a partial con). The cons: The restaurant. We usually just eat breakfast there but I was so excited to go back for their spectacular breakfast buffet. This time, for some strange reason, they did't have it at all for our 3 day weekend stay and the staff could not provide any reason as to why. We ordered a la carte instead and waited almost an hour for the food (the restaurant was empty). Not worth the money. There was also some confusion before we got to the hotel about our rooms that we booked (via Hotwire), which we emailed the hotel but did not get back any type of help from their end. We had to take matters into our hands, and book a third room. Overall, it's a really nice hotel, good location, but doesn't measure up service-wise to its four star rating.

Didn't get a call until 4pm that the room was ready but we were exploring the Greenway so, again, no big deal. The room was very nice and very spacious. The bed was comfortable with nice linens and the bathroom was large with separate shower and tub. The workout facility is quite nice. The city view is fine (I booked through Expedia for a great rate and knew that I would not be getting a water view.) One weird thing about the room is that there are two opaque sliding windows that open from the tub into the sleeping area above the headboard. They did not close tightly and really did not provide any privacy from the bathroom. You could not see into the bathroom was there was no sense that you were isolated from others in the main room. Very odd. A few complaints: 1. I requested a late checkout for Sunday (1pm instead of noon). I was told that it would cost an additional $50! Complete BS! I've never been charged for a late checkout. For this reason alone I'll try another hotel next time. 2. The in-room checkout was not functioning. Annoying. 3. Valet for checkout was very disorganized. I called the number the valet gave me at check-in. It didn't work. I looked in the guest guide and it said to call the front desk. They gave me another number to call. I called that number and got voicemail. What the hell? This isn't that complicated. I brought our bags down to checkout and they told me I had to go down one floor to the garage and hand the valet my ticket. I did this and 10 minutes later I got my car. Just ridiculous....

For such a nice property and global brand reputation, I expected MUCH better customer service. I'll try to explain what I think is going on after second trip. My comments are based on two trips. One in August 28, 2010 and most recently on August 12, 2011. This was a family trip. We booked two rooms. The second for my mother in-law. Our August 28, 2010 trip was cut short due to a hotel fire. Back then, the hotel did a terrible job handling the fire. My comparison / comments are based on other hotel brands I've stayed at over the years including the Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons, Fairmont, Omni, Marriott, and Hyatt. This Intercontinental Boston is a relatively new hotel. The rooms are spacious and beautiful. The hotel is about a 15-20 minute walk to Faneuil Hall marketplace and about 23-30 minute walk to the North End. This trip (Aug. 2011), we managed to check in early. I noticed the hotel did not seem busy. As with most properties, this hotel has both residential and commercial tenants. This is where I believe the problems stem with customer service. Clearly the hotel guests seemed to be second class priority. The desk clerks seemed to be very confused and unclear about hotel policies. For instance when my wife tried to take our 14 year old son to the gym, she was told by the gym supervisor than anyone under 18 was not allowed to use any of the equipment (cycles, treadmill, etc.). However,the front desk clerk said that minors (kids) could use the facility as long as they were supervised by an adult. The second day, the front desk clerk told us that under no circumstances kids under 18 could use the gym facility. When I asked them directly if this is a private gym for the resident tenants, they denied it. We paid extra to stay at the club level. But, they have VERY set times when they open up and when the food + drinks are out. They open up much later on the weekends. So, if you like to start your day early on the weekends (before 7:30 am) skip the club level amenities. In fact they were 30 minutes late opening up for us during our stay; they did not open up till 8:00 pm. They don't setup in the evening until 5:30 pm. So, even though we paid $100 extra per night, we hardly used the club level. In fact we were the only ones at the club. During this trip, a member of our party had a terrible accident walking back from the North End and we desperately needed a first aid kit at 9 pm in the evening. We could not find any open CVS of pharmacy within the 1 mile radius. None the convenient stores has even a Band-Aid. Finally we approached the hotel for assistance. It took us several attempts to get the point across to them that we needed a first aid kit. Reluctantly and 20 minutes later someone showed up with some supplies. For a property this big, I expect the staff to be more responsive to guests that may be in need of medical attention. I guess they have not learned from the August 2010 fire. Do not expect this hotel to handle any medical or other emergency. Parking sucks. Although this hotel provides parking, the rates clearly want you to park your car someplace else. The rate is $40 / night irrespective of weekends. You can find most public parking will charge between $7 - $15 for weekends. I think anything less than 7 hours is around $30 and anything over is still $40. Cleary this parking lot is for residential clients. The bottom line, this hotel property is NOT FAMILY or customer oriented. This property caters to residential guests (these are multimillion dollar condos where everyone drives around a Bentley or Ferrari). You can see the fleet of cars at the parking level. Don't expect this hotel to be consistent on policies. There's a lot of flip flopping on what the policies are. Club level food is OK, but the hours are very limited and inconvenient. Don't expect any help if you need any medical attention or supplies. I don't expect the hotel to have any best practices in case of a fire or emergency. And don't expect to see a manager or supervisor on weekends. In fact we never engaged by anyone above a front desk assistance. The Boston Intercontinental sets a very poor example for what customer service should not be. If you're travelling with family, kids, and for the summer, I would recommend staying at one of the more family friendly hotels that has it act together.

The area is very convenient for access to harbor front sightseeing opportunities ( a short walk) and is also a pleasant walk (on a cool evening) to the North End and Chinatown. The one warning I have is that by being located in the financial district, absolutely everything in the immediate vicinity (coffee shops, bagel shops, donut shops, etc.) is closed on Saturday and Sunday mornings, making a cheap and quick breakfast nearly impossible.

Room needed to be de-feathered and unfortunately when I took the sheets off the bed the mattress pad was full of bodily hairs from a number of previous guests.

Hotel is a five min walk from South Station its recommended to park on top of south station for something like $8 per day instead of the $40 per day that the parking company charges. Down side is that the bellman would not let my friend park long enough for him to carry my things in and swipe his credit card to my account. The bellmen need to realise that not everyone WANTS to park for the evening, some people need to just pull up long enough to pick their friend up for dinner,drop off someone or help them inside. Lighten up guys give people a 3 min stand time that would be helpful.Summer St shopping and Chinatown are all walking distance.

We recommend taking the water taxi from Logan if the weather is nice.

Even though they did not have our room ready when we arrived (it was 9am) they processed our check in and held our bags. They said they would call us when our room was ready but that never happened. When we checked to see if the room was ready, it was. When we got to our room, our keys did not work so back down we went. We were on an award stay, but our first room though acceptable for a standard room was right across from a construction site in the adjacent building and we did not want to be awakened early. To the credit of staff, they moved us to a very nice corner room on the top floor, overlooking the city and a bit of the water. (It was partially \"accessible\", but no worry. From what I understand the hotel was sold out but never felt crowded. The location was right on the waterfront, and less than a ten minute walk to Freedom Trail, main trolley stops, ferry landing, Quincy Market, Faneuil Hall, North end, etc. Being in the financial district there is a slightly limited selection of dining options directly near the hotel but endless options within minutes walk. We felt safe walking in the area. We never used a taxi during out stay as we were so close to everything. The hotel has very nice gym with quite a bit of cardio equipment, (all including TV's), a weight system, and other equipment all overlooking the city. There is an indoor pool (no hot tub) that appeared nice though it was hot and humid. (and crowded with kids...nothing wrong with kiddos, but not relaxing...but hey...we were here to see the sights, we can hang by the pool in the tropics.) They have a nicely appointed business center but it is very high dollar as with most business class hotels. They also had a PC where you could print boarding passes for free, but it never worked...but the concierge kindly printed them for us. The hotel has internet access for a fee....we did not bother using it between our smart phones and tethering plan. The rooms were nicely decorated, and comfortable. The first room we were in had the much mentioned window to the bathroom that would have let light into the room, but the second room we moved into did not have this window, it appeared in the room, but was tiled over in the bathroom. The bed was very comfortable and the curtains did an excellent job of blocking out the light. They have nice flat screen TV's with sufficient channels, and the room included a large work desk, plenty of plugs, and a lounge chair. There is a coffee/tea maker, ice bucket, and mini bar. (No room in minibar for personal items) The first room we were in also had a couch. Everything was very clean. The climate control works well and you can leave the blower motor on for white noise while the climate control is still functioning. Bathrooms are huge and well equipped with plenty of storage and counter space, lots of toiletries, etc. The bathroom has a soaker tub as well as a shower. The towels were a bit of a disappointment.....rather scratchy for this class of hotel. There was no noise from nearby rooms and only marginal noise from the city streets below. There are several dining options in the hotel but we did not partake of any of them....we were not there to eat in hotel restaurants. We did have cocktails in the bar one night...the cocktails were very good though very pricey. Service was also very good. We went down the street to Legal Seafood on subsequent nights and hung out at the bar a bit. Legal Seafood is about a 7 minute walk away. Great hotel, great service, other than the glitches on check in.. The concierge was always very helpful and housekeeping was very responsive and timely.

A few things to keep in mind if you're about to pay 4 or 4.5 star prices: They will not bring your car up from the garage for you. You have to take the elevator to the lobby, walk across the lobby and take a second elevator down to the garage. You can't even call ahead for the car. This service costs $40 a night. There isn't really anyone paying attention to guests coming and going, or for that matter who goes up on the elevators. This seems like a security problem to me. I also found the pillows to be lacking. First of all, I had 2 different size pillows on my bed. Second, they were flat. No support at all. Like I had folded up a shirt and put it under my head.

I travel quite a bit, and had previously come to the realization that many well-known and allegedly high quality hotel chains have simply decreased their service & amenities and I would just have to deal with it. That is absolutely not the case with the InterContinental! It was wonderful! The entire hotel is extremely clean, has a trendy modern feel & decor, plush bedding, amazing bathrooms with huge tubs & separate glass showers, has a fantastic location right on the water, provides top quality amenities, excellent room service, etc. I have ZERO complaints. It was such a welcome change from every other hotel I have stayed at in the past year! Every single hotel staff individual I met went out of their way to make my stay more agreeable. I was attending a conference, and even at the conference, the wait staff would walk up to people who were standing in the foyer and talking and ask if more coffee was desired, or if they could get us some juice, or if they could take our dishes out of our hands (dirty), etc. The hotel supplied so much staff for the event that they literally were waiting on you constantly, and the staff all seemed genuinely pleased to be able to assist with pleasant smiles on their faces. Sounds simple, yet many hotel's do not do this anymore. The above & beyond behavior makes you feel like you are very valued as a hotel guest. I used the gym every day I was there, and it too was fantastic. 24-hour access, temperature controlled, with great machines, and a beautiful view of the little park right in front of the property and the Boston Fire Department right across the street. Plenty of towels, water with watermelon and musk melon to flavor it, newspapers, and it was all included with the room rate. No extra fee for gym use. I also had a treatment at the spa and it too was fantastic. Dined at the Sushi restaurant one evening and had some of the most wonderful sushi I have ever had in my life. It was fantastically prepared, creative, was incredibly fresh, tasted amazing, and the staff of the restaurant were extremely attentive and helpful with ordering as well.

The restaurant had a surprisingly somewhat limited menu. Unless you've just got off a long train ride like I did, I'd venture out for food. For seafood lovers, there is a small but stylish sushi restaurant in the hotel as well. The bar/lounge appears to be a very popular hangout. It was crowded every night I was at the hotel.

Finding that hard to believe because the place seemed nearly deserted, we went online to try and book a room with a king bed directly through their hotel website, which showed available rooms. When we confronted Ms. Santiago with this information, catching her in a lie, she changed her response to, \"we don't have any king rooms available at the price you paid, we do have king rooms, but it will cost you an additional $100\". She then went on to explain that we booked a \"run of the mill\" room, and she could do nothing further for us. My husband said he didn't expect a 4 star hotel to have ANY \"run of the mill rooms\", understanding clearly her misuse of the term \"run of the house\". Two hours later and several phone calls to our online travel site and the hotel's corporate customer service number to complain, we finallly heard from another hotel mgr, Greg, who came to our room with keys to accomodate us with another room with a king bed. While he was very polite and apologized for our unpleasant experience, there was no remedy for the damage done by Lexi in treating us like third rate, very unwelcomed guests not to mention hours lost dealing with unnecessary problems. We refused to spend any more of our money at the hotel, and had a quite lovely meal at Anthony's Pier Four, where we dropped $250 for a very elegant dinner where we WERE treated with respect and class. This place may have a great location and nicely equipped rooms, but with a Mgr. like Ms. Santiago, they will never be 4 star. And shame on this hotel for charging ridiculous prices for wifi and parking. We were wrongly charged for mini bar items because we moved things around to make room for our own wine we purchased (again, we were NOT going to spend any more of our money at this place) and apparently when you move items it trips off the sensors in the fridge and charges you for those items, even if you put them back and they're still there!

The location, as other reviewers have noted, is at the edge of the financial district and it is not an ideal location for shopping. However, the North End is a fun (and scenic) 10 minute walk, South Station is a 5 minute walk, and Beacon Hill is about 10 minutes. The hotel is probably a 15 minute cab ride to Copley Square (Marriot, Hilton, Sheraton) and Newbury Street. The hotel is located on the water (a waterway, not the harbor) and is easily accessed via the water taxi from Logan. Next door, you will find the Federal Reserve, the Boston Fire Department, a bunch of the major Boston banks (State Street, Fidelity, etc..) as well as (in the vicinity): Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA), Boston World Trade Center (5 min walk), NE Aquarium (5 min walk). The staff is wonderful! Check-in was great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even after booking a discounted room from a popular hotel site. I was travelling with my wife and 2 children and we were looking for a room with lots of space.

Standard rooms are nice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the suites are great. The pool, and work out facilities, are the nicest that I have seen in any hotel in Boston.

But based on my recent stay I can say with certainty that this Hotel has gone downhill in just about all ways. I think it is incredibly overpriced for the dated rooms with stained throw pillows, the excessively dry air, the unaccommodating staff as they would not grant me a room with double beds despite my called in request, the fire engines roaring by all hours (have you heard of soundproofing?) and my favorite... $15 for microwaved scrambled eggs from room service! It's not the price that upsets me- its the microwaving of the eggs that is most disturbing and I KNOW the difference between pan scrambled and nuked! The room was in my name and my sister had parked in the garage and they told her they had to charge the parking to my room and would not let her pay out of pocket. I found this astonishing and not at all accommodating for a 5 star hotel! Why would you be required to pay for parking by room charge? What if a client was visiting me at the hotel for work- would I have to pay for their parking? What do people do when they park there for the spa or restaurant? And its not cheap at $40 a day. The hotel location is good. The doors to the hotel are incredibly heavy and the doormen just stand there- no hurry to open the door for you. I really doubt the guys over at the Four Seasons, albeit a favorite of mine, just watch the guests struggle with doors and luggage! I mean- seriously? 5 stars? Now, the one thing that they must change, as many other reviewers have discussed, is the sliding window behind the bed into the bathroom. Who approved that design is what I would like to know. I was staying with my sister on this last trip, and even when I stayed here with my husband, this was a very uncomfortable room amenity. Who wants to listen to people do anything from brush their teeth to other bathroom needs? The 'window' when closed still has a once inch open clearance and its right above your head! You hear EVERYTHING when someone else is in the bathroom. Need I say more? They should fill these windows in and be done with this ridiculous design as it does not aid in an enjoyable hotel stay. I'll give a shout out to the hotel bar. It has a happy hour and nightlife scene and thats a plus.

We've been to Boston before but were not familiar with the Intercontinental so we weren't sure what to expect. Well, we were pleasantly surprised. We booked the room through Priceline.com and got an excellent rate for our stay - it almost seemed too good to be true. The hotel is located in a great spot if you want to sightsee in Boston (and have good walking shoes!). Upon exiting the hotel 3 blocks to your left is the financial district, Boston Common & the start of the \"Freedom Trail\". 2 blocks to your right is Quincy Market, the Harbor Cruises, Columbus Park and so many restaurants. From Quincy Market it is a short walk to \"the North End\" for delicious Italian food & pastries in addition to the rest of the freedom trail. The one down side of the location is that it is across the street (6 lanes and a park) from a Boston Fire House. We were able to hear the rigs pulling out the first night of our stay. It was quiet the second night. The room was large and most importantly for me...CLEAN! The bathroom was huge. The bed was so comfortable we were afforded a great night's sleep. Because we had made our reservation through priceline, we were not able to request a \"king size\" bed in advance...but on arrival the girl at the desk was able to give us what we wanted. We did not eat in the hotel but we did go to the bar which was lively...it was fun to just \"people watch\". Even though the hotel was booked - there were 6 weddings there on Saturday - it did not seem crowded at all. Boston is such a great city and there is so much to do that we'll have to return. We did walk the freedom trail and learned some new stories from US history. We took a harbor cruise (45 minutes was just enough) and saw a few sites but mostly the Boston skyline and Charlestown. Loved the North End...had a delicious dinner at Lucca's...but if you're there on a Saturday night and plan on eatting in any \"recommended\" restaurants...make reservations. These places are small and most had lines waiting to get in or were just turning people away. We stood on line with a bunch of other folks to get into Mike's Pastry Shop to get canoli...or...in our case...a Boston Cream Puff & brownie...delicious! My favorite thing was sitting in Columbus Park on Sunday listening to a street performer playing guitar. The weather was so beautiful and his music was so soothing it made for a very relaxing time. The one downside was the parking fee...$39.00/night!!! Since we got such a great price on the room...I could swallow that fee...but had I paid over $200 for the room and had to pay that fee as well...I would have choked. So, I would definitely return to Boston and stay at the InterContinental Boston hotel.

The InterContinental hosted my wedding reception that night and--since it was an evening wedding--a lot of my family and friends stayed at the InterCon. All of them, including me and my wife, were evacuated with the rest of the hotel guests around 2:30 am. Sadly, my new wife and I spent our first night together sleeping on the ballroom floor of the Boston Harbor Hotel with the rest of our families (most of us in formal wear). If anybody has a reason to be upset with the InterContinental, it's us. Interestingly enough, we aren't upset - instead, we're quite the opposite. Despite that rather unlikely inconvenience, our wedding reception was absolutely fantastic. The gentlemen with whom we worked--Paul and Ralph--for a year leading up to our wedding were fully engaged in our planning and went out of their way to make our reception elegant, unique, and fun. On their recommendation, we served our guests an amazing meal that received rave reviews by all: pepper-crusted filet mignon with green and white asparagus and potato dauphinois; as well as hoisin-glazed sesame-crusted Chilean sea bass; both of which were cooked to perfection for our 200 guests. The band, Night Shift, was recommended by Paul and seriously blew away our guests (I have been told by most that they were the best band they have ever seen). With the exception of the fire (which was obviously beyond the control of the staff of the hotel) there is not a single detail I would change about our wedding reception. The entire staff was courteous, professional, detail-oriented, and genuinely concerned about the quality of our guests' stay. In my opinion, the staff of the hotel could not have been more accomodating to my wife and me or our guests. Many of our guests have told us that it was one of the best, most beautiful, and most fun weddings they've ever been to. In the end, I have heard nothing but rave reviews of the hotel and our reception. Yes, the fire was a fiasco, as fires tend to be. It wasn't exactly the way we planned to end our wedding night, which goes without saying. But I can say with confidence that the hotel did everything they could to turn this wrong right by taking care of our overnight guests, our parents, and us. Our planners called us the next morning to make sure we were ok, apologized profusely for what happened, and assured us that they would reimburse our guests for the evening and would take care of our parents and us for all of the trouble - all of which happened to our satisfaction. I would like to think that the fire was an abberation--something not likely to happen again anytime soon--and that the quality of the service and the accomodations are the norm. If you are planning an event in Boston and would like the perfect combination of luxury and style, I HIGHLY recommend the InterContinental. We plan to go back and spend our first anniversary there. --Patrick", "Date": "October 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens", "Title": "\u201cClassy hotel with all the necessary amenities and super comfortable beds.\u201d", "Author": "alagardener", "ReviewID": "UR83259292", "Content": "The rooms have a modern decor, very clean with fluffy linens and super comforable beds.

The hotel is a 10 minute walk or a short subway ride from central part of the city and parks (subway station is a block away).

Not having free wi-fi is a real inconvenience when you are in a new city. This won't change until people start refusing to pay these outrageous prices. Like all other high-end hotels the room service and mini-bar are also comically overpriced. $30 for some bacon, eggs, toast, and coffee. The mini-bar is computerized so be careful not to remove anything or you will be charged. They only leave a very small space in the refrigerator (about the size of 4 cans of coke) for personal use \u00e2\u20ac\u201c definitely not enough to hold dinner leftovers.

On the rear patio, there are relaxing places to sit with music and a outdoor bar. The hotel's interior design is contemporary and bright, not stuffy or gawdy. The registration desk could've used a third person, but the line still moved quickly. Bell hops were very helpful. We valed-parked the car at the hotel entrance. To retrieve the car, it was necessary to take a separate elevator to the underground garage and office, which was a little strange, but not that inconvenient. Parking was expensive, but not terrible compared to city hotels. The hotel common spaces were extremely clean and comfortable, as were the banquet areas. Hotel staff, including security guards, managers, bell hops, and room service attendants were all very pleasant. The rooms were a decent size. We had a view of the building under construction next door, as well as a sliver of the channel and Atlantic Avenue. In a nice twist, the bathroom is about as big as the rest of the room. There is a full glass shower, as well as a tub. Very spacious. One interesting feature is a window between the bathroom and the rest of the room. It can be slid closed, but light can shine through at night if someone is in the bathroom. Not a big deal. the room had a huge flat screen tv, plenty of drawers and closet space, a desk, and several chairs. It was a very comfortable, beautiful room. The mattress was not as comfy as I would've expected, but the pillows were nice. I think the best elements of this hotel are its proximity to South Station, the business district, and Quincy Market/North End; its contemporary design and appeal; and its cleanliness.", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "floral park", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "ew321", "ReviewID": "UR79253418", "Content": "Booked this through Priceline -- got a great rate.

They transferred me to the front desk (the number wasn't in the room or on the phone to call direct to the front desk like most hotels do). A very rude front desk person explained that just past the roof was the water so technically I had a water view room, so no, there wasn't any other rooms available, I had what I was supposed to have! The room itself was terrible. It was designed with an opening in the wall, between the bathroom and the bedroom, right above the headboard of the bed. The opening had sliding panels with opaque panels, and it didn't completely close off the space. The opening was in direct alignment with the room outside wall windows.

It is within walking distance to Quincy Market, Harbour area, and North End (& even Back Bay) Main issue we had : Booked 2 rooms, with a request for early check in (knowing that they can not guarantee of course). We checked in @ 1 pm, and thankfully, one of the rooms (deluxe city view) was available. However, the man who checked us in said he DOES NOT know when our 2nd rm would be ready (waterfront), but we gave him our phone no. I also did remind him that 3 pm is their listed & official \"Check In\" time, to which he did not respond. By 3:45 pm, we still had not heard from the front desk, & made inquiries at the front desk. By this time, the man from earlier was no longer at the front desk, and the woman we spoke to told us that our room would be ready \"soon\". So we decided to hang around and wait. By 4:30 pm, still no call, & inquired again. This time, they said the room was ready, but \"had to be given a final check through\"...FINALLY, at 4:45 pm, we got our room. The main problem we had here was that considering we checked in @ 1 pm, they would put their housekeeping on notice that the customer is already here, and ensure extra effort was given to make sure that our room would be ready by the official 3 pm time (or at least close to it) We felt that had we not been proactive & still exercised some degree of patience, we would not have gotten a call for our rooms until maybe even 6 pm !...We felt this was unacceptable for a luxury hotel, and greater steps should have been taken by front desk & housekeeping to ensure that their customers do not experience any unnecessary delays. Otherwise, don't advertise your check-in time as 3 pm ! For an InterContinental, we expect more. (On our last night, we & other guests on our floor were awoken @ 1:30 am, by a constant barrage of knocking, yelling & loud noises from the room next door who decided to throw a party. After 30 mins., we & others decided to call the hotel. It was so loud that the operator could hear the yelling on the phone, & some guests down the hall had to physically ask them to quiet down - to which one of the older guests simply responded, \"Well...we just had a wedding ...\" (Jeeez...)

I booked it on a whim through Hotwire (nonrefundable, nonexchangeable, non-everything) because the hotel we had our eye on (Seaport) was fully booked. It just so happened that after I booked the Intercontinental, the Lenox (#1 on Trip Advisor) knocked their prices down to the same as we had paid. I was extremely disappointed, but there was nothing to be done and our trip was more about us than the hotel we were to stay in. That being said - this hotel was wonderful. Check-in was a breeze...we arrived at around noon and knew we wouldn't get our room right away, but the front desk staff was kind enough to get the paperwork over with so we could just grab the keys when we came back from the Quincy Market (she also took down my cell number in case the room was ready ahead of time). They kept our bags in a secure room in the front lobby while we went to have lunch. We went to Quincy, had lunch, did some shopping and came back to a lovely room awaiting our arrival. We grabbed the keys, and went upstairs to settle in. We had just enough time to take a look around the room before our bags were delivered up to us. Here is one issue I had: they called the room a \"waterview\". It was not a waterview, and I knew from earlier reviews that their idea of a waterview was not concurrent with the customers' idea. However, we did not pay extra for a waterview and were not expecting it. We did not bother to order extra towels, as there were three already in the room each morning. I loved the Keurig coffee machine as I have the same one at home and I ended up needing a coffee 2-3 times during our stay to keep from tiring too much. Every feature of our room was lovely. The concierge was extremely helpful in directing us where to shop for my boyfriend's new shoes, and also where to go for dinner at night. If you're looking for a bar, i wouldn't recommend the one in the hotel as it's extremely expensive. After our two ordinary drinks (no premium liquor requested) turned out to be $30USD, we decided to search out a bar a couple blocks away. However, we know that hotel restaurants and bars are always pricier for their convenience than other places and there was a big crowd of people there (I assumed the business crowd after work in the area) around happy hour. The back area of the hotel was very nice and right on the water. We had drinks there both nights and enjoyed an incredible, panoramic view of the harbour. Checking out was just as easy - we had no extra charges to our room, so we were out hassle-free. The only other issue I had with this hotel was the extra charge for internet service. I brought my netbook with me knowing that the charge for internet was $15 per night, but I thought there would be places around the hotel where I could get WiFi. This wasn't that easy to find. The only times I was able to get free internet was in Harvard Square at the Starbucks and at the Museum of Science. We only had to check the internet for a few minutes once a day, so I was not about to pay $15 for those 5 minutes of internet use. Please provide free internet access in the future, as this is considered common by most customers staying at 4 to 5-star hotels. I would also like to say that there was nothing wrong with the location. There were ample fabulous restaurants in the area and shopping quite close as well. We felt no need to take the subway to any of these places and enjoyed the walks to and from. The area was very safe and not at all noisy at night, and we enjoyed the breeze from the harbour. TRY THE BARKING CRAB ACROSS THE BRIDGE. And Flour Bakery (Bobby Flay recommended for the Sticky Buns in \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\") for breakfast - also just across the bridge.

We'd never been to Boston and wanted to be in the Back Bay area, but couldn't get the deal we wanted for that popular area, even through Priceline. So we \"settled\" for the Intercontinental via Hotwire. The hotel is relatively new compared to most hotels in Boston, a result of the Big Dig that was completed several years ago. The hotel is plush, our room was modern and spacious and the king bed comfortable. The bathroom was roomy with a separate shower stall. We were treated fine at check-in, even though we booked our rooms through Hotwire. They attempted to put all 3 rooms near each other, ended up with 2 on the 11th floor and 1 on the 12th (top) floor, all facing the street. Noise was not a serious problem, even though the fire dept is across the street. Ok, the sliding glass between the bedroom and bathroom is not a good idea....even when shut, it lets light through in the middle of the night, and sounds through anytime. But it wasn't a deal buster, just a bit odd. Location: We took the water taxi ($10 each) from the airport right to the back of the hotel. The hotel is only 2 blocks / 5 minute walk from the South \"T\" Station. We all purchased 7 day T passes for $15 each, which we made good use of in our daily tourist adventures. Though if you're enegetic, you can walk to Faneuil Hall or Littel Italy. We walked home from Little Italy one evening, probably about 1 mile. What I'd recommend for tourists: -We did the Duck Tour on our first day. Lots of fun, the guide was hilarious. -\"Freedom Trail Foundation\" guided tour...departs from Boston Commons. This was my personal highlight of the trip. Cost was cheap ($13 adult). Our guide dressed in period costume, called himself \"Nathaniel ???\", was in character the entire 90+ minute walking trip, had a booming period speaking voice & great personality, and told stories that brought history to life. We enjoyed it so much, that we took his optional 90 minute tour departing from Faneuil Hall after a quick lunch break.... $7 for those that alreay paid the original $13. Note, you don't see the entire Freedom Trail on the guided tour. FOOD: -Scali's (147 Pearl St) - Right across the street. Authentic local place, good cheap breakfast, very popular with locals heading to work. -Tavern on the Water - On the Charlestown pier near the USS Constitution. Had lunch there. Good clam chowder. - Traittoria il Panino (11 Parmenter St) - There are unlimited Italian restaurants in the North End / Little Italy section. This unassuming restaurant was recommended by a local, and was wonderful. All 6 of us agreed this was our best meal in Boston. -Green Dragon Tavern (11 Marshall St) - Historic pub, good beer, had a great guitarist playing on Tuesday night.", "Date": "June 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cOne star for service, three for the room, overall a solid 2.\u201d", "Author": "TravelMonkey29", "ReviewID": "UR66781424", "Content": "I stayed at the IC Boston for two nights a Friday and Saturday.

I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the last time I felt that poorly treated by any hotel and they really need to get over themselves. I actually moved hotels for the rest of my stay up here. Service: The service was awful. The doormen were rude and unhelpful, I ended up hauling a roller bag, garment bag, laptop, and handbag up to my room alone with no luggage rack. Nobody ever helped me with the door either. I was so irritated by this. The desk was rude every time I called down. Seriously rude, acting like I was putting them out. Even when I called to order room service they acted like I needed them to move mountains. Also the wifi is pricey, something like $15 a day. It really seems like a rip off. Overall, with the number of great hotels in Boston, based on service alone, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably avoid this hotel in the future. Room: I had a Deluxe King Room with a waterview (#1007). View from the room was not that great. If I craned my neck the right way, I could see some water I think. Mostly I looked into the other wing of the hotel or down on a roof. All in all not much of an upgrade, but I guess it was quieter than a street view right? The room was very nice and well appointed, albeit on the smaller side. The arrangement of furniture was a bit awkward and the desk looked out the window which I am sure is ok and geared towards the business person who might be sitting there more. The bathroom was enormous, a little bit of a waste of space, but it was nice. The toiletries at this hotel are just ok. Towels and linens were very very soft and the bed was quite comfy. The lighting was well set up and convenient. The room had a safe, iron, mini-bar, and hair dryer. Food: I did order room service. It came to the room a little cold and was just ok. It was overpriced for what I got and I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend it. On top of an 18% gratuity there is a $5 service charge. I have traveled and do travel quite a bit and usually don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see that anymore. It was another way I felt nickel and dimed here.

Definitely got the sense that I was being looked down upon because how I booked my room...hey it's not my fault your company chooses to sell rooms through Hotwire...nobody's forcing you to!! Anyway, I told her no thanks and I took a chance and booked another night on Hotwire and fortunately I got the same hotel again. When I arrived, everything was much better than I expected based on my phone conversation with the hotel. The valet guys were very efficient and brought us right over to the elevators. At the front desk, I told the guy that I actually had two reservations for three nights. He said \"no problem\", offered me a King room without me even asking, and said he would connect the two reservations so I wouldn't have to check out after the first day and I could keep the same room for all 3 nights. Very pleasant and very helpful. Nice surprise compared to the woman I talked to on the phone. The room was basic but very nice. Everything was clean, neat, fairly spacious, comfortable bed, and nice bathroom. I wish we had that bed and bathroom in my house! The concierge was also very helpful in how to get around and suggesting places for dinner. On the morning of checkout, I wanted to place my luggage in the car but then still leave it there while attending the last day of my conference. The bellhop called down to valet to have the car brought out so I could pack our stuff...I just asked for access to the car but he said they would bring it up for me. Then they re-parked it for me. Yes, it's $39 per day, but you'll pay that most places for 24-hour parking in Boston. Plus, you get a full 24-hour period for that price which isn't so with other garages. One peeve...should provide free wi-fi in this day and age in a hotel in the financial district for the prices they would charge if not booked on a discount site.

By booking a last minute getaway, I got a great rate. They were kind enough to let me check in several hours early, even though I had not requested to do so in advance. The first room they put me in was nice enough, if unexceptional (I don't know why I still expect chain hotels, even nice ones, to be otherwise). Although my view was a construction site, I was not particularly bothered, as I didn't expect workers to be there at night or on Sunday. The room had a great bathroom, very clean with a big, deep tub. There was also a sturdy umbrella in the closet, a nice touch which turned out to be a necessary accessory the first day there. All was well until I was going to go to sleep that evening, and realized that a previous guest had thrown up on either the bed or one of the pillows. I moved to the other bed in the room and was able to sleep, but it was again the first thing I smelled when I got up in the morning. Before heading out that day, I asked at the desk if I could be moved and left a cell phone number. Within a couple of hours I received a very gracious and apologetic message from one of the managers. She moved me to one of the waterfront rooms on a higher floor, which was quite bright and spacious, and of course had a gorgeous view! Things occasionally are wrong with hotel stays no matter what the cost or reputation of the establishment, of course, but the difference between average and poor hotels and good ones is this kind of prompt and courteous response to rectify any issues. The Intercontinental did a great job on this. Other than that, the location is fine -- it is a couple of minutes walk to Downtown Crossing or the Common, or you can check out the nice new parkway that resulted from the Big Dig, starting right outside the hotel's door. The waterfront is pretty, and the hotel has a pleasant seating area arranged with tables, chairs and umbrellas so you can eat outdoors and enjoy the water view.

One of the things that I appreciated at checkout was that the person at the counter went over each item in my bill to make sure that all charges were accurate. The only sour note occurred as I was leaving: if you take advantage of valet parking at the front of the hotel at check-in, you have to pick up the car next door in the garage. There's an elevator from the area behind the lobby, though it's somewhat tough to find. I had called ahead and the car was ready, but it seems that the valets didn't think my Sentra was worth any attention. So I got the keys from a man behind a window, loaded up the luggage myself and drove out. No tip for them.

I was there for business. My previous experiences were OK but this latest one has caused me to decide to never stay at the hotel again. I booked my travel through my employer's contracted travel agent. Upon check-in I was notified by the front desk clerk that the hotel would not honor my reservation which included a free breakfast. I stated that it had always been included in my rate in the past and that I had it in writing. I was told someone would contact me in my room. A half hour later a woman phones me and says that she needs a copy of my reservation. She comes to my room to retrieve a copy of my reservation confirmation. She later calls to say that they would not honor the reservation and that I need to speak to my travel agent. So I call the travel agent. They state that it is included in the rate and that they spoke to a hotel representative who informed them to tell me to return to the front desk and the matter would be corrected. Now I know this is only a free breakfast but at this point I was getting annoyed at the lack of customer friendly service and that I was being treated like I was trying to obtain something by fraud. I speak to the front desk manager. He tells me that my travel agent lied on the phone and that he would not honor my printed reservation. He continued in a very nasty and condescending tone. I asked for the manager and he stated that she was not available and that she would call me at 9AM the next morning. The next day the manager never calls. I ask to speak to her and she says that she spoke to the front desk manager the night before about the issue, even though he told me she was unavailable. The funny thing is in the near future I will be in Boston for long periods of time and the Intercontinental has lost my business forever. Other thoughts: A very busy fire house is right across the street and the sirens can be annoying at times. The hotel charges for everything.

The rate was relatively expensive, but a good value for a luxurious 5-star hotel in beautiful Boston, MA on a Saturday night. We easily checked into the hotel and received a beautiful corner room with a city view. The room was stylish, sexy, spacious and immaculately clean. It had an extremely comfy bed with a lounge/couch at the foot of the bed, desk, other seating, and a mini bar with a tiny section available for your own food/drink (not too much fits in it, but they do offer a bucket and ice machine so we could put our champagne in there instead). The bed has a window above it with small sliding doors that can be opened to look from the bathroom into the bedroom. This little design feature lets you watch the flatscreen TV from the bathroom and if you're really enjoying the change of scenery from the bedroom they even provide a phone to use next to the toilet. I guess it's just one of those \"extras\" you get with the 5th star! My favorite part of the HUGE bathroom though was the separate walk-in shower and bath. Though I didn't try the bath, it looked nice, and the shower had sufficient water pressure. The shower doors are clear though, so if you had the sliding window doors open to watch your favorite game or show on TV you may be a little exposed to the rest of the room. On that note, I agree that this hotel would only really suit couples or solo business travelers (although I'm not sure how rooms with 2 beds are set up!) The room was quiet and the location felt safe. We used the indoor pool which was cool because the glass roof allowed for a nice view of city buildings. The hotel isn't in the heart of Boston - it is closer to the waterfront which is nice, but not extremely convenient to other parts of the city if you're a tourist, i.e. Fenway Park, theater district etc. Faneuil Hall was walkable but it was a pretty far walk and we took a cab back at night. I didn't use the T but I think the closest stop is South Station. We're not Boston tourists and we were only there for one night so we braved the freezing cold to walk to Joe's American Bar and Grill on the waterfront and then to Faneuil from there. We stopped in at RumBa before heading up to our room, but didn't stay for long since we were tired. The atmosphere seemed nice and I would probably go back to the bar another time even if not staying as a hotel guest.

First off, the hotel appears very new and has a great finish to what you would expect from a new Interncontinental hotel. Finishes were nice and really a nice room. My main problem with this hotel is the awful service. My assistant made an incorrect booking for my one-night stay (she booked me to arrive the previous night). She used hotwire to book and we got a very decent rate for the stay. So when I arrived at the hotel, the front desk staff said I didn't have a room for that current night for a stay. Realizing my own staff's mistake, I inquired about just booking a room for the current evening. After 10 minutes of waiting at the front desk, the front desk informed me I would be charged rack rate to stay in the current evening. I asked the front desk if I could get a rate discount similar to hotwire and the front desk worker said, \"You can try to book it on hotwire at our business center.\" I inquired if I had to pay to use their business center and the front desk worker said, \"Yes.\" I informed the front desk worker that I'm about to book another night's room at his hotel and I didn't have any computer access. Once again, I asked him if i could just borrow a computer in their business center to book a room at his hotel. Asked the concierge and he also stated, \"you'll have to pay a fee to use our computer's in the business center!\" Here is my huge beef with this IHG Boston: the service is terrible. I've already paid 1 unused hotel night due to my error. I'm fine with this. I asked to see if IHG could allow me to book another night if they could just allow me to use a computer for THREE MINUTES just to book it on hotwire. Their response both times were in the negative tone. What I don't appreciate is the cold, inflexible nature with which this hotel is run. No sense of hospitality or soft-skills to work with different problems. I didn't appreciate being Nickel-And-Dimed (even if it was at the company's expense) and I would never recommend staying at this place.

We chose this hotel based on location and price -- we got a deal on hotwire -- The downtown location is on the wharf and the sea aquarium is two blocks away. Fanueil Hall and markets are also 3-4 blocks away and that area had a lot of places to eat and catch a drink while sightseeing. We felt very safe at night walking around downtown to get back to the hotel. There are tons of Irish bars ideally located near the hotel as well. The hotel staff at check in was very accomodating and informative about the area. We arrived early at 1pm and -- Linh at the front desk -- helped get us squared away in a room on the spot. The room was modern and spacious. Large bedroom area with chase lounge and arm chair. We had a king bed that was super comfy with soft linens and lots of feather pillows. (Firm pillows are by request) Seperate desk with several outlets so you can charge up your computer and smart phone all in one. The bathroom was very large with seperate soaking tub and shower stall that had two shower heads! Great water pressure too which is hard to find at a large hotel. Cleaning staff was efficient; we stepped out for lunch and within an half hour our room was clean and spotless. We had room service one night and it was fast, within 10-15 min. of ordering. We got the chicken fingers so I cant tell you about the fine dining! The downstairs bar, Rumba, was packed both Friday and Saturday night ; looked like a popular spot. It is a champagne bar with an extensive selection. It is pricey though and drinks run about $10 a pop -- but it was a nice place to go for a night cap. There is also a commercial lobster shipping company the next block over from the hotel. Go out the hotel and to the right and you can see it on the corner -- James Hook and Company. We ate there several times for a quick lobster roll. It was very good and interesting to look inside the shop to see all the ranges of lobster sizes -- 1 pound all the way up to monster lobsters with claws as big as your head.

The hotel is less than 10 minutes (walking) from South Station. Checked in around 5pm, no problems. The room was quite nice, pretty much just like the website described it. The view was the Boston Fire Station, which isn't a bad view, and was really nice to look at in the dark (everything lit up). We walked toward Fanuel Hall, and ended up having dinner at Jose McIntyres. (we bypassed the hotel restaurant- I'm sure they would excellent, but they were pricey). Spent the evening walking around Fanuel Hall, then back to the hotel. The bed was very comfortable- I believe the pillows and comforter were down. There was a shower stall and a soaking tub. Nice soaps,shampoos, etc. Check out was quick and easy. It was a very nice hotel for a free stay, pretty much what I expected.

The bathroom was exquisite with a deep soaking tub and separate shower. I bought the \"breakfast\" package, which was a good value. Breakfast was delicious, and the service was great. The main restaurant was never crowded, and there was an outside terrace on which we could dine.

You see, the hotel is constructed in 3 sections. The 2 outer sections are condos. They rise higher, are built out further than the middle section, which is the hotel section. Therefore, when we looked out our window, most of the view was of the side walls of the two outer towers, with a little glimpse of the channel, which was just plain ugly. Not worth $80. We stayed in the room, but if we could go back in time, we would have just downgraded back to a regular room. The location is good, but not ideal for this hotel, as there are plenty of nice hotels closer to the \"action\" of the harbor, South Side, and markets.

We had booked our room through Hotwire. The lady that I spoke with kept insisting that we could not get a refund for the missed evening. What is weird is that I never asked.

All of this being said in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tough economic times I am sure that very few leisure travelers will pay the rather high prices they charge, so I assume that 90 percent of their customers during the week are business travelers.

The foyer is huge, elegantly furnished, even had a log fire in a corner. A lot of noise in the foyer in the evenings from the bar Rhumba, but this was not transmitted to other parts of the hotel. Helpful bellhops and friendly and informative check-in. Fast elevators, no delays or queues for these during our stay. The room was great.

We arrived at the hotel around 9:00 on Friday night and checked in-they were able to accomodate our request for two beds. Check in was very quick and friendly. Bellman was there to help with bags. As many have mentioned the lobby is really pretty, it is large with several seating areas about. The bar was LIVE! Lots of people in there having a great time. Wish we could have joined them! Our room was on the 12th (top floor) and it was awesome! It was huge!! I believe it was meant to be part of a suite because the room next door did not have it's own # or doorbell. Therefore there was no one in the room next door. Large closet with a safe (big enough to hold the lap top). Very large bathroom with separate shower and giant tub. Lots of room to store your stuff-loads of towels. Why only one bathrobe? I'm sure they would have brought more had we asked-we didn't. We did not have the bathroom window we've heard so much about The beds and the bedding were so comfortable and the blackout curtains did the trick-we slept like rocks. It was a really quiet room. . never heard another soul. Flat screen TV on top of a dresser which held the mini bar -don't touch anything you don't want to pay for-and it had a couple of drawers. There was also a desk and a chair, ottoman and reading lamp. There was still plenty of room to move around. We had a view of the opposite side of the building (it's kind of U shaped) and a little bit of the water-it was just fine. Never had to wait for an elevator The concierge was very helpful-we spoke to her everyday to solicit advice and she did not fail us! There was always a doorman out front to greet us and get a cab or direct us. The room was clean and pretty and well cleaned everyday. Gym was huge and had tons of machines and free weights-water and towels. The lap pool was nice too. Didn't eat at either of the restaurants but they looked nice. Tried to have lunch at Miel but they stop serving at 2:30 and we got there too late-our fault for not looking. I liked the location. We could walk to everything-which we did. We originally had booked a room at the Marriott Copely Place and I'm glad we did not end up in that location. It was very busy and it was attached to a pretty generic mall. So there you have all the positive aspects of this really pretty, well run hotel. Here are the things that kept me from rating the Intercontinental as \"excellent\" (although there are many excellent aspects of the hotel and most of my gripes are small and to be fair, we did not attempt to get any of the fixable things fixed). Some of this you'll have seen if you've read through the other reviews. *no in room coffee maker!! What the heck? You have get dressed and go down to the restaurant to get a cup of coffee-lame. *no free wi-fi. Also lame. You can go across the street to the bagel shop though. *the ESPN channel was really fuzzy-tough on my husband on the days of NCAA games. *there was something wrong with our phone. Twice during the first night it took itself off the hook and we got that lovely recorded message echoing through the room \"if you'd like to make a call, please hang up and dial again . . .\" and then we received calls from the front desk twice regarding service requests we never made. Not a big deal-just more odd than anything. I'm sure they would have fixed it had we mentioned it to anyone. *no hot tub on the property *the hot water in the tub in our room did not work *room service was quick and friendly but WAY overpriced-and incomplete set up -ordered two pots of coffee they only sent one cup, for example. *it would have been nice to have some more information on the Boston area, (restaurants, schedule of local events etc.) and hotel info in the room. The hotel info (such as a property map and spa info etc and some local info) and a Bpston Infomercial are all on the TV.

Upon arriving, we were treated well both by the valet and the front desk attendant. I was pleasantly surprised since many other reviewers on this site had nothing good to say about the service they encountered. We had no problem, everyone was nice and very helpful. Just like the website advertised, the rooms were large, clean, quiet and ours had a great corner view of the Boston Fire Department and Rowe's Wharf. I know at least one other reviewer complained about the Fire House noise, but we didn't hear anything, or simply didn't notice. The hotel seemed empty, too, as we didn't hear very much other noise, either, excepting the occasional door slam down the hallway. The location couldn't be better, as we walked to the North End the first night of our stay in about 15 -20 minutes. The hotel is also a block away from South Station and you can get almost anywhere in minutes from there. I only had a few gripes about the room itself, but mostly about its design, which is not something that will change anytime soon. I don't know who thought a glass partition over the bed directly into the bathroom was a good idea, but it creates a bit of a problem when you get up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night and wake your sleeping mate with the light through the frosted glass. I took to using just the vanity mirror light in the middle of the night, which also meant feeling around for switches in the dark. The soaking tub is another major selling point on their website, but I couldn't really relax since I had to be all folded up just so I could fit (I'm 5'9\".) It wasn't what I'd consider \"deep\", either. The biggest problem turned out to be the internet. My boyfriend brought his laptop and paid the $14.95 for the wireless internet, but even when plugged in to the network directly, the service crawled along at a frustratingly slow pace. If you have to pay for the high speed internet, it would help for it to actually be high speed. If I were travelling on business, I'd probably get angry fairly quickly. I don't see how anyone would be able to work with that. Overall, we had a wonderful stay at this hotel, especially for the Hotwire price.

Beautiful, huge bathroom. Convenient desk and plugs for electronics. We had no problems with service - everyone was very friendly and willing to help. The bar was convenient - they let us take a glass of wine up to the room without any hesitation. There were two main problems. The sliding window between the bedroom and the bathroom is a total design disaster for couples. First, it does not completely close at the bottom, so all sounds (and smells) waft right into the bedroom, directly over the bed. Second, it has only a frosted glass panel, so, if anyone goes into the bathroom in the middle of the night, the light shines through into the bedroom, waking up the other party. (The bathroom was pitch dark at night -- and, since it was all marble, you really needed light to ensure you didn't kill yourself.) Anyway, the bathroom quickly became the joke of the trip, and if nothing else, will be one of the memories of our trip to Boston. The other problem perhaps is not unique to Intercontinental. Since everything now seems to be digital, it is nearly impossible to have a room completely dark at night. The flat screen TV had a red glowing light. The phone had a green glowing light. The clock had a blue glowing light. The sprinkler system had a white flashing light. The curtains would not close completely. It struck me as ironic that there was so much light in the room where it needed to be dark and positively no light in the bathroom, where just a little of that glow would have been helpful. There were a few other minor things. There was no coffeemaker. Also, no lotion in the bathroom to start, but they brought some the next day without me asking. The light on the make-up mirror did not work - until they cleaned the room - and then it did. Until the next day - and then it didn't again. One of the light bulbs had burnt out on a lamp - we did not mention it and I don't think it ever got replaced. WiFi service was a bit pricey at $14.95 /day or $6.95 hour. The location was okay for us - it was easy to find places to eat breakfast and to get on the T.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a little irritating when you ask the front desk or concierge for a place to grab breakfast and the only place they can think of is the very expensive hotel restaurant, when there are a number of Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, and delis in the area. Given the room rates we were paying, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t justify paying even more money to eat meals in the hotel. Also it is not a good hotel for business. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153business center\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is just two computers tucked into a corner of the tiny gift shop/mini-mart, with printer, fax, etc. behind a counter staffed by a somewhat surly staffer. If you have your own laptop, wired and wifi internet is available but is not free, even in the public areas ($15 for 24 hours). And they charged me more than $17 (aka \u00e2\u20ac\u0153package processing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd fee) to receive one Fed Ex package that was shipped to me. All of this left a somewhat bad taste, for a five-star hotel that touts its business services. It appears that the operations of the business services is contracted out to Penfields, but still, at $400 / night for some rooms, it seems petty to nickel and dime guests for this type of stuff.

In addition, I requested hypoallergenic pillows, blankets and asked that my bed linens be completely changed due to down contamination. The hotel responded immediately and sent someone to bring the pillows, blankets, take away the comforter and linens. I asked when the new linens would arrive and the person said soon. I needed to leave for a meeting and then a late evening. Upon my late return to my room, I found my bed WITHOUT linens but the blankets were made up over the mattress pad. No sheets! I was appalled. Surely any budget hotel could do better than that. I phoned guest services immediately and they just couldn't understand what happened but apologized and sent someone to make up the unmade bed. I asked to speak to the manager on duty but only got a front desk clerk. I asked that the hotel manager contact me the following morning. I received a voice mail the following day from a housekeeping manager assistant who apologized. The excuse was that due to language, somebody misunderstood. What hotel staff person who speaks any other language thinks that a guest wants an unmade bed without linens? For $400 a night for 4 nights, I really expected something more than an excuse. It is apparent that they don't expect guests to return. As it turned out the bed after all that commotion was quite uncomfortable. It was a very disappointing stay. If you have any problems, don't expect anything more than a simple apology from the front desk. They won't let you talk to a manager.

The lobby is a bit stark. Rooms are well done. Bathrooms very nice. Beds not that comfortable, surprisingly. We were upgraded to a suite and it was huge, with windows that went on forever. Very nicely done, but not ultra luxe, frankly. Good views to the canal and the airport in the distance. We could have lived in there for a week, easily. Yet, it isn't a \"warm and friendly\" kind of property. The service is somewhat distant. I guess that is fine for a business traveler, perhaps, but, I think if you wanted to you could check in, spend a couple of days, and check out, and have no contact with any hotel employee, except maybe for the on the ball bellmen. The check in desk was crowded and the concierges seemed a bit inexperienced. And, at the rates they charge there was no turn down service at night. While you might think that is no big deal, it should be. When we asked about it on check out we were told, \"it is available on request.\" In a five star city hotel such service is standard, not on request.

We got some push back from the front desk initially, but they relented and moved us in the end. We ended up in a room on the 11th floor facing the city (the fire hall). This was fine. It was a corner room so lots of windows and natural light and neighbours only on one side. We were able to check in at 10am. Although, I would not have expected anything less because we had actually paid for the previous night and were unable to use it due to a missed flight connection. When we asked to move rooms we were told we would not be able to check in until 3pm and that there would be no guarantee. It took some time to explain that we should be able to stay in our current room and move later because we had technically already paid for the night, even if we didn't arrive until the morning. All I wanted was to freshen up after more than 24hrs of travel then head out sightseeing. In the end this was accommodated. However, the process to get there was a bit painful. NEGATIVES The service in Miel, the restaurant, was TERRIBLE. At brunch we were greeted by a waiter who explained the brunch menu to us and then actually said he wasn't our waiter and walked away. As he did this I was in the middle of asking for a drink and he turned and said he supposed he could do that for us even though he wasn't our waiter. Then somehow he became our waiter, but basically ignored us. I eventually got up and asked the hostess to either get us a waiter who wished to wait on us or to move us to another waiter's section. We got the same waiter, but he was obviously told to smarten up. The service improved, but still wasn't great. However, it should be noted that the crepes (both sweet and savoury) were fantastic. We ate at Miel late at night (just past midnight) one evening. Again, the food was fantastic. The service was slow and frankly painful to watch. The restuarant had about 5 occupied tables and two servers. Between then they couldn't determine who was doing what and as a result we waited for bread, for drinks, for everything really. The food preparation was slow for such an empty restuarant. Surely they would realize that what people want at that time of night is a quick bite, not a lingering meal. During both instances in Miel we noted that the wait staff dragged their feet (literally shuffled around), spoke at a barely audible level, and seemed annoyed to be asked to do anything for you. The business centre is a corner of the convenience store and the hours are not clearly marked. The computers face out so all the customers can see what you are doing. The room didn't have a hotel information book so it was hard to determine what the amenities were and what the various hours and costs for certain amenities were. When I asked the front desk told me that they don't put these books in rooms. This was frustrating as I had to look everything up on the TV and it was slow. The bell hops and door staff were great until check out day when we actually had to step onto the road and hail our own cab. The sliding frosted glass windows that link the bathroom to the bedroom were a terrible design flaw. Fine if you are in the room alone, but with a partner to meant that all activity in the bathroom was easily heard by the person in the bedroom. There is a gaping hole at the bottom of the sliding windows so any bathroom odour leaks into the bedroom. Also, when you get up in the night (or are the first to wake in the morning) and turn the bathroom light on it completely illuminates the bedroom and disturbs your partner.

We have stayed at the IC in Atlanta and I like the IC properties. The IC in Boston is just gorgeous! Gleaming modern d\u00c3\u00a9cor, two incredibly hip hotel bars (RUMBA and SUSHI TEC) and rooms that are really gorgeous. If you want young, hip, and modern this is your place. I enjoyed the bar scene there so much I ended up going back with a friend the next night even though we had moved to a different hotel for a business conference. The rooms are spacious and have some very nice amenities such as small reading lights on the bed and a door that slides open to the tub. We paid extra for the club level. Note if you stay at any IC property they always offer you an upgrade club level at check in for just a bit more money. Sometimes, as in our case, the front desk folks forget to offer the upgrade. We reminded them as we checked in and got the upgrade for only $50 more. I feel the club level is worth a bit extra as it entitles you to drinks, hot appetizers at night, bottled water, juice etc and a fairly large breakfast. In fact, at both the IC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s we have stayed in the breakfast buffet included in the club lounge is exactly the same as the one in their main restaurant. I do have some minor gripes about the Boston IC. When we arrived no doorman was there to help us with our baggage. We found that the service across the board was friendly but young, slow and inexperienced. For example, I ordered an expensive bottle of champagne while I sat in the outdoor patio area which is clearly set up as part of their bar. The waiter was very nice but young. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the price when I asked, he took at least 40 minutes to bring out my champagne and complained that he was the only waiter working this large area. The concierge in the evening at the club level couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even recommend a good Italian restaurant when asked\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6Hello? What exactly does a concierge at the club level do if they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even answer a basic question like that?!? If you are trying for a world class hotel that caters to top executives and business travelers, they are going to expect veteran service by well informed and trained staff. The Boston IC is really lagging in that department. We did not get nightly turn down service as we normally do in the Atlanta property, our room had some minor issues (lights burned out, phone not working) that further made me feel service was not what it needs to be.

The bathrooms are even better. Great tub and a separate shower; both with great fixtures. The sliding window between the bath and room is an innovative design that we enjoyed. But here is an example of a \"little thing\" that separates the great hotels from the very good. The IC linens are a 60/40 cotton/poly blend. Why not spend a few extra bucks on fine quality 100% cotton sheets? Other reviewers have made points about there not being a coffee maker in the room. I can live with that....Ritz Carlton and Four Seasons don't have coffee makers in their rooms either. I was glad to find complimentary coffee available in the lobby on Saturday (between 5:00 am and 7:00 am). However, when I went down on Sunday morning, I was told \"we don't put the coffee out on Sunday\". Why not? Another \"little thing\" that separates the great from the very good.

Drive cater-corner to the hotel to International Place. $9.00/day covered parking on the weekend and after 4:30 on Friday.

I spent 4 nights here over the 4th of July weekend and overall, I was very pleased with this hotel. I got a great rate of $203 on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Web site (compared to earlier rate postings of $415 a night). For $203 a night, this hotel is a five-star gem and an excellent value. The room and bathroom were quite spacious, with tasteful, contemporary design. The gym, pool and spa are excellent. The staff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from the front desk, to the spa, to housekeeping, to the bar - was professional, pleasant and accommodating. No complaints. Previous postings mention criticisms about the lobby design being too cold and stark. I found the lobby warm, elegant and inviting. I had cocktails at Rumba (the hotel bar) with friends and it was quite crowded with young, hip people. The cocktails were great and the atmosphere fun. Also, some reviewers mention that the hotel is noisy with paper thin walls. My experience was entirely different \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my room was extremely quiet, not hearing hardly anything outside or inside the hotel. It was very peaceful and relaxing. And there were people in the room next door. So, for $203 a night, I would highly recommend this hotel. However, if I paid the original going rate of $415, I would have been a little disappointed. There were a couple of minor hiccups that I was willing to overlook given the rate I paid. First of all, our room was on the harbor side as opposed to the city side. When I reserved it, it was marketed as a harbor view room. When I checked in, the front desk person indicated this was a room with a nice view of the harbor. Well\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.not exactly. The hotel has a sort-of U-shape design. My room was on the harbor side of the hotel but my view was of the rooms on the other side of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153U\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Only if you were standing right at the window and peering to the side did you see the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153harbor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And the view was not of the harbor but rather a canal and the buildings on the other side. So, it was misleading to say the room had a harbor view. Again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for $203, the room and view were fine. However, if I paid $415, I would have been annoyed. One other misstep was that I called the hotel prior to arriving to ask if the rooms had IPod docking stations. I was told yes. I arrived to discover that no rooms have IPod docking stations. When I mentioned this to the concierge, Marc Simoneau, he apologized profusely for the miscommunication and thanked me for bringing it to his attention. Lastly, a couple of reviewers mentioned that the lack of a coffee maker in the room was a mark against the hotel. I agree. At the very least, the hotel should have coffee in the lobby, preferably complimentary. It would have been nice to just be able to go downstairs and either have coffee there or bring it back to the room. Instead I had to walk 5-7 minutes outside the hotel in the Financial District to locate a place (which I did \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a Dunkin Donuts). Otherwise, you have to go to Miel, a rather fancy hotel restaurant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c too fancy if you just want to have coffee. Or, order coffee through room service, which would have cost $20 for a pot of coffee (cost plus delivery charge and gratuity included). These issues were minor because of the very reasonable rate that I paid. All-in-all, my experience at the Intercontinental was very positive.

The only small negative I would have to say is the internet cost and a problem we had with the safe.

Meantime they sent us to the lobby to use one of their safes and they only had a tiny one not big enough for the purse we wanted to leave there.

New fancy cardio equiptment. Your welcome to the hotel is cordial at best. They take your car for valet (about $40/day) and they will send a bellman to help you (or at least they offered one to me because I am female AND I gave the man at the curb a tip.) We were able to roll our ownbags into the hotel. There is no doorman. Just the guy at the curb and a bellhop inside the door. You just go through a large revolving door yourself. The staff at the desk was business like and didn't make you feel like most higher end hotels. Perhaps it was that we booked through Hotwire and paid a really great rate. Perhaps they just aren't warm and fuzzy. We were well dressed and certainly looked like we belonged there, but they did confirm that I had booked through Hotwire, so they knew I didn't pay top dollar. Just a note: they didn't seem to be gushing over anybody else either, so perhaps it was just there way. Arrived at the room through a fancy lobby with Anthony Quinn's artwork on display (interesting) and found the room very nice. All the things a high end hotel should have. There was no need to take pictures. They all look the same and the hotel is only 2 years old, so you know what you are getting. Bathroom was clean and nice, but we had to ask for extra towels and they must have figured that we only need ed them once because we had the same small number of towels the next day. The bath products were a strange brand, but on the last day they must have gotten their regular \"fancy french brand\" back, because we had nicer shampoo. As for linen count, I have stayed in 5 star hotels all over the world and the linens here were just fine. They were appropriate (and I am really particular) and certainly not 100 thread count as stated in an earlier review. The only bedding issue I had was that the pillows were really hard. They do have little reading lights by the side of the bed that were really great because they allow others in the room to sleep in the dark while you read! There is no turndown service (which I thought was weird) and at times when you press the button on the phone for \"any service they can help you with\", they do not answer. USA Today delivered during the week but none on Saturday. Internet is about $14/DAY and if you have more than one laptop, you are charged per IP address. Also, if you want to use your laptop in the lobby you are charged about $5/hour. Drinks in the lobby or out on the rear patio start at about $10 each. The lobby bar gets very loud at night. There is a Sushi-teq restaurant that is tiny, but also serves drinks and sushi on the beautiful back patio overlooking the water. The area is small and if you don't get there early you just won't get seated. They take a waiting list, but people just don't seem to get up. My daughter and I tried to get seated around 7pm. They told us to come back in a half hour, so we went back up to the room. At 7:30...Still no table. We then sat in the lounge had a snack and waited. Around 9 they \"DID US A FAVOR\" and got us a seat. You really need to just stand around and hover or they will seat somebody else. It was expensive, the sushi was very \"American\", not very good if you actually eat sushi (non sushi eaters thought it was great ~ they always like potato chips and cream cheese in their sushi :)The desserts, which came from the French Bistro in the hotel were not great. I decided the high cost was paid for a really nice outdoor dining experience on a beautiful summer night. If you want breakfast or a sandwich, room service, as anywhere, is very expensive and only OK. You can walk out the back of the hotel to the right. Walk over a tiny bridge and on the right is Finagle a Bagel and if you walk a couple blocks up on the left (I believe it was Farnsworth Street) is Flour Bakery & Cafe. They have daily specials, gorgeouscakes and the most delicious Raspberry seltzer. They make their own raspberry syrup and it is really good! Also an awesome Grilled BLT with applewood smoked bacon that is lush. You can also walk out the front of the hotel turn right and walk about 3 blocks till you see the giant American Flag hanging down at Rowes Wharf. Just past that is a little cafe (I think it was called Rudi's, but I don't remember) where you can get coffee and pastries or eggs and eat inside or out. Reviews have noted that the staff is rude, which we were expecting, but did not experience. We found the location of the hotel was upscale and safe feeling, but not a lot right there. You could walk about 10 minutes to Faniuel Hall where there were lots of expensive outdoor dining options, that were packed (again, you are paying for being outside in the middle of the action, which is fun sometimes)and a food court that I assume would be less costly. Food court and stores close between 8 and 9 on Friday nights. Other than that, we took cabs, which seemed to eat up the Hotwire savings. We could have stayed in the Copely Square area near Newburry Street and walked everywhere or taken the green line T. This hotel was not on that train line and it would have meant switching trains which we just didn't have time to figure out. If you need to be in the Cambrige are for schools such as Harvard, Mit, etc. You could get a direct train from where we were. Anyway, a cab to BU ran about $15 in each direction. We figured out if we wandered around and headed up toward Newbury it was cheaper to get a cab back to the hotel from there. All and all it was a fabulous hotel for under $200/night in Boston, but if I was paying regular prices I would pick either a better area or a hotel with more gracious service. We will be back in August and October and we will be staying someplace else, regardless of price. It just wasn't convenient enough for us.

Thankfully some of my coworkers and I figured out a system to get all of us through the door. The rooms are nicely decorated and the bathrooms are great looking. However when I took one of the white towels and wiped up the water that I'd dripped on the tile floor so that I wouldn't slip and fall later the towel turned BLACK, so they had obviously not washed the floor in a while which was pretty off putting. I also didn't get a newspaper for 3/5 nights that I stayed. (I would have complained but I didn't notice that it was advertized when I booked the reservation.) The sheets were so poor that I felt like I got a free exfoliation...I'd estimate 100 thread count if they make them that low. Not having a coffee maker does make the place look cheap, I was just as shocked as the other reviewers about this. I also had the issue with the minibar charges (they AUTOMATICALLY charge you if you just BUMP the stuff in there)--however they weren't so nice about taking them off. I had to argue with them to get them taken off. This was the kicker for me though. Since I wasn't footing the bill I wasn't too irritated with all of the other problems that I had...However on my second day there I returned to my room at 6pm that I had left at 7:15am only to find it NOT CLEANED. When I called down to tell them at the front desk that my room wasn't cleaned they didn't even aplogize. They insinuated that I was mistaken. As if I wouldn't know!! I thought that was rude. Once I convinced them that I wasn't mistaken I waited 30 min for someone to show up to clean the room. I was asked to wait outside in the hall...so there I stood looking like an idiot. The last straw for me was the next night I was left with 0 washcloths and had to call 2 times to get someone to come up with one...and then the guy showed up with a bath towel and no wash cloth.

We booked through Hotwire in March and received an excellant rate. Rooms were not ready when we arrived and the bell staff held our bags for us. We enjoyed a couple of cocktails in the bar - Rumba - service and drinks provided by Kevin were fantastic. Prices are high but Kevin does make a great drink! After a short stroll to Fanueil Hall for a late lunch we were able to check in. Our party had 2 rooms on the 7th floor - ours was a corner room and the views were great from two walls of windows. Our companions room was an interior and happened to be slightly larger than ours. The rooms are definitely gorgeous. Very plush and comfortable. The bathrooms are to die for and I could have spent the entire 4 days in there! The glassed in shower is huge and water pressure was very good and my husband soaked in the giant tub one night after a day of walking in Boston! He enjoyed that immensely! Some people have mentioned that they don't like the sliding windows between the bathroom and bedroom but it is great for TV watching if you are getting ready to go out. Bath was well stocked with lots of towels, a hair dryer and Q-tips, cotton balls, etc. The bed was extremely comfortable and triple sheeted. If you don't sleep well here you're just not doing enough walking! Beware the dreaded mini-bar! If you even look at it the sensors go off saying you have purchased something. We had to have charges removed from both rooms, as we were merely trying to find a place to store our own wine. Charges were removed without hassle. The only drawback to the I/C is the fact there is no in-room coffee and a pot from room service will set you back $10 plus gratuity, service charge and administrative fee - what? What's to \"administrate\" about a pot of coffee? We found our own coffee about 3 blocks away, at Rudi's, just past the Boston Harbor Hotel. Apparently we were not alone as every morning someone would ask us where we got our coffee? We did get to experience the hotel coffee on our last morning when we had breakfast at Miel. Not only was it not good...it also was not hot....and we had to continually ask our waiter for more to fill our $4 \"bottomless cups\". Pass on the I/C coffee and go to Rudi's! However, breakfast at Miel was terrific. The 3-egg omelette was too large to finish. A variety of fillings are available - including shrimp and lobster. One of our party had both of these ingredients and he proclaimed it the best omelette he ever had. Breakfast for 5 was $95 plus tax - one of the higher amounts we have spent, but I must say it was worth it. Other things to note....our room was across the street from the Boston Fire Department - we hardly knew it was there. The neighborhood is mostly high rise office buildings and condos, a couple of hotels and little more. If it wasn't for Rudi's and their coffee we would have been sunk! South Station is about 2 blocks away and the T-stop at the Aquarium is 4 - 5 blocks in the other direction. The neighborhood seems very safe and is very pretty. Gardeners worked in the park across the street all weekend getting it ready for the summer and it will be very pretty. Staff was very nice and competent - not overly friendly, but that's OK. Our housekeeping staff was excellant - we left notes for extra towels and tipped by the day so our housekeeper was taken care of. The hotel is currently displaying some of Anthony Quinn's artwork, which was very interesting, Hope I haven't forgotten anything...we would definitely stay here again if the price was right....but they must do something about the coffee situation to make it perfect!", "Date": "June 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco,CA", "Title": "\u201cNice, comfortable stay at the IC.\u201d", "Author": "CALove2Travel", "ReviewID": "UR16540373", "Content": "We got a great price for the IC Boston through Hotwire and it was well worth the value!

I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t describe the hotel as necessarily family \u00e2\u20ac\u201cfriendly, but we knew going in that it was more of a business hotel so that was o.k. The furniture in the room was very contemporary. Everything was very clean. The bathroom is very large and has a great separate shower. The room also included a very nice marble entry. Only downside to the room was the view, or lack thereof. We looked into the offices of the next building. (see picture). The location was great. We were only a couple of blocks from the children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s museum (highly recommended) and the Aquarium. The Boston Common, where we rode the swan boats, Fanueil Hall, and the Freedom Trail are also all within walking distance. In addition the South Station, with train and bus connections and a reasonable food court if needed, is only a couple of blocks away. The Convention Center is about a 15-20 min walk or a $7-9 cab ride. We walked to all the restaurants as well. Barking Crab was very good and fun. Legal Sea Foods is near the Aquarium. OK, but a local chain, so that was to be expected. Ate a couple of times at the Flour Bakery & Caf\u00c3\u00a9, which is a couple of blocks behind the Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Museum. We saw it on the Food Network and it ended up being great for breakfast and lunch \u00e2\u20ac\u201c excellent food, reasonable prices for a simple meal. There were three problems we came across at the hotel. All had to do with service. The first thing was that the service was slow at times. My husband grabbed dinner at the restaurant and the service was very slow. We also met someone in the lobby outside of the bar for a drink and the waitress failed to acknowledge us on several trips even though others were helped. Probably because we had a child with us, but that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need a drink. The second problem was with one particular doorman, if you can call him that. Many times we would come through with a stroller, bags, etc. and he wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open the door for us. Sometimes he would say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hi,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but he would never offer assistance. Third, the concierge was very nice, but, when we asked for a child friendly recommendation for a simple restaurant the first night we were in (in need of a simple and quick meal where a potentially fussy child would not be an issue), we were sent to a higher end restaurant that looked very nice (and not child appropriate) with $40 entrees \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this made no sense.", "Date": "May 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Summit, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat location for business meetings\u201d", "Author": "ewrpex87", "ReviewID": "UR16345533", "Content": "Really good location for those coming in from South Station.

We were upgraded to the suite for one night, which was beautiful. Views of the water and the city - floor to ceiling windows in the bedroom and the living room. Nice, new plasma t.v.'s in the bedroom and living room. The main bathroom was great with tub, nice shower, L'Occitane products, bathrobes for both, etc. The second night we stayed in a \"regular room,\" and that was a scaled-down version of the suite.

He didn't know how to get around it, and was a little flustered by the whole thing. The people answering the phones there are not very professional. They don't do the \"Hi Mr./Mrs. so and so, this is so in so, how may I help you?\" It was just basically a \"hello\". And, it was evident that most of the people did not take pride in their job or even care. There was a kind of attitude and unprofessionalism that we got from several different people that answered the phone. 2 out of the 3 times we called to get coffee, they forgot to bring both milk adn cream, which we explicitly asked for. The room service food was pretty good quality, but a bit expensive (though standard and comperable to a Marriott). I had two treatments at the spa - a 1 hr massage and a wrap/hydrotherapy treatment. The massage was average (I'm a regular to massages, and I usually get them when I stay at hotels with spas). But, it was nothing to write home about. The wrap/hydroptherapy was done but an extremely nice & very good at what she did. She was great in applying the treatment cream that went under the wrap. However, I was not warned that the cream was going to make my body feel like I was in a ICE BATH!! I was FREEZING while sitting there under the wrap. All I could think about was please, get me outta here. I couldn't relax, and it seemed like it took forever for her to come back, unwrap me, and for me to get in the tub. Even after I sat in the tub for a couple of minutes, I could not get the chill out. I think it was called the \"deluxe wrap/hydrotherapy treatment,\" adn I definitely would suggest NOT getting it. This was the first time (I have done at least 5 or 6 wraps) that I was so uncomfortable while in a wrap. The last thing I would say about the spa is that the showers are good, the stream room is pretty nice, but I would have liked to have the waiting area be gender segregated. Although, it was nice to see my fiance in there, but I think you would be more comfortable sitting with all women in your robe. The lighting, music and atmosphere was very nice and peaceful. In short, I would not stay there again (or have my wedding there) becuase I don't think they provide the level of customer service I expect out of a mid to high-end hotel.

The directions on the confirmation form for the website left out an important note to continue straight when you get off Interstate 93. Net result, a 15 minute delay in getting to the hotel. The title of my post indicates that I am not a fan of driving in Boston. One wrong turn and you will suffer the consequences of an extremely long delay. Be forewarned, if you do not need a car, take the T. I went to school in Massachusetts, am from New York City, live in DC and am therefore familiar with big city driving. That said, the single direction roadways and lack of street signs in Boston can result in a high degree of frustration. In any event, got to the hotel, left the car for valet service and went into the hotel. Check in was quick and pleasant. The rooms are extremely high end. Big plasma TV, nice business lay out for the desk and comfortable bedding. The bathrooms, as other posts have pointed out, is large and chock full of amenities such as a soaking tub, glassed in shower, and plenty of room around the sink. Good turn down service as well. The bar was high end, and known for its rum selection. Nice touch, but a little pricey. Mojitos were $14. The only negative was the valet parking. I read other reviews that indicated that having to go down to the garage to drive your car out was a pain. I generally did not think it would be that bad. Wrong. You cannot call down to have your car pulled out (at least no one told me you could do that, they indicated you had to come down to get your car) and the first morning, it took a good 15 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 20 minutes for them to get my car because they had a conference going on and were getting a lot of cars pulling in. In addition, I had to get on 93 North after pulling out of the lot (far left of the four lane Atlantic Ave), which is hard to do at 8:25 AM in downtown Boston. Then, upon my return, the entire front driveway was packed with valet cars and cabs.

The Intercontinental was one of several high-end hotels on my company's \"preferred\" list, but it was the only one I had not previously stayed at, and it was close to the site of my meetings. The Intercontinental is a new property, built (oddly enough) around the ugly Central Artery Tunnel discharge stacks. Its lovely location right on the harbor is hard to beat, and the hotel manages a very pleasant balance between modern chic and real luxury, without going over the top in either direction. The public spaces are spare but attractive, with discrete sitting areas along the main corridor and what looked like a very attractive bar, Rhumba (which is well-reviewed by friends, but I didn't have time to check it out). My room was very nicely appointed, with simply lined dark-wood furnishings, an opulent and very comfortable bathroom, and a wide-screen LCD TV (though the actual cable signal is analog and rather disappointing). As several other reviewers have noted, I was surprised to find two double beds instead of the King I thought I reserved through Orbitz, but since they also \"dumped\" my no-smoking preference, I suspect Orbitz, not the hotel might have been to blame. About the bed: I guess I have been spoiled by too many nights in Marriott properties in the last year, but this sucker was on the hard side, and the sheets and pillows were a step down from even your run-of-the-mill Courtyard (where they have really got the plush-bed religion). In spite of the location (by the harbor, on the Central Artery, close to the fire station), the room was hushed and comfortable all night long. Overall, I found the Intercontinental Boston to be an extremely pleasant hotel in a sensational location, for a competitive price. I would recommend it heartily to those traveling on business and wanting to be close to the Financial or Seaport districts, or for leisure travelers willing to spend a little more for a very nice room.", "Date": "March 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auburn, Maine", "Title": "\u201cGreat harbor area hotel\u201d", "Author": "Pretzellogix", "ReviewID": "UR14574882", "Content": "My wife and I have now stayed at this Intercontinental several times.

In fact, she said that because we were willing to have both rooms on that floor, that she would upgrade one of the rooms to a suite at no charge! (I think they have a hard time filling the smoking rooms maybe. Regardless, we were happy w/ the free upgrade.) The lobby area was nice and open and very clean. The two rooms weren't as close together as we would have liked, BUT, that was okay, because we all hung out in the suite anyway. The suite was a HUGE living room with nice decor, flat screen TV, which led to a door that opened to a small entry way to the bedroom. To the left was a spectaculor bathroom. I agree with the other reviews when they say how great the bathroom is. To the right was a large walk in closet. Straight ahead was a good size bedroom with a king bed. The only thing that I didn't like about the bedroom was the sliders above the bed that opened into the bathroom and you could hear everything in the bathroom. I wouldn't have cared if I was with my boyfriend, but with a group of girls staying, in the middle of the night every single time the toilet flushed it would wake you up. We did have a few drinks at the Rumba Bar. I thought the atmosphere was nice but also thought the drinks were overpriced. I agree with the previous post that said that getting your car back from valet at the end of your stay isn't set up very well. It's not a classy set up at all, compared to the rest of the hotel.

Even the full rate was only $245, which for a hotel in this category in a city as popular as Boston is pretty reasonable. Overall I recommend the hotel, but let me review some of the pros and cons. PROS: 1) ROOM. We were booked into a standard king room. While the actual usable space of the room was a bit smaller and boxier than I expected, it was certainly comfortably sized, and the bathroom is enormous (see number 2). Design-wise, there were a few cheap-feeling fixtures, but overall the Intercontinental has succeeded in creating a room that is distinctly modern but not cold or sterile-feeling like a lot of other newer hotels. Wood furniture and colorful walls help keep it homey. Lighting was both excellent and innovative (all kinds of bright and dim mood-type lighting options around the bed and work areas, plus lots of recessed lighting in the entrance hallway). Workdesk was spacious with easy outlets (although I was expecting something like an aeron chair, and instead it was a more basic deskchair). Flatscreen was like every other flatscreen and worked well, with a massive selection of cable channels. 2) BATHROOM. This is really the best part of the room and maybe the entire hotel. They really went out of their way on these. Absolutely massive, with beautiful lighting and tilework, spacious glass shower and separate bathtub, fixtures, bath amenities, etc. And of course the fun little extra that everyone mentions - two small sliding doors open up between the bathroom and bedroom area. I wish my home bathroom was a fraction as nice as this! If you're someone who relishes your time in the shower in the morning, this is undoubtedly the Boston hotel for you. 3)BAR. I'm used to hotel bars being either really bland or overly pompous. The hotel's signature bar, RumBa, is easily accessed right off the lobby, which immediately creates a welcoming, easygoing but classy vibe for one and all. This was reflected in the clientele, which was made up of every kind of person imaginable, young and old, casual and more formal. Also they have genuinely created a cool concept that would be worth visiting all by itself - a bar with an emphasis on dozens of rare rums and champagnes (far more rums than champagnes though). Pricey but not as bad as you might think for such rarities! Service was speedy even on a very busy Saturday night, and despite the crowds, it was easy enough to find a seat, relax and have a conversation without screaming. This is one of the best hotel bars I've ever seen. Also, honorable mentions for the hallways, which are beautifully decorated and inviting, and the elevators, which were huge and always available to us within seconds. CONS: 1) LOCATION. Boston is such a small city that there's really no such thing as \"bad location\". However the Intercontinental is located in the new Waterfront district, an area that only really came into existence as a result of the tunneling of I-93 in the \"big dig\" which was completed a few years ago. So what you have in this area is a lot of construction and new office buildings. The area is definitely lacking in the cozy New England-type charm that you get in most other areas of the center city. It's also on the edge of the downtown core, so it's a fair 10-15 minute walk to Fanueil Hall, and areas such as Newbury Street and Beacon Hill are really more of a cab or T-ride away. On the plus side, the lovely South Station is really close, so the T, Amtrak, etc. are within very easy reach. Still, you won't feel the real cobblestone-and-colonial charm of Boston in the immediate vicinity of this hotel, nor will you find the hotel to be \"right next door\" to anything special. 2) LOBBY. There are a number of good elements to the lobby - cool music, little nooks with bookshelves, the above-mentioned bar - but overall, it just doesn't hang together well and doesn't give a great first impression. It feels overly minimalist, and somewhat like the entrance to an office building (which is exactly what it looks like on the outside). I know this isn't a big deal for most people, but it was still disappointing for a hotel of this stature. 3) ROOM NOISE. The large exterior windows of our room were definitely double-glazed and quiet, but we could hear noise from adjacent rooms, even from the room upstairs! This was surprising given how new this hotel is and the insulation options they must've had available during construction. If you're a light sleeper, you should definitely take this into consideration. Overall, if you're looking for a thoroughly contemporary hotel, luxurious and modern rooms, and don't mind walking to, rather than being immersed in, the Boston you've seen and read about, the Intercontinental is an excellent choice.", "Date": "February 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cClassy new Boston landmark\u201d", "Author": "Kines", "ReviewID": "UR13755451", "Content": "I had a lovely stay at the Intercontinental in January.

The hotel is within walking distance of the Seaport World Trade Center; they are building the area up so it's not the desolate destination it used to be. I didn't venture out too much to see what restaurants were in walking distance because it was very cold outside. The room was outstanding. Spacious, modern and very clean. The bathroom was enormous for a hotel in Boston, including a deep tub, glass-enclosed shower, and plenty of counter space. What was most appealing was the opening between the bathroom and the sleeping area. There were opaque doors that could be slid closed for privacy and the opening was above the king sized bed, but it opened up the room so nicely! Granted, I was solo for this trip so it being open wasn't an issue. The work area was outstanding. A large desk that had plenty of outlets was a relief since I was there on business and had to setup my printer and laptop, etc. However the $14.95/day for internet access was frustratingly outrageous. Housekeeping was very good and I didn't have trouble with them knocking at odd times. Room service was good, always giving me a time when they were going to arrive. Within the hotel, there is a sushi bar, a rum bar, and a bistro restaurant that is open 24 hours. The sushi bar is nice but very expensive, the regular bar is very loud and usually packed, and the restaurant was surprisingly empty. However, the food at the restaurant was outstanding as well as the service; the prices were high as well. I also had a business meeting there that I planned with their staff. The food was outstanding, the meeting room great, and the staff really worked hard to make this small, simple meeting go well. The reason this hotel doesn't rate a full five stars: * 14.95/night for internet is outrageous. * there was no guest services book in my room but it did have a room service menu. I had no idea where the business center or the gym were or their hours. I had to ask a few times. Finding the business center was a bit tricky since the signs weren't all that helpful. It's a small thing, sure, but not having that info handy was annoying. * the business center. Wow. This is NOT run by the Intercontinental, instead contracted out. The fees they charge for delivery boxes was the highest I've had to pay -- $85 for four boxes. Yes, one of them was heavy but it had rollers! The staff ranged from helpful to belligerent. The hours for the center were NOT posted outside the door. I tried to drop off packages on a Sunday morning because I had been told they were open at 8 a.m. Wrong. They opened at 10 a.m. I managed to flag down a person who worked for the Intercontinental to help me but the person didn't seem all that interested in assisting a hotel guest.

The furnishings and carpeting looked new, and the in room artwork gave the room some personality. Hallway and adjoining room noise were minimal, despite the fact our room was next to the ice machine. While technically you could see the Boston Harbor from the window if you contorted and leaned properly, charging extra money for such a limited view seemed gouging. Likewise, the $14.95 a day for in room wi-fi internet seemed a bit steep as well. One interesting feature of the room was the separation between the sleeping area and bathroom.

A sweet touch. The room was large, included two walls with windows overlooking the city, which was actually prettier than the harbor view I thought. The bathroom was large and 4 piece, a deep tub separate from the glass enclosed shower. You couldn't see the flat screen from the tub though (but if you could, I probably would have wasted too much time in there!). The gym was great - all new equipment, plenty of room, and the treadmills all faced a wall of glass overlooking the city. The gym also provided plenty of amenities - bottled water, towels, toiletries and disposable razors. The hotel bar was very cool - leather couches and chairs, fireside - drinks were pricey and the late night crowd was the \"beautiful people\" - but it was fun for us to people-watch for a drink or two. The location is easy walking to Quincy Market. We met friends for drinks there and then walked to the North End for an amazing dinner at La Summa on Fleet Street. Overall, our one night stay was perfect for a night away from the kids.

It felt like a four seasons, although the large lobby was slightly impersonal (but still very well handled, for such a large space). Check-in/check-out was polite and efficient and there was no issue with adding to bags in store or changing in the gym prior to heading off to the airport. Rooms have been laid out with a lot of thought and attention to detail, especially for fittings and lighting + bathrooms are great + sliding window to bathroom helps add space. Only negative for me was the overly soft water, but I live in a hard water area, so maybe I notice it more. Room service timely and high quality.

The rooms are very large and generously furnished. The oversized bathrooms are very nice and well equipped. My bathroom was also spotless and had a great shower and tub area. The TV is a nice flat screen and the views of the city were quite nice. A previous review mentioned the fire station and despite being on the 9th floor, I hardly notice when the fire trucks were dispatched which must have only been twice (that I heard) over my one week stay. The gym is fantastic and probably one of the best gyms I have ever used in a hotel. There are a good choice of cardio machines, including about 5 treadmills and 5 cross trainers. The gym apparently offers classes as well which are included in the free admission for hotel guests. There are also a good variety of free weights and weight machines. The staff were very helpful and showed me the nice steam room and relaxation area where the treatment rooms for the spas are located. Free water, towels, headphones and fruit were also available. Best of all it is 24 hours. I didn't try the pool but it looked great. The restaurant was OK but not entirely 5 stars or what you'd expect from a hotel of this calibur. Portions were very American (ie quite good) but nothing seemed particularly special. Suprisingly there was only a very meagre breakfast buffet of fruits, pastries and cereals. Perhaps there is not enough demand (the hotel didn't seem to busy) so maybe this was seasonal? Otherwise, the service in the restaurant was good. Hotel staff seemed friendly but it was frustrating that it seemed that there was never more than one person at the reception desk meaning that one always had to wait. Otherwise the hotel staff were good. Wifi access was excellent and a reasonable charge of 40$ for one whole week. Wifi coverage was excellent, including seamless from lobby, restaurant to room. I just had the overall feeling that the hotel nickel and dimed you at most chances. There seemed to be additional fees on everything such as a delivery charge and then tax and then gratuity on room service. Then, no reminder or notice that gratuity was already included once food is delivered. I had some packages from Amazon delivered to the hotel and before ordering them and after receiving them, no one told me that there was any fees for this. In the end, I got stuck with a 46$ bill which was a big surprise. That was pretty lousy. At check-out, my colleague was checking out one day earlier and they insisted on charging him for an extra night stay. This is after our entire bill for three people came well over $5000. It took the Duty Manager to come and remove this charge. Poor discretion or empowerment of the front desk staff. Otherwise a good hotel but I would consider another one of the large chains closer to the shopping areas, including Newbury Street for my next stay in Boston.

We picked this hotel because of the great offer through TravelZoo ($169/nite) and it's location to the Children's Museum, New England Aquarium, Fanueil Hall, and the downtown shops on Washington Street. Everything was within walking distance. Plus it's a brand new hotel! ROOM We had a harborview room that was absolutely beautiful and the only tiny complaint I had about the room was that it didn't have a mini coffee maker. (You can get a cup of coffee for $2.00 from the hotel restaurant, Miel, or go off site to the nearby Starbucks, across from South Street Station.) BREAKFAST/LUNCH/DINNER If you are traveling with kids, you may want to go to Finagle A Bagel or Panera Bread for breakfast rather than the hotel restaurant (Miel) in the lobby because it is a little pricey. For lunch or dinner, we would definitely recommend the Legal Seafoods Restaurant across from the New England Aquarium, 10-15 minute walk from hotel. Call ahead for reservations. There's also a 7-Eleven (I think that's the name of it) a few blocks from hotel if you are looking to buy snacks for the kids and/or for yourself. POOL The hotel has a very nice indoor pool on the 2nd floor that the kids loved and the big glass windows give you a nice view of the city buildings. Remember to bring flip flops since the pool floor can get very wet. The pool is next to the spa/fitness room. PARKING Parking at the hotel was expensive but we knew that it would be - $39/day. We parked at the hotel for the first nite and then moved the car to a nearby outdoor parking lot that was only $10/day (24 hr period). If you take a right out of the hotel, then an immediate right at the next traffic light, you will see an outdoor parking lot on your left. Easy walk back to hotel.

The bedroom was spacious and had everything you could have wanted, including a flat screen TV. The bathroom was very luxurious with a bath and separate shower. However the toilet paper was a bit nasty for a 5 star hotel. The first night we arrive late and decided to eat in their bar called Rumba. The choice of food is limited but the burger was delicious! The waitresses are a little fake, I asked for a diet coke and got an ice tea. I would imagine they are more attentive to the big spenders in the bar. We booked this city break from Last Minute and paid extra for a room with river view however upon arrival were placed in a room facing into the financial district. We asked to be moved and showed them a copy of the reservation from Last Minute but they said there was nothing they could do all rooms were fully booked. So instead we had a view of the fire station. Only 1 night we could hear the sirens going. Just a word of warning they may try to charge you for mini bar items you haven't had. There is a lovely place called Scali diner where you can go and eat breakfast cheaply. It's a 5 min walk from the hotel. Turn left out of the hotel onto the main street and cross the first juction you come to, it will be straight ahead. There is also a 7 eleven near by. Turn right out of the hotel and walk for 10 mins.

In my opinion, though, the most important commodity that a hotel can offer is customer service. The InterContinental falls short in this area. The service during my stay was inconsistant and seemed contribed. When I arrived on Friday night, the key to my room did not work. I returned to the Front Desk and waited in line to ask for a new key. The lady that I dealt with was short tempered and seemed inconvenienced to help me although she finally gave me a key that worked. Later that evening, I met friends in their bar \"Rhumba\". The place was busy and the service was exceptionally slow. When we were finally served, our order was incorrect and the food that we did get was luke warm. We brought this fact to our server and she begrudgingly reordered our food and after some time delivered it.

The maid BARGED INTO MY ROOM AT 8:30 A.M. on a Saturday morning WITHOUT knocking, just walked right in, assuming for some unknown reason that no one was there since my husband had left the room at 8 to go to a meeting. I, however, was STILL TRYING TO SLEEP. I cannot imagine in what parallel universe someone would assume that no one was in the room because one person had left it. She didnt even look at the bed when she came in, just headed straight for the windows to open the curtains. I said EXCUSE ME I'm trying to sleep here! She apologized and left, but it took me awhile to get back to sleep. Absolutely no excuse whatsoever for that to have happened. However, one of the concierges by the name of Rob Fournier, made up for the maid's nitwitedness. He could not have been nicer or more accommodating, fielding stupid tourist questions with aplomb and taking extra care to explain the route to the Capital Grille and that to get back to the hotel, the route was different because of the one-way streets. With just an address to go by, we never would have found the restaurant had he not detailed it to a T on a map. Very nice fellow. Room was great, bed very comfortable with soft sheets and a down comforter. Bathroom awesome, toiletries top notch. Beware the bottle of Evian water by the bedside - it is NOT included in the room price, as it is a part of the mini-bar at $7 I believe. There was a basket of fruit awaiting me but as I was not sure if it was equipped with the same sensors that everything in the mini-bar was, I didnt touch it. I assume it was gratis because it was not mentioned on the mini-bar pricing sheet. Breakfast was lovely but kinda pricey but the price was pretty much in line with this sort of property. Breakfast service uneven - I hadnt made up my mind what I wanted the first time the waiter came around, and he ignored me for a full 15 minutes after I had decided what I wanted and put my menu down. The restaurant in the morning gets full sun and it was warm and inviting. We were there on the first night of the Red Sox playoff games against Cleveland and in the evening before game time, taxis were scarce. We ended up driving to the restaurant after being given the great directions by Rob. We had a room on the 10th floor (non-harbor side) which was very quiet in terms of noise from within. I have seen many complaints on Tripadvisor about the Fire Dept being loud at night - a $50 white noise machine from Hammacher-Schlemmer and some foam earplugs makes all that go away. However, it would be very nice for a property of this magnitude (4 or 5 stars) to provide these amenities for their guests on the non-harbor side of the building - a small investment on their part that would go a long way toward customer satisfaction overall. They wouldnt even have to necessarily put them in every room - just have them available for free or for a very nominal charge - it would be a very welcome amenity. All in all, however, a nice stay.

Our room was impressive with a super comfortable King sized bed with luxury linens, a down comforter and soft, fluffy pillows. There are so many comfort touches...each side of the bed has focused beam, adjustable neck reading lights that come out of the wall, the wall of windows has block-out drapes, there are plenty of lamps all around the room, there is a flat screen TV, a huge wall mirror and a granite shelf just inside the door (perfect for putting things down as you come in or out), The closet has a pair of solid, substantial doors that close with a magnetic catch and a light goes on inside it whenever it is opened. The bathroom is beautiful with a granite topped vanity, a lighted, adjustable makeup mirror, marble floor and walls and a glass enclosed marble shower with both a showerhead and a handheld shower. The water pressure is excellent and there is plenty of hot water. There is a deep soaking tub and above it is a set of sliding panels that open to the bedroom. The bed is on the other side and I was able to watch TV from the tub in the evening and while brushing my teeth the next morning. All the furniture and wood trim throughout is high quality: dark and solid and reminded me of a sophisticated blend of Arts and Crafts/Contemporary with a touch of Asian influence. There are shoji style panels above the bed with built-in soft nightlights. There was even a chaise at the foot of the bed. Of course there are all the techno-necessities for business travelers. What was particularly striking was the quiet; we never heard any noise from the hall or from other rooms. The carpeting is thick and the walls must be very solid.

Additionally, after a call to the credit card company I discovered they had already charged me for the night not reserved. Needless to say, I was not happy, but decided to go ahead and try the hotel out since the charge for the night in question has been removed by the credit card company. Deciding to stay was a mistake as the bathroom was dilapidated and unclean with most things being broken in the room itself. Also, getting the hotel room cleaned every day required a call to the front desk as the cleaning service had not cleaned the rooms by 3:00 PM. Upon checking out, I brought up all of these issues with a manager and was scolded for complaining and not showing up on the dates that were reserved.

My reservations were made for the dates of the conference (8/19/2007 to 8/23/2007) by a travel agent working through my particular conference. When I arrived on 8/19 and tried to check in, the front desk staff said that their records showed I should have checked in on the day before and that they were going to charge me for a whole additional night (which isn't exactly pocket change!). I showed them my reservation, which had the dates of my stay 8/19/2007 to 8/23/2007. I tried to cancel my reservations there and they insisted that I would have to pay for the night before we came anyway. To add additional pressure, they said they would give away my room if I didn't check in immediately. Because I wouldn't be able to find a hotel room in that general during the conference, I ended up having to stay at this hotel. I asked for the manager, and he insisted that despite what the our reservation paper said, I had to pay for the additional night because it was their policy... even though my paper said otherwise. He was very rude and did not offer an apology. On 8/23/2007, while checking out, I tried to talk to the manager again about the reservations being messed up. He told us there was nothing he could do about the mistake they made on my reservation. Then he told me that he \"remembered\" that my reservation different check in date than was actually on my confirmation sheet; that it was my fault because I was stupid and couldn't read our confirmation paper. Staying at the hotel turned out to be a mistake because this hotel did not live up to it's four star potential. One design flaw with the hotel there is a panel of frosted glass over the top of the bed, which opens up to show a panorama the toilet and shower. This was annoying for two reasons: 1. a small piece of glass does not provide the same privacy that a wall would if you are using the bathroom, and 2. if someone uses the bathroom at night, the whole bedroom is lit up. The list of the following reasons are the problems we had with our room. 1. A family with a young child was staying in the room next to us. We could hear the family's conversations clearly, as well as the child's screaming fits through the adjoining door (please see the picture). 2. The pipes under our sink in the bathroom leaked all over the floor making it slippery (please see the picture). 3. There was hair in the bathtub when we checked in (it was not our hair). 4. The tv had very bad reception (please see the picture). 5. The handle was falling off the bathroom door, making it difficult to get out of the bathroom. 6.

When we checked in they had bumped us up to a junior suite with a great view of the harbor. The room was spotless and the bathroom was huge with a great shower and a nice size tub. Everything looked brand new and I thought we may have been the first people to stay in that suite, because it was so clean and tidy. The bed was amazing and the sheets and pillows were perfectly soft. The only problem was that the 30 inch flat screen LCD TV had a grainy picture. This seems to be more common in the new larger hotels when the cable is split too many times between the rooms and the signal is degraded. However, if you stay at this hotel don't waste your time watching TV. The North End is just a few blocks away and there is a great walk along the harbor to the aquarium and other attractions just outside the hotel. When we checked out, the hotel had charged us $100 for a bunch of drinks we didn't drink out of the mini-fridge. Apparently there is an automatic sensor on each individual drink if you pick it up or even move it. The front desk rectified the problem immediately, but I am assuming this is a common problem and that this system won't work because that really set me off when I heard that touching the bottle automatically charges your room. (You can't even tell what some of the bottles are unless you pick them up or move them around). Don't let the hotel charge you for this, and if for some reason they do, go back to the room and take whatever they charged you for. When I was leaving the manager on duty, a really helpful 40 something man, got a bellman and personally loaded my bed back onto my truck.

I had booked a harbour-view room for my parents and it was perfect. Very spacious with two queen beds, with the whole back wall floor to ceiling windows overlooking the river, across to the children's museum. My husband's and my room was slightly smaller with a king sized bed, chaise longue, and separate desk area. Even though we did not request a view with our room, we had a partial river view which was lovely. The bathrooms were amazing. In our room, we had a sliding partition between the bathroom to the bedroom so we could chat to each other while we are taking a bath! The bathroom in my parent's room did not have this feature, which was fine for them. The bathrooms had separate walk-in showers which was great too. Plush robes. Nice toiletries. Their turn-down service included filling our ice bucket and leaving a small chocolate for us, which I thought was a nice touch. We checked out the spa in the morning before check-out. The gym is well equipped and even has a yoga/pilates area. There is fruit and bottled water available and most of the machines have individual TVs built in which you can watch as you work-out. The pool was lovely - very calming and a good enough size for laps. The best part of the spa is the ecalyptus steam bath in the locker rooms. Heaven! Treatments are available in the spa too, although we didn't partake of any. Prior to our visit, I was slightly worried that the location may not be so good, but I was wrong. The whole area is being re-developed and the back of the hotel (overlooking the river) has a nice walkway along the river's edge. The Boston Tea Party is normally docked there, however it was not there at the time of our visit. The hotel is a mere 10 minutes walk from Quincy Market and about 3 minutes walk (across the bridge) to the bustling Barking Crab, which is a fun place to spend an evening. 24-hour valet parking was $39. Not cheap, but convenient. I only have one minor gripe about the whole stay. Coffee is available, mid-week, in the hotel lobby before 7am. My mother is an early riser. She went down around 6ish, got a coffee and enjoyed that outside in the early morning sun. My father went down around 6:45am, and the coffee was finished.

Well, I'm happy to say that the service we received was fantastic, especially from David, the concierge, who could not have been more helpful. Everyone we dealt with was courteous and friendly and professional. They gave us the double room we requested, as I was traveling with my father for a family reunion. Our room was gorgeous--the marble bath, glass shower, and deep tub were beautiful, and we really enjoyed the flat screen tv and fine linens on the beds. There was ample room and storage for both of us, and everything was brand new. Our room was on the west side of the building, so our view was basically of the old warehouse next door being remodeled. However, we never heard any construction noise or noise from the fire department or any other guests. The fitness center was unbelievable for a hotel--it was better than the gym I go to at home! We did not eat at the hotel, but the public areas were very well done, and a lot of people seemed to be enjoying the rum bar. I had also read that this hotel is not in a convenient location, but I can't imagine who would think that! It is a block and a half from the T (South Station), and less than a 10-minute walk to the Aquarium (where all the tour trolleys start out), Quincy Market and Little Italy. And the walk to the aquarium and Little Italy takes you along the waterfront--it's a very safe, attractive area, even after dark. We walked over to Little Italy every night for fantastic Italian food, cannolis, and cappucinos! David, the concierge, recommended several places for us to try and they were all fantastic. From the aquarium, we took a $29 trolley tour that took us all over the city in about 2 hours and included a free harbor tour afterwards! I can't recommend this hotel highly enough--especially for the price we paid. We stayed at a Holiday Inn in Portland Maine on this same trip that didn't come close to the 3* accomodations it promised, yet we paid $153/night...but that's New England in July for you.

If fact, we stayed until 2PM the next day because we are a member of the hotel chain's Priority Club. Parking was a bit pricey at $39 dollars. Checked all nearby parking lots and prices were similar. Could have had $24 weekend rate at parking lot ( Post Office Garage) 3 blocks away if we had decided to waited on parking the car until 4PM. Location was fine...10 minute walk to Quincy Market or the North End. Hotel service for the entire visit was excellent. Spa and gym areas were great. Only disappointment was the \"thin\" hallway doors that let all hallway noises in the room. Annoying!

My friend and I got an unbelievable 3 night-four day rate on this hotel which included airfare, for less than what some have shared that they have paid for a two night stay in this hotel!! I made a decision to spend more time out of my room than in it, but know that this hotel is perfect for those who are looking for a relaxing weekend as well!! The Positives: 1. The hotel's location is great, but only if you are able to do the kind of walking that's associated with big cities like New York and D.C. 2. We were able to catch a bus from the airport to the hotel for the equivalent of two dollars each. A cab would have been a total of $20 for the two of us. We decided to buy a transit pass good for a week which cost $15; a day pass was $9.00. The transit station is a five-ten minute walk from the hotel. My suitcase weighed almost 50 pounds; yet I was able to make it!! 3. The security in this hotel is unbelievable!!! The hotel security were men in suits who \"patroled\" the lobby area, opened doors for us, and greeted us whenever we encountered them in the lobby on our way in and out of the hotel. I felt safe as a single woman in this hotel. 4. While I am not a fan of sushi, the Sushi/Tequila bar plays salsa music which I love. It has a high-tech look and feel and I was able to get an impromptu salsa lesson from one of the wait staff after the bar had cleared one evening. 5. If you are one who enjoys socializing, make sure you speak to Wayne in the Rum/Champagne Bar and Charles in the Miel Restaurant. They are delightful!! 6. The bathroom was outstanding. It was all marble, oversized, with a glass-encased shower and a separate, long and deep bathtub. It reminded me of those bathrooms one sees in those upscale decorating magazines. Bring your bubble bath, shower gel, exfoliate, and candles!!! 7. The beds were comfortable. 8. We were in room 604, with two double beds. NO VIEW!!! but there were no sirens as mentioned by a fellow reviewer, it was VERY, VERY, QUIET!! 9. The hotel has this little nook in the lobby that contains a Scrabble board and a couple of Monopoly games. I like playing board games so having access to these was a treat! 10. The hotel's Business Center has a limited selection of office supplies available for sale in case you forget something. I did not check the prices. 11. Elevators are fast. 12. We had a probelm connecting to the internet. The front desk was called, the tech crew was there in five minutes and resolved the problem in five more. 13. Walked to the Barking Crab. This place is as causal as a picnic table in a local park but the food was decent. You can't go wrong with the crab legs. 14. There is an iron and ironing board in the room. I prefer to iron with steam. I had a difficult time getting the water into the iron. The Negatives 1. I do not like French food which is the featured food for the hotel's main dining room. It is expensive for a working woman like me. When I say expensive I am talking double-digit prices for appetizers and salads. 2. If you are sharing the room with others you need to know that everything you do in the bathroom can be heard by those outside the bathroom. Bad Singing, Cell Phone Conversations, etc. 3. Another reviewer mentioned that the glasses in the bathroom were not restocked daily. I had this experience too, additionally, we had to call housekeeping for washclothes. NO BIG DEAL JUST A MINOR INCONVENIENCE TO ME. 4. Business Center internet five dollars per 15 minutes. In-room internet 15 dollars a day. You do the math. A laptop was left in the room each day of our stay. No problems. 5. If you are a breakfast person and a bargain traveler you are going to have to leave the hotel and walk across the street to a side street next to the fire department. There is a restaurant named VIGA there that serves a $3.50 breakfast special, but I didn't have time to try it. 6. Be very careful in the bathroom if the marble floor gets wet. I almost fell. USE THE CLOTH BATHMAT OR YOU'RE GOING DOWN!!! 7. We were going to order a roll-away bed to accomodate another friend who decided to spend the night. I think it was going to cost $30-45 per night. 8. Although I'm not a drinking woman I did review the drink menus in both the Sushi/Tequila Bar and the Rum/Champagne Bar. WOW!! I think the drink prices are high; many were double-digit prices in sitandard-sized bar glasses. There was even one drink on the menu that was made with 24-carat gold!!! If you are looking for the ultimate in a glass, this could be the bar for you!! Other Notes 1. Many of the hotel staff are from cities around the world. If you start a conversation they will gladly interact with you. I like this!! 2. I did not eat in the hotel, nor did I go to the pool or spa, or use the bell men, so I can't comment. 3. I was dissapointed with the different bowls of chowder that I had at several different restaurants during my stay in the Boston area. They were too thick and had no flavor. I recommend a small mom and pop restaurant chain called Kelly's Restaurant. There is a location at the end of the blue line at Revere Beach. It is not close but if you can get there this restaurant had the best chowder and other delights from the sea ( lobster rolls, scallops, fried clams, and even roast beef sandwiches) at reasonable prices. Nothing in the restaurant is over $20!!! They are on the web. 4. Many people recommend dining at Legal Seafood. Try Legal, Try Kelly's, then you decide.", "Date": "July 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel, not a single problem\u201d", "Author": "Arbitrage", "ReviewID": "UR8064950", "Content": "When I stay at a hotel I'm looking for cleanliness, condition of the furnishings in the room, service, value, location and amenities, in that order.

I dont know about value though, its an expensive hotel and thats a hard thing to judge. I think its definitely at least as good as anything else that expensive. The bathroom was massive. Tub and separate shower. The room was large, even by city hotel standards. Flat screen tv and then the usual. Lively restaurant and bar in the lobby. Room service was available 24 hours a day. The hotel is located in the financial district. Its not really a touristy area, however, Faneuil Hall is < 10 minute walk, and we walked to Boston Common. The only thing to watch out for is that if you get a room on either side of the building, you're going to have no view. There are buildings on either side which complete block the view.

Brand new equipment with a self-contained tv on the treadmills and the elliptical machine. The only complaint that i have is not the hotel but of the area itself. In the evening, there isn't much in terms of food or even \"activity\". We would have preferred staying in the Copley Square area where there is more life and more restaurants that are opened later in the evening. Other than that...the location of the hotel is very convenient to the subway but we didn't use the subway at all during our stay. We walked through the \"tourist\" sites all on one day going from Fanueil Square (10 min away from hotel) all the way to Copley Square and Newburry Street and back to the hotel.

The reviews were mostly positive so I wasn't too too worried about what to expect. And so should you. This is a very good hotel with an excellent location, especially for business. I've travelled and stayed much more often lately in 3 to 5 star rated hotels of all kinds; a Marriott, some Hyatts, Westin, Radisson and now I got to try this Intercontinental. As much as I'd be close to giving this hotel a 5/5, I'll give it a 4 as it was lacking just a few little things to really be an \"excellent\" (per TripAdvisor ratings) hotel. But it definately was \"above average\". A lot has already been said in other reviews so I'll try to be quick. STAFF: Most staff were nice although lacking the charm and friendliness of smaller hotels. They were very polite and mostly helpful. That is exactly what I suppose, you can expect from Intercontinental. Check-in was fast, I was advised even how much they would freeze on my card and the gentleman confirmed I wanted 2 beds non-smoking. The room was far from the elevator and depsite facing the Boston Fire Dept. , as some mentionned I believe, I never heard a sirene. ROOM: Excellent with dark new furniture, blackout drapes and plasma TV. Bathroom was huge with a great stand up all marble shower and a separate deep soaking tub. A modern hotel meant an amazingly quiet AC and automatic light sensors for when you get in the room. Cleanliness was alright, the work desk was covered with a glass for protection and was full of finger and hand prints that were there when we got the room and which were never cleaned during our stay. Glasses were not changed depsite having been clearly used the night before. The tub's hot water pressure, already weak the first night, died the second night and at one point was spraying brown water with residues. Same with the sink. Somewhere, it seemed someone flushed the pipes. Maintenance was sent up but never came back to tell If it could be fixed or not. Front desk did not ask If we wanted a room switch which I would have refused anyways but they perhaps should have asked when I did mention it to the desk. Mattress, as mentionned right in the previous reviews, could have been much better, especially for an Intercontinental. Both Marriotts and H yatts have much better bedding. Cheap Serta pillowtop. Two goose pillows. I like soft but you might not. POOL/SPA: Already said, clean, relaxing with music. Amazingly huge and clean gym. Nice attendants. PARKING: At 39$, it's a rip off, especially on week-end. Just about everything around is cheaper If you don't mind a little walk. Overall, the hotel was very good. It lost the 5th point on cleanliness, bedding quality and dealing with problems. Otherwise, everything about the hotel was 5 star.

The room was spacious and well appointed. The beds were okay, not ultra comfortable. Also, the pillows were disappointing - not enough of them and too soft. The bathroom was great - huge with a big tub and separate shower. There was a plasma screen tv in the room, but the cheap kind with only a mediocre picture. There was not free internet in the room; in fact it was $15/day. In a brand new hotel, this in inexcusable. Also, parking is a steep $39/day, but the valets were helpful and always available. Room service was prompt, polite and tasty. My favorite part of the hotel, however, was the spa and fitness area. The fitness area featured brand new equiptment with individual television screens.

Also, a few more blocks in the other direction is the Aquarium and that Subway stop also. BTW, I highly recommend checking out the Aquarium, it was beautiful and fascinating. Check-in was accomplished in minutes and they didn't even bat an eye that we were early, even though the hotel was booked solid for the weekend. I really appreciated that, and I was thrilled when I saw our harbor view room, the windows are floor to ceiling so as to take advantage of the lovely vista.

It was very spacious, lots of storage, very nice lighting, big flat screen TV, quite comfortable and relaxing.
