Argentine metro stop was in front of the hotel. We landed at Paris Beauvais-Tille airport from Madrid (Ryanair) and a 45min shuttle bus took us to Porte Maillot, Paris. It was only a 10min walk to the hotel from there. The rooms were small and had no air conditioning or ventilation. Our room was #114 facing the street. If you opened the windows, you would not be able to sleep at night due to traffic noise and the cigarette smell from the restaurant in front. The bed was comfortable and the toilets were clean though cramped. TV was small and no english channels. The room had a small fridge. If you don't mind the accommodations which we really didn't because it was just a place to rest up for the next day adventure, then this hotel is ok. We're not picky. Don't eat breakfast in the hotel for E9.00. Not worth it. The front desk spoke english and helped us out with directions. Wifi was not free. One thing I really liked is that they kept our bags for us after checkout since we had time to walk around Paris before our flight back to Madrid. Around the area, there were a lot of good restaurants, a self-service wash, internet cafe and within walking distance to Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees. We even walked from the Eiffel back to the hotel.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSmall and musty\u201d", "Author": "xvi0letx", "ReviewID": "UR117956537", "Content": "Romantic Paris - this hotel was not. I do not understand the reviews on this site. I did not find the location wonderful, or the hotel, wonderful. I suppose you could say the hotel was saved by its proximity to a metro station, but that is about it. We were here for four nights in August and I really wish we would have stayed elsewhere. Our room was very small, and travelling in Europe you become used to this so it wasn't our biggest complaint. The room itself, although tidy, smelled like it hadn't been properly cleaned in a long time. It was very musty and not a welcome place to return to. The shower was teeny and there were no toiletries provided. The wifi was the most expensive we experienced on our trip. 9 euros a day. Although the location was directly above the Argentine station, staying here you really miss out on the quaintness and romance of Paris.The street the hotel is located on is extremely wide (6 lanes, or 4 large lanes) and busy. It is like staying at a roadside hotel. Stay elsewhere.

Breakfast was typical, 8 euros for a continental breakfast: coffee, bread, butter, croissant.

It is definitely a budget hotel - no elevator with narrow staircases, breakfast was coffee/croissants/bagette. The rooms were very clean and bed was comfortable. Wifi works and will cost you 9 euros for 24 hrs. Get a room with a shower instead of tub, there's no hook for the shower hose in the tub so you end up holding it the whole time. Rooms facing the front are loud if you want to sleep with the windows open to get ventilation. Rooms facing the courtyard on the top floor would be best.

At 10 m from the subway station Argentine, which assure the connection with almost every location in Paris. The price was good comparing with overall price level around. We stayed 8 days and we were positively impressed by friendly, trustful and helpful staff. The room was small but cozy, recently renovated. We had a very good wi-fi (internet) connection. Still, the TV in the room had only 5 channels; phonic isolation between rooms, not very good. Working temporary or just visiting Paris for a week or more Marmotel Hotel is an excellent choice.

The one picture and the raves make it seem like this is the best bargain in Paris. Yes, it has a great rate of 87E per night, but thats about it...and I would say thats the only thing great at this hotel. Picture driving on a US interstate and needing to stop at the motel on the side of the road. Thats this. The room was small and dreary. The walls are in major need of paint or repapering. The window didn't shut completely this there was draft. Luckily, we were facing the courtyard so we weren't getting the noise from the street. The bed was flimsy and the comforter musty and I would recommend that for a couple (if you MUST stay here due to budget restrictions) get the room with 2 twin beds which seemed nicer after we peeked in. We were in Room #121. The bathroom was very small and the shower is big enough for a child. I am a slim guy and had trouble. Plus the show head faces the wrong direction, so be prepared to flood the bathroom. The shower itself was moldy. Overall, the ONLY reason to stay here is because it's inexpensive shelter. They have heat and hot water and it's relatively clean.
