They know that the property is not too large to fill and given the locational advantage (Baker Street tube station is 5min walking distance) they will always get idiots like me who will pay GBP 100 + for a lousy room. Would still consider this as you do not get too many better options for this price in Central London. But if you do, pls stay away. The hotel staff is not arrogant but has a \"you need me, I don't need you\" kind of attitude. Expect a basic room with barely clean toilets. No elevators, cramped corridor. Wodden structure and Road facing so noise levels can be disturbing. If the idea is to explore London from a central location and use the hotel to just come back late at night and crash then book.

Breakfast was served in the restaurant next door and consisted of 3 kinds of cereals, meats, cheese, hard boiled eggs, fruit salad, tomato and lettuce salad, yougurt, croissants, and rolls, coffee and tea. Great way to start out a long day of site seeing. The restaurant next door (Malasian) was excellent if you are to tired to go out to eat.

If you dropped the soap one would have to \"plies\" gracefully (like Anna Pavlova) to pick it up. The room was cleaned daily. Breakfast: Served in the adjacent Singaporean restaurant's main dining room on the basement level. We were very impressed with the massive atrium.

After staying in one of the best hotels in the city, I was expecting the contrast to be difficult but keeping in mind the excellent price (67 GBP) I never regretted the decision. The room key is a long rectangular plastic card, about 1.5 the length and twice the thickness of a credit card. It unlocks the door mechanically and also must stay inserted in the room fusebox to activate electricity. Avoid the upper rooms if the weather is warm as they're warmer than the lower ones. My room had a standing fan but it made a lot of noise; there was a bit of a heat wave at the time so I resorted to sleeping under a wet towel, which worked pretty well. The bathroom had seen better days but was nonetheless functional. Soap and linen provided. No clock or alarm is available (not counting the TV), and the wake-up call service is unreliable; hence, a traveller's clock would be a good idea/purchase. Say hello to the parrot in the lobby, but keep your distance if you're standing nearby as the droppings splatter. Madame Tussaud's is within easy walking distance, as is an excellent pub, a camera store, and a cheap (1GBP per half hour) internet cafe, all south/southeast within 2-3 blocks. Several convenience stores within a block or two. If you are looking for good restaurants/pubs head South/Southeast about 6-7 blocks and just wander from there. Tube (Baker Street) is about 4-5 walk away. If you're not familiar with London, major attractions (West End, Leicester Square, etc.) are reachable within 15-20 minutes but you will have to transfer subway lines probably once. If you are a business traveller or don't mind the extra expense, avoid the hotel's taxi service as it was slow and took away from the time we'd allotted to check in early at the airport. Rather, hail a street cab (faster) or take the tube to Heathrow (cheaper). The bed was clean, the bathroom was clean and functional; both were cleaned daily. That's pretty much all I was looking for.

This hotel is well situated and is very comfortable and clean. The standard of service and room quality is much lower in London then elsewhere, but I felt that this property gave me value for my money. The only complaint I have was that it was hot during my stay, and unfortunately in order to get air into the room, we had to have the window open. As we were in the front of the hotel, we overlooked the street which is a very busy street with buses and cars running up it all night long. This would not bother me in the fall or winter, but if you stay in the summer I would suggest you ask for a back facing room. The breakfast was good, with a reasonable assortment of options, but the 10 cereals (only 3) and the pain au chocolate the other reviewer mention were not present during our stay, however it was varied enough for the 4 days we were there.
