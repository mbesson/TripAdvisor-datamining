It's a budget hotel in every way - cheap, and really not very nice. Felt like more like a hostel than a hotel. My single room was small, basic, had a grubby carpet, bars on the window, and a view over a filthy little basement courtyard. But on the positive side, the shower was very good. Everything felt just a bit grubby. The only hotel I've ever stayed where there was no shampoo or shower gel provided. Perhaps just about acceptable given the low price (for London anyway) - but reception didn't even have any for sale, so it was fortunate that there was a Sainsbury's Local just up the road! The breakfast room was particularly unpleasant - a windowless basement room, with very basic canteen-type furniture, and a very basic contintental breakfast buffet. Strange that there were cups but no saucers (just mugs would have been better!). No bar or lounge. So in summary, it's ok if you need a cheap hotel close to Paddington/Bayswater - but be prepared for a \"hostel\" type experience.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, UK", "Title": "\u201cEndurance Test\u201d", "Author": "SueManchester_UK", "ReviewID": "UR124731304", "Content": "I had the misfortune of staying at this hotel for five nights last week.

Homepage of the hotel claims \"The Palace Court Hotel is a newly refurbished thirty eight bedroom hotel\"!? I guess you can call it refurbished in Pakistan or India but in Europe we call it a filth infested dump not fit for humans !!! The furniture was the kind you find in a rubbish dump. The carpet was probably coming from a stable. The curtains was stained with dirt. Ventilation non existing. One morning it was dripping water from the lamp in the toilet. Everyday only 2 towels and no soap or shampoo. The employe working Saturday 4/6 evening refused to bring a towel to the room \"we do not have room service\" was he's reply. We tried the breakfast 1 day but the dirt covering the rest of the \"hotel\" told us too stay away from eating inside the building. I travel 200 days/year all over the world. The mentality of the personel working in this hotel cannot be found elsewhere. Guest houses i visited in India has the same cleanliness (non existing) as this so called \"hotel\". It's sad to see that the English goverment allows people with no clue regarding health, vermin, germs and hospitallity are allowed to manage \"hotels\".

There was no chair to sit on, only a tiny bed surrounded by shelves so nowhere to lean and relax without laying down on the hard bed. The toilet made a lot of noice when used and I barely fit in under the shower. The oven did not warm the room up to an acceptable degree and I was left freezing, in turn giving me a cold when I returned back home.

We just got back yesterday after spending six nights at this motel. We felt like ditching it as soon as we got there but just managed to spend alot of time away from it. We had a 4th floor (no elevator) triple room with three beds squeezed in, one picture on the wall. One bare lightbulb fixture lit the whole room, no glasses, no shampoo, no chest of drawers, you can't dial out on the phone and there was no phone book (or even bible) shower stall only with water that barely had enough force to rinse hair. Breakfast consisted of cold cereal, toast/jam/butter, hard boiled eggs, cheese, beverages. Be sure not to wear your pajama bottoms down to the breakfast lounge. Lobby consisted of one small sofa about 20' from the reception desk and you must bring your own computer down there to access internet. At least location was okay in terms of catching bus/tube, restaurants nearby, walk to Kensington/Hyde Park and even Piccadilly Square. Surely you can find something better........ there were lots of motels on the same block and one over (hostel is right next door) around this same area whose lobbies looked much better. Wasn't even that inexpensive.", "Date": "November 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ghent", "Title": "\u201cStolen in Palace Court Hotel\u201d", "Author": "foto_jo", "ReviewID": "UR48922815", "Content": "The familyroom was small, as well as the breakfastroom.
