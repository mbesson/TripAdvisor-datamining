The bed is like a boxspring with no mattress laying on the floor, and all night all you hear is banging and alarms. I have been here for 4 nights now and this is by far the worst hotel I have stayed at in the 10 years I have been traveling for work. The rooms are small and I have to straddle the toilet to close the bath room door to get in the shower. Oh ya dont expect your room to be cleaned on a daily basis either unless you ask for it. Otherwise the rest of Hong Kong is very pretty and very friendly!", "Date": "May 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam", "Title": "\u201c\"WORST\" of Hong Kong\"\u201d", "Author": "liveinAsia", "ReviewID": "UR119790511", "Content": "I travel to Hong Kong regularly to shop and eat world class food. My last trip ( oct. 2011 ) I made the mistake of staying at the San Diego hotel in Kowloon, the price was WAY too high for what I got. The room was $200 (US) per night, the most shocking part was they DO NOT clean your room unless you \"make\" them do it !! I was woke up in the middle of the night, EVERY night for my entire stay (5 nights) by a car alarm, I was told it was the hotel managers car and there was nothing they could do about it...........PLEASE save yourself from the huge disapointment and stay at; the Royal garden......Royal Pacific.....Even the 3 star BP international is VERY nice and is FULL SERVICE !!!!! A DO NOT miss is the Ruth's Chris steak house in Kowloon, it's an American steak house ( the ONLY ) place in all of Asia that \"flies-in\" fresh US grade \"A\" steaks from the US \"daily\". The service is \"world class\" they are very in-tune with thier customers !! Every time I walk through the door they remember my name and \"exactly\" how I like things.....right down to the toppings on my baked potatoe !!!!!! Next time your in Kowloon stop by and let them know Patrick from Thailand sent you.....I promise you will return again and again.....THE VERY BEST of Hong Kong !!!!!!", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood for the value and location is quite good too.\u201d", "Author": "Gwch", "ReviewID": "UR85617225", "Content": "Have been staying at this hotel for te last 5 yr.

I claimed, but they just say they'll do soon. They should have appologized their fault. 2. DVD player corruption. I had a cold, so I stayed at hotel at night watching DVD. I'm afraid the DVD was broken. So I asked them to replace it. But they just said no replacement. It's ok that they have no replacement. But they should have made me feel more comfortable. Finally they changed the DVD player. But anyway I hate the staff service.
