We stayed for 3 nights and it was quite pricy as we booked the top floor \"suite\" which consisted of a small sitting area, a separate toilet, a smallish bedroom, a bathroom with a whirlpool bath and shower and a patio area. I didn't see a normal room so my review has to be restricted to this one. Most of my comments are based on the high price we paid - normal rooms may be much cheaper and better value. The layout of the room was good for us as our son could sleep in the sitting area. It was just that the whole room had seen better days. It wasn't dirty but it was scuffed and old fashioned - the floor had scuff marks where the bed is pulled in and out, the grout in the bathroom was not very white, there were scale marks in the granite sinks where water dripped (which could be cleaned if someone tried). The patio was nice but you didn't get a view - it was surrounded by plants. You could just see the Arc de Triomphe if you stood on a chair (a bit like the Fawlty Towers sea view). It also had rickety boarding that needed maintenance. The bed was comfy but you do get vibrations from the nearby extractor which shake the bed and don't aid sleep. There were dark fitted wardrobes and I found you couldn't see into them as when the doors opened they shut out the natural light and there was no lighting nearby. I actually felt quite claustrophobic at times in the room - not something I''ve experienced before. The bathroom toiletries were not very good - a mixed bunch and oddly no hair conditioner which threw me a bit. I didn't take any of them home with me (which I usually do) and they were not replenished during our stay. As part of the room deal we got a bottle of cheap champagne - presented in an ice bucket on the first night and then just left in the melted water for the next two nights when we didn't drink it.

You have a coffee shop next to you and a pharmacy/mini supermarket for late night emergencies.

I booked a room for 247 Euros/night without breakfast. When I arrived at the hotel I was upgraded to room 407 which is located at the back of the hotel. The room was fairly large compared to the typical Paris hotel room. The room had two French doors that opened and allowed a breeze to circulate throughout the room, although the room was air-conditioned. The room was clean, functional, but dated. The staff was very accomodating, friendly and efficient. I was told by many locals, including hotel staff members, that the Ave. Des Champs Ellysees had turned into an overpriced shopping mall and to shop and eat away from the Champs. I found this advice to be true. The hotel is one block from the Metro station at the Arc Triomphe. I took the Eurostar from London which terminates at the Gare du Nord. The Metro cost me $2.20 USD to get to the hotel versus around $80 USD by cab. If you have a lot of luggage or are disabled the Metro is not the best option because the number of stairs one needs to climb to negotiate through the Metro's innards before arriving at the hotel. The Eiffel Tower is about a 20-25 minute walk from the hotel and there are a number of restaurants in the area within walking distance. Many of the surrounding streets are in upscale neighborhoods and I encountered no problems during my stay. My advice to management is to update the bathrooms and replace the dated furniture. The hotel offers free internet use of a laptop computer cabled to the wall in the small lounge area next the the hotel bar. Yes, the older laptop is cabled to the wall and poorly lit. I had to retrive a flashlight from my luggage in order to illuminate the keyboard. The hotel restaurant was empty most nights, consequently I never dined there. I enjoyed my stay at the hotel and appreciated the staff's friendly, helpful service. If you are looking for a quaint neighborhood to enjoy a few days in Paris or a newer, trendy hotel you might look elsewhere.

Let's start with the location. 10 minutes walk from the Eiffel tower, 15 minutes walk from the Opera house, and one minute only away from the Arc and Champ Elysees. we were literally in the center of all action, good restaurants and all trendy places are all over. The room was very clean, bit smaller than i expected for a Business Class room but still relatively good enough in French standards. We had a slight problem with the bed. we had 2 single mattresses combined and often had to push these from both directions to prevent the gap. i find it a bit uncomfortable to sleep like that if you are a couple who like cuddling at night ;) The service was absolutely amazing. I have never seen such friendly receptionists and a cool concierge who gave us all the tips and information we needed to hang out in the city. All guys at the reception always were willing to help and way much more professional and enthusiast than any other hotel i ever stayed before. I would recommend this hotel to anybody i know just because of that service.. that was a good surprise indeed! The breakfast service was really kind and sweet, but i found it strange to had it served to my table and not pick all my favorites up from a buffet. I find the breakfast slightly smaller than i expected. but not a bad one. Furthermore, the hotel didn't rip me off for extras just like all the others in Europe i've been staying so far. WIFI was for free, a very fast connection too and never had a problem to connect at anytime. very strong signal as well. The only negative thing i can say is that Business Class room is not a real upgrade. i find it more like a brandable way to charge more money. The specification of Biz Room in their website suggests \"late checkout\" while we didn't manage to get that in practice. Plus the view was not the best, while i expected a business class room to have a better one. but bottom line, their service compensated for it all.. we were just astonished to see their enthusiasm to make us happy all the time.

Although i understand that it is usually the culture that hotels will not provide air conditioning during winter season, I needed air conditioning as I could not be exposed to winter air for a long period due to very dry skin conditions. Hence, I booked for the hotel believing their advert that they have air conditioning even in winter times. However, when i reached the hotel everything was a scam. 1) The hotel room was so small i had difficulty opening the wardrobe door. 2) The bedsheets were filled with dust. 3) One smack on the pillows will set the dust flying over your face! Horrible. 4) Air conditioning worked on a central control system, hence there was no way I could request for air conditioning for my room. 5) The safebox was spoilt. Needless to say, I made a complaint to the frontdesk. Only to see that they were rude and adamant about their services and the wrongly advertised information. Not wanting it to dampen my holiday mood, i went out of the hotel in search of a better hotel and that was where i stumbled up the concierge staff Radisson Hotel! Everything took a drastic change from here. The concierge was highly professional who spoke with grace, enthusiasm and politeness. Immediately they showed me to the room which is available for our consideration and offered to transfer our luggages from the nasty hotel to theirs! Their service was professional and efficient. Hence without further ado I went back to the hotel, spoke with the manager about my situation, waived the penalty payment of cancellation of hotel booking fees and dived straight into the cozy arms of Radisson!

The room was always spotless, and turndown service was consistent and on time. The air conditioning was wonderful and individually controlled. TV worked fine, good amount of closet space, and lots of shelves to store your belongings. The bathroom--very cute, and very clean, except for one or two tiny patches of mildew in the shower tile. Otherwise, I only had two minor complaints about the bathroom. First, the sink drain was very, very slow. The sink was also very shallow and did not have a run-off drain, so, basically, in order to avoid overflow, you had to keep the water going at only a trickle. If you let it flow full blast, you basically ended up with a full sink within seconds. Second, the shower door was only about a foot wide, and leaked like crazy. We put three towels down on the floor to absorb the water, but after every shower, the towels and the floor were soaking wet. I mentioned these issues to the front desk. They were very smiling and understood the problems, but said that was just the way the bathrooms were designed. Slightly annoying, but not a huge deal. The service--I found the front desk staff very friendly and eager to please. They did not seem super-knowledgeable about restaurant recommendations and the like, so I wouldn't rely on them for that kind of information. What they are helpful with are calling places for you, lending umbrellas, etc. They always said good morning and good night with a smile, which was nice. The location--super-touristy and super-expensive, with a sprinkling of office buildings and car dealerships. (Mind you, these are Parisian office buildings and car dealerships, which are not ugly eye sores at all; it just means the neighborhood can be pretty dead in spots, especially during the summer.) The outdoor cafes on the Champs Elysees, which are right around the corner from the hotel, are overpriced and mediocre. That said, the hotel is in easy walking distance of just about everything in central Paris. The nearest taxi stand is 2 blocks away, and you can get just about anywhere in 10 minutes. Even Sacre Coeur is only a 15-minute cab ride away. Another convenience: there is an amazing drugstore/gift shop around the corner called Publicis Drugstore. It's pricey, but is great for \"supplies\" like bottled water, batteries, toiletries, newspapers, etc., as well as fun non-essentials like purses, cashmere sweaters, and just about anything else you can think of. Overall, the area felt very safe. I would definitely stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to friends. It's not particularly charming or special or glamorous, but it's clean, spotless, friendly, and reasonably priced.", "Date": "August 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cWonderful stay\u201d", "Author": "knitski", "ReviewID": "UR8508435", "Content": "Wonderful place with a great location.

The hotel is conveniently located, just a couple of minutes walk from the Charles de Gaule Etoile Metro station and right next to the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees. We decided to go for the 'Room with a View' package and got a good view of the Arc de Triomphe from our bedroom. The bedroom was larger than I expected it to be with a comfortable bed, plasma TV, mini bar, bathroom with bath and separate shower cubicle and very clean and tidy throughout. We also got a complimentary bottle of Champagne. It wasn't in the room on arrival but without prompting they brought it up to our room later that day and it was there for us to enjoy when we got back from our afternoon sight seeing. The Reception staff and bar staff were all friendly, helpful and cheerful. We had a full English breakfast included in our package. Unlike other hotels there is not a buffet but waiter service which will bring your choice to the table. Personally I preferred this as it was a more relaxing experience than battling for food with a crowd of people. There was plenty to eat. Choice of juice, choice of tea, coffee or hot chocolate (incidentally hot chocolate is to die for so give it a try!), big basket of pastries with jams. The cooked breakfast has sausage, egg any style, bacon, mushrooms and tomato and is cooked to order so hot and fresh. By the time you are finished you will be more than full enough to see through to lunchtime! The hotel itself is quite small so there are not any more amenities than necessary, so if you are looking for an all singing, all dancing type establishment then this isn't for you. However, if you like relaxed and peaceful surroundings with a boutique feel that is close to the Metro and has excellent accessability for all parts of Paris then this is a very good choice and you will enjoy your stay.", "Date": "August 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cExcellent 4 star hotel.\u201d", "Author": "harry6palmer", "ReviewID": "UR8456406", "Content": "Very clean room.

We paid a bit extra for a superior room with a view (and a free bottle of champagne). Like the rest of Paris, it was quite expensive. I couldn't seem to find any cheap deals on the web, so just booked through the Radisson website. We stayed there at the start of June 07. Upon arrival we were told that the water on our floor wasn't working. Consequently, we had to stay in another hotel for our first night. The only place on offer (apparently, as Paris was so busy!) was the Concorde La Fayette. This gets an average rating of just 2.5 on TripAdvisor. And it showed. Even though we were put in a Junior Suite, it was a large, run-down hotel in an inferior location (see the reviews for yourself). Needless to say, we were less than pleased. Especially as we were only there for 3 nights! When I finally spoke to the manager (of the Radisson), she offered us a free meal. But never once did they offer to upgrade us. In fact, when we finally got into our room, we had to ask a couple of times for our champagne. To be fair though, after this rather unfortunate incident, the hotel was generally fine. Excellent location, friendly and helpful staff, with a nicely designed interior (although I still thought our room had a bit of a damp smell to it). Overall, I do think that our problem was probably a one-off. So I would still recommend this hotel. And the food was also very good. I just wish we'd realised that the drinks were free too...

But I'll add my quick two cents. Location? Could NOT be much better. Of course, depending on what you're looking for. Near the fabulous designers, L'Arc de Triomphe was visible if I leaned out my window, Champs Elysees a 1 minute walk, restaurants, the Metro, a LOVELY store about a 30 second walk that had anything you could possibly need, an epicurean delight. This was my 4th trip to Paris, but each has been very different. This one was luxurious. If you're looking for more flavor/charm/character...the Champs Elysees might not be the area for you. Room was beautiful. Wooden floors and built ins, gorgeous bathroom. I had two rooms (traveling with teens) that connected and both were nice. I was booked in a standard room, but I don't know if they might have upgraded me or not. The rooms were quite large with TONS of closet space. They look like the hotel's website. BUT...on arrival we had no air conditioning. I called down and was told it was inadvertently not turned on from downstairs, and that they then did so. I struggled for the next 2 nights wondering why it was still sweltering, but felt uncomfortable asking again because they SAID they'd corrrected it. Fortunately, it was COLD outside, so the rooms never got so that we couldn't stand it, but it was close. There was no opening the window to cool the room beause they were fabulously soundproofing. But, if you opened them, there is an underground garage entrance just outside the hotel and the horrid loud noise of cars exiting/entering and going over a metal plate is constant. The last day, I finally asked again, they said they'd call me back. In 5 minutes the air started and they never did call me back. We could hardly sleep so this was the only REALLY disappointing part. We ate the full breakfast there both days, and it was reasonably priced compared to others. And it was VERY good. The service was polite at the small restaurant/bar...as well as the front desk. I got a tiny bit of attitude from the concierge when I asked if they could check when the Paris Opera (Garnier) held tours in English. My daughter is a huge fan and, though we speak a bit of French, knew we'd get a lot more out of the tour in English. But online searches gave conflicting information and it was THE reason we decided to stop in Paris again. \"Well, I've never done anything like that...but I guess I'll make the call\". Of course I tipped him, and ... in typical American fashion overtipped.

Our room had a limited view of the street, although we have been told Eiffel Tower views are available. The only complaints we would have would be the overall cleanliness of the bathrooms.

Would go back again. High marks for each of the following: Location: Extremely convenient. A few blocks from the main Metro line that goes directly to the Louvre and other major attractions and provides transfers to all other lines. A block from the Champs-Elysees, which has numerous shopping and eating options at all price levels. Drug/foodstore at the corner is open until 2am. Close to ritzy shopping if that's important. Very pleasant 10-15 walk to the river and the Bateaux Mouche. Room: As with most European rooms, a bit on the small side. But room is clean and modern, a bit like a W hotel. Bed was comfortable and a true king, not two singles put together. We were on a non-smoking floor and did not have any issues with smelling smoke. Bathroom was good-sized, plenty of room. No shower curtain/door, so just need to be careful about spraying water. Small refrigerator where we stored water, milk, juice, fruits. No issue with noise, though we did face the inside courtyard. Service and Amenities: Concierge/front desk was uniformly pleasant and helpful with providing directions, suggestions and reservations for dinner (definitely try Chez Henri for the French brasserie experience, excellent food and gracious service). There is one computer in the lobby/lounge area with free internet access. Did not try to food. Preferred to grab food from a pastry shop or to buy some cereal/fruits at a nearby grocery and eat in our room. Conclusion: Would highly recommend to anyone.

I requested top floor, and got room 702, which I think has the biggest balcony (the other balconies all looked smaller - big enough to stand on and enjoy the view, but my balcony had seats on it!). Ask for 702, but if it's not available the other balconies looked fine to me and I'd have been happy with a different room. Reception staff are superb, all seem to speak English, and it was a nice friendly and professional welcome. Location is great, although be aware that it's on a busy road, so on a hot night I kept the windows shut and the air conditioning on. The latter was adequate, although not bone-chilling. There was a wired-in smoke detector in the room, and in the halls, and proper fire exits! This is the main reason I booked there, because too many Paris hotels don't take fire safety seriously. Although it's a small hotel, there were two fire exits close to me, and on a quick look both seemed to be in order (ie the door opened, no obstructions, nothing stored there). Flat screen tv had the main channels you would expect, including BBC World for English language news. Bathroom was brilliantly fitted out and they were generous with the towels. There is a rather nice panelled hallway, and if you close the door between it and the bedroom, there is just the light from the frosted glass door of the bathroom, it forms a relaxing place to just sit for a bit. That probably makes no sense, but try it if you stay there. The room and bathroom were very clean indeed, the wooden floor having been mopped. There is a good deal of lighting, in all sorts of different configurations, which I liked - I hate it when you can't get some decent bright light to read, or can't get a nice dim light for relaxing in. The views are splendid - of the Arc de Triomph in one direction, and you can see the top third of the Eifel Tower in the other direction, which looks nice at night when it's lit up. If you stay on a lower floor, I think you probably won't get to see as much or anything of the Eifel Tower though. A few negatives. Although the bathroom and hallway are lovely, I found the room itself a bit ugly. The curtains were a rather drab blue, and there was some rather nasty modern art on the walls. All harmless enough, and you don't visit Paris to sit in your hotel room all day looking at the curtains. Bed was okay but slightly softer than I like. Breakfast was okay but slightly disappointing, in terms of both quality and quantity for the price. I've had better in Paris hotels, but also worse - I think I'd just expected slightly better. I think I paid just over 300 Euros for the night, can't remember the precise amount, and I thought it was good value for money. The package included a bottle of champagne, which was on ice and yummy.

They are funky modern affairs\u2026 I said I was torn\u2026 The downsides are\u2026 The room was small, we stayed in 203, there is just enough room for the furniture and not enough room for the furniture if you want to open the French doors leading to the balcony with that view of the Arc de Triomphe. Don\u2019t get too excited, the balcony is less than a metre wide and the only way you see the Arc is by stepping out onto it. Then again you could just step outside the hotel and get a better view\u2026 The champagne (actually\u2026 methode champenoise) was not exactly quality either. The funky bathroom has a door frame that is coming away from the wall, not major, but a nice dirt trap that should be fixed. The shower has a waterproof (I hope\u2026) light directly above the shower head. I say I hope it is waterproof because the shower head needs replacing a water shoots at force into the light and the ceiling! The basin is funky, not practical though and the limescale deposit that has been allowed to build up is a little unforgivable. Finally the in-room safe was not, on account of how it did not work.

You can jump on the double decker bus from the Arc de Triomph which takes you around all the major sites - a great way to see Paris.
