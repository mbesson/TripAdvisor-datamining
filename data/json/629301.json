The apartment was clean, well furnished and had everything we needed, as well as some things we didn't - like the mirror on the bedroom ceiling! Meriton have obviously had issues in the past with wild parties - there are signs all over the place warning of immediate ejection from the building for any guests found to be having a party in their room, though we saw nothing else to suggest this might be a problem. Indeed, our floor was deathly quiet. The apartment had a great view looking towards Darling Harbour and the Anzac Bridge (I guess if you were on the other side of the building you'd be looking at skyscrapers in the CBD) and the balcony was great, although was bizarrely locked for the first couple of nights we were there. There's a note in the guest information book that says \"all balconies are locked and guests who tamper with the locks will be charged\" so we initially got cross and were going to go and complain to reception (\"why advertise an apartment with a balcony if you can't use it?\") - before deciding it just wasn't worth the hassle. Then, on the next day, I tried the patio door again and it opened. Given that I've since seen reviews from other guests complaining about locked balconies at this property, I can't understand what was going on here! The full kitchen was great - all the facilities we wanted; the bed was comfortable (though I really prefer not to wake up to my own reflection looking back at me from the ceiling); the bathroom was clean and new-ish and having a washer and dryer was very helpful. We parked in the property's underground car park, which was fine, if eye-wateringly expensive for my pocket. Then again, all the city centre car parks in Sydney are. As for location, it's a block and a bit walk to Town Hall Station, and the property is surrounded by cafes and restaurants. Plus there's a Coles supermarket under World Tower just around the corner and a Woolworths opposite Town Hall station if you want to buy and cook your own food. Darling Harbour is also walking distance. The was the most expensive accomodation we stayed in during our trip to Australia, but comparable in price to good city centre hotels in Sydney. That being the case, I'd definitely stay here or in another of the Meriton properties if I was in Sydney again, rather than paying a similar amount for a much smaller hotel room with fewer facilities.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWorst value hotel stay in years\u201d", "Author": "aussiedarkhorse", "ReviewID": "UR127974061", "Content": "This place is VERY dissapointing!

Our one bedroom apartment was a good size and was clean and well equipped. We had followed the tips on trip advisor and requested a high floor and a room on the Darling Harbour side. We got exactly the opposite. Now I realise they can't fulfil everyone's requests but considering most people probably would not have asked or booked as early as us and considering that we were staying for 10 nights I would have thought our request may have been granted. Our view was of the street behind and the Planet Hollywood Cafe glaring sign. The balcony was not a balcony you could use at all due to it's size. The quality of the fittings was good except for the lounge which was so uncomfortable to sit on. Hard as a rock, no arm rests and only one. We woke the first night in the early hours because the couple in the room near ours was having a domestic. After listening to them yell for a while we contacted reception when things started being thrown. We heard security arrive and it quietened down for awhile but then we were awoken again. Again we rang reception. Same thing happened three times and neither me, my husband or our 21 month old that kept getting woken were happy. When we decided to go out early for the day so we didn't have to listen to it any longer, the couple were continuing their arguments in the hall but none of the staff seemed to care. We only had occasion to speak to the staff a few times and every time they seemed completely exhausted and as a result were not very friendly. The daily room service was great for the first day but after that it was terrible. The detergents were replaced once and then not again. Toilet paper was not replaced. Milk was not replaced and on some days the garbage wasn't emptied. The hotel was definitely convenient. Train station around the corner, short walk to Darling Harbour, loads of restaurants around and ofcourse plenty of shopping. For the price it was an ok stay. If you go make sure you make your reservation on myrez.com.au as it was definitely the cheapest way to book. A good place to stay if you just want a bed at night. Will I go again?

The building is very clean and modern, and the suite I received was excellent.

I thought the size of my suite was incredible, good sized bedroom with a big comfy bed, full kitchen, full size laundry and a good sized living room. The room was serviced once a week, which was good but a bit inconsistant - some weeks I received additional ammenities, sometimes I didn't, sometimes I'd be given extra toilet paper and some weeks I'd have to call and request more. The actual cleaning during the servicing was excellent though. I didn't experience any noise coming from within the hotel, but if you are a light sleeper I would reccommend getting a high floor that is west facing to avoid the nightly commotion from George Street. I'm an excellet sleeper, however, so while being aware of the noise, it never bothered me. Elevators are sometimes a bit slow, but I never experienced the ten minute wait I read about in other reviews. I usually just found the elevators to be busiest at the end of the day if there was a big conference staying in the hotel (and as I was there for 75 nights, I saw quite a bit of turnover). The Neighbourhood makes you accessible to so many things - two grocery stores within walking distance, tons of restaurants, as well as Paddy's Markets only a few minutes away for cheaper veggies, and of course Darling Harbour.

Several things are to be applauded. First, the rooms are large (typical for converted apartments being used for hotel-style accommodation). Stayed in a 1-bedroom apartment which had spacious living and dining, good sized kitchen and bathroom was appropriately sized. Excellent sense of light and space, though I was on a high floor and had a balcony so that helps. The complex is very modern and the furnishings and other features of the room were contemporary, comfortable and fresh. Much better than some other nearby apartment hotels which are a bit rundown (eg the Radisson Liverpool St which is another one I've used recently). Second, there is a good gym and spa/pool facility - emphasis is on cardio workout (6 running machines, x-trainer, no free weights, small number of weight machines). Third, location is unbeatable, though it may be personal preference - I love the Chinatown end of the city. It's about a 10-15 minute walk to the main shops around QVB building, Myer, Westfield if you don't know Sydney. Fourth, excellent air conditioning. I mean REALLY excellent. Three independently controllable units, very effective. BEst I've had in this kind of hotel. One very big minus - there is no television in the bedroom of the 1-br apartments. This doesn't worry us when travelling as a couple but I'd be a bit annoyed if I were on my own. Studio apartment presumably doesn't have this problem. Did also have a problem in that we asked for blankets not duvet in room and it was not provided; problem solved within 2 minutes of ringing them upon arrival, however. Only other minor complaint would be parking cost - $35 / day. Then again, 9 times out of 10 you don't need a car and at least the parking is easy to navigate and the bays are not all cramped as in some others. Curious feature. This may not be true of all rooms but the one I was in had a very large ceiling mounted mirror in the bedroom (!!!). I wonder what the owners or earlier tenants have in mind for this place haha. If that's your thing ask for room 4602A All in all, this has won me - better value than Fraser Suites, about a block down Kent St, and more modern fittings and feel (esp. gym) than the Radisson Suites hotel nearby.

It felt like such an achievent to look up at the bridge throughout the day and think we'd climbed to the summit. - Sight seeing tour bus. This took around 2 hours to do the full circle. Definitely worth it to see as much of Sydney as we could. You do have the option to hop on and off as many times as you like though and your ticket is valid for 24 hrs to do this. You also have the option of getting on another tour, which takes you to the eastern suburbs, including Bondi. This is all included in the total price of $35. - Ferry to Manly. This was a great photo opportunity on the journey of the Opera House and of course the Harbour Bridge, as well as the whole of Sydney's skyline. We then had a stroll around manly and headed to the beach to watch the surfers take in the early evening waves. - After our return ferry journey back to The Quays (Sydney Harbour) we took a stroll up the Opera House steps to take in the amazing architecture of this phenomenal building. After our long and exhausting day we opted to go back to our beautiful apartment and cook our evening meal in the very well equipt kitchen. Also to make the most of the very relaxing and comfortable facilities. My only regret is that we didn't have a longer stay in this great apartment and in the amazing city of Sydney...", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cExcellent room, poor reception and service, for tall guys only\u201d", "Author": "Matilda F", "ReviewID": "UR123288328", "Content": "The room (sky view) was spacious, great and had heaps of seating options (including a loggia).

Asian to European and many offering great value meals. I could not find any fault with this establishment and if you like to stay in an apartment rather than an hotel, I suggest that the Meriton on Kent Street is about as good as you will get.

I chose it because of the close proximity to darling harbour (10 mins) and circular quay (15 mins) Given the time of year most hotels in the centre were either full or ridiculously expensive so we opted for a cheaper alternative. I'm really glad we extended our search beyond hotels because the meriton apartments were wonderful and exactly what we wanted - clean, newly refurbished and relaxed enough to do laundry and cook breakfast etc... It essentially felt like a home away from home. The apartments were very well serviced and we were given everything we needed to keep the place clean ourselves. The bed was incredibly comfy and in the living room we had panoramic views from the numerous windows which was a nice touch. My only criticism would be that the windows are not very well insulated so music from the late night bars could be heard even from our 37th floor! Also the tv reception was apalling with most channels not even having sound. But when you're in a great city like Sydney one of the last things you'll do is watch tv so that's not a big deal.

This time we were told by the very pleasant fellow at reception that they had \"a surprise\" for us - and what a nice surprise it was; we got a studio on the top floor! What an absolutely outstanding view - we can see both north and south head as well as the ocean over towards Bondi area and the Sydney Cricket Ground (where the game is still playing as we speak under lights). As usual the check in was quick and efficient with well presented staff. The room is typically Meriton furnished - which means very nice and comfortable. A small kitchen (remember it's only a studio) - which has a 2 burner halogen stove with rangehood, a Smeg convection microwave (if you can't cook a full meal in this thing, short of steak or pan fried food, you can't cook anything) and a half sized Smeg dishwasher. An Omega washer/dryer combined (not a fan of those as everything comes out creased beyond belief if you dry in them) and bar sized fridge. The bathroom doesn't have a bath but it's a studio - and with this view, who is in bathtub?? I'm sitting watching the lights outside as I write this. The windows open hearing the buzz of the city 55 floors below. The king sized bed is also a welcome comfort as this is what we sleep in at home. I know it will be comfortable as all the beds have been in the past quite firm, just the way we like them. A quick lie down on it earlier showed that it was the same as we are used to here. Full sized wardrobe space and a marble 2 person square dining table with a separate office nook near the almost floor to ceiling windows - this place is awesome. There is a lap style pool and sauna with a spa pool (which isn't really heated). It's great if you don't have anyone with their horrible screaming/screeching vile children running between all three. I don't mind children provided they're behaved. Why don't seem people stop their children from interrupting other's relaxation? The place is enclosed in glass so if you luck out and have these types of children running around you'd best leave and come back another time, because their ignorant parents won't do anything about them. The location is fantastic if you want to go to Chinatown or Darling Harbour. Personally we think Darling Harbour and King Street Wharf are waaaaay overpriced. Better to go down to a small Chinatown restaurant where you can walk and check out the menus (steer clear of Dixon Street - the main pedestrian mall - unless you want cheap mass produced goopy Americanised Chinese food at inflated prices). From here in 5 mins you can get to a underground railway station or in about 7 mins you can be at the light rail which takes you over to the cosmopolitan Glebe or the Star City Casino. The rail network is excellent if you want to jump a couple of stops down to Circular Quay which has got to be the best view from a railway platform in the world - The Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge right in front of you - all for about 4 or 5 dollars from near the Meriton on Kent. About 5 mins walk to the Queen Victoria Building (which is stunningly beautiful) where you can see the original parchment signed by Queen Elizabeth II on it's opening. Walking through that place is magic - especially around now at Xmas time, looking down all the open federation tiled floor openings to the basement and watching the foot traffic is an hour's enjoyment on its own. We get a deal on parking nearby but if you want to park here you can get it for $35 a night - steep it might seem - that's not bad for Sydney City overnight. At least here you get multiple in/out privileges. If you park in a carpark it's one time in and one time out each time before you pay again. Immaculately clean and always a pleasure to walk into - we casn't go past the Kent Street Meriton. Give it a try - we hope you like it as much as we do. Have a look at the photos I took today.

The building seems to be new and on arrival awaits a friendly and helpful staff for check-in and general info about the city. I had a studio but it was surprisingly large with a large bed, well equipped kitchen, nice and rather spacious bathroom and sitting corner. All amenities were there.

Fully stocked kitchen, laundry, nice bathroom and then the bedroom. This is my little complaint. I am so not into mirrors above beds. Had actually considered staying in Kings Cross and at that point thought I was actually in Kings Cross. For the 3 nights that mirror totally freaked me out. Everything else was wonderful and would recommend these apartments to anyone that wanted, views (we had fabulous views), space, all the comforts of home for a pretty reasonable price. Very central to just about everywhere with an abundance of restaurants, supermarkets and pubs. No problems with staff, they were all very helpful and friendly.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat great location\u201d", "Author": "Sieumuoi", "ReviewID": "UR108050889", "Content": "Definitely stay here again next time I am in Sydney.

We complained and they did nothing. The rooms were dusty, the front-office staff were unhelpful and all they appeared interested in was hot extract more money out of us for anything and everything...internet costs are additional, parking is additional, breakfast not included! There is no concierge, no help and they get you to pay upfront for your apartment!!! The surrounding area is also horrible. We stayed on the 38th floor and could hear traffic down below and were regularly woken up by sirens because the windows in the apartment are not sound proofed. It tried to cook breakfast in the tiny kitchen and had to battle the fire alarm going off every 5 minutes with normal cooking smoke.

So we decided to book a 1 bedroom sky view for one night. When it came to checking in they couldn't find my reservation but after asking other staff they soon found it. *Room 5004A on level 50 *Room was $205 + $60 for late check out at 1pm Lucky because a week later, when I looked the same room was $395 a night They were excited to tell us we had been given one of the nicest rooms within the hotel. Level 50 with sky views along with late checkout ($65 extra charge, which had already been asked for and was confirmed without any problems) along with a mirror on the ceiling which took up most of the ceiling over looking the king bed. Was lovely, along with everything else that was within that room. For Example: *Bathroom ~ separate bath, separate shower, rather large basin. *Kitchen ~ Full-size Kitchen, dishwasher, sink, stove and oven, microwave, kettle and all glasses and plates plus much more. *Lounge Area ~ 3 Seater-lounge and a single lounge along with a coffee table, flat screen television and plenty of ample space. *Dining Area ~ 4 seats and a table , with a wrap around window with lovely views looking the other way onto George Street etc. *Balcony ~ lovely views with 2 seats and a table *Laundry ~ Washing machine, dryer, sink, iron board and iron (all located in a closet in the hallway). *Along with plenty of cardboard space within the hallway of the room, the yellow-pages are also in one of these closets. *Bedroom ~ 1 king size bed (actually is two separate beds put together) but this didn't make the bed uncomfortable in anyway, the bed was really roomy and we both had a lovely sleep. Large wardrobe with mirrors on the outside, along with a large ceiling mirror overlooking the bed. *Bit cliche` but I had asked for it because I thought being a special occasion is was called for. Plenty of lighting in every room, opening windows. Only Faults ~ Would have to be the blinds within the bedroom were nice but when it came to early morning the sun really came in and we're shielded in it, as it bounced off the wardrobe mirror and the ceiling mirror. We had a bath but myself being a curvier women it was a bit of a tight squeeze it would of been nicer if the bath was that little bit wider as the depth of it was fine. The shower on the other hand was a good size, we could both fit in it but the only down-fall was that the head of the shower was very small and even when the knob was turned on full there wasn't much water that came out of it, maybe it's just me but when I have a shower at home its on full and heaps of water comes out. Other than those 2 small faults with the room, I'd stay here again. I've stayed here before once before and really enjoyed myself. It's within the CBD, world square. Plenty of places to party, drink and dine. 24 hour reception with a card swipe for entry at night that makes it a whole lot more safer then some other places. Along with 5 lifts, so you don't have to wait long to get to your room. Parking is $35 a night, but we ended up parking at Harbour-side carpark for $28 for 24hrs. As I personally think $35 a night for parking is quite expensive. I paid in cash when I arrived and left a $200 cash bond.

I am the first to admit that we touched lucky and got a very good rate. I would have been equally satisfied if we had paid $300 a night for the two bedroom apartment. This time in February 2011 we didn't get so lucky! Firstly we got an awful exchange rate due to the weak pound. Secondly due to Sydney's understandable popularity everywhere has put their prices up considerably. The same two bedroom apartment cost over $450 which equated to \u00c2\u00a3300 per night. There were only three of us so \u00c2\u00a3100 per night for an apartment that whilst only a few years old is already starting to date and look tired. The furnishings are of very low end quality and their condition leaves a lot to be desired. These comments are based on the properties five star status and the very high prices that they command. The apartments are reasonably comfortable with an efficient AC system and a well equipped kitchen but they really aren't anything special and I certainly wouldn't stay their again unless we managed to get a much better rate. Meriton's pricing policy is a bit of a lottery and you have to be prepared to cancel and rebook several times to get a decent rate. They will try and charge $800 per night for a two bedroom apartment which is well over \u00c2\u00a3500 if they can get away with it. For Travel Lodge/Premier Inn style of furnishings and comfort that is a very high price. Staff are ok. The swimming pool and leisure facilities are reasonable. The location is good. High floor views are amazing. Daily servicing of the apartments is of a high standard.

For us, these apartments can't be faulted. Great location just off George Street with everything you could want on your doorstep.

This time, slightly smaller and with only one balcony, but still plenty of space. The beds are really comfortable (although after travelling for 28 hours from the UK I could have slept on a clothes line) and the pillows are wonderful. (And I'm fussy about pillows.) The aparments have everything you need including a washing machine, dryer, iron and ironing board, oven, hob, microwave, dishwasher and flatscreen TV with Foxtel. There's also plenty of wardrobe space and a safe as well. Everything is immaculately clean and the apartments are serviced daily with the dishwasher powder and laundry detergent replaced. They're also really quiet and you rarely hear another guest. A real bonus for those of us with noisy neighbours at home! And I know others have complained about the lifts but, on both of our stays, we never waited for more than a couplen of minutes for a lift and most of the time it was just a few seconds.

Its not that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m innocent myself of any unusual behaviour that night but this seems a good summary of the general happenings of the 56th Penthouse Floor. The Meriton Apartments on Kent Street is centrally located & is actually a skyscraper building. It is by no means an up market establishment as serviced apartments go, it meets all of the criteria & is comfortable enough for a big night out with your best mates, at $800 a night they would have to be pretty good friends. Weeknights prices drop to $500 as these rooms are mostly used for parties. Our 3 Bedroom Apartment Penthouse Suite was located on the 56th floor with views perfect for spit balling & water bombs, no-one can touch you! If you have been in an aircraft preparing to land at Sydney airport that is the sort of height we had, I could easily make out the Blue Mountains & the setting sun to the west. The apartment layout was divided into 3 levels with entertainment space on the first & third floors & the main bedrooms on the 2nd. The fully furnished apartment lacks the sort of boutique furniture which creates atmosphere & vibe so you will have to bring the party yourself. The apartment is carpeted so spillage will be a problem for spewers & wine spillers alike Another memorable feature of the master bedroom with ensuite was the ceiling mirrors fitted directly on top of the bed. This I would imagine would be quite a raunchy experience for those inclined, foolishly I got drunk & passed out on the couch. The room policy strictly stated no parties but we spoke to a few people who confirmed they were throwing celebrations themselves. Security eventually evicted 3 of these groups for noise complaints, one being the group of drunk women fighting in the hallway. The apartments are very much configured for parties especially the third level with the large balcony, mini kitchen/bar area & sweeping views of Sydney. Security doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t screen people in the lobby so party goers would be ok to go up as long as groups of people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t arrive at the same time.", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Suva, Fiji", "Title": "\u201cGood apartment choice\u201d", "Author": "CherryPuppy", "ReviewID": "UR80445354", "Content": "I stayed here for a week and had the 1 bedroom unit.

The kitchen contained a full size fridge, microwave, oven, range, and dishwasher, and call fully stocked with pots, pans, dishes, and utensils. This place was truly spacious, even by my \"I like it Texas sized\" American standards. This was an absolutely bargain! The washer and dryer (in a small separate washroom) was a huge plus! The furniture reminded me of college dorm room quality, but it really didn't matter. The maids came by daily as they would in a hotel, and everything else was hotel like. You'll hear complaints about the staff being snooty, and it's true. However, they respond to service request, and will provide useful information when asked. So who gives a flip if they aren't friendly? 1) You're not going to spend that much time interacting with them anyways. 2) The room size is awesome, and more than compensates for the staff's attitude. The Meriton World Tower is slightly more conveniently located, but you can't go wrong with any of the Meritons. We were blocks away from a large mall with a large supermarket inside of it. We were blocks away from the harbor and all sorts of dining. And if you're worried about fast food you recognize, Aussie's eat more fast food than anyone I've ever seen, so don't worry. You'll have your choice between McDonalds, Burger King (a close impersonator anyways), Denny's, KFC, Krispy Kreme, Pizza Hut, White Castle, etc. And, that's just on one block near the Meriton! Tip: If you stay here, there's a large just below ground souvenir shop (Sydney Souvenir Warehouse) just around the corner on Liverpool. This is the cheapest place in the Sydney area to buy your souvenirs. Go there on day 1 and at least see the pricing and selection so you're not tempted by the tourist traps. If you want to be in the heart of the nightlife, then you will want to stay in King's Cross. The Holiday Inn is your best bet there. You will hear people whine about how seedy and dangerous King's Cross is, but these are fuddy duddy grandparent types. Yes, it is the location of the red light district, but a fair comparison is that it's about as dangerous as New York's Time Square at night.

I'm already planning on staying there again this weekend, and no I do not work for them but I have stayed in at least 20 different hotels in the Sydney area and this one is by far the best I've experienced. Sometimes they drop their rates significantly at the last minute so if you're flexible it can be an extremely great value. I think anyone who is disappointed either paid too much or did not do their homework. The name clearly states it is Serviced Apartments, not a full service hotel, meaning the staff are there more or less to book you into your room, not to cater to your every need. Also a quick glance at a picture of the building clearly shows it is a tall building in the CBD surrounded by other tall buildings, so guess what, your room might face other tall buildings....surprise!! If you are expecting a view, you have to book a room that specifies it has a view, or else there is no guarantee. That's how hotels work. Also, the first 10 floors of the place are offices, so there is no way that one could be very close to the street. If you can't handle street noise, then you should not ask to be on a lower floor. There are like 55 floors to this place and the lifts are extremely fast. The city is really not very noisy at night anyway, and I am a rather noise sensitive person. I had no problem operating the washer and dryer, in fact for the rate I paid (less than $100) I was quite thankful to have these amenities.

It sounded as if people had only good things to say about it. That would probably be true for me too, except for very specific problems I had. The studio rooms I was in were both nicely appointed and very clean. The bathrooms were gorgeous. My problem was with the \"conveniences\" in the apartment. Let me explain. First, when I checked in I was assigned to a lower floor (18th floor--but don't be deceived. The above ground floors begin on Floor 10). I was really hoping for a water view room, as water is really what Sydney is all about. I was told I could move to a higher floor with a water view, but would be charged a $40 moving fee. Huh? I did the moving, and it was extremely inconvenient as I had to stand in a long line to check out of my 18th floor room. Stand in a long line to store my bags for the day. Stand in a long line to check back in for my 36th floor room. When I got to that room it was lovely, but much smaller than my first room and had a view of about 1/4 inch of water (which the houseman and I found after 5 minutes of searching). Why was a houseman in my room, you might ask. Well, the main reason I chose this hotel was that I am traveling around Australia and am traveling lightly. Therefore, I need a washer/dryer and a kitchenette. The house man was in my room because the washer/dryer was actually just a washer and he was trying to fix it for me. After washing my clothes for a second three hour cycle (no exaggeration) with no rying, he came back to take the clothes to the hotel laundry to dry. They came back still damp, balled up in a bag, and smelling a little stale as they had clearly sat wet in the laundry for several hours. Also, the microwave burned everything. There were no directions for the w/d nor microwave and neither were like any appliance I have used in multiple other places in Australia. Needless to say, this whole thing frustrated me greatly. The hotel did return the $40 moving fee because of my bad experience. As for location, the place is perfect if you want to be near Darling Harbor or Hyde Park. It is actually not too bad a walk to the Botanic Garden, Opera House (1/2 hour) or Oxford Street (20 minutes). In other words, it was central, but not really next to anything but China Town.

All soaps for dishes, laundry, and dishwasher were provided and replenished daily. They provide a hair dryer and iron w/board as well. Tub & separate shower also. We were impressed with its level of cleanliness. Ask for a high floor, as street noise can be a small issue, most especially on Saturday nights. The pubs go until 4 or so. Looking down on George St, it's like a sea of ants at that hour. Most other nights were much more peaceful. There are windows that open, which was lent a refreshing change from air conditioning (which it has). Good view of Darling Harbor. Nice central location. Walk to Chinatown, Darling Harbor, Pyrmont Bridge, and even Circular Quay. Foodstuffs can be had at Coles and Woolworth's, which we preferred slightly. In both cases, you take an escalator downstairs, where we least expected to find them. It's great if you want a meal at \"home\", since eating out in Sydney is quite pricey. One minor caveat, phone calls, even local ones, are $1.30/call, even for toll free calls. Reception desk is much too high, as noted by others, but it's marble, so I guess it's there to stay.

The \"major clean\" was far more than we expected - they even tidied up all the pens and highlighters that were strewn around by putting them back in their cases! Over the top! Yes, the balcony was locked and this is a pity because the balcony would extend the living space so much more. We were also lucky in being on a relatively high floor - the traffic noise in Sydney is shocking. Even being that high up we were entertained by sirens most nights.

At the airport we took the door-to-door van service (ask at the tourist office in the terminal), a bus for about 20 people with behind a luggage car. It costs 13 AUD p.p. one way or 22 AUD p.p. for a return. In the lobby the employees are behind a huge front as if they have something to hide. They have to stand to see you and loop down upon you, not very client friendly. Some staff is forthcoming but some of them are not really suited for the hospitality business. I had to sign a form to agree with the no-party and no-noise policy (great, it will give us a quiet stay) but also I had to give a 100 AUD deposit. (In the apartment is a list with all the kitchen items and the price of it in case something is broking or missing. During our stay I noticed that not everything was with 4 pieces as on the list. So I was a little worried that they would charge me the lost items and if I would mentioned it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that make them suspicious? Fortunately I received my whole deposit back!) In the living room there were only lighting ornaments in the ceiling, so in the evening it was not possible to create a cozier atmosphere. The apartment had a living room with open (full) kitchen area, a small bedroom with a wardrobe and a tiny bathroom. The latter was bad designed; it was not easy to get in, the door had to be wide open to enter due to the place of the washbasin. There was also a washer and dryer. Very strange that the washer could only be set on two temperatures, cold or 50 Celsius (= 122 F), so the laundry would not be clean or shrink! When I tried the hot temperature I noticed that it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worked at all, the water stayed cold. They offer laundry and dry cleaning service, we used to dry cleaning for a suit, it was reasonable priced and ready within 2 days (but only just in time for our visit to the Opera that evening!) . From here we could easily walk to Coles supermarket and we made our own dinner during our 4-day stay, which was fantastic (we were on a round-the-world tour and mostly in hotels). Also it was a 5-10 minute walk to catch a train to Circulair Quay, we always bought the day-tripper of 16 AUD p.p with unlimited access to public transport including ferries. The business center was expensive but just around the corner (on the way to Coles) in Liverpool Street is a Korean Internet caf\u00c3\u00a9.

Check - In OK very busy due to the heavily discounted post New Years Eve room rates for the week ($78 a Night), but we mananged to get checked in under 10mins so no complaints. We took our own bags up to our room but again no dramas, they had a guy do it if need be. The lifts were busy 55 floors and four lifts can lead to delays as the maintenance/maids use th same lifts and it can slow things down. So don't be in a hurry. The Room As we had spent the last few nights crashing on a fold-up bed at a friends place over New Years I was ready to settle for anything as we had only paid such a cheap rate I thought there must be a catch, but when we walked into the apartment we were not disappointed. We had a studio which was quite large, it had a shared lobby with another apartment (Dual Key) but didn't hear any noise from them. No balcony in studios but they lock all balconies anyway, presumably to stop Yobbos from throwing stubbies or furniture off the balconies. Other than that, Flat Screen TV, Kitchenette and very clean. Check Out No problems they stored our bags for a few hours before our flight, no dramas with the bill, then or afterwards.

Some other reviewers have complained that they found the beds uncomfortable because they have a slight 'split' in the middle as they are actually two singles zipped together, but I didn't feel the split at all. On top of this, the view from our big balcony was just wonderful. We were facing Chinatown/Darling Harbour and the lights at night time were breathtaking. We could really only see part of Darling Harbour as we were facing the other way, but the view overall was just amazing to come home to. The overall noise of the city wasn't too bad as we were very high up, however I won't lie and say we couldn't hear anything at all. Some nights there were several sirens going off, and we definitely heard the recycling van tipping bottles into a truck in the early morning several times. However, the noise wasn't overwhelming and was only slightly annoying on Saturday night, when there was a lot of traffic and beeping along with the sirens. The location of the apartment was also great. There was a Coles supermarket across the road and a Woolworths a 10-minute walk away. Darling Harbour was only a 5-minute walk, along with other great sights like the Powerhouse Museum, the Aquarium and Wildlife World. Sydney Tower was a 10-15 minute walk away (and very easy to get to) and Circular Quay is still within comfortable walking distance, about a 30-minute walk at a moderate pace. We walked absolutely everywhere and didn't feel any need to catch public transport as we were in a prime position to access everything. However, if you wanted to, the monorail station is extremely close, as well as Town Hall railway station and local bus access. The apartments were touched up every day, which included straightening the bathrooms, replacing towels and amenities (toilet paper, shampoo/conditioner, dishwashing powder) and making the beds. There were times when we came home and the housekeeping team had even turned on the dishwasher for us or folded clothing, which was very nice of them. The only complaint we had about the housekeeping team is that once we forgot to leave the 'do not disturb' sign on the door before we went to bed and housekeeping let themself in at 9am on the dot, when we were still asleep in bed. We thought this was a little bit too early to be servicing rooms, particularly because a lot of guests are on holidays and could be sleeping in. Apart from that very small complaint, we had a great time in the Kent Street Apartments and would recommend them to anyone.", "Date": "November 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cLoved the place\u201d", "Author": "lingamair", "ReviewID": "UR21921003", "Content": "Stayed at Meriton Kent Street on 2 seperate occasions.

We had a 1 bedroom apartment and the layout was good and facilities superb. The pool, spa and gym had me running around town trying to find some gym gear and bathers (I had not brought my own). The staff on the front desk are super-efficient, we didn't have to linger longer than 5 minutes to have everything taken care of including return airport shuttle for our checkout and the room key in hand. At this point I have to admit, this is probably my first stay in a serviced apartment vs a hotel. This is a great cheaper option than many 5 star hotels in the area, but I did find myself missing those extra hotel benefits...the bathroom amenities are the usual bar of soap, shampoo, conditioner, bath gel, bubble bath...but we found we missed the few extra things hotels include like shower cap, cotton buds/balls. Small niggle - but we ended up making the run to the local chemist to get them. The other major difference is that this does tend to feel like a home away from home, or someone else's place. It doesn't have the romance of a hotel, there isn't the connection with the property or the people who work there. There's no inhouse restaurant, no central lounge area to swap travel stories with strangers (apart from the hot tub). At around the $250 we paid for the 1 bedroom apartment...for a mere $50 extra, gets us into The Intercontinental, the Westin, Marriott or a host of others which are more geared to the service aspect - anything you need etc...but that's just us. The location is convenient for many things; trains, monorail, buses, Chinatown, Central CBD, Capital Theatre (we were here to see Billy Elliot), Chinese Gardens, Paddy's Market, Darling Harbour...everything really. If you have kids and want to contain costs by cooking yourself, being able to do your own laundry. This place is great, it will do it. My one key piece of advice on this hotel is DO NOT accept a room that ends in the number 1 or 2 or maybe 3. These rooms face South/South Westish (towards Liverpool St). The noise from the monorail is there, although not too bad. You will find that on Friday and especially Saturday nights is that this part of Sydney does not sleep...nor will you! This was even more in evidence come 5am on Sunday morning. The tinkle of empty bottles being transfered from one bin into a bigger bin and then probably into a garbage recycling truck went on for 90 minutes!!! Either people drink a lot, or they'd been hoarding bottles for a while - sounded like we were next to a glass recycling facility! Maybe it's quieter if you can get up high near the 50th floor too...we were down on the 19th level which is only 4 or 5 floors above ground (street level is level 10).

So I went with their recommendation for Meriton Kent St Apartment Hotel after reading favourable reviews in Trip Advisor. We asked for and got a high floor. The 52nd to be exact, so we could hardly hear the noises (nothing more than a distant hum) from the street even though the roads that surround the hotel were pretty busy. Our apartment faces Darling Harbour, so that was nice. The two-bedroom apartment (with two baths) is well furnished and the small kitchen (they provide dish washing detergent coz dirty dishes incur some outrageous charge) met our needs well enough. It was also convenient to have a washer and a dryer in the apartment (there's laundry detergent, but not dryer sheets or fabric softener). Good-sized bathrooms, but only one has a tub. Parents-in-law extended their stay and I booked a studio apartment for them in the same hotel. They liked it well enough too, although if I had known earlier, I would have asked for an apartment that is NOT on the same floor (15th) as the swimming pool for them. Reason: MIL told me that the cholrine from the pool would greet them whenever they stepped out of the lift. The hotel is a little expensive, but you get what you paid for. The location is great; it's easy to walk from the hotel to 1. the major shopping areas, 2.

The location is very convenient, in the middle of the busy shopping area. Circular quay and Darling Harbour are an easy walk away. I have to agree with the comments below regarding the service at reception. Although I have no particular complaint, the staff there was not the friendliest . The 1-bedroom apartment was very spacious for the two of us, we had everything we needed for our short stay. The furniture is as nice as it can be, not great quality, but I think this place is fairly new, so it still looks good. I was quite amused by the abundance of 'signs' about what you can and can't do in the apartment. (Although later on I found this a bit of a routine at other hotels in Australia as well.) Having just arrived after a very long haul flight, the first night was comfortable. However, for the rest of the time, the noise level from the street became very disturbing. I did read previous reviews about this, but since I have lived in cities all my life, I am very used to traffic noise etc. therefore I didn't think this would be an issue.

He explained that they did not have anything but I could buy something for about $5 at the convenience store around the corner and told me how to get there. We returned with the unit and even showed it to him to make sure it would work and he replied \"Yes\". The next morning I used my $100+ professional flat iron and it burned out after several seconds! I mentioned this to the front desk on my way back to the room that day and the clerk asked to see the appliance as he thought I should be compensated something for my loss. Luckily,he followed me to my room as my key did not work when we got there and he told me he would speak to his manager about the appliance. After another call to the desk as the airconditioning did not work AGAIN, this time due to a tripped switch, the desk clerk informed me that his manager did not feel they were responsible for my loss. She said that since \"they did not buy the adapter and we did\" , it was not their problem even though the clerk \"approved\" it!

I would NOT have wanted to be on a lower floor as even on the 38th floor we could hear music from the street, car horns etc. The apartments are lovely and I was genuinely surprised at the standard of the cleaning service. The daily \"touch up\" service is much more than that. They cleaned the bathroom, did our dishes, replaced linen and made the bed, amongst other things. To me, that was a full cleaning service - not a touch up. A nice surprise. The location of the apartment is fabulous. 5 minute walk to Darling Harbour where you can hop on a ferry to almost anywhere, 2 minute walk to the train or monorail. It is also right next to chinatown as well as many spanish restaurants for dinner or across the road from a supermarket and shopping centre (World Tower) so you can easily get food to cook for yourself. There were a couple of issues with maintenance of the apartment - which has been noted by other reviewers. Our bathroom door didnt close proprerly, the clothes dryer didnt get hot and the fan in the bathroom didnt work. However, I didnt report these issues to reception as they didnt really impact my stay so I cant complain too much (we only tried to use the dryer once and we just showered with the bathroom door open anyway). They may have fixed it while I was there if I had told them. I did complain about music once and security came right away, so that is good.

I booked direct with the Meriton on their website and paid the $194 per night x 8 nights up front. At the time of booking I requested a high floor. We arrived at just before 1pm and an efficient but \"superior\" receptionist told us that we could have a room on floor 20 immediately or the planned room on floor 45 at 2pm. We decided to wait. A note about reception, the desk is about 1.4m high and the staff on the other side are all seated. This makes it uncomfortable for someone short like me to fill out papers and deal with the staff. With the exception of the guy who checked us out all the recpeption staff were efficient but cold. So when we got our room we were impressed. A large corner apartment with a nice sized bedroom and a well planned living/kitchen area. Nice touches in the layout were the facts that the bathroom and laundry were located at the end of the hallway by the front door to cause minimum disturbance to the bedroom and living room area. The balcony was huge with a fabulous view of Darling harbour and even the airport in the distance. Cool to watch the 747's landing. Unfortunately some of the details let the apartment down. All the knives were ridiculously blunt, despite getting someone up to show us how to work the oven we couldn't get it above 70 degrees, the handtowel rail fell off every day, one day the handle to the laundry came off in my hand. (This was fixed at no penalty charge to us by the time we returned the next day). Internet is available in the room but was very expensive. Reception did provide a cable to us free of charge with no bond. The room was well serviced daily but late in the afternoon which was a pain if you were back and wanted to relax. The lifts were mostly ok, queues formed in the lobby on a couple of occasions but mainly because only 5 people would get in a lift with room for 15. One lift was out of order for the whole 8 days we were there. The pool and jacuzzi were nice but I was put off when the hygiene guy took samples and then returned with a large sack of chemicals. The sauna did not work. Did not try the gym. Our keycards worked without a problem for the whole 8 days. In a previous hotel my keycard had to be repeatedly reprogrammed because it would not work, until we discovered that having it in my bag next to my mobile phone demagnitised it. One last thing you might consider is that if like us you get a room on the 45th floor you will discover that you are only on floor 35 above street level because the lobby and street access are on level 10!!!!! This means that level 20 is really rather low and therefore it is not surprising that it would be noisy from the street. At level 45 (35) we could hear traffic and sirens but no partying.", "Date": "February 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cCan do better\u201d", "Author": "pirate-allie", "ReviewID": "UR13241179", "Content": "Previously we have stayed in the Radisson Plaza and the Westin but decided to try a serviced apartment instead. We won't be back as I didn't think it was very good value for the service we got. It was $218/night on wotif. I have to say, it was a HUGE corner apartment but it was incredibly noisy being on the 20th floor. Luckily the aircon drowned out much of the street party noise so it wasn't disastrous but obviously they don't have the soundproofing of other places. The location, overlooking George St is likely to result in plenty of noise compared to other locations perhaps. Yes it has free foxtel but a lot of the channels had dodgy sound and were in b/w. This wasn't really a problem as we hadn't come to Sydney to watch tv all day. I agree with someone else's comments about the lifts. Again, one was out of order and there were insufficient lifts to service the amount of users. The kitchen was well-equipped but there were draconian messages about having to ensure washing up was all done which I found surprising in a serviced apartment (my previous experience eg Medina Grand in Melbourne is that washing up is done every day - not that I expect this) especially when a lot of the cutlery/dishes weren't clean to start with! The bathroom was fine but starting to look a bit tired. It is good to have a laundry for longer stays. The pool was a good size although disappointing that no towels were provided. The gym looked good in principle but the gym station had sticky cables, the swiss balls were almost flat and there were only 2 treadmills and no signs by the management asking people to limit their time on the machines. It was busy which was not helped by a guy who spent 1.5hours on one of the treadmills. This was clearly not the hotel's fault but given the plethora of notices telling guests what to do elsewhere, I was surprised there was no notice in the gym asking for consideration (my experience shows that this is standard in most gyms because clearly people can't be considerate without being told to be!). I think the gym was ok but not if you want a serious work out. It wasn't as good as other gyms I have been to either in Melbourne or Sydney. Depends on what's important I guess as to whether this is an issue. One good thing is that the water machine was empty and reception actioned this when we mentioned it. Another positive is that they have left luggage and allow use of the pool/gym/showers if you have a late flight. OVERALL, I thought it was in a good location, the apartment was the biggest I have ever stayed in but the rules (eg $100 fee for lost room keys seems extortionate and I personally dislike hotels who insist on actually processing a deposit from your credit card rather than having it as security), the noise and the slightly-off facilities mean that we won't be going back.", "Date": "February 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cThe just don't care\u201d", "Author": "Steve147", "ReviewID": "UR13090644", "Content": "Stayed here in a studio apartment for two weeks over Christmas and New Year, and have to say much the same as some other reviewers. I'll start with the good .... - location is excellent, a block from Town Hall Station, five minute walk from Darling Harbour, plenty of convenience stores nearby that are open late - check-in: we arrived in Sydney at 9am, officially their check-in time is 2pm, but they had our room ready for 12:30. They didn't have to do this, and I appreciate the effort they made. - complimentary Foxtel TV - in-room CD and DVD players - modern, clean, the kind of place you should really enjoy spending time in Now, in no particular order, the bad .... - both of our room key-cards had to be re-programmed by reception every two or three days. So frustrating, and unnecessary, these should easily be able to retain all the information on them for two weeks. If they can't then there's something wrong with the cards, so stop re-issuing them. Throw them away and get some new ones that work. - apartment floors are served by five elevators, one of which was permanently out of order. I can accept that Christmas isn't the best time to get a repair company out, but they charge the earth for rooms around New Years Eve and the place was full so it's not like they couldn't afford it. But they would rather deny guests 20% of the elevator capacity at the busiest time of year. - I have to agree with what somebody else said, they have a whole load of daft rules, and if you break any of them you're fined a hundred dollars! Like if you lose your room key (which is just a plastic key-card, which costs pennies to replace) it's not worth a $100 fine - sometimes people lose things, it's not malicious, it's just human nature. And are they also saying that if you're unlucky enough to have your wallet or purse stolen and your key is in it, then Meriton Towers are going to take another hundred dollars from you as well? Come on! - another rule, which was on posters all over the place reminding their guests was a \"no parties, no loud noise\" rule, the penalty for which was immediate eviction and no refund. Which seemed a bit harsh, but if that's the rules then that's the rules (though we weren't going to have a party anyway). Except that when I complained to reception about neighbours having a party in their room (and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want them evicted, just given a warning) I was told that there was nothing they could do as \"theirs is a residential apartment\". So Meriton Towers set the expectation that they have a zero-tolerance policy towards in-room parties, only for them to turn round and say that this applies to me, but that my neighbours could do whatever they liked! Unacceptable. - folder with details of all their draconian fines also had \"helpful\" details about how to operate the oven, dishwasher, etc. Except that the person who wrote it obviously didn't try to follow his own instructions, as the ones that were allegedly for our dishwasher bore no relation to what we actually had to do. OK, figuring out a dishwasher isn't rocket science, but it just shows a lack of thought towards the guests. - you need to be a giant to reach into the kitchen cupboards. I'm 6 foot (1.83m) tall and I was standing on tip-toes and barely getting my fingertips to the shelves. No doubt if I had caused a plate or cup to smash because of this, they would have fined me a hundred dollars! - two people are staying in a room for two weeks, so give them a wardrobe with three coat-hangers in it. Ridiculous. It's not even like some had been pinched by previous guests, as these were the unstealable ones where the metal ring bit is on the pole (and can't be removed). It's not right that one of the first things we had to do is go out and buy coat-hangers. - you've been out all day, you get back at about 4:30 or 5pm, go for a shower, pad about the apartment wearing not-a-lot, and generally relax and unwind. You don't want a knock at the door and have housekeeping come in to make your bed and vacuum the carpet and mop the floor, all with you watching them. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had all day, why wait till after 5pm? This wasn't an isolated incident, it happened again and again and again. You'll notice that none of these things would cost a lot to fix. Which is the frustrating thing - these are first-class apartments and I enjoyed the time I spent in them. But there are just too many little niggling problems that, when looked at together, leave me with the impression that there's no real care or consideration for their guests.

The apartments are located near town hall station, just off George Street, which is direct from the airport and relatively easy to find, once you exit the station. Reception wery very nice indeed, friendly, jokey but at all times professional. I only had a studio apartment on the 24th floor. I had requested a quiet room and that is what i got. I could hear people from the lobby, but not at all once in my studio apartment. The apartment was very clean indeed, which is just what i like. It was bigger than a hotel room and had a kitchenette , microwave and i think even some kind of oven. All the utensils looked decent too. The bed was very comfortable and TV worked fine with many channels. The bbathroom was very clean, with a nice shower and lots of fluffy white towels. there is also a washing machine and dryer for those who may be travelling or staying longer. I did not wait long at all for a lift at any time and I was popping in and out quite a lot. Overall a very good experience and i would have stayed longer if i could have had the original rate. I decided to move to the Marriot opposite Hyde Park instead as I got a great deal including an upgrade and breakfast for less than what the Meriton Kent St wanted for any additional night.

Check-in was quick and fuss-free. I didn't understand what front-desk meant when the guy said I've got to open 2 doors to get to my apartment. I didn't think much of it....assuming it must be a private lift access type or something like that. But what it really was....the first door I opened led me to a 1.2m by 1.2m area - big enough for standing room only. I was then confronted by 2 different apartments A & B. Whereupon, you've got to use the key a second time to open the next door. That's fine....except when I was heaving luggage (for 2 full weeks) through 2 separate doors. Plus I was also paranoid that I could be ambushed by some nasty neighbours if they find out I'm living all alone by myself. The interior is very spacious and everything's spanking new. I must be no more than the 3rd person to use the cooking utensils and oven. So clean and shiny. Once I saw the kitchen, I couldn't resist but rush down to Coles (the big supermarket just diagonally across the street - at the basement of another Meriton apartment - Meriton World Tower). The supermarket tops what's already a very central location. The fresh produce and the range is fantastic at this particular Coles. There are also wine shops, internet cafes, restaurants and pharmacies in World Tower. Despite saying in the brochure they only do touch-ups for longer stays, i found my beds made everyday & towels replaced everyday. I have a double-bed and the living room has a foldable sofa-bed so i'm already entertaining thots of brining my family the next time I'm there. Food's aplenty - as it is near Chinatown - so food's available till late in the evenings. Fastfood, Chinese, Italian, Japanese, korean etc. And the famous Tetsuya's is apparently just across a little street (if you have money to spare). In the same building, there's a vietnamese place, a chinese eatery and a Japanese fastfood. But it's never nec to eat in the building 'cos you are surrounded by eating options. Possibly 'cos it's so central & high human traffic, it's a little noisy at night. Friday and Saturdays - sounds of smashing bottles and drunkards yelling. Other nights - I've heard ambulance/fire engine sirens at least on 2 consecutive nights. Transport - I take the train most of the time. So it's a 10 minute stroll to Town Hall station (the leisurely type of stroll). On the weekend, I even walked 30 mins to Circular Quay and the Rocks. Darling Harbour is about 15 mins away. The streets in Sydney are really very easy to navigate 'cos George Street, Pitt Street, Kent Street etc all run either parallel or perpendicular. Oh, to get to the fish market (more cooking!), take a monorail from one end of Chinatown outside Paddy's market. And ofcourse Paddy's market itself is full of fresh produce over the weekend. Wait for lifts can be more than 3 minutes long as there's always 2 out of 5 lifts not working. Very multinational clientele there - Australians, Americans, Asians etc. Gym and pool are basic but that's ok with me - nicer gyms usually not-so-nice price.", "Date": "October 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cExcellent I would stay here again\u201d", "Author": "aus_isis", "ReviewID": "UR10360455", "Content": "I was in Sydney for 5 days with work.
