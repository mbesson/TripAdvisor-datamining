Swissotel has a good reputation, so we were basically dissapointed in regards to service and maintenance of the hotel. When we arrived from Europe we did not have to wait long in line, but the receptionist took quite some time to handle our reservation (it is not rocket science especially when all information have been forwarded beforehand). The area at the reception is dark and depression, while the Cafe around the corner is a little bit more cosy. Our room was on the 4 floor looking out on the Swimming pool, which also looked that it had better days. The beds was comfy, but the rest of the room looked a little bit run down. The AC, which worked, was however quite noisy and still made the room slightly damp, so we could not dry our bathwear in the room. The worst was however the service door, which was placed adjacent to our room, disturbed our sleep several times as Service personal went in and out of the door during the night. I used the fitness equipment 2 times, but every time you used the Threadmill more than 20 minutes there was an mal-function. The charges for Internet and Laundry is as always on 4 star hotel a rip-off. The only real good thing about the hotel is the location at Clarke Quay - but i might find the same qualities at the Novotel on the other side of Clarke Quay for the same price.

My room was rather small and tired, the bathroom was average and needed updating, the TV was spectacularly ancient, rather a unique experience for a hotel in Asia so basically, to sum it up, the rooms need a total renovation. Breakfast was good, no complaints there and I didn't eat dinner in the hotel so can't comment on that. This was because the hotel itself is in a great location with a multitude of restaurants and bars to choose from all within 200m of the front door so really there's no need to stay in the hotel in the evenings.

We booked the family special through the hotel and got a good rate for two connecting rooms with the added bonus of children's amenities like a wii, toys, and a welcome gift. There were definitely many good points to the hotel, but many negatives as well. First, the positives: Rooms were a very good size. The second room had two beds that were much larger than a regular twin, so the kids had plenty of space. Staff were very attentive, especially to the kids which we really appreciated. Pool area is very nice, has a small children's pool and a waterslide, plus the view out from the pool is Clarke quay, so nice to sit and relax. Location is superb. Really easy to get around, lots of good places to walk to for meals. The negative points really changed my opinion of the hotel. It is so loud. There was no soundproofing on the window in our room. It sounded like we were sleeping on the street. The last night we were there was a Saturday and there must have been a wedding or something going on in the hotel, we could hear the thumping of the music until late into the night. The doors are also quite loud so if we tried to leave the room early in the morning to get a coffee, all the kids woke up. To me, noise like this in an expensive hotel room is a deal breaker. Rooms are a bit shabby. For as nice as the hotel is, the rooms definitely show quite a bit of wear and tear. TV was old and had very few channels. Buffet breakfast was just ok. Not a great selection and the omelet station was very slow and inefficient.

When recently looking in advance for a night stopover hotel following a cruise, we decided to give it a try, especially as Asiarooms had a deal on at the time. We were not disappointed! The hotel is conveniently placed almost next door to the Clarke Quay MRT system stop (found in the Central building basement) and is also within easy walking distance to Chinatown, or similarly no more than 15 minutes walk from the City Hall shopping Malls either. We liked the hotel. More 4 star than 5 star perhaps, but that was reflected in the price we paid. We were allocated room 423 on the 4th floor. No view to speak off, but it had the advantage of being quiet. The room itself was clean, tidy and well maintained. No dud lightbulbs, no gaping curtains, no worn out carpet. The room decor was of a slightly older era, more gilts and soft mixed fabric patterns, rather than the currently trendy and contemporary all white, solid colours and dark furniture look that is, in my view, now becoming anonymous, repetitive and found almost everywhere. The room door opened into small looby area, with bathroom to the right the main room had a large double bed, TV cabinet with storage drawers beneath. The TV was an old style CRT set. (Surely something of an oversight in Hi-tech Singapore?) The bathroom was immaculately clean, bright and shiny with good pressure from the shower and taps, and a non-anxiety 'first flush' everytime WC! Complimentary 'Purovel' toiletries (a brand name that I hadnt encountered before!) were provided. It there was a criticism of this particular bathroom, it would be that the grouting between bathroom tiles had not been smoothed or finished off properly. It looked as if it was a bit of a rushed job. Reception staff attitude was warm, friendly and efficient. We were able to check-in quite early in the day without undue fuss, and apart from a small glitch at check-out, when I had requested to settle the bill with a Debit Card, rather than use the credit card with which we had secured the Asia rooms reservation, the were no problems at all. Hotel Reception/ Cashier agent 'Jessy' quickly resolved this issue in a calm & pleasant manner. We booked a 'room only' package as we are not normally breakfast people beyond a coffee. Thus we did not eat or drink in the hotel either, as there are many food outlets in all the shopping malls. Come the evening, the many bars and restaurants that abound in Clarke Quay offer an eclectic mix, covering all cuisines and cultures East to West; everything from Hoisin Sauce to Hooters Wings. The hotel has a swimming pool deck, but in truth we didnt use it. We liked this quiet hotel a lot. We felt like home, rather than a theme park.

However sadly I was suitably unimpressed. I booked a kids deal which is two rooms with an interconnecting door for 5 nights. I paid a lot of money to stay here and should not have had any of the following problems. The story goes like this. Check in was smooth and we proceeded to our rooms. No sooner had we arrived at our rooms our doorbell went. A friendly woman walked in to welcome us to the hotel and provided the kids with a soft toy each. We also were provided with fresh fruit and chocolates. We instantly felt really welcome. So, why do you ask were we bitterly disappointed! Well, whether we had old rooms or not, the air conditioning didn't work and in Singapore you don't want the air conditioning not working (we must say that this did get rectified). Our mini bar did not work and was not fixed prior to us leaving. With the double bed there was only one bed side table so too bad if you were both relaxing on the bed drinking a coffee, you had no where to put it, nor your book if you read at night etc. We had ants in the room and they never seemed to be attended too. There was no where to put your suitcase without having to step over it to get anywhere. This isn't to say that the room was small, just nowhere to put it \u2013 more of a poor design. The kids room was organised with a Wii which was fantastic. However if you wanted to watch the TV after you finished with the Wii, you had to call the technicians to come and change the plugs around as the TV was so old you were unable to switch to either format. No, we were unable to change the plugs around ourselves as you had to take the top of the unit, in which the TV sat in, off \u2013 tools we did not have. Also, and really only a small aesthetic problem, however with all the other problems and this being a four star hotel, the bathroom was appalling. I\u2019m sure a blind man put the grout in.

I booked 2 months ahead and requested for a high floor room as it was our anniversary trip but we got corner room on 2nd floor that was stinking really bad. The room was so worn out we even joked saying this must be a house keepers room. We called the front desk and complained, and the guy on the phone said he would call us back in 10min which did not happen. We were just standing in the room when we saw a cockroach crawling into the wardrobe. At that moment I didn't care if they had another room or not I just had to get out. Went back to the front desk (about 25min after the initial complaint call) and we were finally checked into another room on 4th floor. To my surprise the room was a LOT better than the first one. After unpacking, we were heading out for dinner that was long due and we noticed a door knob on the floor. Yes, it was neatly placed on the floor. We went back to the lobby and told them the door knob was on the floor so we had trouble opening the door from the inside, and was told someone will fix it till we get back. Overall our stay at swissotel merchant court was very frustrating and there is no way I'd stay here ever again. The only good thing about this hotel is its location. I'd rather go somewhere else next time that is worth my hard earned money. if they give u a corner room on the second floor don't even bother checking it out first, its a long walk from the lift and it literally looks like a trashy motel room.

First impressions are good, with an immaculate appearance from the outside and from the inside foyer area. All very large and spacious, with the foyer containing a large reception counter, a concierge station, sitting areas and a lounge bar. Outside they have their own driveway and offloading point and there are usually taxis waiting out on the road. (NB: The hotel is opposite a shopping centre and walking distance to others, the riverfront and many eating places and bars.) Unfortunately, I arrived about 1:30am and was not met nor helped with my luggage from the taxi to reception. My initial thoughts were, \u201cthe place may look nice, but the service is lacking from the start\u201d. This was a disappointing start, as I was really tired and exhausted from travelling and could\u2019ve done with assistance with my bags. This was the only service fault experienced throughout my stay. Check in was procedural and took only a few minutes, and then I was escorted to my room by the porter via one of the large elevators. My room was one of the mid-range styles on the 9th floor, well presented, modern looking and very clean, but not very big. The room consisted of an entrance way which contained the tea & coffee station (inclusive of a coffee machine), minibar, drinks, snacks and glasses etc. all kept on a cabinet, followed by the bedroom area with an ensuite off to the side. The bedroom had a comfortable, king size bed (though the pillows were atrocious \u2013 lucky enough they have a pillow menu....which the choices are free [one of the few additional services that are]), two bedside tables with a central control console for the electrics, two wall mounted lamps (which also have the flexible reading lights), a large, wall mounted, flat screen TV, a small desk, and an office style chair. The desk had an internet connection, which costs extra to use (another element of profiteering by international hotels), a desk lamp and a telephone. The ensuite was very clean and functional, but relatively small. It had a western style toilet, a vanity area with a sink, mirror, hair dryer, complimentary items and a wall mounted, moveable vanity/make up mirror, and a shower in bath with a towel rack at the end. I didn\u2019t use any of the restaurants or other hotel\u2019s facilities, besides a couple of room service dinners. The choices are limited, and late evening dining is restrictive even further. The costs are fairly high, the wait time is minimal and the quality is pretty good, but there are much better options overall, outside along the river. Overall, this hotel is very nice, but it is expensive and definitely not a bargain (if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after or chasing). I would look at trying another hotel if I visit Singapore again, but if I had to return to this one I wouldn\u2019t be disappointed.

The room I stayed in which was just a standard room consisted of a hall entrance large bathroom with bath, desk area, large bed and a balcony. A TV and safe are also in the room.

I used the spa on the final day which was clean and offered a range of services gym treatments steam room and sauna.

Visit to sands casino ..what a place ....more than 500 gaming tables and in excess of 1700 slot macnines ..where we had a win Over all enjoyed our brief stop over ..although found Singapore expensive ..but after Penang ...guess most places would be dearer", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City, Utah", "Title": "\u201cNice property, great location\u201d", "Author": "DaveF42", "ReviewID": "UR123650333", "Content": "The location in Clarke Quay is great for evening activities, restaurant choices and a run along the river or up through the park around the reservour.

Though a bit run down the hotel is well kept with all basic amenities. The size of the rooms are about 30 SQ M, with a pillow menu, iron box and ironing board, an old but well maintained bathtub and Interactive TV syste. Wi-Fi was functional and easy to access without too many procedures to get internet. I tried watching a pay movie, the charge got posted to my room but the movie did not come up on screen. I contacted the telephone butler and was told that if any other guest is watching the same movie, I will not be able to, which sounded a bit strange. There are 400 + rooms in the hotel and about 20+ pay movies. Later I tried about three more movies, the screen remained blank. I had no choice but to complain and got the reply that the movie system is not working and someone will look into this the next day morning. I had no choice but to go to bed.

On the way back to the airport we got a taxi from the hotel which was only about $S22. Location The hotel is located on Clarke Quay which is an area by the river with lots of bars and restaurants. The nearest MRT (underground) station was \u201cClarke Quay\u201d just over the road in a shopping mall downstairs. This had great links to the city, it was cheap and the ticket machines were easy to use. When you get a single ticket don\u2019t forget to put it back in the ticket machine and get a refund of a $S1 after your journey. Hotel The hotel was spotlessly clean and always smelt nice. Downstairs there was a bar, restaurant and shops. There was a concierge desk which would help out with questions, directions, bookings, etc. There was a taxi stand outside, always got a taxi immediately. Room (378) Fairly small room but the bed and linen was extremely comfortable. The view was of the road but it was never noisy. Mini bar, safe, TV, Hairdryer, iron and board, toiletries, Tea & Coffee. Same plug socket as the UK. Food / Drink We didn\u2019t dine at the restaurant during our stay but the buffet was usually very busy. The bar looked comfortable but expensive. Staff The staff were polite and there was always someone available to help.

As we were staying over Christmas, the hotel put on a few really nice and personal touches to make our stay a little more memorable. In the lobby was a gingerbread house made out of real ginger bricks! Well, ginger slabs were glued on to the side of the house, but it was a nice touch. On Christmas Eve, the hotel had a wonderful buffet at their Blue Potato restaurant, with some of the best seafood we'd ever eaten - barbecued in front of us.

I had dinner at each location and walked home each night - saves the hassle of finding a taxi late at night. I enjoyed staying near the \"night life\" on this visit (rather than Orchard Road) - just so I can get home easily (albeit the taxi fare between the 2 is less than SGD10). All in all, I still prefer the Marriott on Orchard Road - more modern and sophisticated. The gym and pool at Marriott are fantastic. Swissotel Pluses Nespresso machine in your room - great coffee in your own room. Awesome. Satin clothes hangers for delicate dresses. Good idea. I used them. I could open the windows. Love that at night and morning. Good range of bathroom products Lovely drinks and canapes on executive floor from 6pm to 8pm with great view over Singapore from level 11.

Could do better here. Yes, I would stay again as the location is GREAT but not for SGD285 + tax - it was overpriced for what it was albeit I was there in a busy period for Singapore.

The hotel is perfectly located in Clark Quay. Very accessible location going to the mall and MRT Station. By night, don't worry if you get drunk while partying in Clark Quay coz its just a 5-minute walk from the night life center. Also, you can walk from the hotel to Fullerton up to Merlion in 30minutes then go back to the hotel without taking a cab. The hotel service was awesome, the swimming pool is nice, though they should change it to a more modern pool.

I've found an iPhone 4 at my seat and called out for the staff so i can return it to in case the owner came back to get it. When i gave the item and explained to him what happened, he didn't say anything and just took the phone away. I'm not asking for a thank you or so forth but at least reassure me that the item is going to be return back if the owner came back for it. Thankfully, the owner came back when I was still around so I told him that I've passed the item to the lounge staff and he managed to retrieve it. The room was alright, needs a little refurbishment but it was clean, spacey and the view was great. We got the room with a balcony facing Clarke Quay, so it was very lively. Do take note that Clarke Quay is a place for clubbers and usually they will gather at the bridge leading to the clubs. So you can expect massive noise until wee hours in the morning! If you're a light sleeper, request for a room away from the quay. Also, the door latch to the balcony is not high enough and if you're staying over with kids, it could be a little dangerous. Nice touches during our stay... we requested for a dvd player and we got it. Also requested for a late check-out and they let us stay till 2pm. The hotel also delivered a complimentary fruits platter and chocolates to our room. Most staffs we met along the corridors and around the hotel were friendly and greeted us whenever we bumped.

After booking a trip to the Far East with Trailfinders, we were slightly apprehensive after seeing some of the comments on tripadvisor. After arriving we thought the comments were against the wrong hotel. Unfortunately we started to see where some of the previous comments wer coming from. At breakfast it was feast or famine! Lots of stuff or very little. One day you had a member of staff trying to top your coffee up every two minutes whilst the next you had to demand a cup of coffee. The ready made omlette I had was the worst ever and ensured that i never tried that option again on following mornings. Our towels appeard to get thinner by the day. On our final day (1st October) the towels were very thin - someone else posted this comment previously. We were hoping for a long lie on our final day as our flight was not till 1am on the following morning. Unfortunately we were awoken at 7.30 with loud music being tested for a wedding that was taking place that morning. It would have been nice to have been given advance notice of this. I tried to extend the room from the normal noon check out. At first I was told that we could keep it till 2pm for no charge. Up until 6pm was 100$$ and then it would be the full room rate. When I returned 5 minutes later ( to go for the 6pm option) I was told that we could only keep it till 1pm as the hotel was now going to be very busy. This basically summed up the hotel for me, initial impression is good when you arrive but thereafter it is a downward spiral. When we checked out I was given an unexpected shock. Despite being told by Trailfinders that breakfasts were included at all my hotels on out tour, I was charged for breakfast! When we checked in I was told by the front desk that everything was prepaid and then told that you get your breakfast over there - no mention of additional cost.At \u00a325 each per day it was a big additional bill - when I queried it I was told that breakfast was not included. After I fight I managed to get them to only charge for 3 days. They never actually backed down because we did not go for breakfast on our final day and still wanted to charge me unless I signed some paper to say that we did not have breakfast and if this was incorrect I would be liable for the cost. Had we known that breakfast was not included we would not have bothered getting up for it as it was pretty poor and I'm sure that subway or something else at the central mrket (opposite the hotel) would have served up something of a higher quality at a fraction of the price. There is no free internet access or wifi in the hotel. At 10$$ an hour it is very expensive. When the local buses in my own city offer free wifi I fail to see why a hotel charges so much! Considering that many guests must have onward flights in the early hours we were extremely disappointed with the facilities once you have checked out. You cannot even sit by the pool as anything above lobby level requires as room key to access the lift to access these areas. The only sitting areas available are a bar where the staff keep askign you to buy a drink or another area that was taken over by the wedding guests on our departure date! I would question if this hotel is 4*. In my view it is a tired 3*. This was the poorest overall hotel we stayed in during our tour. I went to our local Trailfinders Office yesterday to register my disappoint with this hotel. It was not my first pick but I was talked into going there by the trailfinders rep. The positve - the hotel is well located. Personally when I go back to Singapore I will be looking for an alternative hotel. In all our years of travelling in the Far East, this was our worst hotel experience.

But... the experience with their services got me so upset that I woke up at 0430am feeling totally angry and disturbed; I had to write to this feedback email. I have initially decided to overlook the minor service lags encountered, but due to the experience the night before, I decided to list down every single detail of my observation. The Ultimatum On the 29 Sep, at approximately 1050pm, we dialed the In-room dining ext to check if the \"Nasi Goreng\" in the menu is still available. The reply was \"Let me check with the chef and get back to you\". At approximately 11.15pm, since there was no return call, so we dialed in to check again, the response was \"Oh yes, the order is on the way\". When the food arrives, the served items does not coincide with what is indicated in the menu (without otah, curry vege and chicken wings), so we called to check. Before I could finish my sentence, Linda on the other line, interrupted me and spoke in a extremely harsh tone \"Mdm! When you called, the item is already not available so this is the best our chef can do for you at this time!\" After being told off, I finally get to asked why were we not informed? And in the first place, we called in to check availability but no one got back to us until we made the 2nd call. Taken aback, Linda rudely says \" Wait!...\" turning to her colleagues in the background.. \"Eh.. You all never inform...\" A good 3min later, with a changed tone, she admitted the mistake, claiming that she just took over shift and was not aware that we were not informed of the changes.. and asked \"so you do not want the Nasi Goreng is it?\" The reason I attempted to make an order is obviously because I was hungry! And to take back the food to solve the problem??!!! What kind of response is that?!!! I have to tell her the obvious and that I wanted to lodge this encounter with somebody. Only upon this, that she reverted and says that she will check with the kitchen staff and sees what they can offer. Ok, the kitchen staff responded in an apologetic manner and offer to waive off the charges for the meal. But I have been scolded and accused of being unreasonable, treated in harsh manner, just because a staff took over shift without getting her facts right plus the negligence down the line of service chains?!! No amount of apologies nor food shuffed down my throat can make me swallow the displeasures! It's like you punched someone in the face and says sorry got the wrong person??!!! The Front Desk could not \"hear\" us! My friend checked in on my behalf and was informed that I need to approach the counter to sign some documents when I arrived. I was not feeling well, when I reached the front desk and my friend tried to inform the staff that we are here to complete the check in, again, before she could finish her sentence, the staff says \"oh.. let me go get it\" and come back with something else.. I had to stand in my mildly sedated state for quite a while to wait for the staff to grasp the situation and get the procedures done! We were told to approach the frontdesk for complimentary parking tickets whenever we need to drive out of the hotel; the following day, for the complimentary parking tickets, we had to repeat each of our names 3 times but still not heard!! Only when the staff finally gets into the system, to read the same names we repeated so many times. She was simply not listening to us, just going through motion when asked us to give our names! What's wrong with the staff??? \"Going through motion\" or Stereo-typing? From observation, it seems like a service policy for staffs in Merchant Court to greet guests when sees them. So, I received a \"Good Evening\", from a figure who glance at me and turned the other direction in the midst of the greeting, who to \"flank\" but only to meet me at the lift lobby again, pretended that I was invisible looking at all other directions. I think a kid has better manners. When we returned to our room after breakfast, seeing that the house-keeping is at work, we decided to wait at the lobby rest area. There were foreign guests at the same area, a service personnel in suit came forward to greet the other foreign guests. He glanced at us from the corner of his eyes and made a 360degree turn and walked off. Do you have to be so obvious?! That we are not priviledge guests??!!! Incomplete amenities I have heard and experienced from my overseas work-trips that some hotel staffs deliberately provide incomplete set of amenities so that there would be opportunities for tips when guests made requests. I did not expect this to happen in Singapore. We did not have complete tolilet amenities nor receive the daily papers until we call.. I hope this is an coincidence.

Bathroom outdated,dirty,with ants!,tiles from the 50's!,awful shower and sticky floor in bath!...not even cleaned properly. The towels are limited and the thinnest I've ever come across! Service was terrible all round: reception staff are rude & disinterested;at breakfast you might as well be invisible...the waiters are totally unattentive...had to ask 3 different waiters for a cup of tea...then it came without milk! Food at buffet was awful: fruit was stale,limited pastry & cereal choices,my husband found hair in fruit! Room service was none the better...waited 1 1/2 hours for a meal that then came incomplete! Although we got upgraded from a classic to an advantage room ( which is much better,but bathroom still really dated), the overall poor attitude of disinterested staff did not improve our experience. Will never stay here again! I think the high rating may be attributed largely to its location on Clarke Quay,but there are so many other hotels to choose from.", "Date": "September 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cFront Desk Nightmare\u201d", "Author": "Concerned117", "ReviewID": "UR118395129", "Content": "This hotel is in a great location but the service at the front desk was extremely poor.

After speaking with reception staff, on two occasions before we got an answer (despite being told a message would be sent to our room after the first request), as to what was going on. It was clearly not something that was being undertaken as emergency works and notice could have been given to guests in affected rooms/floors.

The Clarke Quay MRT station is also just across the road, and is only one stop from the Dhoby Ghaut MRT interchange (with 3 lines converging) and the Chinatown MRT station is only one stop away in the other direction (or an easy 10-15 minute walk for those willing to brave the tropical humidity). As we were in Singapore for only a couple of days, the central location of the Swissotel Merchant Court allowed us to maximise our time at sights, instead of spending it getting there. While the room rates were higher than we would have preferred to pay, we balanced this by not eating at the hotel (except for the time I succumbed to a late night supper and indulged in room service). The Clarke Quay MRT station is located under a small shopping centre, where you\u2019ll find a cheap foodcourt with hawker-style outlets upstairs (about level 4 or 5), some restaurants (maybe level 3), local and international fast-food chains and cafes at entry level, and a few food outlets and a small supermarket in the basement. The room we were in was quite spacious for two people. There was a foyer area where a bar fridge and tea-making facilities were located, a sizeable bathroom, desk and chair. The bed was large and comfortable, and we were able to order special pillows from a pillow menu. I was hoping to try out the buckwheat-hull option, but there\u2019d been a run on these, so I went for the neck-support one instead, which was terrific. We had the option of purchasing any of the pillows on the menu from the hotel, and we\u2019ve since regretted not doing it when we left! I had hoped to use the hotel pool, but we were so busy taking in the sights and indulging in retail therapy that we didn\u2019t have the time.

It is clearly set up for buffet, which if you get it in your room price looks great. If you prefer a cheaper room price, don't worry - there are plenty of alternatives to eat breakfast.

From the time we arrived to the time we left we could not say 1 bad thing about the place! Location is excellent! This was one of the main reasons we decided to stay here because the MRT (train) is literally less than a minute walk away. We used the train on a daily basis to do our touristy bits. The staff here we're friendly, kind, helpful but above all you could genuinely tell that they wanted us to enjoy our stay which we did. Room was decent. We had a classic room with a balcony. The bed's were super comfortable and felt like you were sleeping on a cloud. What I loved was the air con was at the perfect temperature. Sleeping at night was a breeze because the air con never made noises nor did we have to get up to adjust the setting. The only minor critique I would have is the tv's were very small. And don't get a smoking room unless you want to smell the stench as soon as you step out of the lift. Food and drink was expensive. We made sure to drink our duty free in our room instead of $20 for 1 cocktail eek and $15 for a beer. So we never drunk at the hotel but did decide to indulge in breakfast one morning. 2 standard breakfasts consisting of eggs and bacon cost us $45. We asked for 2 more slices of toast but decided against it when they told us that would cost $12...! Overall a lovely hotel to stay at.

At 9pm, we returned to see muddy foot prints on our toilet floor and the shower still didn't work! So we had to go back to Reception and asked if they could please fix it. Then we went out walking in Clarke Quay again. We returned at 10pm and went to Reception first and enquired about our shower... and we were informed that it was fixed. When we went back to our room, the shower worked! It had been a long long day and we were so thankful the shower was fixed! What we liked: - Location: right at Clarke Quay, near the MRT, and the Singapore Food Festival was right at our doorstep! We ate so much food and everything was so delicious! - Comfortable: the beds were really comfortable and there were 4 big, fluffy pillows! - Nice swimming pool and nice jacuzzi - Nice gym - Nice buffet breakfast - delicious bacon with mix of western and asian food - Friendly staff - efficient too... after all, they did fix the faulty shower by 10pm! - Room with no view - turned out to be a blessing in disguise because with the Singapore Food Festival nearby, having a room facing the river would not be a good idea as the music was really loud! What we didn't like: - Our room was near the lift lobby. On one rainy afternoon, we were in our room and heard 2 kids who were really noisy, shouting and playing a game of 'knocking down suitcases' at the lift lobby!

The booking was through Expedia and was non-refundable, we were expecting to lose our money but thanks to the kind staff at the Swissotel they were more than happy to reschedule our trip at no extra costs. We were in a business advantage room. Whilst the living area and bed were great I have to admit with some of the other reviewers that the bathroom area needs renovating.

Gets all day sun and is a nice way to wind down after a busy day. The Blue Potato bar and bistro is great. The food and drink are reasonably priced. We had breakfast there twice and found the food to be excellent. We used the gym daily. There is a good selection of cardio machines and weights. There is also a steam room and sauna in the changing area. One of the best things we found about the Swissotel was the laundry facilities on the 2nd floor. It costs $8 for a wash and a further $8 for the dryer. You'll appreciate this service when you see the price Hotels charge for laundry. There are laundrettes nearby but do not offer same day services. The MRT is located opposite in The Central Shopping Center. There are plenty of places to eat either in the basement at the shopping center or at Clarke Key, or alternatively if you're wanting a more down to earth and unpretentious eating experience, the Lau Pa Sat, Maxwell Street and Smith Street hawker centers are all near by and are easily within walking distance.

They were filthy, they smelled, the linens were stained, the walls were stained, and there were wires hanging from the wall where some device used to be. So I did something that I have never done, which is to call the manager and complain. The manager and an assistant came in a flash, and could not have been nicer. They looked at the room, and after confirming the filth, they apologized profusely and immediately moved my family to 2 adjoining rooms on the executive level at no additional cost. Due to this exceptional customer service, I really wanted to love everything about the hotel. But there are negative issues that make this hotel simply average for Singapore, which has so many amazing hotel choices. But to begin positively, the decor, furnishings - everything - about the executive floor and rooms are VASTLY superior to floor 2. It was like a completely different hotel. But the rooms a very small (even for Asia). One of the 2 rooms had wood floors, and the beds had rollers on them, so they would move by sitting on them, and would even move during sleep (like a roll-away bed). The mattress was thin and not even close to a typical Marriott or Weston mattress. While it is obvious that the floor (the 12th floor) was recently remodeled and looked fine, it was remodeled cheaply. When we were there, the room number sign outside the room actually fell off of the wall. The sink did not drain well. The hotel is also going through construction. From the pool area, the facade of the hotel is covered in scaffolding and tarps. While this may be to remodel rooms such as our original room and I certainly have no fault with their need to renovate (long overdue...), travelers should simply beware that this construction is occurring. But turning again to the positives, the location is fantastic, the front desk and concierge were great, and again, the manager's assistance in remedying the room situation was magnificent.

When we checked in we were asked if we wanted a smoking room and we said no. After filling in five hours, we were given our room. It was a smoking room. It was clean, but smelled of stale smoke. We went back down and asked for a non-smoking room as we had requested twice. We were told that the only non-smoking room had twin beds, not a king. If we wanted a non-smoking room with a king bed (as we had booked) we would need to pay to upgrade. They tried to give us a package that would cost an extra $100 a night (we were staying a week). In the end we could upgrade for an extra $40 a night. This was an added expense we were not expecting. We were given a \"deluxe\" room which was comfortable, but the bathroom had many cracked tiles and rust coming from a handrail. After I wrote to the general manager and complained, he waived the extra fee, but it had all been a real let down.

It is within 5 minutes walking distance to Clarke Quay the center of Singapore's nightlife where throngs of both locals and expats alike gather over the weekends to dine or party the night away. Somehow staying in Swissotel Merchant Court makes me feel like I am away from the hustle of Singapore city life, a great place to stay overnight even as a Singaporean. The hotel room is styled in old Straits Chinese with British influence. Though the hotel has been around for a while and looks a little worn out around the edges, it is clean and excellently maintained. The hotel has a huge free form swimming pool with a cascading waterfall where you can enjoy a little massage on your shoulders standing under it. It also has a fairly large gym that is split into 3 levels, which I didn't explore until my last day. Indeed it is a great place to relax and is located just next to Clarke Quay MRT station which you can use to connect to the most of Singapore. The Swissotel Merchant Court is also located near a Japanese mall called Liang Court, where many Japanese expats like to dine and pick up their weekly groceries. If you are into cream puff pastries, be sure to check out Tampopo Deli. I had two minor hiccups while staying in the hotel and the GM was very responsive to address. Firstly, the housekeeping kept coming to my room to check, which I didn't really understand why. I suppose most people would be out in the afternoon but I was staying in to rest that day so that became fairly annoying after it happened more than twice. Secondly, the keycard was not sensitive and I each time I spent minutes trying to access my room.

I asked to have some simple linens and slept like a baby without air conditioning. The heavy curtains would not close completely leaving a gap; in the morning I woke up earlier than planned as the light was leaking just to my face. The following night I resorted to a little trick to close the gap. The bathroom was rather small, but fine. As this was a corner room, the layout offered a toilet facing a wall. Odd, but nothing important. Internet connection was pretty responsive allowing me to make phone calls with voice-over-ip service. There is a nice swimming pool... bring your swimsuit. Breakfast was fine. Choice was good, and satisfied my vegetarian preferences and my sweet tooth. Many girls were tending the tables and brought me coffee as frequently as I needed. The music was a bit too present, not loud but it was impossible to exclude it from the senses. The hotel is very conveniently located close to the subway.

Executive floors way to go.\u201d", "Author": "bdm82", "ReviewID": "UR87728849", "Content": "I have stayed at the Swissotel twice, 3 weeks each time. The first was about three years ago, the most recent being now. ROOM TYPES: There are two main types of rooms at the hotel; I've stayed in the \"Executive Club\" rooms each time. These rooms make up the top 3 of the 12 floors, and are the nicer rooms with more space and amenities. Executive Club rooms feature a mini bar/fridge, have bathrooms with separate shower and tub, receive a free daily newspaper, get free breakfast in the Executive Club Lounge on the 11th floor or the Market Cafe on the 1st, and get free snacks and drinks (including alcohol beverages) from 6 to 8 each night during \"happy hour\". Executive club rooms also get free internet (wired and wireless). You can also request a printer or DVD player for free (on availability). The Executive Club rooms are more expensive, but considering breakfast and 24hrs of internet are about $30/each separately if you were to stay at a non-executive club floor, it's not a bad deal. ...This review only really applies to the executive club level rooms. FACILITIES: The hotel looks very nice from the outside, and the lower level bar, restaurant, and foyer areas are also very nice with marble everywhere. The hallways and rooms have outdated carpet that looks a little dated, and there are some signs of wear other places like the elevators. The bedding is nice, there is an iHome iPod radio/alarm, and there is a bedside control panel for controlling the lights and room A/C. A modern glass-top desk with and multiple electrical outlets (that accept UK, US, or EU style plugs) is nice for working. The rooms also have a safe, iron and ironing board, wide closet, espresso/coffee maker, and complimentary bottled water. The pool is very nicely done with a tropical feeling; there is a lot of greenery and a large waterfall into the pool. The pool is never busy, and at times they will have certain events in the pool area where there is a restaurant...it's a little awkward to go for a swim knowing you'll be in the background of someone's wedding pictures. There is also a small spa (too expensive to bother with) and a small self-serve laundry room ($8/wash, $8/dry--expensive, but cheaper than sending laundry out). A large fitness center is available and never busy, as is a business center. All in all, I would say that the hotel would have been amazing 5-10 years ago, but is starting to show some age...but is still quite nice. DINING: There is a cafe (Ellenborough Market Cafe) that might as well call itself a restaurant, a bar (Crossroads), and a restaurant (Blue Potatoe). All of these are high priced -- S$8 for a Coke, for example. The service is also mixed...generally pretty good, but the cafe can get so busy that the wait staff can't keep up. The food is okay, but really, there's no reason to eat at the hotel (unless talking of the free breakfast or happy hour snacks). There are a great deal of other restaurants within walking distance (Jumbo Seafood, Hooters, Subway, Burger King, and various Korean, Mexican, Italian, Indian, American and Moroccan restaurants). SECURITY: Keycards are required for elevator operation and room entry. They are also required for entry in the pool and spa areas. You have to leave your keycard in a slot near the door (inside the room) to get the lights to operate, which I find a bit annoying -- but this is a very EU-like approach. LOCATION: Location has to be one of the best parts about this hotel. It is in the Clarke Quay area (read as \"Clark Key\" - I still don't understand why it's pronounced that way, perhaps a UK/US English difference). Clarke Quay has dozens of restaurants and places to spend some time, and it is walking distance to most things you'd want to see. Marina Bay (Sands, Merlion, Shopping Centre, Esplanade, Singapore Flyer) is a 15 minute walk along the river away, Central Mall and MRT stop is across the street, and Funan DigitalLife electronics mall is within a 10 minute walk. The MRT stop means you aren't far from just about anything but for reasonably close stops, I just prefer to walk -- it's such a nice area to be in. The MRT stop is for the NE line, which is one stop from a major junction with other lines and only about 3 stops from the Harbourfront (which connects to Sentosa beach/resort island). SERVICE: The front desk service is quick and professional, but not particularly friendly. The Concierge is helpful, but pretty concise as well--they'll tell you what you want to know and tell you what you need to know, but they won't make you feel special. The Executive Club Lounge is staffed during reasonable hours (say 6:30 am to 10pm; I don't remember the exact hours), and they can do all front-desk functions from there -- so you can check out and arrange other services without having to queue with other guests at the main desk downstairs. The service in the Club Lounge is also much better and much more friendly than elsewhere in the hotel. They learn your name, ask you how you are, notice if you aren't there one day, keep your drinks full, occasionally bring you a free fruit tray in your room, and generally just fill the service void that's there through the rest of the hotel. SUMMARY: Not a cheap hotel, but spring for the Executive Club level rooms if you can afford it. You get better service, nicer rooms, and less nickel-and-diming.

You have already wasted too much of it and too much of my cash BUT i must warn others of the Swissotel Merchant Court. I do not know what SWISSOTEL stands for but it may be appropriate for the Hotel to be called SWISS LEMON. We spent 3 nights at Swissotel Merchant Court. The first on the 24th was in room 570. The next 2 night we moved to Room 586. Another nightmare. Before i start the Hotel Management wherever they are based do not care about the Customer/Client experience. Your WINDOWS ARE NOT DOUBLE GLAZED. You may as well be on top or next to a Freeway or Disco. The noise is a nightmare. I read a review NOW from other Patrons 1 year ago about the Noise problem. You have done nothing. What has the Hotel done to improve the comfort of the Patron from external noise on the street from their windows? NOTHING. Because the Windows are thin. NOT Double glazed.Its Outrageous. I have looked at 20 websites at the price of this Hotel. It is anywhere from $250-$350 a night. That is a TON of money. The Hotel is skimping on doing this. Saving money Swissotel service out the window. Thanks we had 3 SLEEPLESS nights. The noise was HORRIFIC until 5-6am and then forced ourselves to get up. Shame on Swissotel. Our first night we arrived late and as soon as we turned the Water on under the sink the Water pipe was leaking BADLY. In know time the water made its way to our feet and accross the other side of the Bathroom. A HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUE. The Hotel staff at reception said it was the first they heard of it. Really? It was as if someone drilled a hole in the bottom of the pipe with a drill and all the water ended up on the floor. But wait there is more. A absolutely stupid Design issue. Water water everywhere again. The water pressure is not great anyway but in room 570 we showere at a trickle because the water would not flow down to the Tub and in to the sink. A lot of the water would flow around the top of the Bath Tub all the way around and flow on to the floor. So the floor was drenched and one big puddle. Also when you flushed the Water of the Toilet the Button of the flush itself which was on the wall squirted water out also. Crazy. The Hotel Slippers are really nice soaking wet. I rand the operator to speak to the Duty Mnager. The Duty Manager was not interested. I was told the DM would call back but the operator called back. You put our health and safety at risk. I explained the situation at reception because i had to go to the Lobby to tell them. The duty Manager was standing their and after i told the Hotel reception girl because duty Manager wasn't available for me i could see the Duty Manager with a long angry face shoo her off and get rid of me was the message. We changed the room the following day and used the Bathtub Water instead of using the sink because of the problem. The following day we moved to room 586. What a nightmare. The noise was Horrific. Actually the room was a smaller room also. THe Hotel reception told me a Bulldust story about the room having a better view. Are you serious. I was looking in to Buildings close by. You have NO EXCUSE SWISSOTEL not to have double glazed windows. The outside of the Hotel, that is whatever your facing from your room is extremely noisy. This is a very busy Hotel. I have never seen so much activity. The Hotel is making BIG BUCKS but a thin pane of glass separating your room from the street. I would not have given $10 for this room when you are POUNDED By noise and other problems. Also the Breakfast at the Hotels main Buffet breakfast room is SO SO BUSY. The Design is outrageous. But this is Swissotel. Actions speak louder than words. \"Bums on Seats\" \"Bums on Beds\" is really the swissotel logo. Quality 00000000000. The Food area of the restaurant is tightly packed and yes you have to wait in lines for many things because of the stupid designs. You can see everything is crammed together to get more Sheep, OOPS i mean Patrons in. The people working the tables are good at their job in the restaurant but i cannot blame them they cannot even crack a smile. After observing them working their backside off, with obviously not enough staff i don't blame them. The variety in the Restaurant Buffet is small and the similar for the 3 days. CONCIERGE. The night Concierge forget it. I asked politely about transport. The concierge had LOOOOOONG angry faces and they were trying to push some kind of private Car/Limousine. Commision Boys? Just the Boys working during the day, particular the young boy sorry i forget your name i remember him from checking in was very nice. On check in and check out. I wrote an appreciation card for him.

It is one of the hotels which are contracted by my employer. As my employer contracts 5 hotels in Singapore, this one is #3 out of my top 5.

The reception is efficient, but never overly friendly. The staff is trained to maintain short waitinglines, but not to make people feel welcome. The rooms itself are not to large. Some rooms actually make it difficult for you to with move around with 2 people and 2 suitcases.. for short trips that is OK, but I wouldnt want to stay in a room like this for a week. The bathrooms are all with a bath in which you can also shower. Personally I prefer to have just a shower, but for some people this will be a benefit.

Right on the river where there are many restaurants and bars but are quite pricey. Much cheaper to eat and drink at the hawker centres. If you don't mind walking its a gentle stroll to most places. The fitness centre in the hotel is open 24hrs, handy if you can't sleep and plenty of good quality exercise machines. Did not have enough time to use swimming pool but looked very nice and was never busy. Also on 2nd floor was self service launderette costing $8 per wash or dryer. If you plan to purchase the Singapore Tourist Pass costing $8 a day for unlimited travel on all buses and mrt this is only avaliable from certain stations at limited times,found the lady at Raffles Place MRT ticket office the most helpful. Anyone thinking of going on the Singapore Flyer costing $29.50,why not try the Skypark on top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel like we did costing $20,a lift takes you to the top of the hotel where you can just relax and take in the amazing view of the Singapore skyline from all angles. Remember the F1 pit lane is right near the Singapore Flyer so you can walk there taking a few minutes and its free.

The only problem we had was the noise from the adjacent street, traffic never stops in Singapore sometimes you could hear vehicles accelerating, motorbikes were the worst offenders, the heavy curtains helped to suppress some of the noise our room was on the 3rd floor. Did not use many of the amenities mainly the pool, the pool overlooks the river nice views more than you can say for some of the other hotel pools, one criticism I have; there was always a lack of pool-lounges, I doubt the hotel can fix this as there no more space to place more pool-lounges, it\u2019s a matter of first in first served.

To the local taxi drivers, do not tell them \"Swissotel Merchant Court\" as that would confuse them. Just tell them \"Merchant Court\" and they will know where to go. For the absolutely newbie taxt drivers (we encountered one), tell them to take you to the Clark Quay MRT station, the hotel essentially sits right on top of it! This is the third and last hotel we stayed at for our honeymoon. As such, I am writing this having experienced better and may sound a tad sour. Swissotel Merchant Court, if not for the grand looking reception area and nice swimming pool, might be mistaken for a Holiday Inn Express! It may be due to the fact this is a business hotel, where staid looking business people go about their daily business(es) wearing suits and ties. Or it could be the fact that everything is so dimly lit indoors. We certainly did feel a sense of claustrophobia in the tiny bathroom of our Business Advantage room. The toilet was angled to induce a sense of spaciousness to an otherwise cramped niche. The room itself was no frills. You feel like a middle manager sitting in a corner with the little glass work desk that was thoughtfully provided by the hotel staff for business people. There was a phone, a desk lamp, LAN cable and -a pencil case- stuffed with pencil, pen, ruler, rubber bands, eraser and paper clips. The decor is designed to induce productivity and energy with orange'ish earth tones. At the center of the night stand is a console with buttons that control every aspect of the room, from A/C to lights in the foyer, Swiss efficiency indeed! Of particular interest are the two mid wall mounted lamps flanking our double beds. Each one had a goose neck flashlight extending from the bottom of the lamp body, no doubt to provide the patron with an adjustable reading light for all the late night, last minute PowerPoint foils printed on bleached white A4 sized printer paper. Unfortunately, instead of a warm yellowish glow, the lights have bright and bluish LEDs designed to keep you from falling asleep as you savor every last fancy graphic on the slideshow printouts. The beds are nothing to write home about, standard hotel affairs with comforter, sheets and pillows. Room service does a commendable job making up the room daily, also providing free Straits Times in the nifty slot built into the ringer outside each room. Do not drink from the minibar, a tiny bottle of vodka costs triple of what you'd find from the nearest liquor store. The strength of the hotel is (not surprisingly), its location. The hotel as mentioned previously (and ad nauseum from other reviews) is conveniently located right on top of the Clark Quay MRT station. The Clark Quay MRT station is but one stop from the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station, which is a hub for other colored tube lines branching out into Singapore. Also right by the hotel is a Starbucks Coffee, a modern shopping center, Kopitiam food court, Cheers 24 hours convenience store and of course, Clark Quay along the Singapore River. All within an easy three minute walking distance from the taxi station in front of the hotel. Herein lies the hotel's greatest strength. Stay at Swissotel Merchant Court if you don't mind staying in a Holiday Inn Express that is located on primo real estate in Singapore. Mind you, the stay was comfortable but we never felt warm and cozy, even during the daily thunderstorms that would have cooped us into our room, staring out at the wonderfully refreshing rain drops splattering on the paned glass. The hotel is run efficiently but business like. Perfect for business people going about their daily duties in Singapore. Stay at Swissotel Merchant Court for the convenience.

They also gave us a late check out until 2pm. I booked a weekend special which included a king sized bed in a business advantage room with free internet and breakfast included. This cost 900 singapore dollars including taxes and service charge for 3 nights. The King sized bed was actually 2 single beds pushed together which was not comfortable at all and hard matresses, I didnt get a good nights sleep on any one of the nights and was dissapointed by this. The room itself is spacious enough with flat screen TV and business desk, there is a seperate drinks area with mini bar and tea making facilities. The bathroom is also nice and spacious and very bright. There is no mirror in the bedroom and no plug socket in the bathroom for my hair straightners so this was a pain, there was also no full length mirror. We didnt eat at the hotel but Clarke Quay is just outside with loads of places to eat and there is a burger king and subway opposite if thats what you fancy. Dont change money in the hotel, you get a much better rate from the money exchange in the shopping centre just opposite...also DONT use the hotel laundry!! My boyfriend gave in a few items and the bill came back as 140 singapore dollars. We could have bought new socks and T shirts for that price! We complained about this and it was also our fault for not checking the price first but we never imagined that it would cost so much. The manager gave us a 20% discount on the laundry bill which they didnt have to do so we accepted this. Overall, the hotel is very modern and has a nice setting. It is very safe and ideal location and we saved money by not having to take Taxis everywhere (the MRT station is just outside the hotel), but the bed could have been better and it is pricey, but Singapore is expensive in general.

To be brief - all my worries were in vain, Swissotel MC greeted me with its usual class of impeccable service, nice rooms and perfectly trained staff. I was totally happy with my stay (as always). To the details then... 1/ Stayed in Classic room. Two downsides in the beginning - rabbit ears prehistoric TV (workable though) and a bit dated bathroom (bathtub especially). The rest is absolutely nice. The comfiest beds for your jet-legged body, very quiet AC, tea-coffee making facilities, mini bar, working desk and sitting area. Room size appx. 28 sq.m. Carpet on the floor is dated too, but the result of proper work of housekeeping in definitely seen, as even dated carpet is properly shampooed and feels fresh under your feet. Room also equipped with iron+ironing board, safe box, Internet connection, sleepers, but no bathrobes?? All towels and linens are snowy-white and crispy clean. No stains or other pleasantries. My room was facing the pool, and I never had a problem with noise or loud sounds as the previous reviewers mentioned. The windows were dusty though.........Some facade cleaning will be handy. 2/ Location. Perfect... nothing to add. This is Clarke Quay, the place I always love to stay and recommend to anyone, especially first-timers. MRT - 10 m from the hotel main entrance. Taxis are waved by the doorman. 3/ Swimming pool. Very busy and popular during any time of day. One day I ventured to do my routine laps at 8 am and found out myself in the same busy environment. Guests just love MC pool. I do not blame them. LOL 4/ Breakfast. The best I had in Singapore. 100% European oriented, no Asian sections, but perfectly staffed with freshly squeezed juices ( celery and carrot!!!), pastry, smoked salmon, 7 kinds of cheese, jars of jelly and peanut butter....you name it ... they have it. I enjoyed every moment of my morning meal in the cozy ambiance of Market Cafe. Highly recommended. And their freshly brewed caffee - never tasted a better one! 5/ Staff. Perfectly trained, very polite, efficient and accommodating. Had no problem with check-in/ out. Was given a late check-out in a blink after I requested such. 6/ Internet. Very expensive. 16 SGD for 2 hours. Better have free WiFi in any cafe in Clarke Quay or Riverside Point. 7/ Conclusion : I would definitely stay in this hotel again ( and again, and again) as it never gave me a chance to doubt its level and standard of Swiss hospitality. With this choice of accommodation I always get much more than a room to sleep and place to stay, I get the awareness in the quality that is carefully maintained and thoughtfully delivered to the guests. 8/ I`d be glad to answer you question if you have any.

My concern also might be typical of other hotels in Singapore--I'll find out this evening when we move to a location closer to our business offices--that is everything inside is humid and smells slightly 'damp.' My room is okay. The furnishings are bland but mostly functional. The bed is hard and not very comfortable. The bedside table and the wall unit are fake-veneer pressboard, and slightly worn. There is a loud bit of mathinery (compressor?) in the ceiling of my bathroom, and the paint is flaked off some bathroom trim. I also found dirt and some packaging debris under the bed scarf--odd! My colleague's room smells strongly of mildew, and, the air conditioning vent shows definite signs of leaking water. He is also missing his 'accent chair.' His room also had lint, dust and dirt on the door frames, floor, and bathroom. This is a four star property?", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Western Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in great location.\u201d", "Author": "1947WesternAustralia", "ReviewID": "UR65157707", "Content": "We stayed for five nights, arriving after a night flight. We were able to get straight into our room, which was bliss after little sleep. Two adults and one child shared a room (one grade up from the Classic), which contained two double beds and sitting furniture, ample room for three people. The room and the bathroom were neat and clean. The beds were comfortable with good quality bedding and towels. The only complaints we would have about the room was it lacked a mirror, so if you needed one and someone was in the bathroom, you had to wait. Also although tea and coffee were provided, we had to ask twice that tea be replenished (it was instantly) and the cups were too small to be practical. The pool area was lovely (although don't have a coffee at the cafe there; you need a mortgage to pay for it) although being outside it was often closed late afternoon due to storms. This was usually the time you would want to swim. We thought the lobby and communal areas were quite classy, and all staff we met were efficient and friendly. We loved the breakfast. The food was plentiful and varied and you could sit and watch activity along the river. The hotel is well located, right next to Clark Quay and it's extensive range of eating venues. The MRT was situated under the shopping centre opposite, so it was easy to get around. Taxis were readily available at the hotel if preferred. The only other criticism I would make would be the exorbitant cost of internet access.

People stuck in Singapore trying to get rooms at quoted prices of $550 over is shameful. This totally lost my goodwill with the hotel. A room that usually goes for mid $200's at $550!.

Finally had the chance to stay in one given I was going to stay 7 days and didn't want to be in some small business hotel. There are actually two Swissotels in Singapore so take note that this Swissotel at Merchant Court is smack next to the somewhat \"happening\" bars and restuarants of Clarke Quay. So location is great as you're 3 minutes away from a host of dining and drinking choices of Clarke Quay, which gets a lot of attention from tourists and locals alike. You can choose between the tourist-laden Jumbo Seafood, 20+ odd bars or even a decent sized Hooters restaurant to spend your cash. You'll also be 1 minute from a MRT (subway) station so transport won't be a problem as getting a cab seems really hard these days all over Singapore. There are multiple of room grades, starting with the \"Classic\" room, which really means 13 year-old rooms without LCD TVs on lower floors. Then there are \"Swiss Advantage\" rooms which means slight renovated/upgraded rooms on slightly higher floors. There's pool view, building views, and Clarke Quay view rooms, and when you throw in the Club level rooms and Studios, you'll be thoroughly confused as to what really is your room grade. Stay away from the Classic Rooms as they're just old with a dated bathroom to match. Try to go for the Club level rooms, they're on the top three floors ( 10/F to 12/F), some have views of the pool ( most popular) and you have access to breakfast and drinks in their Swissotel Club. Beds are comfortable, rooms are spacious so you can fit a huge suitcase or two, and each room comes with a coffee machine that makes coffee from Lavazza coffee pods. It was actually very quiet at night ( even though I initially worried about the noise from Clarke Quay and the swimming pool ) so I slept like a log everyday. Breakfast was decent but I'd never pay for it unless it came with the room given you can have some Kaya toast and tea/coffee for a few dollars everywhere. Staff are all extremely friendly and will go the extra mile to fulfill your request. The pool is decent sized and you'll be catching plenty of sun when the weather permits. Full working gym on the same floor, so my advice will be to pump iron first, then strip into your swimsuit and apply tanning oil to acheive maximum muscular effect. Downside of this hotel is that they charge you for broadband. I personally think charging for broadband is extremely out of fashion so you can try to take that up with the manager and see what he/she says. The lobby can be stuffy, but if you can think environmental-friendly, this means they are cutting down their carbon emissions.

Singapore itself is an amazing city but im very dissapointed with our choice of hotel. We booked the Swissotel Merchant Court as the location looked excellent, which it was, right on Clarke Quay with bars, resteraunts, shops right outside the hotel. But the location was the only good thing about the hotel. When we walked into reception the hotel smelt musty, as did the room. Thr reception staff were friendly enough, but dont ask concierge anything as its far too much trouble for them to help you! So after leaving reception we went upto our room, firstly the handrail in the lift was on the floor..(Really good impression!), then as walking to our room through the long corridors, the carpets had alot of stains, you could barely see out of the windows as they were so dirty. The room looked ok when we first walked in but after 10 mins we wanted to check out ! The furniture was very old, the bed runner was covered in stains which we quickly remeved, the windows were horribly dirty, the marble in the bathroom was really old & dirty in places, the toilet seat was wonky, the tv was like something out of a 70;s film, the carpet was all stained & the bath towels were that ols that they were paper thin with trhreads all hanging off them!! How this hotel has a 4* rating ill never know! Oh and the Air con in the room was also useless, its made a constant ticking noise & didnt reallt cool the room much.! Just what you need when its 34 deg outside!! Breakfast was also awful, the choice was very limited. We ate just toast as the mad scramble with all the other guests wasnt worth it. The resteraunt is quite large but all the food is served in a small area making it rather cramped. On the upside as i said before, the location was excellent and the pool area was lovely. the staff in the spa were the friendliest in the hotel and they kept the changing rooms very clean. We would not reccomment anyone to stay at this hotel as there are many hotels in Singapore that looked much nicer. There are also many other hotels around they Quay area if its the location you want. If we hadnt prepaid for the hotel then we would have checked into another after seeing the rooms..! Also there was no complimentary internet useage, SGD 15 for 1 hr, which is approx \u00a38!

Arriving late at night, we caught a limousine from the airport to the hotel and were very pleased to find that our room was ready and had been prepared accurately to our booking - a Classic Room with King Bed and baby cot. The room was cool and comfortable, a welcome break from the humidity outdoors. Check in was friendly and efficient. Throughout the 8 days we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, used the pool several times and enjoyed having chosen the Swissotel as our base. From the pool there is a good view of the river and Clarke Quay. There were 3 food and beverage outlets at the hotel, however we chose to eat elsewhere as the prices were generally extortionate. Breakfast was not included in our rate, and we did not avail ourselves of the overpriced breakfast at the hotel. A gift shop with reasonable prices is located in the hotel foyer. We strongly recommend the food from the large Hawker Centres down in Chinatown, or the selection on \"Food Street\" in Chinatown. For a more upmarket dining experience with an international flavour, there is a wide selection of food available across at Clarke Quay, although these are significantly more expensive than the outlets in Chinatown. Boat Quay is also a short walk from the hotel, however we would not recommend eating here as the number of touts is ridiculous and the selection is no better than other \"hassle free\" areas of town and the prices tend to be higher. Dining in Little India is a must for some great value quality food from the subcontinent. The MRT station is a short walk from the hotel and provides easy connections through to many places in Singapore, there is also a bus stop servicing many lines near this station. As there were 3 of us and plenty of luggage, we caught a taxi back from the hotel to the airport and this cost SGD $21.

The bathroom was large with every amenity I look for (slippers, toiletries, hairdryer, etc) EXCEPT a robe. This seems a strange omission. Wireless and wired internet is available for an incredible $12SGD an hour or $28SGD a day. Breakfast is NOT included in the basic room, and runs $30SGD + 10% gratuity + tax, if you eat in the hotel. For the price - get an upgraded room that includes internet and breakfast, if you plan to need them. My interactions with hotel staff were limited, but I found them generally friendly and helpful. Expect slow service in the restaurants when it is busy, particularly on drink refills. The breakfast buffet has many good foods, although the selection is the same each day. The lunch buffet is a better experience, with many more stations and a very good representative sampling of local cuisine - our local contacts actually brought us to our own hotel for lunch, as they enjoyed it so much. Don't feel confined to the hotel for food though - Clark Quay has many, many good restaurants along the river. You can also go to the basement level of the nearby mall for cheap local food - $4SGD for a prawn noodle bowl lunch for example. If you are visiting Singapore on business, this is an excellent location. If you are here primarily to shop, you will want a hotel closer to Orchard road.

Located at the touristy and contrived (but not bad) Singapore River walk with their 10-15 Sg $ beers. Clarke Quay MRT Station is just beside and under the hotel. Cabs are within the thoroughfares. 5-10 mins (during rush hour) away from Chinatown, Raffles City, Bugis and the Esplanade where we watched the NY Philharmonic. There is also an HSBC ATM just outside the hotel along the Riverwalk. Everyone and the cabbies in town knows where the hotel is. Room Service is excellente! Was very very very tired one night to grab a late night grub and decided to call room service instead. Since its a 5 star hotel, it doesn't come cheap (and not w/in the test of reasonableness maybe), but the seafood fried rice was one of the best damn thing I ever had in recent memory. The meal and service was also quick, served in generous portions and fresh. (Well, it has to be if you are paying 20 bucks) The hotel staff learned that I will be spending my birthday while I'm checked in so they sent me a birthday cake. A chocolate mousse. Other than the thought, it was classy and delicious too. My room was also upgraded. Rooms were well-appointed, comfy king sized bed, pillow and sheets. It was small but the interiors were tastefully intelligent with modern designs. There were free issues of Time and Newsweek magazines as well as other Sg periodicals. Wifi is free at the lobby and lounge area. They also offered me to use the pool showers after I check-out since my flight would be later on the early evening of the day I check-out. High marks also for cleanliness. Warm and accommodating staff at the reception, the cafe and housekeeping during our stay. THE (not gruesomely BAD) but qualifies as BAD: The hotel building was itself dated. Although there were constant renovations to catch up with the times, not all of the facilities were spruced up. The bathroom and the tub were still on old tiles, its no big deal though since they were clean at all times. Water pressure was also 'in the middle'. THE UGLY: Buffet breakfast was so so :( Was looking forward for the buffet spread and Swissotel standards to start one hectic appointment-ridden day. Although the staff were completely attending to you're needs, the buffet spread was less colorful and interesting. Restaurant interiors were dim and dull, not the kind of atmosphere to start a hectic day for business. Only one kind of sausage, simple potato spreads, egg station, cereals and less variety of fruits. Pastries and Asian fares were also limited. Can't help to compare it with other 5 star breakfast spreads at the Hyatt, Fullerton, Mandarin, even Novotel. It was not worth the SG$ 30 per person tab.

The hotel is near a couple of malls and is close to Clarke Quay Metro, China Town is a 5 to 10 minute walk away. There is wifi in your room, but this costs S$20 per day. You can however walk to the local Subway, McDonalds or Starbucks with your laptop and get free wifi (less than a 5 minute walk away). For a cheaper alternative to the hotel breakfasts you can walk to the cafes at the nearby malls where you get a choice of local or international food outlets. The pool was small, but very nice with good loungers and a bar service. Unfortunately the pool area goes into shadow mid afternoon. A gym is located next to the pool. The reception staff were polite and helpful. We left luggage at the hotel while we went travelling and there was no charge for this service.

It also looks over the river and has a spa as well. when we arrived it was about 6.30 /7 am and the check in staff were very pleasant and said that they would make a room ready for us by 9am, which they did. we also asked if we could have a room with a nice view which they very nicely changed for us, and we got an extremely pleasant view of the pool and the river and restaurants below, for the same price.

We checked in at 9.30am and were very pleased to find out that they had a room available for us even though it had 2 single beds instead of the double we'd requested. We took it though, rather than wait until the afternoon, as we both needed a shower after our long flight. The room was on the 2nd floor and looked out over the entrance (in other words away from the pool area) where all the taxi's pull up - not the most pleasant of views but hey, we were only going to use the room for sleeping. It was also quite a small room, but everything was clean so no real complaints there. The air con was bliss and the beds were super comfy, which were the most important things for us. The staff were very friendly and accommodationg, and every member of staff whether it be the manager or the cleaner would greet you with a cheery greeting whenever you passed them in the corridors. We loved the fact that this hotel is so close to China Town, about a 10 minute walk, which we loved for all the great food you can get there! Clarke Quay and Riverside Point are great for restaurants but they are very pricey (we paid SGD 320 for a meal one night!) so we enjoyed the good quality and cheap prices of the food in China Town very much. I wouldn't personally consider the Swissotel a 4 star hotel but I think that's because we stayed in a rather small room that, although clean, looked like it needed an upgrade. Also, the breakfast is great with a wide choice of food, but on the morning we chose to eat there the food wasn't very hot at all, infact some of the \"hot\" food was almost cold. The price of SGD 30 each was a bit steep I thought. We ate at Starbucks just round the corner for breakfast on the second day for a much cheaper price!

This is my first review on Tripadvisor and I am sad to begin it with negative impressions. Please find below my short remarks: - Location is great, especially for those who knows that the Orchard road is not the only attraction of Singapore. Perhaps for me it was the only advantage of the hotel - Pool area also looks very nice but I was intended to see as many places in Singapore as possible and did not have time for swimming. - The service is just normal, neither perfect, nor bad. Just usual, even as in many others 3* hotels. - The room was TOTALLY not worse the money I paid for it. I have been travelling since I was a child 4 times a year and have been to dozens of hotels in the world. So I know what I am talking about. When I first entered the room I was shocked. I caught the smell which was like in my grandpa\u2019s basement in the village. Dampness mixed with something else hard to describe. The room was as big as in 3* hotel in the suburbs of European cities It was really dirty in all places well seen by the eye and little hard to reach with the hoover. The next thing which totally made me crazy about this hotel is sound proofing. Every morning beautiful sounds of toilet flushing from my neighbours woke me up!!! It is totally unacceptable for a 4 star hotel. Everything in this room including walls, ceiling, furniture was very tired and needs renovation. - Breakfast was just ordinary, like in many other hotels. Nevertheless I was dissatisfied with the variety of fruits and quality of juice (perhaps 80% water, 10% juice, 10% concentrate). As I found out later, the rate for breakfast separately was about S $50 per person. So it is far more better to go out of the hotel to the next shopping center (just in front of Swissotel) with a great variety of different cuisines and have breakfast there at about 15$. To sum up, the hotel is overpriced and no worth its money at all. You will definitely expect more from a hotel in Singapore.

The room was a reasonable size with free internet access (make sure this is reflected on the bill at checkout) and had an iron and ironing board in the closet. Staying in the executive rooms gives you access to the executive lounge where you can take breakfast (highly recommended as it is much quieter) and also there is a 'happy hour' between 6-8pm where you can take nibbles and drinks FOC. Good for expenses as it keeps the drinks bill down! In general the hotel was fine, the location I found was the best thing, it took me about 45 mins to check out due to problems with my bill but it was corrected to my satisfaction finally. For any future trips I will look to stay elsewhere as there are a large number of hotels that I am sure will offer equally good standards.", "Date": "March 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indonesia", "Title": "\u201cSingapore isn't only about Orchard\u201d", "Author": "bintangbintang", "ReviewID": "UR25909637", "Content": "I visited Singapore again for 3 days and 2 nights, having a little bit bored with hotels in Orchard I chose this hotel.

Bed was decently comfortable although I found the pillows not much comfortable. The room has a flat screen TV but no DVD player and a very very poor selection of TV channels.

It had a smaller-sized King bed and basic furniture, but there really wasn't anywhere to put your suitcases without having to step over/around them.

The free laundry went last year, and now the free broadband accompanies it ...... so just what is an 'executive' with no broadband ? The service quality costs reduction is now so obvious that the hotel management looks rather out-of-touch with their target customers' needs. It would have been much better to raise prices and maintain quality, but the route chosen - raising prices and reducing quality has made the value proposition significantly poorer.

They also have lots of mini-spas or beauty salons in the mall, I haven't tried any of them, but they are there if you decide against using the hotel spa (not advisable :-)). There is a fantastic Chinese restaurant in the basement of the mall across the road. It's called DA PAI DANG, they have great food at really good prices. Lovely staff also. We had breakfast in the hotel two mornings. You can get an all you can eat buffet for 39 Singaporean dollars. Get there early and fill up on the great food that they have to offer. If you are a lover of dim sum and local food, definitely pay a visit to the food hall in the basement of the Paragon mall. The restaurant is called TASTER FOOD PTE LTD.

The agent I had booked through told me that a deluxe room would be suitable for a family. I found the staff a little unfriendly and uninterested during the long check in. As soon as I saw the room I noticed that it only had two double sized beds. The staff assured me that they were queen sized (they were not) but even two queens would not have been suitable for a comfortable night. When I requested a folding bed I was told that this would cost an additional $80. I then spoke with the hotel duty manager and requested our money back so that we could go to another hotel. He mentioned that we could only do this by speaking with our agent (not possible on a Sunday!). We were therefore unable to change hotels even though I asked to leave before we settled in the room. As compensation, he offered a 10% discount on the cost of the folding bed (a total of $8). I would rather have spent this discount on a cab fare to another hotel. This was our 2nd holiday in Singapore within a year and the 3rd hotel that we have tried there. I have nothing but praise for the other 2 hotels but Swissotel, given the price and reputation, was disappointing. Great location, large room, average service, long check in/out, slightly shabby corridors and renovations were taking place during our stay. $12 for 2 bottles of water.

If they don't charge to use the televsion why internet. If there is a charge made to the hotel, it should be absorbed in the room charge, or else passed on at cost. This of course applies to most hotels in Singapore and elsewhere. Ultimately, there is no extra cost for a hotel to charge for wi fi use on an unsecured network because there is no extra cost for the hotel in providing the service. As an experienced traveller, this is getting out of hand, and a hidden cost not disclosed to the traveller. Hotels should start being upfront about this because it is misleading advertising. 80% of business travellers need to use their laptops, and there is a difference if a hotel makes internet use complimentary (there are some) and those hotels which charge up to $30 for the privilege.

I booked the room through the swissotel.com website, which was extremely convenient as unlike other hotels, booking with them directly truly does guarantee the best rate possible, and they show the cost in it's entirety, service charges and taxes included. Always remember to check the promotions/tie-up link from the site - I booked the promo rate for Premium Mastercard holders, which was an excellent, excellent value - a room upgrade, late checkout up to 4 pm, breakfast included. Be sure though to printout the hotel's confirmation of your rate and amenities and present it when you check in. The people manning Reception were unaware of the promotional rate and the inclusions, and they tried to initially place us in a non-upgraded room. I paid for a \"Swiss Business\" room, so according to the promo we should be placed in the next category, which was on the Executive Floor. When I pointed out the upgrade indicated on my printout, they said okay, we'll put you in a Swiss Business room with two double beds, and I had to insist that their website indicated that the next category was actually an Executive floor room. The only other kink in an otherwise excellent stay was that it turned out the Executive Lounge was closed for renovation - NOT mentioned on the website, but there was a letter of explanation from the GM in the room. The Lounge amenities (buffet breakfast served there, evening cocktails as well) had been a major selling point for me as I did not want to battle the crowd at the coffee shop in the mornings. Thankfully the hotel was not too busy during our stay, so breakfast at the coffee shop was still comfortable with an area set aside just for Executive floor guests, and cocktails were still served in the lobby / cafe area. ROOM- We stayed on the top floor of the hotel, the 12th floor, which is one of their Executive Floors. It was very spacious and newly renovated, very, very clean. Tasteful Western decor. Windows along an entire wall, with heavy floor-to-ceiling blackout drapes. It had a foyer, desk, king-sized bed, bathroom with tub and rainfall shower head, spacious closet with an iron and ironing board, Lavazza coffee machine, waffle cotton robes, hairdryer, weighing scale, safe, slippers, in addition to all the usual amenities. The mattress was excellent, and the pillows! Fabulous. They even offer a choice of the pillow-type - if I recall correctly, memory foam, feather, hypoallergenic fill. Nice, good quality linens with a duvet. A generous four pillows were provided, with an extra one tucked away in the closet. I did find the \"Welcome Fruit Plate\" a little amusing as it was composed of two green apples. I suppose I'd expected a little more exotic than apples. They did tell us there was ongoing construction on the floor below us but we never heard any noise. Very minor quibbles - room was obviously new but the contractor for the refurbishing may messed up a little - grouting in the shower area was not done neatly, and the ceramic wall tiles were \"wavy\" and probably not the highest quality. Even with the glass enclosure shut, the entire bathroom floor gets wet when showering. Also because of the way the sliding doors on the closet were configured, the drawer could not be opened fully. BREAKFAST/ FOOD - A generous spread with everything you could possibly want : hot and cold cereals, bread variety, fruit juice station, fresh fruit, egg station, pancakes and french toast, sauteed vegetables, congee, noodles, sausages, bacon, coldcuts, cheeses, yogurt.... so much of it you couldn't possibly try it all. Our rate also offered an a la carte breakfast up to 2 pm for late-risers.Complimentary evening cocktails and canapes if you stay on an Executive floor. LOCATION- Has an MRT station right next to the hotel, taxis always available out front. This hotel is in the Clarke Quay /riverside locale, which is a nice area to walk around in at night. Just across the street is the Central shopping mall, a mid-sized center with many food and retail outlets. Cab from the airport on a Saturday morning was 18 Singapore dollars, to the airport on Monday afternoon was 14.40. SERVICE - Always extremely courteous and pleasant staff, despite the little bit of confusion when we checked in.

I had a late afternoon flight and by the time I went back to get my bags I was dripping with sweat. A quick shower before jumping on the plane for 12 hours would have made me feel better.

We had booked a (Business Executive) with small balcony overlooking the river. Rooms were miniscule compared to Exec Rooms at other Hotels we have stayed in, so I would class as just adequate. Certainly no frills for the extra dollars. We were there for 10 days and hit the Oktoberfest which was noisy but not a problem as they seemed to wind up each night about midnight and with curtains drawn was not a concern even on their last night so no complaints about that, it was fun to listen to. The problem was the many many nightclubs and bars which are growing at a rapid pace along the Quay area. I think this is going to be a major problem for the Hotel as after a couple of TOTALLY sleepless nights both Friday and Saturday, I was ringing around by 7 am on the Sunday morning trying to find alternative accomodation. I had actually given up trying to sleep by 4 am. and went down to do washing/drying and ironing to get away from all the yahooing and screaming, from the young people (the bungee was still operating at 4 am. plus the live bands and constant thump of music from the nightclubs was unbearable. There were young people actually passed out on the walls of the bridge and others running up and down them until well after 5 am. shouting and yelling. In fact I can honestly say that after 8 trips over the last 20 odd years this was the first time we have witnessed drunken, rowdy and unruly behaviour. We have stayed 3 times at the Merchant and although only a *** star hotel I have mentioned on the list before that it has been worth it for the location/pool area and we have never had a problem with staff, but sadly this will be our last stay. Let me be clear that I am not blaming the Hotel in anyway for the noise problem, after all they can't do much about it. After talking to reception people, and advising them that we were going to be moving hotels, they did everything they could and managed to change us to another room on the 12th floor and whilst not nearly as nice a view at least we managed to get good sleep for the rest of our stay. There were several people complaining so we were not alone. The staff were all fine and we have no complaints about how we were looked after. I agree with other reviews on the list, the Hotel is now well past its use by date and the only thing going for it was the location. Yes the CENTRAL shopping centre is just across the road and yes has heaps of Japanese Restaurants if you happen to like Japanese food, however some sections of the CENTRAL S/Centre are just about an arms length of some of the hotel rooms. Wonderful view facing white glass and concrete walls if you are allocated one of those rooms!!! With everything changing now around the Clarke Quay area this has now become a \"Mini Teenage Yuppie\" Disneyland, all the old ambience of the river is now gone as the upmarket cafes, bars, restaurants have taken over.

Our rooms were small, not very elegant but clean, bathroom was okay. The Hotel has an official four-star rating, the rooms are more three-star, after my opinion. You always get the impression, that the hotel owner wants to save money, if it is in the bathroom, where the faucet has a water-saver or the hair-dryer has a power-save-button which you have to keep pressed all the time during hair-drying. This is not the style of a four-star-hotel. But the owners are swiss, these guys always knew how to save money and to leave their customers with the feeling of being cheated. Breakfast service was extremely poor on our first morning, table was not cleaned, we got coffee instead of tea, there was no refill and so on. After we complained about that at the reception, service became much better the next days. Breakfast itself was okay but nothing more than you would expect in a four-star hotel. You have to pay for the internet-access, which is also quite poor for a four-star hotel, but you should remember that this is a Swiss\u00f4tel, as I explained before. The only real positive thing about this hotel is the location directly opposite of newly renovated, stylish Clarke Quay. Chinatown can be reached by foot, also Boat Quay. To make it short: I would not recommend to stay at this hotel, for there are much better hotels in Singapore, even the other Swiss\u00f4tel The Stamford is better, our friends stood there for additional five nights.

I immediately walked to concierge desk to ask for help--we needed a video camcorder cleaning tape and to have our city tour confirmed. The concierge within 10 minutes had name, address, walking directions and personal contact of a camera shop, and had our city tour confirmed. He couldn't have been nicer.

We had no problem with the noise, and we were in there during the day. The location is excellent to walk from to the Quay to eat, take a Singapore River cruise, catch the MRT or even walk easily to Raffles and its shopping center. The large restaurant had excellent breakfast and lunch buffets, including a wide variety of delicious choices, at $24 US for breakfast and $28 US for lunch, as I recall.

Most of the items on offer can be bought at home in most countries and as far as electronics go, you are pretty much gauranteed to get ripped off at the famous Lucky Plaza which has become seedier in recent years in this regard.

It is in a great location for dining out with Clake Quay and Riverside Point about two minutes away and Boat Quay about a 15 minute walk. To get to a shopping mall it was a $5-6 taxi ride. However, initial impressions weren't great! When we pulled up in the taxi the road outside was a construction site with lots of noise and dust everywhere. Once inside the hotel the noise wasn't bad but more fun was to come! We had booked an extra night at the hotel as our flight from NZ arrived in at 6.45am and we wanted to check in straight away. At reception we were told that because we hadn't turned up the night before they had sold our room and we would have to wait. They claimed they didn't know we were arriving in the morning despite it being in black and white on our reservation forms. They eventually found us a room which was on the third floor near the lifts. Not a bad room but the noise from people talking at the lifts was annoying. Luckily we weren't in that room for very long as my husband worked his magic and we were moved to another room. This room was lovely, it was nice and big and had a balcony that overlooked Clarke Quay with two chairs and a table. The room was serviced every day and was kept very clean. Each night we had a small bar of Toblerone and a bottle of water by the bed (a great touch given the heat in Singapore). We could hear the construction from this room but it wasn't that annoying (when we arrived they were working on getting the road outside the hotel finished which accounted for most of the noise, by the time we left this was finished) and there was noise from a nightclub across the river but again not that invasive that we couldn't sleep. The bed was a true king size, not two twin beds pushed together and was extremely comfortable. The pillows were great too. We had dinner in the Blue Potato one night - the bbq buffet. Which was great, there was loads of food and they cooked your meat/seafood in front of you. The staff were very attentive. Highly recommended is the buffet breakfast in the Ellenborough Cafe. The selection was great and they cooked your eggs on demand to your specification. We also had room service our first night and it was good, hot and arrived quickly. They also do a high tea in the Crossroads bar, a booking is recommended as they seem to fill it every day. We found the price of alcohol very high at the hotel and at the restaurants on Clarke Quay and in the nearby supermarket. If you like a glass of wine or a beer at the end of the day, take your own from your home country. Currently you can take 1 litre of spirits and 1 litre of wine or beer into Singapore. There is a supermarket over at Liang Court Mall.

Checkin was easy and fast, and I got a room not facing the construction site. Unfortunately my room was at the end of the one wing, what meant, that I had to walk a lot in the hotel's corridors to reach the pool floor or the lobby. The room itself was rather outdated than new being equipped with the standard amenties. That's the first problem. A five star hotel only having ordinary amenties...? Beds were comfortable enough, working desk was fine, TV had some reception problems and only a few Western entertainment channels had been available. The control unit next to the beds had some malefunctions - when you pushed the master button to turn off all lights in the room, one light, the one of the bathroom, remained on or was even turned on. Additionally, if you attempted to reactivate the aircondition, the light in the bathroom was turned on either. I got a little bit angry about that. The bathroom wasn't that exciting having a bath tube and an outdated sink/mirror area. Outside the rooms the Swissotel has more to explore and relax, what finally compensates the deficits in the rooms (my room). The lobby is breathtaking and fancy, in the evening a piano player entertains the guests. The Swissotel is perfectly located adjacent to the Singapore river, the next MRT station is only a few steps away, which makes it easy to roam around in Singapore. The pool area is nicely designed with enough sun beds and towels. There is a slide for the children and a seperate pool for babies and toddlers. From there you have a great view at the river and its banks, where the entertainment takes place daily (and nightly). Unfortunately there wasn't even one ashtray available, smoking is fully prohibited at the pool level. I basically agree with that, but they could have defined a zone around a trash bin, where smokers could act out their addiction. The gym was equipped properly, the SPA (sauna and steam bath) were acceptable, but disappointing for an European being used to these SPA facilities. Final conclusion: For my taste, the premises does not fulfill the promises made on their website. I was charged SGD 130 (excl. taxes)/night, which has been a discounted rate. I would accomodate myself there again if not more expansive than the remarked S$130.

Bonus being that it is Adjacent to an MRT station so you can get just about anywhere on the island.", "Date": "December 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cChristmas in the Tropics\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4240903", "Content": "We spent six nights here in November 2005 and had a very pleasant stay. The room was reasonably large, well kept and very clean. The en suite bathroom was a good size with a big bath and fantastic shower - very important when the heat and humidity are as high as they are in Singapore. Room service was very good and delivered promptly. The breakfast buffet had a good selection everything from Continental breafast, traditional English style cooked breakfast to local delicacies such as noodles and durian fruit. As in most of Singapore there is a large consruction site just over the road and although it was operational for quite long hours there was no noise or disturbance while in the hotel. Don't let it put you off. We arrived at 10.00am and they were very accomodating in getting us into a room as soon as possible. Singapore is a great place and there is lots to see and do. You must do the Night Safari. The concierge can book that for you and they pick you up at the hotel. There are lots of bars and restaurants nearby on the waterfront and it is in easy walking distance to Chinatown and Esplanades. Gluttons Bay is a must visit if you go to Esplanades - outdoor fast food that is just the best you've ever tasted and incredibly cheap. One of the best holidays we've had.", "Date": "December 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, England", "Title": "\u201cFabulous hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4146722", "Content": "I can only agree with the recent reviews, this hotel is excellent!

Anyway, we accepted to stay in a twin room without balcony.

Checked into the hotel as Executive Club Members (which we didn't know we were, but naturally went along with it! something to do with the deal we got when we booked it i think.) We had a fantastic, spacious, quiet, clean, airy, modern looking room on the 11th floor overlooking the Quay and the pool. Went out to the fantastic selection of restaurants and bars, western and eastern food for dinner. We found The Iguana Cafe. A great place to have a drink. It has an amazing endless choice of spirits/ alcohol to the ceiling. Literally. Shelf upon shelf! Our first night there we went to bed hoping to get a good nights sleep and a lie in after the flight, we were unfortunately awoken at 8am the next morning by a holiday rep- we didn't know we had!!! (not the hotels fault- we should have said no to being disturned) A tad annoyed at this but knowing that our time in Singapore was limited (only a 3 day stopover) we were up and booking trips within the hour. (The Night Safari is a must and the City Tour is fantastic if you want to know more about Singapore culture and history. Both excellent. Tour guides had excellent spoken English, friendly jokey nature and of course a wealth of information. I would also suggest Sentosa Island by cable car- it is a fantastic adventure which you can do without a tour guide and explore at your own leisure. Also girls there's 24hour shopping Malls out here!!!! Come with an empty suitcase! And for guys there's technology shopping malls for you- yep purely dedicated to cameras, computers and other electronic gadgets.) We had breakfast in the hotel, up on the 11th floor club lounge. A good selection of bread (to toast), pastries, croissants and jams to accompany (the coconut jam is scrummy), fried Singapore style breakfast cooked to order in front of you. Also in the same lounge area from 5pm until about 7pm there was complimentary drinks served, alcoholic and non alcoholic. Overall this hotel offered polite, caring, friendly chatty staff, especially Eddie in the executive club. He made our holiday ... I think the word is easy and trouble free. The staff were genuinely there to help and interested in YOU. Not like some of the hotels i've stayed in where the staff half heartedly help you! We were given FREE extended check out time (until 5pm) as our flight wasn't until later afternoon. The pool was clean and the service above excellent.(Also Spa treatments available, I didn't try them but relaxing aromatherapy oils were on the list. excellent idea if you've been on a plane for 14hours.) Chocolates were left on our bed every night and fresh fruit was in a bowl in the room everyday. The bathroom was clean, new towels and toiletries (shampoo, shower gel ect) everyday too. And a cheap 5minute call to the UK too! This was the first stop on our trip and I think that the hotel made our holiday start with the 'WOW' factor. I would definitely go back to Singapore and will definitely look into trying out other Swissotel owned accommodation.", "Date": "November 2, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Swissotel Merchant Court", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d301577-Reviews-Swissotel_Merchant_Court-Singapore.html", "Price": "$187 - $427*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">20 Merchant Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Singapore</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">058281</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Singapore</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "301577", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/bc/07/bc07ff847219b38bf890848751c22c277large.jpg"}}
