The airport shuttle collected us from the railway station, it runs every half hour and collects both from the station and the airport itself.

The welcome from the front desk staff was very good and we got upgraded to a junior suite which was very pleasant. It looks as if the hotel has recently been refurbished and they seem to have done a good job. Had dinner in the restaurant, I generally avoid hotel restaurants but in this one the food was actually pretty good, but the service was patchy. Order taken promptly, food was delivered quick enough and was hot and tasty. But then nothing, no-one came near us to ask if we wanted another drink, did we want dessert or to bring the bill, in the end I had to get up and ask for it, and I noticed others doing the same. Don't get me wrong the service was friendly enough, but I'm used to people coming to me not the other way around. But it was the accommodation we were actually there for and that was fine.

We chose it mainly because it was near the airport and we arrived there on a Friday night and they had a free shuttle bus service between the airport, the train station and the hotel. The first night everything was as expected but on Saturday, we asked at the reception desk if there would be shuttle service until late night (they told us it was a 24h service) and the bus worked every 20 minutes, great! That night, at 22.00h we were at the station, and, after 30 minutes waiting we had to call to the hotel and ask to be picked up, they told us then than that night there was no bus service (they could have told us that morning!). They advice to hire a taxi and they told us they would pay the fare, as it was their fault. We were happy enough with the answer but, every single taxi we asked, wouldn't take us to the hotel, as they said that was \"too little money\" (the hotel is only about 2kms from the airport/train station). We called the hotel again to ask for help, as they had seem quite aware that the whole problem was their fault but this time they were not that helpful! We were told that the taxi drivers did not take us seriously because we couldn't speak German (?!\u00bf) and that, according to the German law, a taxi driver cannot refuse passengers on these grounds... Thus, we were stuck at the airport, is was really late at night, we had walked all day but... hopefully we had our GPS with us and we managed to find our way to the hotel walking. But it is not that near when you have already walked the city all day, you have to walk the deserted dark streets of the area and you feel you've been treated like crap! We finally arrived at the hotel at 00:20, which ruined our night and also the next morning. We were quite angry and wanted to file a written complain but they wouldn't let us write any! They told us the manager would speak to us the next morning and that he started working at 10.00 AM. We waited till then, losing our precious time, as we still had a lot to see in Berlin, but, what a surprise, the manager wasn't coming to work until 11.00 (or at least, that was what we were told). Then we just decided we would file the complain and leave, but, as much as we tried, the assistant manager (who obviously, was not informed of our problem by the night staff) didn't let us do so either! We couldn't even write a proper complaint! We think the whole staff were really unprofessional for a 4-star hotel.

That was OK for me since I only stayed there because of a function at the hotel - but I would not recommend it to people visiting Berlin.", "Date": "June 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cHandy to airport, not to Berlin\u201d", "Author": "zigmund", "ReviewID": "UR5326884", "Content": "I stayed one night due to flight timings and found the overall experience to be a good one. One of the best things was that there was a bowl of fruit in my room upon arrival. I don't know if this was because I am a Priority Club member or they do it for everyone, but it made for a nice welcome at the end of a long day working in Berlin. The room was good value (\u20ac85/night including breakfast) The hotel has a shuttle which picks up at the airport (I think you have to phone) and also at the s-bahn station nearby. The distance is not walkable unless you really like walking a lot. The hotel is near the airport, but access is via a major road and a long link road. Breakfast in the morning was good with all the usual things like frys, breads, meats, cheeses, etc . . . no complaints there. It took a while to locate the restaurant though because it is through a passageway behind the bar and when I walked into the bar in the morning it was empty and there was no sign of any dining room. I had to check with reception who insisted that the restaurant was at the end of the building before I found it. As other posters have said it is not a place to stay if you want to see Berlin - stay downtown somewhere instead. Getting to downtown Berlin from the hotel would take at least 70-80 minutes depending on timing with the shuttle and train. I would stay there again, but only for flight timing reasons.", "Date": "June 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFull Marks\u201d", "Author": "Hotelwatcher", "ReviewID": "UR4317373", "Content": "I only stayed one night as I had a flight the following morning.

First of all the good points, it is close to the hotel and it does get you there at any time and also will pick you up from the S bahn station.

It was a great start to our holiday, which took us to Poland and Estonia, and a good finish too, i.e. one night in the Holiday Inn at the beginning and end of our trip. The staff were all very friendly, the rooms a delight, with everything you could want for an overnight stay: hairdryer; coffee maker; mini bar; TV; even tissues in the bathroom, which was very well planned. We liked this hotel a lot, particularly as we got a very good rate, 45 euros a night, though breakfast was an extra 15 euros each per day. The breakfast is excellent, and if the weather is good, you can sit out on the terrace. There is a children's play area with paddling room, and some easy chairs for mum and dad. There is a 'wellness' centre and also a roof garden. The (comp.) shuttle to and from the airport works well - the train station is about 500 m. from the airport terminal, and it costs 2 euro and takes about 45-60 mins. to get to the centre of the city. Thus, if you are out sightseeing all day, and just want to return to a hotel to relax and eat dinner/drink wine, this hotel would suit. But if you want to go out in the city in the evening, look elsewhere. We found it peaceful and relaxing and would not hesitate to use it again.

Unfortunately that was as far as we got. Despite having had a reservation for 4 months, we were told that there had been a \"computer error\" (that seemed to be the story they finally settled on) and they were transferring us to another hotel (The Van der Valk Berliner-Ring - lovely hotel but....) which they assured us was just a few mintues away and also had a shuttlebus which ran to the airport (since our flight wasn't until late afternoon we were planning to spend the morning in central Berlin). In the event the other hotel was more than 20 minutes away and in the middle of nowhere with no public transport links and a shuttlebus could be hired for 15 euros each way to take you to the airport. This effectively scuppered our morning in Berlin. At least five other parties were the victims of the same thing the night we were there. What was infuriating was that the Holiday Inn had clearly known about the problem in advance yet made no effort to advise me of the difficulty before I arrived so that I could make the decision about where I stayed instead of them.

They spoke English on the 'phone and said the bus was already on its way. It runs every 30 minutes from the Hotel so I'm not sure if they would make a special trip to get you if you had just missed one. As someone else has pointed out it is close to and fantastically convenient for the airport but not so good for Berlin City. We were going to do an early morning dash into Berlin before coming back for the flight but the Airport Express trains tend to run just before the hour and half-hour and their shuttle is on the hour and half hour. As the crow flies its a walkable distance to the station but there might be the railway line in the way, as it was dark I couldn't quite work out if this is possible and safe. The Hotel was very clean, modern and the staff spoke English. They had our on-line booking but offered us an upgrade that we declined; the economy room we had booked was just what we needed for the overnight stay.

The food in the restaurant is actually very good as well. We had a great salmon and pasta dish.
