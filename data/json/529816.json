You need to be reasonably fit if you are going to walk down the steep steps into the main part of Trastevere for dinner (and back up again afterwards!), but once there we found some lovely neighbourhood restaurants, which were very good value.

Service - this is not a place that offers service with a smile. Nothing was proactively given to us - no free wifi ticket, no map of Rome, no information on anything near the hotel. If you dont care about service then this could be he place for you. By the way this is (in my opinion) pretty common for Rome so i'm not sure how other hotels would be anyhow. Room. Small by north American standards and large by European standards. The walls are paper thin and we were kept up all night long by our wonderful neighbour who seemed to get in at 1230 and crank the tv to 11 and fall asleep to it. Third night was the same a guest seemed to check a 1230 am and we heard everything - she turned the lights on, emptied her suitcases... Not a place for peace and quiet. Breakfast, was included in our rate and it was worth it. Good service in this area of the hotel. Location. Amazing. Trastevere is a great place to have a home base in Rome. We landed at FCO and took the regional train to Roma Trastevere train station (8 euro each) and a 8 euro can to the hotel. We could see the Vatican from the breakfast area on the 4th floor. We actually walked to the Vatican from the hotel (about 20 minutes). We took the 75 bus into Rome everyday. it took about 15 minutes and dropped us off at the colloseum. From there you can take a subway to all the great spots in Rome. A 3 day metro / bus pass cost us 11 euro each. Overall, the area was wonderful, the location great. It is too bad the room walls were paper thin and the service did not meet even basic courtesy standards.

There is a pool, which is kept immaculate by the pool guy (I think its only open late spring till early autumn) which the kids loved after a hot day of sightseeing. The decor of the hotel is a bit 80's dark green and mahogany hues, but its a good price and the staff are quite helpful, although they don't fall over themselves to ensure you have a good time. The breakfast, although just about edible, could definately be improved upon. There's a great little cafe/bar under the walls of the hotel which does toasties and coffees, and a very reasonably priced restaurant called Carpe Diem, just around the corner from that where we had a few great meals.

Because the Grand Hotel del Gianicolo is situated on one of the severn hills of Rome in Trastevere and so about a 10 minute taxi ride to the Forum, rates for this 4 star are lower than comparable hotels in central Rome. However, there is excellent city bus transportation from just outside the hotel (a block away) that takes one directly to the Forum in about 15 minutes. It also connects with the subway and that provides a quick and air-conditioned ride to the main shopping area. We took taxis going home as it is quite the up-hill walk (cost less than 10 Euro) although the walk down is pleasant and the views fantastic. The hotel arranged for a Mercedes to collect us at the airport as we had considerable luggage..cost was 57 Euros and likewise to the Port of Rome for a van at 120 Euros for 2 persons. The room was well appointed and comfortable although some might find it a little dated and lacking colour. The finishings however were quality as was the linen and it was very clean. Breakfast was extra but was on the roof-top which had a nice view over Rome. Top feature was the swimming pool...a large irregular shape pool with plenty of chairs and loungers so we were able to enjoy the afternoon and then go to town for the late afternoon-evening.

This did not bother us as it meant we spent little time in the room and slept well. We spent a full day around the pool and every afternoon after sight seeing which I would say travelling to Rome in August is essential and fantastic when its 30'c The breakfast had a good choice for our 4 days, I can understand people may expect more choice if staying for a week. Drinks were expensive at the hotel, much better value elsewhere even in central Rome. Trastevere was lovely, more understated and less touristy than central rome, everyone seemed local or a young foreign student staying here. We walked most places you need good shoes as its all cobbles and quite steep, occasionally took a taxi to and from Rome centre, taxis were between 8-14 euros but worth getting back for the pool. Once in the centre the metro was brilliant for visiting the sites.

Also being up a steep hill the area has some lovely views of the city if you decide to walk down to the river (around 20 minutes walk with lots of steps). The area also has some nice restaurants. The hotel has a faded grandeur, and is quite cool as the windows are all shuttered and the floors in the halls and bedrooms are ceramic tiled. The first room they gave us was really horrid - it was pokey and gloomy with a tatty bathroom and a window that you couldn't fully open due to a roof behind it. We complained and got a room on the next floor that was better but still not worth the money we had paid for this quite expensive hotel. But its bathroom was better and the air conditioning had just been fixed so although still a small room it was just acceptable. The wifi was free but you have to pay to use its swimming pool.

I have stayed in Rome a lot for business and personal reasons and can honestly say that I have always had a wonderful time at lovely hotels, unfortunately this hotel did not live up to its reviews in my eyes. The room was basic, small, but that's fine as we only used it to sleep in, I would certainly not give it a 4 star rating! the pictures are obviously the best rooms. The pool photo on their website is taken at such an angel that you think you are at the wrong hotel when you arrive. It is a nice pool, but one that is used by outsiders paying a fee, so this makes it quite difficult to get a lounger, they leave their towels on them and go off for hours, oh and you have to pay 5 Euro's for a pool cap that must be worn at all times in the pool! OK I can understand this, they want to keep the pool filter clean, but you would think the guests would be given these for free as you certainly can spend money there! Normal general pricing at hotels, twice the price for anything you can pick up at a supermarket or shop, but as there is not anything directly around the hotel they have a captives market. Breakfast was typically european, bacon, eggs, little frankfurters, cold meats, cereals, cakes, lots of cakes. the breakfast staff seemed more intent on looking busy than actually paying attention to the guests, our first morning we had got tea/coffee, juice and sat down to put our sugar in etc, then we got up to get some food, when we returned to our table they had cleared it! l did laugh at this, but then on the other mornings when we had no spoons, no napkins, there was no fruit, there was no coffee, it was no longer funny. Overall it was not too bad, but you have to know what you are going to get for your money, as a seasoned traveller I have experienced a lot better service in smaller 2 star hotels, where the staff are actually really happy to see you and want you to enjoy your stay, here it felt like we were a slight inconvenience!

I especially enjoyed the chance to have a simple lunch outside in the garden--yes, there are days when it comes close to 70 in January, and it feels like 80 when you have left the frozen Middle West. We had two meals in the dining room, and I wish I had arranged more. The food was really very good and not just for a hotel, and the service, though they were a bit short-staffed, was crisp and efficient. As someone who arranges group events several times a year, I notice details, and this hotel is very well organized, The staff could not have been more helpful, and when I fell in the shower and brought the shower door crashing down in a rain of safety glass, they cleaned the mess up immediately--offering me a new room that I did not take--and beseeching me to let them call a doctor. They acted as if the whole thing was their fault, when it was completely my own.

Hotel attendants are very efficient and polite especially the woman at the reception and the people taking care of the breakfast\u2026I dont understand the critics I ve read but I must add something : a lot of tourists just out of gary indiana or carlyle England just arrive at the hotel and ask \u201chey anyway what\u2019s there to see in rome ?\u201d or other silly questions which can cause a severe nervous breakdown to the most polite hotel professional 5. when I left on sunday I realised at the airport that I had forgotten an expensive valentine-signed jacket\u2026it was a bit difficult to reach the adequate person but the hotel sent it to me in paris via colissimo with no charge..i thank them there 6.

The rooms are very nice and, I believe, of a four star standard. The Hotel is on hill and to get to the Vatican City you will need to catch the 115 or 870 bus from outside of the Hotel.

A bus ticket cost 1 euro (purchased from any newsagent stands) and lasts for 75 mins. The staff were fine, the breakfast was good in peaceful surroundings. We didn\u2019t eat at the restaurant, as the prices did appear high. On arrival we had a small beer and a campari and lemonade, which cost 15 Euros. There is a local bar situated 1 mins walk left from the Hotel that is much more reasonable. For the evening we went to the Trastevere area where there are hundreds of restaurants in winding streets. Very typical Italian and very good. Here we ate out at very reasonable prices. Bottle of House red costs between 8 to 10 Euros. This area is a 15 min walk downhill and 20 mins back up.

All was fine until the airconditioning broke down soon after settling into our new room. We reported it immediately and were told that nothing could be done until the following day. Now this is an alleged four star hotel and you would expect that maintenance people were at the end of a telephone line. Their answer was it was Sunday afternoon and it was not possible to have repairs until the following day. They offered us a different room and the airconditioning did not work in this room and we were getting a poorer quality room to what we were paying for.

We were told after a while that the airconditioning was now fixed and we returned to our room, for the same problem to happen again. We contacted the reception and he offered a less superior room and we refused to leave the room and demanded the repairs to be carried out again. This was not getting us anywhere until we threatened to not to pay for our stay. Within 20 minutes the repair man was back. We stayed out of our room until 7.50pm, when finally the repairs were completed. We were afforded a \u20ac30 discount for not having the right room the first night and nothing else.

It is very dangerous going out the front door onto a street with no sidewalks and traffic travelling at high speeds. There is a rear entrance, but it is closed for some reason. The breakfasts were exceptionally good for an Italian hotel, including scrambled eggs and American bacon as well as Italian cold cuts, pastries, cereals, juices, cappucino, caffe latte and much more. The breakfast staff was attentive, courteous and efficient, as were the maids. The room was very nice. We had a major problem at the desk, where we reserved a tour of Tivoli and were told we would be picked up at about 8 a.m. on a Tuesday. The tour transportation did not arrive and the woman at the desk called them, but chose to take their word over her own associate that they had no record of our reservations. We had precedent for this at another Rome hotel, where the woman had gone out of her way to put us in a cab to the beginning tour site at the tour's expense. The woman at the Gianicolo was of no help whatsoever, telling us we would have to take a cab at our own (considerable) expense. We tried to make it on the bus, but arrived too late. Clearly the fault lay either with the tour agency or the hotel and we should have been put in a taxi and they could have haggled over who paid later. There was no apology until I really laid into them...at which point we did find a bottle of Prosecco with an apology in our room, but that didn't make up for missing Tivoli. This event left a very bad taste in our mouths and was the lowlight of our trip, given that we booked the hotel for ten nights. The bus rides into Rome offer spectacular views of the city. I would recommend this hotel unconditionally except for the rude treatment we received at the desk, particularlly from the woman. On the other hand, the rest of the staff, including the porter, were outstanding. The location is problematic, so I'd say you would want to have a reason for staying on the Gianicolo rather than in a more central location.

My overall impression of the hotel was excellent, despite a few teething problems at the beginning of our stay. We arrived late at night and pretty frazzled due to a long journey to find we had been allocated a double room, despite asking for a twin - not a good start. I must admit, if I had had to stay in the double room for the entire stay I would not have been happy - the room was tiny and had a view of the breakfast room roof ! However we reported this to the concierge at reception and he allocated us a twin straight away. This room was far better, with a jacuzzi bath no less, and a view of the gardens. It was also much more spacious. Apart from that our stay was fantastic. We found the hotel staff to be extremely friendly and helpful (especially Marco the concierge and Enzo the breakfast waiter). They directed us to bus stops for all the major sites and provided us with a very helpful map to guide us. The hotel is located in a residential area quite a way from the centre, but to be honest we found this to be a bonus. It was quite nice to return to a quiet area after a full days hectic sightseeing ! Plus you have the best view in Rome literally on your doorstep (so good that even tours stop off to see it). The only thing lacking in the area was restaurants, but we found we were staying out in the centre until at least 7pm so we had our evening meals there where there is an abundance of eateries. There was a bus stop a few metres from the hotel which took you directly into the centre of Rome. We bought a 3 day bus/train/tram pass for 11 euros but found nobody checked the ticket even once ! (not that I'm advocating not buying one !). The busses were frequent and the journey only took about 10-15 minutes. Even the bus drivers were extremely helpful. If you ask, they will let you know when you reach your destination, although it's better if you can learn the phrase in Italian as most don't speak English. We didn't find it a problem to get around at all. The 44 and 75 bus routes are the best for getting to and from the centre. Learning a smattering of Italian is a definite bonus as many people only speak a smattering of English and they definitely seem to appreciate your efforts (no matter how rubbish they are !). The breakfasts at the hotel were absolutely superb with a fine range of breads, cakes, pastries, fresh fruit and vegetables, yogurt, spreads, cheese, ham and of course fresh cappuccino (which you have to ask for incidentally). We ate so much at breakfast we didn't really need lunch ! The pool is the perfect antidote to the Roman heat and was mostly empty. We booked a taxi to the airport on the last day which, although expensive at 55 euros, was very comfortable and made for a stress free end to the holiday. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will be staying there again next time I visit Rome. I think it's extremely good value for a city hotel with a pool. The only thing I would say is take some ear plugs - the walls are paper thin and you can hear everything that's going on !", "Date": "September 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cNot What It Appears To Be\u201d", "Author": "Scott&Stacey", "ReviewID": "UR5325568", "Content": "We would not recommend this hotel, especially for first time visitors to Rome. Here are our reasons: 1)The hotel is located at a very busy intersection; walking around it is very difficult and potentially dangerous due to the bliind corners. 2) It is too far away from the major sights. We were told that we were a 10 minute walk to Trastevere and a 15 minute walk to the Vatican Museum. It took about 20 minutes to get to the part of Trastevere where there were a significant number of restaurants and shops. The Vatican Museum would have taken about an hour along some very busy roads (with little or no sidewalk) that cross back on each other as they wind down the hill. For the Vatican, it's not so much the distance but the busy street and the lack of sidewalk that would make the walk unpleasant. Also, the walk down -- and back up -- the hill is very steep. Some guests were having trouble with it, so unless you're in good shape or plan to take taxis, this is really not a good choice. 3)The hotel contracts with at least one taxi service that starts billing you from the time the hotel calls them, which adds about 5 euros to your total bill. 4)The front desk staff reception was poor, with no introduction to the hotel, information about breakfast time and location, etc. 5) As of June 2006, there was no food service at the hotel (other than breakfast) and the rooftop garden/bar was deserted -- no furniture, etc.... 6) There were very few people at the hotel. It had an odd, deserted sort of feel. We would not stay here again, and after this stay decided that it's better to pay a bit more to be closer to the city so that you can enjoy evening strolls through lively piazzas and walk by the beautiful floodlit monuments of Rome.", "Date": "June 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4247704", "Content": "We very much enjoyed our stay here. Bedroom and bathroom were a bit on the smaller side but very clean and nicely decorated. Note to all travelers: TAKE EARPLUGS! The walls were extremely thin, to the point where you could hear every move your neighbors made in their rooms (yes, I mean EVERY move...). Also, the hotel is located on a rather busy street and automobile noises could be easily heard until late into the night. There were not too many nice restaurants within walking distance, so you may want to plan accordingly with meals. However, a short (10 minute) walk on a busy street with no sidewalks will get you to a fabulous restaurant called Scarpone. We highly recommend this restaurant. There is a bus stop a short walk from the hotel which will get you anywhere you need to go in Rome. All in all, this hotel was wonderful - great breakfast, very helpful front desk staff, clean, and upscale. It is also set a bit away from the hustle and bustle of the city and so it was refreshing to escape back to the hotel after a long day of busy tourist spots.

The hotel, pool, corridors, public areas, breakfast room were absolutely, immaculately clean and well maintained. Some of the staff on reception I felt though were quite aloof and not very helpful at times when we were enquiring where a newsagent and small supermarket was. Perhaps they just wanted us to spend our money in the hotel! The room was tiny and only had a shower despite previous email requesting a bath. They may have changed it had I requested on arrival but we arrived past midnight and were too tired to do this. The breakfast was of a variety friuts, meats, cheese cereals juices etc, nicely presented and plenty of it. Fresh cappucinos etc were made at request and hot chocolate too. The gardens were well kept. The hotel is situated near the old wall near the Gianicolo Park. A long but scenic walk to the Vatican or Trastevere where the bars and restaurants are. On an afternoon rest we found out the walls are paper thin. You can hear EVERYTHING and they can hear YOU so bear this in mind. Would I stay again?
