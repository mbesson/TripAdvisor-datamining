{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Slept at the Golden Harbor Just returned from a one-week stay at the Golden Harbor. Location is a bit inconvenient and it requires a cab ride to go most anywhere. Staff was always able to get taxi within minutes. Hotel was clean, some English spoken, internet available. Certainly not plush but has club next door that gives wonderful (non-sexual) massages. Hotel is excellent value for the money, but don't expect it to be American. Price was around $40 American per night, which might have been a special rate since I was part of a group. ATM within walking distance that worked for American debit card, exchange in hotel. Very clean, elevators always worked, rooms decent size with frig. Two restaurants and breakfast probably better than most I've had in China. Staff was very accommodating. Nice lobby for socializing after hours. Sometimes had cold beer.", "Date": "Apr 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR430102546", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Ntimid8r"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d603572-r7478071-Golden_Harbor_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "603572", "Price": "$56"}}
