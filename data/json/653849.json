It was very convenient for us to just walk a few steps and we get to the place we want. There is a department store (Carrefour) nearby. Its close to the heritage museum...good restos, old dubai (Diera), souqs. The room was very good, clean and up to the mark of a 3 star hotel. Room service was 24hrs....and good. The staff were very cordial and helpful. The breakfast was simple but good. The restaurant manager was very helpful and accommodating. The hotel is owned by an Indian national so expect Indian dishes. They did serve continental too. The WIFI is not free....but somehow we couldn't get connected to facebook. It also has a bar though we didn't use it... but judging from how it looks it must be good.

I was there in hotel for 5 nights from 13th to 18 december ... Every Employee of the hotel are very co-operative and helpful.... they make us feel comfortable and guide to explore dubai... We had arranged a tour package from hotel itself it included half day city tour, desert safari with dinner, and Dow Cruise with dinner... all were good. Rooms of the hotel are very nice and clean.. i had a room with a view to Khalifa... which shins like a star at night as the khalifa has flashing lights ON at night. Room was big enough for 2 people, it had bath tub and fridge, etc etc... Rooms were kept clean by the house keeping section, Every time we were out for lunch or tour our rooms were cleaned and give a nice feeling to enter in the room. We had a Breakfast included for Free which was also nice... Staff over there was nice to serve us nice breakfast they arrange a special request from you for your breakfast... Restaurant is now a days decorated with Christmas Trees and stuff, coz its christmas time now. Hotel is located in bur dubai and in middle of city which gives us a easy access to shopping mall and Taxi and Indian Restaurant etc. etc. Shopping Mall named \"Carrefour\" is very near to hotel which is good for shopping, I prefered food from Restaurant Name \"Karachi Darbar\" which is good food joint. Even Meena Bazaar is close to buy other stuff. Theres is Bus Stop near and we can easily get Taxi in seconds from the Entrance of the Hotel. Also you take a small boat which is also near hotel to go to Diera or Gold Souk they small boats charge 1 AED to travel to other side of the creek. Soo i would say hotel is in good location which gives access to all the things and good to travel.
