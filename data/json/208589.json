My wife and I had a double room and my mother-in-law had a single room. Location. Location. location. The greatest asset of this hotel (at this price) is its location right at Plaza Catalunya. Walking distance to almost everything and easy subway access for the few more distant sites. Airport bus stops right at Plaza. Plaza Catalunya and Las Ramblas are the heart of Barcelona where so much of the energy and activity seems to revolve. The hotel was what we expected for a 3 star European Hotel and certainly met our needs (location and cost were highest priority for us). Our double room was clean and comfortable albeit small (as expected). Bathroom was clean (and very small). Our room had a small balcony overlooking plaza Catalunya. There were a couple of quirks with the hotel but they really did not bother us much. Plaza Catalunya is noisy almost all night (especially during our stay since there was a festival and concert in the plaza every night). There is a nightclub across the street and people congregate in front of the club. May only be open weekends (not sure). The balcony has a heavy sliding glass door in addition to heavy wooded doors. When everything is shut, it blocks 95% of the noise so really no problem. However, I like to keep the window/door open a bit overnight for some fresh air. In that case, it was very noisy. But, a pair of earplugs solved that problem and I slept soundly (wife sleeps through anything). On one night there was also a bit of noise from the adjacent room for a little while. The biggest problem was that my mother-in-law's room developed a strong sewer odor after the second day. The hotel was fully booked and they did not have an alternative room. She had to keep the bathroom door shut and the windows open. Since the window of this room faced an interior courtyard, noise was not so much of an issue. We had no such smell in our room, which was just across the hall. Assuming the smell in the single room was an aberration, we would stay in this hotel again. We loved the location. Staff was friendly. Price was right. When we travel, we only use our hotel rooms to sleep and shower so a luxurious hotel is not worth the extra money for us.", "Date": "October 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, shame about the rest...\u201d", "Author": "eurotripSydney", "ReviewID": "UR51322765", "Content": "Fantastic location Not very clean- no clean towels each day Very noisy", "Date": "December 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing and not good value\u201d", "Author": "HotelsExpert", "ReviewID": "UR46996421", "Content": "Looking for budget accommodation in the city centre we read the reviews for Hotel Ginebra and decided to stay there.

I had one of the best sandwiches of my life just down the road at Caf\u00e9 Vienna (if you go there, you will quickly see which one it is and what I mean). Staff was very friendly. Beer, water and soft drinks were available for purchase at the front desk, which was convenient after coming home late night. Like other hotels in Europe, double occupancy meant two single beds, so we somehow rearranged the bedroom furniture to push them together (the room is small, so admittedly it was a struggle!) Why a 4 and not a 5: the room and bathroom are very, very small. I have a high tolerance for limited space, but this was definitely pushing it for me. Also, the elevator to get to the hotel entrance is super small (two people with minimal luggage barely fit) and feels a little shaky.

This hotel is located in a fantastic position at the top of Las Ramblas over looking Plaza de Catalu\u00f1a. This square is where the airport and tourist attraction busses depart from, as well as a Metro station which is very convenient. The airport bus costs 4 Euros 25 cents each and the Bus Touristic is 21 Euros for a day or 26 Euros for two days. To access the hotel you have to press the buzzer and the receptionist lets you into the building. There is then a lift to take you to the 3rd floor, or a lot of stairs to climb. When leaving the hotel, you need to return your room key to the receptionist when you leave the hotel, and if they are away from the desk, there is a bell to ring for service. Upon return to the hotel, once they have buzzed you into the building they are waiting at the hotel door with your room key. We had a room over looking Plaza de Catalu\u00f1a and the room was nice and quiet from the street noise. The 4 layers of shutters/doors keep out the noise and light! The hotel walls did seem to be rather thin so, as some noise was heard from the rooms either side of us. Our room was of a decent size although the bathroom was a little small with a wooden folding door separating it from the bedroom. The whole hotel was very clean, with maid service everyday cleaning the rooms. Bathroom towels are replaced as and when you want them like most hotels and only soap is provided, so toiletries are required. Regarding electrical sockets as previously mentioned, there was one socket in the bathroom and one where the television is plugged in. However, the television is placed high on the wall towards the ceiling so the plug is not very accessible. The rooms do not have safes unfortunately, and we did have some doubts about the safety of our personal belongings, however we experienced no problems in leaving things in the hotel or out and about this large city. We did not have to pay for our accommodation until we departed and the hotel sells hot/cold drinks for 1 Euro 30 cents which are added to your bill and paid for on departure.

We too booked based on Tripadvisor reviews so I thought I'd try to add my own review as well. We took the train with Europass and it was good for the train that brought us right to Plaza de Catalunya. We had to show them our Eurorail pass and they told us the platform to go to. It really was the metro I guess. Then when we got off we had to show the tickets to get a card to let us out. So no worries. We took the one out to the right but the left exit there is an escalator up so if you have bags take the time to find it. Both exits are exactly across the street from the hotel. What could be better? The hotel is on the third floor and we had room 403 which overlooks the plaza. Twin beds and they were comfortable enough but not great of course. But they DID have A/C. You have to ask them to turn it on in your room - but it worked GREAT!!! What a surprise after five star hotels with little or no A/C since it is Fall now. Go figure. The tour buses are right outside your door on the Plaza and we bought 2 day tickets for Bus Turistic. There is also Barcelona Tours but for some reason they were empty and ours was always full. They don't go as many places. The green line didn't run since it was October but theRed and blue line worked great. Just covers so MUCH space it can be daunting to ride for one hour just to get to themuseum you want to visit. But well worth the E26 we spent for two days. Hard Rock Cafe is across the square and hate to admit we ate there but we did. Haven't found any great restaurants yet (one more night to try). We are doing the Flamenco show tonight and will post separately on that. Getting to the Ginebra Hotel is EASY as pie (the airport bus also dropsoff in the Plaza - and picks up too). Even with luggage it was good. There is an elevator at the hotel that is larger than I expected. We fit with our luggage easily with room to spare. They do sell water, coke and beer for very cheap at the hotel (E1.2 - OMG that seems cheap now!). The hotel was clean, clean, clean!!! A walk down La Ramblas is really an easy walk. Just walk straight down and ythen to the left at the harbor and you are at the beach! We did take a break near the port and I laid down using my purse as a pillow. My sister wasn't paying attention to her purse for a moment and a guy came up and snatched it right up. I sat up right when he did it and yelled her name. He dropped it immediately and walked slowly to his bike and took off while the Spanish folks around screamed at him. They came over and reminded us to be careful. SO BE CAREFUL! She had her passport in that purse! Yikes! Enjoy Barcelona and we highly recommend Ginebra as an inexpensive great location. Bring your own shampoo and toiletries. If you need fancy - don't stay here. Our bathroom was spotless with a shower, toilet, sink and bedet.

Infact when we arrived there all was exactly as said: central location, easy access from/to the Airport, etc. It\u2019s also very safe because it\u2019s on the third floor of a building so people must go thru a doormen at the entrance, and then thru the hotel receptionist who\u2019s always there 24h day. Also friendly staff (they don\u2019t speak English though); we had a late night departure flight, and they kept custody of our bags all day long. So I just want to add a couple of tips: Noise \u2013 yes\u2026 but from the inside! Outside traffic noise is well stopped by the windows, while inside walls and doors are very thin, so people arriving and talking late at night can be disturbing. Anyway there are only few rooms, so there isn\u2019t much back & forth. But if you want to avoid an irritating night awakening, ear plugs are definitely suggested. Beds \u2013 definitely not the best bed I have ever slept in\u2026. if you are a couple you may want to chose separate beds, because they are REALLY small and two persons can barely spin! Eventually considering the room rates, it\u2019s the best solution you can find in Barcelona, and if yours is a short getaway that is the best solution.

I would recomend you take the elevator up as it seemed to be more than three floors if you walk up. The rooms are very clean but small and rather basic. Most of the rooms look over the plaza but they do have a room that has no view and is very quiet. The walls are not the thickest but with only 10 rooms there is never much going on outside the room. The staff do not speak much english, so dont expect any recomendations for restaurants, but they are nice and did try to recomend a restaurant but it was lost in translation. They do have a communal room with a larger tv and large table that could be nice for a larger group to play cards or have a nightcap. I never saw it being used except for guests who left luggage in the room after they checked out so they did not have to carry it around on their last day. They also sold beer, soda, water, etc... for 1.50 euros which is quite reasonable for a hotel. Booking the rooom requires you to search for the hotel website on google and to email them direct. They got back to me the next day and confirmed a single was availble for 40 euros a night. I cannot see staying anywhere else as the room is just for sleeping and the price cannot be beat. Also, the hotel and room were cleaner than about any other hotel I have ever stayed in and if ther housekeeping was very good.
