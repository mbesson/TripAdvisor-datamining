Camping in the desert near Moab Utah in July was hotter. However, these are the warmest nights I've ever experienced in a $100+ hotel. Sleeping under the stars in the Utah desert was cheapet (ie free) and more pleasant because the night breezes blew. Sadly the two small windows in my apartment appear to have a combined opening of about 1 sq meter and don't seem to catch the sea breeze very well. Might be ok in the spring, fall or winter. And might be ok in the summer for < $20 Canadian.

An added bonus is you can meet new people who are also staying at the residence with you. I came here to attend school and loved it. I will most certainly be back again.

Ended up upgrading to Gage Apartments for a studio suite as the walls for the dorms at Pacific Spirit were paper thin and the mens bathroom was on a floor above or below me. if I had to do it again, would have just stayed at my downtown hotel for a third night and taken a bus to visit the campus and parks Pros for Gage Towers: - Right on campus - Kitchenette (fully stocked with plates/utensils/cooking equipment) - Towels and soap provided in rooms - Free breakfast at the Student Union across the street Cons: - No air conditioning - Can easily find comparable or lower rates at other places around town and easily drive or bus to campus. - Nothing going on around the entire area. Campus is dead during the summer as to be expected but the surrounding area is also COMPLETELY DEAD. From my experience on other large campuses there is usually a little neighborhood with restaurants and bars that is active year round. There is an off campus area called University Place but literally the only place that was open at 8pm on a Saturday was McDonald's.

They turned the heat to around 35 degrees but there was no air conditioning at all! You could literally suffocate if you don't open your window at night (which turned out it was also raining outside, the room became damp and hot). Ever since it's not even a hotel, you can't expect they have great facilities like you name them. Everything from bed to desks are pretty much like they have been using them since the 1970s. I am 6'1 and I had a bit problem with fitting the bed. Maybe because I stayed during the school period, the hallway got pretty noisy at night when some students came back from pubs (I couldn't fall in sleep during the second night). Overall it's just like staying in a low end hotel in third world countries like Vietnam, China, or India. However the only good thing is in Vancouver you can't find bugs in winter.

First night we were on a ground level 2 bedroom suite...a stones throw from all the action but didn't hear peep all night. Rooms were clean, nice, comfortable. Housekeeping knocked around 10 am but we weren't ready to leave yet. Being ground level during summer it was nice to find the room refreshingly COOL. Nicely decorated, comfortable beds, bedding etc. The next morning we decided to stay another night and were lucky enough to get a suite in the Gage apartments (across from the main building). Got a one bedroom. Big comfy bed/bedding, a pull out in the livingroom. Ceiling fan in the bedroom, large flatscreen tv in livingroom, great view. Clean, tidy, nicely furnished. Quite a deal, both rooms! (same price). Staff were great. Starbucks coffee in both rooms. Kitchen was spotless, bathroom same. A REALLY good deal considering all other hotels are soooo far away! Am DEFINITELY staying there again. Would highly recommend. THE ONLY thing is that the 1 Bd. in Gage Apartments had windows that opened wide which was awesome for breeze but not good for YOUNG kids. Generally I'd recommend for both short AND long visits...lots of storage space, complete kitchens (with cutlery) in both, just very nice in general and nicer than some more expensive hotels i've stayed in.

It is not a hotel, it doesn't even have air in the room. When we called the operator about the temp in the room, we were told to use a fan from the closet and open the window. For $245 a night, I think having air conditioning is not too much to ask. Then when we asked about the pool, we were told there is an extra charge of $6 per person to use the pool each time. The size of the bathroom is so small and there is no tub. When you shower, you better stood still and not move around because you will bump into the walls. The staffs at the conference services were a nightmare to work with. We have attended many meetings in the states and in Europe and never had an experience as bad as this one.

Please note that this place only functions as a \"sort of hotel\" in the summer, the rest of the year it is one of the UBC student dorms. The room featured ugly-functional dorm furniture (to be expected) and a kitchenette. It smelled of mildew and rotting carpet. In no way did we expect Ritz-Carlton surroundings, but the one thing that struck us is the lack of the most basic hotel-like services, such as turning the room over daily, taking out the garbage and providing towels. Some days they did all of these things, some days they brought more towels but didn't bother making the bed or taking out the garbage, and some days they didn't come at all. With a 14 month old boy in tow, you can imagine the pile up of diapers. This is a basic service even the most seedy motel could be expected to provide, yet we had to call and ask for our room to be turned over, and for extra towels to be provided. One day I called to ask for some more towels to be brought to our room, and the \"front desk\" told me that due to lack of staff, I would have to come down and get it myself! My wife's mom was staying in an adjacent room, and actually had a squirrel sneak into her room and steal some nuts from a bag! Although it's understandable you can't always control animals, the (ahem) \"front desk\" told her \"not to worry as the squirrels are tame from all the people feeding them\"! They agreed to assign her another room, but when she unlocked the door she found someone else inside! They had assigned her a room that was already occupied. I would not recommend staying here as Gage Towers does not understand the difference between providing a dorm room for students, and a hotel room for paying customers. Although definitely affordable, Im sure you could find equally priced accomodations that at least provide the most basic hotel services. I definitely do not recommend this place for anyone with young children. The floor is concrete under the carpet, the windows open widely enough for a child to fall out, and there is no bathtub. On the positive - strong wireless internet signal (although was charged an extra $10)", "Date": "August 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coleraine, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood no frills stay in a great location\u201d", "Author": "rachm77", "ReviewID": "UR15075997", "Content": "We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment in for 5 nights and found little to complain about. This is not a hotel, and contrary to previous reviews, I don't believe it is advertised as such. We booked through the UBC website, and as we had looked at photos etc, knew what to expect - which is why we were pleased with our stay. I can understand someone who expected hotel service being disappointed. The apartment itself was quite spacious - both bedrooms were large and had ample storage space. We had the biggest room and our 15 month old the 2nd bedroom, a travel cot was supplied for our son. The kitchen had a full size fridge/freezer, the cupboards were well stocked and the the basket with Starbucks coffee was restocked daily. The bathroom was a little strange, or, to be more specific, the shower was like something from Star Trek/ a caravan - hard to describe! It did the job though, with plenty of hot water. The whole apartment was clean and was serviced daily. The staff at the main desk were helpful and courteous. We had chosen to stay on the UBC campus as we wanted to be close to friends who live there, but I think the location also has a lot to offer. We enjoyed exploring the Japanese gardens, the nearby beaches, places to eat etc. It was also good to be fairly close to both Kitsilano and the airport.

The prices were modest both times. The tower was cramped with basic furnishings and little closet space--basic by hotel standards--several individual bedrooms led to a common kitchen and a common bathroom area. The bathrooms were kept immaculate--the kitchens were not (btw, there was a small grocery store in the Commons). So, unless you know your roommates and their habits, you might want to eat out. The Student Union restuarants nearby are open all year round. The apartments were basic, also. They had phone service that allowed one to record a personal greeting and take voicemail, kitchenettes, large bathrooms, and slender twin beds. *Very* European. My apartment had a large carpet stain but was otherwise immaculate. Furnishings were basic, like in the towers. Walk to the bus terminal beside the swimming arena, and connect to virtually every point in the city and suburbs; bus passes were sold at the Student Union news stand. Desk clerks were graduate students in uniform, and none would win awards for personality. Yes, I would stay there again.
