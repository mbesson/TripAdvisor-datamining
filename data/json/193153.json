This hotel was what it sys it is, and just satisfied us for a small room, fairly decetly priced, with no frills. Not happy that all we had in room 306 was hot water in teh toilet sink, absolutly no cold water whatsoever. For cold drinking water one has to request a jug of it or buy in bottled water. mind you I am no lover of Londons 'hard' water anyway so try to avoid drinking it from a tap anyway. All in all, a good clean room, good service, a really decent breakfast the next morning with plenty of choice. Staff were friendly. Check in and check out was rapid, no problems whatsoever.

Even boiling it produced rather grim tasting tea that didn't make me feel so good. In fact, in a bored moment, I read from the folder in the room that no one ever reads, and it is stated there that guests shouldn't drink the tap water and should either buy bottled water or ask reception to bring a jug of drinking water to their room! If this were the only problem here, it wouldn't be so bad. There is next to no tv reception on the next-to-knackered tiny portable televisions that were possibly bought 25 years ago, the shower (where you just about break your neck coming out of it as the shower, toilet and sink are all rammed into a tiny room) hardly worked, starting warm then cold then warm then cold then off, the heating wasn't working, you can hear just about any noise outside the room as the walls are thin, the bed just about had the springs coming out of the mattress, the breakfast was very basic, with the coffee unpalatable, and the whole place was soulless and more like a poor bed and breakfast place than a branded hotel. I haven't stayed in a Best Western hotel before, but I'll avoid them like the plague in future.

When we brought this to the attention of the manager, she came to the room explaining you need to let it run for several minutes until you get cold water . . . What a waste! Just when you think you have the right temperature, it turned hot again. Miserable! The room was also not clean. Someone left behind hair and there were dead bugs. If you think you can use the phone to call the front desk, think again. There was a \"reception desk\" button, but it just rang. I went in person to the front desk and was told you are not supposed to use that button, dial \"0\". Back to the room, dialed \"0\" and that did not work either. Don't believe the online information saying they are multilingual. An Italian gentleman staying there came to the front desk trying to ask questions, and the clerk shrugged his shoulders. While I don't speak Italian either, I did hear pizzeria in his question. With no knowledge of Italian, I was able to assist by saying \"Pizzeria\" and pointing in the direction down the street. On another occasion, I asked if there was a phone book so we could find a French or German restaurant. After checking around, he said they must have thrown out the phone books. He then proceeded to call friends so they could find one. He did tell me there was a French restaurant 3 blocks away, but said we would not want to do there because it is too expensive. Since we knew we could not depend on his advice, we went anyway and had a wonderful meal. And the price was reasonable.

Location is excellent. Turn left outside the hotel and at the end of the road turn left and you will see Pimlico underground station. Its less than a 5 min walk and we felt a lot safer only having to walk that small amount on the way back at night after a show. Otherwise Victoria is about 10/15 min walk. There is a little shop at the end of the street, not too bad prices. Otherwise in Victoria there is tescos and sainsburys. There are also many places to eat in the area. Reception staff always welcoming and friendly. There is a small lift. In the rooms there is a hairdryer (found in a cupboard). You are supplied with toiletries i.e. soap, shampoo, shower gel, tissues etc. The towels are a bit on the small side. The double bed is also a bit small but comfy enough. You get hot drink facilities and we got two packs on biscuits when we arrived. Bathroom is also a good size in comparison with other hotels in the area. Shower has its own cubicle. Only one small complaint was the shower wasn't very powerful. The rooms are quite hot as well. There is a radiator in the rooms if it gets chilly. Old style TVs, not very good reception but you don't go to watch TV. You can also connect to their internet as they supply ethernet cables at reception. Room service is available, didn't try any so can't comment on the food, but it cost \u00a31.50 to get it. Clean towels everyday, room spotless. There is street noise as it is a busy road and during the night there are a lot of sirens and road noise, but that shouldn't put you off. The breakfast room is much better than other hotels in Victoria. Usually they are so crammed in it is ridiculous, but this has two rooms for the space of about 25 people. The staff are very polite and attentive and pour your hot drinks and bring you toast. All the jams, butters and cutlery are already on the table which is convenient. The orange and cranberry juice tasted a little odd but bare able. There is fruit, cold meats, cereals, croissants etc. All expected of continental.

I needed a ironing board and iron on my first evening. The iron was fine but the board had seen better days.

First, the pros. The location could not be better. Absolutely superb. It's about a block away from the Pimlico Tube station, which is a few short stops from everything you'll want to see in London. It's in a nice, safe, residential neighborhood w/ several pubs and convenience stores, plus an internet cafe. The service is good too. The front desk staff is nice and helpful. They gave us a map that gave us discounts to lots of stuff, which they didn't have to do. The rooms are clean and the bathrooms are fine. A breakfast buffet is included w/ limited hours every morning. The food is standard fare, nothing fancy, but decent and nothing to complain about. Now, for the cons. This room is small. I mean, tiny! It's small by european hotel standards. There was literally no room for the suitcase on the floor. The double bed took up the entire room. There's no closet, just an open armoir. The bathroom door opens up toward the bed instead of near the doorway like most hotels. In fact, you cannot open the bathroom door all the way, b/c it hits the side of the bed. It's that small. Secondly, the amenities are quite lacking. They provided shampoo, but no conditioner. The hair dryer was not located in the bathroom, so it was two days before I found it. And when I did locate it, I found it to be damaged. There was no refrigerator or safe. There is also no room service. The bed in our room was very uncomfortable. Neither of us slept well the entire four nights we were there, and my spouse actually awoke in pain most mornings. But the biggest negative to this hotel for me would have to be that the walls in the rooms are painted ORANGE!!! I don't know what the management was thinking when they did that! It is nearly impossible to sleep well in a brightly painted orange room. I literally couldn't sleep w/o Benadryl. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this hotel. there are some positives, but they are unfortuantely outweighed by the negatives.

The breakfast room is not that big and you may need to wait a little before get a table. The location is great, walking distance from many places that one must see.

The room was small, placed on lower ground floor (I call that a cellar), but everything was clean, which was what we wanted in the first place.", "Date": "September 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aberdeen", "Title": "\u201cGive it a wide berth\u201d", "Author": "TETAberdeen", "ReviewID": "UR8877631", "Content": "Small and cramped is the best way to describe this hotel. I must have stayed somewhere different compared to the 'small and luxurious' hotel being described by some of the writers. The Receptionist on arrival was friendly and helpful. The Receptionist on departure asked 'which room' and 'enter you PIN'. No other words. The breakfast staff, of which there appeared to be 2 were incredibly busy - more on the food later, but didn't appear to be welcoming guests. The room - I booked a single as I was travelling alone. There must be bigger cells in HM Prisons as to the room I stayed in. The room was about the width of two and a half single beds and depth of one and a half. There were 3 windows. Two were incredibly small and the third had been painted over with black paint. The curtains were matching but one piece of fabric which didn't fully cover the window (although there was a cream coloured fabric covering the glass. I had to stand on the bed or the chair to see out of the window. The desk had 3 drawers, one of which had been removed. The bottom drawer held the kettle and cup, some tea, coffee etc. The hairdryer which was fixed was adequate but you had to hold your hand on the button to keep it going. At the bottom of the bed there was a wardrobe, with no door and a tray stand inside with a 14\" portable on top of the wardrobe. The ensuite consisted of a shower, toilet and wash-hand basin. Again it was incredibly small, room only to stand between the loo and shower. The towels were quite hard and seemed to be fairly old. The shower was hot with good pressure. The room was tidied and bed made but the linen on the bed wasn't changed though I did receive fresh towels. The selection from room service was disgraceful. 3 hot meals consisting of Tomato Soup, Lasagne and Cannonilli. The rest was sandwiches. The breakfast room was located in the basement of the building. It was filled to over flowing when I went down. I hovered for a bit before I was given a table. The breakfast consisted of orange and apple juice (glasses were slow in coming), cereal (4 types), fruit (4 types - one was prunes and another grapefruit), hard small rolls, croissants, ham and cheese. Tea and coffee. Toast came as I was leaving but no butter or jam. Another guest was put at my table as she was on her own also. It would have been nice to have been asked.

Americans used to the unlimited expanses of the great plains might find the compactness of the rooms at a moderately-priced big city hotel surprising, but as residents of New York City, we did not. If we were judging the Best Western Corona as a trendy luxury hotel for jetsetters, well...it's not, nor does it pretend to be. But by the typical and reasonable standards of this type of city hotel, the Corona came out well and gave us a pleasant stay. Here's our experience: We arrived late in the evening and at first were given a room on basement level -- this one *was* tiny, airless, and so close to the breakfast room that we feared excessive noise in the morning. Gentle reader, do remember: one doesn't have to accept the first room any hotel offers! We immediately asked for another room, which was cheerfully granted. The room we were given was on the 4th floor and actually had a lovely distant view of Big Ben, the London Eye and the Swiss Re building. It was small, but a bit bigger than the other one -- and those few extra square feet made all the difference. Like all hotels on Belgrave Road, the Best Western Corona is comprised of what were once Georgian houses, now connected as one structure. Although perfectly modernized, there's a bit of an old-timey hotel experience in staying in an antique building that is not made of concrete and steel. The neighborhood is wonderful; it's extremely safe, quiet, and pretty and mostly residential off Belgrave Road, yet has delightful restaurants and plenty of services tucked away nearby. (In our case, after two previous weeks of travel, we were happy to find the nearby laundrette!) The transportation options are excellent at all hours. The neighborhood is removed from the party crowd yet makes a lovely \"home base\" for touring London because the Pimlico tube stop is close by and you can easily zip to all the popular tourist sites of London very quickly. If you prefer to walk, you can even take a most pleasant stroll along the Thames to the Tate museum or to Westminster Abbey and Parliament. Buses too are frequent and taxis are easily hailed, or can be quickly called by the front desk. The hotel's rooms *are* small, but attractively furnished and well-maintained. Our room was spotlessly clean, and efficiently laid out: adequately comfortable for the typical needs of guests but definitely no standing room to host a crowd! Your luggage remains in view in a storage unit. There was a small desk that featured a free high speed internet connection (just ask at the front desk to switch it on). WiFi is available in the lobby. As is typical in the UK, there was also an electric kettle on a tray with coffee, tea, and biscuits. Our bed was comfortable -- we slept well -- and the linens were soft. The bathroom matched the small scale of the room, but was also comfortable -- we had enough towels and the shower was a nice size, with plenty of hot water too. There is no airconditioning, but the oscillating fan kept us comfortable, day or night, (and this was in August, with sunny warm days); our room faced the rear, which was absolutely quiet, so we kept the window open our entire stay and delighted in the view too. However, if there had been an outright heatwave, a fan alone might not have been enough. Breakfast was a simple delight. We never had to wait for a table, even when the hotel was full. On the buffet were peaches, stewed prunes, plain and strawberry yogurts, danish, croissants, wholewheat rolls, several cereals (including Special K), mueusli, ham, sliced cheese, cottage cheese, orange juice, apple juice, coffee and tea. Guests sit in an simple but attractive dining room at tables with tablecloths, and they then bring you a rack of warm toast (white or wholegrain) with butter and jams, plus they refill coffee and tea as you eat. We enjoyed meeting some of the other guests at breakfast too. The staff was friendly and helpful to us in all matters. There were complimentary newspapers and magazines (Men's Health, Reader's Digest, etc.) in the lobby too. We stored luggage for a few hours after we checked out, as we had some time before our flight, but I agree with another reviewer that it wasn't clear how much security was actually offered in doing this -- the closet seemed too accessible. There was no safe in the room, so we kept our passports on us at all times and we did take the precaution of deferring housekeeping services if our laptop had not been put away. But these precautions were based on our own travel smarts: there was nothing about the hotel staff that aroused any distrust. All in all, we left London congratulating ourselves on having made a wise hotel choice that, for London, was pleasant, clean, comfortable, and well-located without being tremendously costly.

The dining room is small and cramped and if you go at the wrong time you'll have to queue for a seat. If you aren't up for breakfast when it begins then you are unlikely to ever see the selection of foods on offer. This hotel does continental breakfasts only and the variety of food available is poor.
