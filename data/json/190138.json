Before we arrived, I was wary that the hotel was not central but the location was really perfect for us! I doubt that a central hotel would have offered half of what the Rome Cavalieri offers. The frequent (free) shuttle bus is great for central locations (it can be popular at certain times). Taxis are always available too. (Vatican City is around 15 minutes away & just over \u20ac10 in a taxi, Spanish Steps about 25 minutes in traffic.) When you've done with the sites, Rome Cavalieri is a perfect retreat! All of the staff are exceptional; customer service well beyond the extra mile. Nothing is too much trouble. The hotel is stunning! We had an Alcove suite which was gorgeous. House keeping were totally respectful & there are some lovely touches; menu for pillows, menu for soaps, an appropriate sized bathrobe for our daughter. This is one hotel where you'll never have to request extra towels, pillows etc as there are ample frequently provided. The bed was very comfortable. Our suite allowed access to the Imperial Lounge where food (delicious & lots of choice) & drink are available from 7am to 11pm. The lounge also offers computers (handy for printing your boarding cards for return flights) which are free of charge for the first 15 minutes. We also had free access to the spa/pool. The indoor pool is lovely & warm! Our 9 year old daughter was treated beautifully especially at the 3 star Michelin La Pergola restaurant. (Review to follow!) We pre-booked our table (& limousine airport transfers) before arrival. The only niggle (& it is minor) is the \u20ac9 per 24 hour WiFi charge. I would have liked this to be free given the price of the suite but a tiny grumble! My best tips; request a city view room when booking, pre-book La Pergola if you want a fine dining experience & pre-book limousine airport transfers. Finally, watch out for unscrupulous taxi drivers who might try to hike the price of your journey from the centre when you tell them which hotel you want to go to!", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "DeMotte, IN", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Property & Great Staff\u201d", "Author": "Steve S", "ReviewID": "UR127835885", "Content": "This was an amazing hotel, the best Hilton I have ever stayed at and I spend 140 nights a year in hotels.

This is not a inexpensive hotel but in terms of value you get what you pay for. Try to get a city view, when you open the balcony and hear the church bells you know you are in Rome. Take advantage of the shuttle, it is reliable and drops you at a good central location. Cabs are always available too and the doorman gives very good instructions to the drivers.

By American standards the room was large. The buffet breakfast has a fabulous assortment of food, fried eggs, scrambled, tons of pastries, wonderful bread, fresh fruit, and beverages. The staff were helpful, and more that willing to go out of their way to assist us. As Diamond members we have access to the executive lounge. At this hotel it is called, The Imperial Room, and this is a tremendous perk, open all day and serving food and drinks from 7:00 am until 10:30 pm. There is a shuttle bus from the hotel to the city. the one drawback is that you need to be at the shuttle return stop at least a half hour before the shuttle stops in the city to pick you up, because if it is full, you need to wait for an hour or take a taxi.

The hotel is just stunning, like a museum in itself. Service was also great. First warning I have has nothing to do with the hotel \u2013 but feel I should prepare people visiting, we were conned to get into a private car at the airport. We went into the taxi queue and were led by the \u2018supervisor\u2019 with ID into a car, we felt it was more upmarket car than the taxis we were expecting and queried the charge, we were reassured it was the standard charge. However upon arriving at our hotel we realised things were amiss as the taxi refused to pull up directly out front, he then demanded 180 Euros from us, we refused and after arguing left him the standard 50 and walked off. We were quite shaken up by this, so thought I should just warn any travellers. We travel a lot and were surprised we fell for this, but we are used to taxi queue supervisors in the UK. Back to the hotel, we had a lovely twin imperial room \u2013 as others have said, lovely large rooms with huge balconies\u2019. We had a city view which was just stunning. Only complaint about the room would be not being able to have access to an iron, having to use an ironing room felt a little more holiday inn than Waldorf!! The room was also very hot, there is not air con out of peak season so we had to sleep with balcony doors open. The beds were so comfy though...I had the best nights sleep! Use of the imperial lounge was great, one of the best lounges I have visited with a great selection of food and drink throughout the day. Only complaint about this would be needing to ask for a key to use the toilet!! Felt like I was at school having to ask for permission!! I would not expect this in such in hotel. Other complaint would be the clear signs stating you could not take drinks and then staff turning a blind eye to people taking full bottles of beer and water out and glasses of wine. When the lounge shut the one evening my mother had a third of a bottle of water left and went to take it out but we were stopped. I understand this is the rule, but it was annoying that it was clearly overlooked for some and then enforced with others, additionally we had been sat in the lounge all night and were taking a half consumed drink of water, rather than others who blatantly came in, selected a number of bottles and left!! We used the shuttle bus which was great. It was not very regular on Sundays though, so something to keep in mind if you visit on a weekend. We also used the pool, unfortunately most of the spa facilitates were shut, but the pool was lovely as were the changing rooms.

That might sound a lot but is DEFINITELY worth it when you see what they charge elsewhere in the hotel! Residents even pay for use of the pool and with juice at 15 Euros a pop the bill could mount up very quickly! By the time you've had a swim and a couple of drinks the Imperial surcharge has paid for itself. We spent many happy hours at various times of day taking in the view and enjoying some excellent wine and food. Breakfast was good but not great. The buffet really needs a station for eggs made to order as the omelettes and scrambled eggs were either tough or soggy and the fried eggs raw or over done.

Before we even arrived the concierge and duty manager were being incredibly helpful over email to arrange transfers from the airport and even a complimentary bottle of bubbly and chocolates on arrival. We met the duty manager Nicola on arrival and he personally checked us in, gave us a quick tour and took us to our room. He not only treated us in a very professional manner but also like we were people. He was genuinely interested in who we were and what we wanted to see and do in Rome. The room was fantastic and the view over Rome was beautiful. Very spacious and the sound proof door was a great touch. On the first night we were later arriving than expected and as the hotel is a way from Rome itself (Which is made very clear from the website and dealings with the hotel. You can't possibly be under the impression you could stroll into Rome so you can't hold that against them), the hotel happily phoned up the restaurant we were meant to me going to and altered our reservations for us. We ordered from the room service menu instead and although you are paying a premium for the room service you can't fault the service. The food was excellent and the staff incredibly helpful and friendly. Adriano on the concierge desk was so incredibly helpful in recommending restaurants that offered good vegetarian food, he also helped with Colosseum tickets, Vatican entry, maps and directions, good advice for sights to see, etc. He was a star and definitely made the trip easier and more relaxing for us. The imperial lounge was an excellent addition. If you were on the 7th/8th floors you could walk into the lounge, grab a drink and a nibble and sit and chill out. Whilst we were having a beer a few days into our trip, Nicola was walking past. He stopped in and just chatted with us as people. Asked us how we were enjoying Rome and again made us feel like guests not customers. We made good use of the shuttle service and spent our days sightseeing in Rome, catching the last bus back. If you miss it, then you're looking at 20euros for a taxi. Not too bad.

Our family spent 3 great nights at the Rome Cavalieri last week for our kids' spring break. My husband travels ALOT for work so we made use of his \"points\" and Diamond status to reserve 2 rooms for 3 nights. Both rooms had 2 beds that are larger than American twin beds but smaller than full-size or queen size. The beds were comfortable, the sheets were lovely, and the pillows worked for all of us. The balconies overlooking the City of Rome were an added bonus. The weather was beautiful and we left the balcony doors open for the fresh air (the A/C was not turned on yet). About the service: The management clearly promotes customer service as we were treated courteously and promptly by staff at the front desk, concierge, housekeeping, and the restaurant. I especially appreciated that we were not treated as \"less important\" guests because we used points instead of cash for our stay (that is not the case everywhere). The Concierge staff provided helpful suggestions when we decided to change our touring plans over a couple of days. We appreciated the shuttle service the hotel provides its guests. The shuttle ran every 30 minutes and takes you into the heart of Rome (near the seashell fountain -- see photo). You could also get a lift home from the drop-off spot in the late afternoons. A note: All the taxi drivers referred to the Cavalieri as \"the Hilton.\" The Waldorf Astoria brand has not been widely acknowledged yet. I printed out the hotel name, address, and telephone number and gave it to all family members. We handed the taxi drivers the paper and did not worry that our mispronunciation could lead us to an unintended destination. :) The breakfast buffet at L'Uliveto was impressive as seemingly every palate was contemplated: along with many dry cereals were 7 types of milk (cow, goat, soy, almond, rice, & two others), yogurts, smoothies, hot food items, wide variety of in season fruits, breads and danish, cheeses, cured meats, and Japanese breakfast items. I particularly liked the French green beens w/tomatoes - yes, for breakfast! The wait staff were quite busy removing plates and replenishing coffee and fresh orange juice, yet they were all friendly. We had access to the Imperial Club on the 7th floor because of my husband's Hilton status and it was a wonderful spot to drop in for a beverage and snack after walking for miles. For our last night, the kids (teens) wanted pizza but we didn't want to take a taxi back into the heart of the city. The concierge told us of a local restaurant within walking distance of the hotel. He called them and alerted them to our impending arrival and we set off on foot with a map. It was less than 10 minute walk through a neighborhood. The place was empty when we entered, and the staff did not appear to speak any English (and menu is in Italian only). Within 5 minutes, the place was packed with multi-generation families, a few couples, and a group of guys to watch the Milan v. Barcelona match. We were the only tourists. The food was great and the other diners were friendly to us. We spotted a local Gelateria and enjoyed it so much we went back the next day just before heading to the airport. Did I mention their art collection? It seems like all the wall decor has a rich story. It creates an environment that is luxurious yet livable.

We couldn't have been happier! The hotel is exquisite, the service was wonderful, and the views of Rome unparalleled! This was my 10 year old son's first trip to Europe and I wanted his trip to be memorable. Staying at the Cavalieri exceeded our expectations and contributed substantially to an outstanding trip to Rome! The only problem I have now is that my son thinks that all hotels in Europe are like the Cavalieri (I'm not sure how to break it to him that most hotels are not nearly as luxurious as the Cavalieri). The view from our room was phenomenal: Rome was laid out at our feet! My son loved the Imperial Lounge and delighted in the culinary treats that he could help himself to. The original artwork throughout the hotel is amazing: we downloaded podcasts from the Cavalieri website and enjoyed a self guided tour of the art pieces which was educational and a lot of fun. The pools are amazing, especially the Olympic sized one, and we enjoyed taking a dip after a day of touring. We also enjoyed walking around the expansive grounds--it's really like a wonderful park. Because the hotel is outside the city center and atop a hill, we relied predominantly on taxis to get into town. A few times we took the hotel's shuttle service which was fine, but generally we took taxis so that we weren't tied to the shuttle schedule. One really nice thing was that while we were there the Cavalieri participated in Earth Hour. On March 31st, from 8:30 - 9:30 p.m. the hotel turned off all non-essential lights and equipment. It was nice to know that they participated in this world-wide environmental event. The hotel spa was voted the best in all of Europe in 2011, and I enjoyed a wonderful massage there. Not only was the spa treatment itself lovely, the spa facilities are absolutely gorgeous! I can't recommend the Cavalieri highly enough.

Let me start out by saying that I am just a hard working guy from Florida that travels 200 days a year and normally would not stay at a 5 Star hotel that is $550.00 per night or more and I have only complained once during my entire time as Diamond status over 5 years. After 5 years of saving, a business associate and I used points that are from spending $214,000.00 on Amxp so our expectations were very high. The Cavalieri Hotel is very beautiful but very disappointing for us and definitely not worth the 81k points per night or equivalent of $550.00 per night, I researched on the internet (trip Advisor) and I reserved with a live Hilton reservationist the very best deluxe room, on the Imperial floor with the obvious recommended choice \u201cA deluxe room with Rome View\u201d but got the front of the hotel \u201ci.e. The Garden View\u201d (see photos) because they do not show many accurate pictures of that side on their web site. This Garden View is on a main road looking at the largest communication tower I have ever seen and the hotel entrance is noisy all night long. After 10 minutes in the room I complained about the a/c not working and I was told sorry with a laugh that \u201cSir it is in season only\u201d. I have lived in Florida for 30 years and use air conditioning every day, spoiled I guess. Unlike what the amenities posted on the web site which says \u201cair conditioning, climate control\u201d. The room was consistently warm. The management told me to leave the sliding door open and climate control was a cheap noisy Wal-Mart type fan. Unfortunately either way we got limited sleep. If we had a Rome view you could open sliding door without the noise but I never got that chance. Rome was unseasonably warm and beautiful to visit the Vatican, we even were lucky to be part of the crowd the Pope gave a blessing to in Vatican Square on Sunday. As a loyal Hilton Diamond member I made it clear to several employees at check in and the follow up call that I was not happy about not getting the room I reserved and it was hard for me to believe that I had no chance of an upgrade. I asked them to please let his manager know I was not satisfied, I never heard from anybody but they said at the desk that the hotel is sold out but every other employee I asked said 50-60% occupancy, I guess it is possible that all but 5% were looking at Rome 24/7 because they were not in the lounge, the pool or the lobby. The hotel was almost empty the entire 4 days and not sold out according all staff asked except front desk, I guess they could all have been wrong. My belief is that because we used the points and were not paying in Euro they denied an upgrade of any type. I am sure the Management will say that this is not so but I have stayed in many sold out hotels and this was empty. I want to compliment all the service staff they were excellent, but the front desk and management failed to even try to make this Diamond member happy on probably what will be once in a lifetime trip to Rome. If you do stay here confirm in writing a \u201cA deluxe room with Rome View\u201d or you will be very disappointed. I would look closer to the city we saw some magnificent hotels, The Majestic, St. Regis (see Trip Advisor) and stay away from The Cavalieri.

Get a room with a view (we were in room 657- odd numbers have a city view). Other reviewers complained about noise, but we didn't have any problems. We could hear our upstairs neighbors every once in a while (especially out on the balcony) but nothing ever really bothered us. We even quit using the sound proof door on the second night. The shuttle: what a great service! Always on time (the 8:30am shuttle takes longer because of traffice, so we started to go on the 9:30 one). We stayed the first night at the Rome Hilton Airport and took their free shuttle to the city, walked about 20 mins to the Cavalieri's shuttle bus. Thanks to other reviewers we looked for the \"The Big Shell\" on the corner. It was very easy to find and the shuttle bus picks up just steps from the shell fountain (there were always a few cars or scooters parked right there). Make sure you plan around the lunch break... You have to catch it at 1 or not again until 4. Breakfast: Incredible. If you can't find something you like you're in trouble. The fresh fruit, muffins, and fresh bread with all sorts of fun jam flavors were my favorites. Pool: As other reviewers have mentioned it is a clean pool. You have to shower before getting in and wear a swim cap. It's a beautiful pool, but it wasnt quite warm enough for my liking, so we only went once. Getting around: The only money we spent on transportation was our taxi ride to the airport. We did everything with the hotel shuttle and walked EVERYWHERE! I'd fully planned on using the metro, but we had so much fun walking through the small back streets there was no need for the metro or taxis. This is the most amazing hotel, incredible staff, and the BEST view in all of Rome! I dream of the day I get to return!", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norway", "Title": "\u201cBest hotel in the eternal city\u201d", "Author": "HeavyTravel", "ReviewID": "UR125616302", "Content": "Visited this fantastic hotel with my parents and family for the first time in 2004. Since then my parents have wanted to go back to see if it would be as good as the first time. I have been back in the Cavalieri every year between 2004 and 2011, and consider my self a regular guest. I usually stay at the Imperial Floor, because of the excellent quiet lounge with very nice staff. This time we stayed in a suite, and my parents loved everything from the extremely comfortable bed in the bedroom to the elegant marble bathroom. We had more than enough space for 3 persons, I had an extra bed in the living room. But I would prefer a higher floor than 3rd to have a better view from the balconies. The art galleries in the hotel are really impressive and we spent hours admiring the lovely paintings and other pieces. We enjoyed the huge breakfast buffet in l\u2019Ulvieto Restaurant and some tasty bites in the Imperial Lounge. For dinner we went to the local restaurant \u201cda Luiciano\u201d in the neighbourhood. The owner and his family provides good Italian food and wine, and the 10 minutes walk to the restaurant and back gives some fresh air before a night cup in the Imperial lounge by the end of the day. All members of staff are really nice and provide the best service. The first night we asked the duty manager for help, because my parents prefer the duvet cover \u201cGerman style\u201d which means two separate covers in the king bed. Everything was sorted out to our greatest satisfaction and Mr. Khaled was very accommodating and showed the greatest hospitality. Overall the hotel services and facilities exceeded our expectations, and my parents hope they will be able to return to Cavalieri and Rome one more time.

Fortunately we had just enough change to pay for the taxi to the hotel \u2013 around 13 Euros and were warmly welcomed by the reception staff (Aurelio, Francesca and Lora) who were wonderful in helping to block my credit cards and providing the use of a phone to order new cards. American Express arranged for a new card to be printed and replacement cash to be available for collection at their office in Piazza Di Spania. While I dealt with the theft Aurelio checked my wife in and after a coffee and snack in the Imperial Club Aurelio escorted us as translator to the local Police station where a pleasant police officer took down the details of the theft and provided the necessary insurance form. This behind us we looked forward to 4 days in Rome. We had a room on the 4th floor with a beautiful view of the hotel pools and Rome where you could make out in the distance the Coliseum, the Pantheon and St Peters Basilica etc. This must be one of the world\u2019s best hotel views. The bathroom is luxuriously appointed if not large and has nice Salvatore Ferragamo toiletries. As a Hhonors Diamond member and booked via American Express Fine Hotels and Resort Program we had free access to the Imperial Club and the Spa, free breakfast for two, free wifi, 4pm late check-out, and 85 Euros food and beverage credit (the hotel said this has now changed to a Spa credit but as American Express said it was food and beverage the hotel obligingly accepted this). The hotel is beautiful and lives up to the photo\u2019s on the website. It is immaculately presented and cleanliness and hygiene are obvious. The indoor pool is warm and hygiene is strictly while pleasantly enforced. The sauna, steam room and Jacuzzi are great after a day of sightseeing. The hotel bus takes about 20 minutes to get to Piazza Barberini which is quite close to the Spanish Steps and the Trevi fountain. In fact the sights of Rome are all easily walkable. We could choose to take breakfast in the Imperial Club or the L'Uliveto restaurant. Although we could get everything we wanted in the Imperial club we chose to eat breakfast in the restaurant which had a tremendous range of high quality and extremely tasty food although no live cooking station. The Imperial Club is the best executive lounge we have visited with complimentary light lunches, afternoon tea, evening snacks and a wide selection of alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks. While we could easily have managed to eat only at the Imperial Club we forced ourselves to take dinner at L'Uliveto restaurant. Luckily we chose to take only one course as the steaks were huge and while we waited we were served bread and olive oil and a chef\u2019s taster followed by a selection of mini deserts. The staff throughout the hotel are excellent \u2013 friendly and efficient and they added greatly to a fantastic city break.

The breakfast spread the next morning, too, was beyond compare, one of the best Hilton breakfast's I've ever had. My only quibble with the hotel is the, perhaps, assumption that I was American. I am Australian. A large aspect of the hotel seems to be to present things in an American style not an Italian one. After arriving I ordered a vegetable focaccia, what arrived was more akin to a McDonald's hamburger, complete with fries and Heinz sauce! I was quite offended, it was not a focaccia at all, and to be honest the fries would have been better at a McDonalds... The next morning when I ordered a coffee with breakfast the assumption was I wanted an American latte, no! I had just spent 3 weeks ordering coffee and getting exactly what I wanted, short black ristretti. Not this American milky stuff!

The most expensive taxi we caught was when we had to go the least distance - from the Vatican up the hill to the hotel (around $20). Otherwise, it ranged from $7 - $15. The shuttle into the city was helpful in alleviating costs and dropped off a short walk from the top of the Spanish steps. The only con is the location, but we knew that it was outside the city center by doing research ahead of time and this didn't bother us. However, there aren't many restaurants around the hotel so you will need to either eat at the hotel, which can be pricey, or take a taxi down the hill if you are looking for a larger selection.

The staff at this hotel is so attentive and welcoming (The only other place I've ever received this type of service was in the Hawaiian Islands). Polite, professional and willing to assist you with just about any request. Our room was tastefully decorated, an excellent size and the room was cleaned on a prompt and daily basis (Turn down service is always a nice touch). We stayed on the Imperial Floor which comes with its own express elevator service and the fabulous Imperial Club that offers an array of beverages, snacks and other delicacies (Staying on the Imperial floor grants you daily access to the spa and gym. I highly reccomend the hot stone massage. It's worth the 120 euros). Another nice touch is the shuttle service which will drop you off close to the Vatican Museum (five minute walk) or at Piazza Barberini which is close to the Spanish Steps. The shuttle only runs until 8pm and is great especially since the hotel is quite far off the beaten track and is not close to a metro (Depending on the day and where you are going, a cab can be expensive and nothing is in walking distance). Finally, you MUST dine at La Pergola, it is truly an experience (Gentlemen, make sure you wear a jacket!).

While my husband attended a conference, my son and I saw the sights in the mornings and returned to nap and eat in the afternoon. First things first- the big advantage to the hotel is that it has large and modern rooms and is a purpose built hotel. If you do not enjoy charming European hotels that have been creatively carved from houses and have quirky layouts like bathrooms you have to climb stairs to reach or closets whose doors need to be closed to access the bed, then this place will suit you. Rooms are spacious (500+ sq ft) with a desk and a small sitting area as well as a balcony. There was plenty of room for my son's crib and room for him to play. The bathrooms are also large and modern. The rooms were also soundproof which was nice. The hotel is located on a hill to the west of central Rome- it was about a 15-20 min taxi ride to attractions such as the Spanish steps and pantheon and a 10-15 min taxi ride to the Vatican. For some visitors, the point of their trip is to immerse themselves in the culture and stay in central Rome, but as a repeat visitor with a toddler, it was glorious to see the sights in the mornings and then return to a large comfortable room with room service, gardens and paths to run around on, and a quiet place to nap. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful and include 2 outdoor pools, a large garden with running path, huge stone lions that my son loved, as well as a roof terrace with great views. There is also a weekend kids activity room with bouncy castle that my son was a bit too young for. Service was friendly and prompt- I often preordered room service lunch before I left in the mornings so that it would be there right as we returned and the staff were happy to oblige. Dining options were plentiful and they also catered to dietary restrictions. Overall, this is a great base for families with young children to stay while seeing Rome. Having travelled frequently with our young child, we have found that we spend far more time at our hotel than we would otherwise, so we like to find places with more amenities and service and travel further to the sights. For families with older childrens or couples on a getaway, I would advise them to stay closer to attractions and at a place with more character and charm.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "azzano", "Title": "\u201cWhy so expensive extras?\u201d", "Author": "sommo_vate", "ReviewID": "UR123541111", "Content": "Wonderful location (but far from downtown), large rooms with balcony, very comfortable beds, everything really luxurious...

It was a great splurge for us since we got to stay on points. With her diamond level status, they treated us exceptionally well and gave us a huge suite to die for, with a commanding view of Rome that was just stunning. Since this hotel sits on a hill on the west side of rome, it has some beutiful views of downtown Rome and the Vatican / St Peters in particular. I will admit this is probably nicer than most places that we stay when we are picking up the bill ourselves. While over the top nice in many areas, I am not sure I would stay here if I was picking up the bill, for several reasons including costs and a few of the downsides that I will mention later. I do have to give you the caveat on our fantastic room, that not all the room are going to have that great view, and certainly not all of them are two room suites. We were all the way at the end of the hallway on one side, and that was probably the best view in the hotel, except for any rooms above it. I have seen others reviews that have stayed here on points that have a view of nothing but the huge antenna that is next to the hotel, or a look into the residental neighborhood that this is located in. I think you would have to have a room on one of the upper floors (probably 3 or above) (I believe we were on 5th floor [6th floor to americans]) to be able to see over the trees to get that great view of Rome even if you have one that points in the correct direction. Another plus for those with status in Hilton properties is the Executive Lounge access where they have (complimentary) available various wines, Prosecco, soft drinks, coffee and light snacks. Also a nice place to get to know the other people in the hotel if you are feeling social, we had some interesting conversations with some of the other guests and found all but one were staying there on points as well (the one only had enough points for one night and had to pay for the remaining). We had the breakfast buffet included in our room and it was nice to be able to eat there for free. The buffet was a bit over the top with all the things that were available, so feel free to make yourself an american style breakfast, or an asian style breakfast, or a European style breakfast it was all there. But its still a buffet, so that means runny scrambled eggs every morning as well. I heard the buffet was actually outrageously expensive (like 35Euro?) and if it wasn't included in the room, I would have caught the shuttle into town and found a nice local place instead. While this place was over the top fabulous in many ways, I also have to mention the downsides as well. It is located on a hill in a residential area of Rome, it isn't really within walking distance of anything significant although I did see a few people that did manage to find a resteraunt or two resteraunts within walking distance although they must have really had to search that out and get directions since nothing was obvious from where I stood. They have a shuttle that will pick up you when you arrive in rome if you take the subway to a particular stop. Although you have to know what corner to be on, as thier direction said there would be a sign there, and there isn't (Tip: Its the corner with the huge sea shell, you will see it when you get there). The shuttle has a big gap in the afternoon when it doesn't run, and only runs to about 8pm. So the shuttle was nice to ride into town in the morning, and we would sometimes catch it back in the evening, and then head back out on one of the last shuttle to do things around Rome, and count on having to pay for a taxi back that evening. The shuttle driver was very accomidating and allowed us to hope off the shuttle when we were close to something we wanted to see, or one time we jumped off when traffic was too messed up due to a protest parade ahead of us. You would have to be a masochist to want to drive your own car while staying in Rome if you are not from there. Tip for riding in taxis, look out the side windows and enjoy the tour. Don't look forward, you will probably see things that you really don't want to see, and raise your blood pressure. Also at night most of the cab drivers will want a negotiated fare rather than run the meter. Agree before you get in the cab. If you are concerned that they are going to try to rip you off, check with the concier for approximate rates of what it should cost you to get from place to place in the taxi. Keep in mind they have different rates if its at night or you have luggage, or a bunch of people. Also the hotel is west-north-west of most of the attractions, except the vatican which it is about due south from the hotel, but because of the hill there isn't exactly a straight shot. The shuttle drops you off sort of north and east of most of the attractions, and the subway doesn't have particularly good coverage in rome (they are adding a new line that will help in a couple of years). So we ended up walking alot which we enjoy, and also taking alot more taxi's than we were use to, so be sure to budget for taking a taxi ride or two just about every day even if you use the shuttle and subway. Normally I would prefer to stay in something a bit more in the center of things and wouldn't have minded not having the luxury that you get here. Although I must admit, the tourist sites of rome are very spread out, and many of them don't have hotels near them. So I think you will end up walking more than usual, and using more taxis reguardless of where you stay. But this hotel is very isolated, if you get stuck here at night and don't want to grab a taxi to head down into town and back and eat at the resteraunt, it think one of the cheapest items on the menu is a cheeseburger at 28 Euro. I don't mind spending money on a nice dinner, but I'd rather be spending it in town at a resteraunt rather than the one in the hotel. It was probably also a shame that we didn't spend much time in the hotel, as we were trying to see as much of Rome as we could, and other than some nice time in the executive lounge, we didn't really get a chance to really take advantage of the spa and other nice things in the hotel. We meet one couple who was going to take a day off and just spend it in the spa while we were there, which we couldn't understand at the time, as you can spend time in a spa back home. Although this was somewhat early in our Italian trip, and after a few weeks, that taking a day off and being pampered in the spa started to look like a nice option. In the end, a fabulous stay, and we will probably be back but its because of points and status, if we were picking up the check, this place probably would have been above what we wanted to spend.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "nireland", "Title": "\u201cStunning Hotel\u201d", "Author": "samsneer", "ReviewID": "UR123305936", "Content": "Great hotel, a bit expensive for restaurant food.

The only con is that it is a 20-30 minute walk downhill to the city, BUT...there is a shuttle, and we did take advantage of that a couple times...but for the most part we just hopped in cab...wasn't too bad cost wise.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful, but the worst ripoff conceivable\u201d", "Author": "aeharbom", "ReviewID": "UR122995837", "Content": "My fiance and I stayed here at the end of a month long trip to Europe.

Additionally, the mattress in our room was hard as a rock and I ended up with pain in my back. I ordered room service on three different occasions. The first time, the food was delicious and great, but the second time (I ordered the same meal) it was completely different, and tasted bad. I had to complain repeatedly to get them to do anything about it. The hotel is undoubtedly beautiful, but after paying top dollar for a room, I found it frustrating that I then had to pay 15 Euro's for a gin and tonic at the pool bar and something like 8 Euro's to lay by the pool. As far as I am concerned, when you pay to stay at a hotel, having the right to lay by the pool is not something you ought to be asked to pay extra for. It wasn't even pleasant spending time in the hotel due to the incredibly snobbish atmosphere. My understanding is that most people stay here using Hilton reward points, and so I suppose if that is what you are doing, it is worth it, but otherwise I would say, don't bother with this hotel.

This Waldorf sits in a wooded area (amazingly, I didn't know one existed here) where on a clear day, from a superior room, you can see all of Roma. From the roof top, you can see snow capped mountains in winter and hear birds singing when you awake to relative quiet. Well, quiet Italian style anyway. Our superior room was well appointed and was a (requested) non-smoking one, surrounded by the same. But sadly smoking seems to be allowed on the balconies and even with our sliding glass door tightly shut, the smoke came pooring into our room somehow and lingered. The worst of it was we were in bed and it lingered around us. Since there is no forced air, we could do nothing but breathe the smoke coming from the next balcony. Obviously I could have called downstairs to deal with the smoking neighbors, or to move especially after the baby started crying in the other room next to ours (thus making our 1st night pretty unpleasant), but moving in the middle of the night or encoutering angry, smoking neighbors wasn't how we wanted our 1st night in Rome to come to a close. Thankfully, we awoke to a fantastic breakfast (don't miss it) downstairs that bowled us over and afterward a walk around the grounds. Only then were we convinced that this hotel was a great choice. The not so greats: while our room was very pleasantly appointed, part of the drapes were very rumpled and looked just out of the dryer which at this level of a hotel seemed way out of place. The carpet: while very pretty, worn in places. All in all, everything looked like it had had a quick daily once over, but had not been thoroughly cleaned to perfection for quite a while giving it a rather unpleasant \"occupied just the night before\" look, with its bed sheets hanging down over the bed skirt, soaps streaks coming from the shower down it's wall and so on. It was so noticeable I wondered if the room itself had been cleaned, but it had apparently. My conclusion is that while the property has a fantastic locale and I wouldn't move, the rooms need thorough going overs or the maid staff needs better managing and balcony smoking in non- smoking areas strictly forbidden. If one o the many managers I saw is reading this please lay in the bed/s in room 463 whil someone is soaking heavily on the balcony in room next door and smell what we breathed in while sleeping. There is a vent issue somewhere! Tips: room service, while costly, brings good food that will feed far more than you suspect it will. So plan to split everything. Never tip the person who brings your luggage before he brings you ice. Ours here pointed my husband to the ice machine down the hall after we gave him 5 euro. Shamefull. This hotel has ATMs and everything else under the sun and brings a wonderful respite from a very busy city. So off season and save.

When we arrived (with a three year old tired from a long drive from SW France in tow, our booking was not found on their system.

The reception staff said that we needed to get onto our email (by paying for it in reception area with) to access our booking (although we had given them our full printed out booking with reference numbers). Eventually they found us alternative accommodation. We were placed on a lower floor but still in our suite and a separate room for our teenage daughter. The room was freezing for three days (no heating due to renovations going on in the rooms surrounding us). We found half of the door staff unhelpful and did not help you from your car, open the door for clients, whilst half were really great. The concierge staff sent us to a day outing which was closed two hours drive away and then stated that there were no available tickets in all the city for a concert or opera at all (I got online and booked within ten minutes of speaking to them three tickets to the opera). The Christmas day childrens entertainment was a shambles....very late, lots of unhappy kids waiting around and no qualified staff on hand whatsoever. we were then informed we had to pay 35 euros for our son to attend the party which was an hour late although I had been told by reception that it was complimentary for our suite. The room service staff were in contrast excellent (we have a lot of room service with a three year old!) they were efficient, polite, truly 5* service each and every time we used them. There was one in particular who often came to our room who was a cut above everyone else there and should really run the whole establishment! It would then be efficient! In short, the hotel was great, the facilities excellent, great pool, spa, etc, but the hotel should really shake up all the staff.....get rid of half of them and keep hold of the gems. the staff really let the whole stay down.

We preferred Vespri Siciliani (I think that is how it was spelled) - the food was very good and reasonably priced. Everyone at the hotel spoke very good English as did most people in the restaurants - enough that we were able to communicate with no problem. We only used the hotel shuttle once to return from Rome - the other days we used cabs to Termini, the Vatican, and the Coliseum - we never had any problem with any of them trying to overcharge us, and all the drivers were all very nice. There is an ATM machine in the hotel off the lobby which was VERY convenient and we felt much safer using it than having to use one on the street in Rome where it was very crowded.

And what a great choice that was. I did upgrade to a small suite which was in hindsight an excellent idea. First of all the suite is wonderful. You have a dressing room that is almost a whole room by itself. An enormous bathroom with a \"soap menu\" just in case you're not satisfied by the anormous selection that's already there. A wonderful bed with a \"pillow menu\" with almost 10 types of additional pillow types that you can choose from. A large TV and a DVD player with a USB interface which - if you have a USB cable - you can watch your pictures from your digital camera on. Best of all, if you're in a junior suite or better, you have access to the \"Imperial club\" which is a lounge where you can have breakfast, lunch, dinner or a pre-bedtime drink and snack and that offers fantastic views over the city. The spa must be terrific too, it is rated one of the finest (if not the finest) hotel spas in Europe. I didn't have time to visit it though, and neither did I bring a bathing suit. Oh well. There's really just two \"issues\" with the hotel which are actually non-issues. The first one is that, well, you're in Rome. The hotel is so nice and fancy that it is really competing with the city for your valuable time there. You're really torn between hitting the city and \"just sleeping there\" (which would be a bit of a shame, given how wonderful the hotel is), or enjoying the hotel and cutting back on the wonderful sights of eternal Rome itself. In the end, do it like I did - mix the two, and you'll have the visit of your lifetime. The second minor \"issue\" is that you're a bit from Rome itself, which actually isn't a problem either. Taxis are relatively cheap (although they sometimes drive a few loops to bump up the fare), and there's a shuttle every hour (except unfortunately for the weekend, where there are some more gaps in between the shuttle services). From the hotel however you can walk over to the Vatican, and even to the city which makes for a very nice drawn-out walk (bring good shoes). The staff are wonderful, nothing is a problem, always attentive with a smile on their face. So... if you can afford it, stay there!

This means that it can become very costly travelling from the airport to the hotel and into/out of central Rome. They do have a shuttle bus which you must queue early for - we went on June which isn't really the peak season and sometimes we had to wait for the next one. On the first occasion the hotel paid for us to get a taxi with another couple as it was the last shuttle into town. The shuttle bus stops quite early on the way back to the hotel so you most definitely would need to pay for a taxi after an evening meal out / night out etc. I'm sorry but I can't remember the cost of the taxis! I don't think public transport is an option here and walking is a definitely no no.

Hotel's response? \"Sorry, you shouldn't have left luggage on the shuttle.\" \"It's Italy, you should've expected things to be stolen.\" When they called back to tell us they've researched this in detail and have exhausted all sources, we asked if they checked the security feed and they responded with, \"we are still working with Loss Prevention on that\". They protect their hotel like it's a rate jewel and treat their hotel guests like dirt. Oh, I should mention, each person we spoke with regarding this suggested that we got the items stolen from us while we were on our way to the train station. How did we know the shuttle driver stole our luggage? The netbook was inside a backpack, the charger was wrapped separately outside of the backpack, under a teeshirt, headsets were under other items in the luggage, also not in the backpack. Netbook with backpack was taken, charger was taken but the shirt it was under still remained in the luggage, and the headsets were missing from other areas of the luggage. Someone had to have opened our luggage and rummaged through it to know what to take... and the only time we didn't have the luggage with us by our sides that day was when we left them in the Rome Cavalieri shuttle for an hour. Diamond Card holders and Hilton Grand Vacations Club owners here. When we asked about the Imperial Floor upgrade, we got a \"sorry, no availability\". I said, \"I understand there may be a fee involved.\" The story then changed to, \"we can upgrade you tomorrow.\" We were in Venice for three days before staying in Rome for four. Our friends received our Venice postcards the day after our return to the States. Rome ones are still missing. It's been a week. I wouldn't be surprised if the concierge didn't mail those out. (Yes, we paid for \"stamps\".) We walked out of the elevator once with an older couple behind us, and the female manager walked right past us to greet the older couple. And take my word for it when I say the $250 USD spent on the brunch and $780 USD at La Pergola was SO NOT WORTH IT. Yes, those are prices for TWO people. Spa was under renovation, so only the sauna was available to us. We tipped like we normally would in the States, didn't ask for cleaning (though they still went into the room and cleaned, dunno why), and mostly didn't ask for any room service. I felt we were not difficult guests and we've stayed in enough Hiltons to believe it was the chain for us. After this experience, we're thinking about switching over to another hotel rewards program. We stayed at Rome Cavalieri for the peace of mind, but instead we brought home headaches.

We really like it due to the fantastic facilities and room size. We stayed here many times before in summer / this time was the first time in colder months and was slightly less exciting. here is why: 1. Rooms are very nice, modern and spacious but they are starting to have maintenance issues - our bathroom had quite strong toilet smell around the toilet. So you couldn't have a bath as all you'd have this unpleasant smell right in your face. 2. There was a bit of mould around the bath taps. 3. Service wasn't what we remembered - one of the waitresses was plain rude at breakfast which came as a shock at this usually very friendly hotel. 4. Dinner at the main restaurant is very bland without any atmosphere. In summer it is served on a pretty terrace outside but in colder months in a brightly lit room without any vibe. Food was also very plain and not exciting. 5. We went to the spa for couples massage, specifically requested double's room - they put us in a single room together and just added a very old shaky squeaky massage bed next to the permanent one. The bed squeaked every time the therapist touched me - which is all the time. Very unpleasant. That's enough with the negatives; on a positive side - 1. It has a great gym, better than most hotels / nice spa (unless you ask for a couple's room) / turkish baths / indoor poll - excellent! 2. Big rooms/ bathrooms 3. Great breakfast 4. Most importantly you can often get excellent prices in this hotel if you book in advance. All in all, we'll be back but it would be great if management could iron out a few of the above issues.

Room was spaciaous and clean a huge bed and lovely crabtree and Evelyn products in the bathroom, the room was faultless. Very Nice indeed. The shuttle into central Rome is definately needed it goes around every hour and without this service Im not sure we would have booked this hotel.

After asking the pool attendant what to do, he took us to the kids pool and bought us 2 sunloungers, after around an hour a huge inflatable slide was put up and obviously the kids loved it but was so noisy and not relaxing.

I felt really sorry for her though. Anyway the order was taken by a waiter including 2 drinks, the drinks never arrived though. Not the relaxing day we hoped for.

From the moment we arrived, we were taken care of by their superior staff. Everyone we came in contact with was friendly, helpful, and just very kind. Beyond that, the rooms have all sorts of extras that you won't commonly see in a hotel (power shade on the balcony windows/door to give complete privacy and keep out the morning sunlight, mirror that pulls out to become a soundproof door to keep sounds from the hallway out at night, your choice of pillow, etc., etc. The list goes on.) The breakfast buffet was the best we've ever had - 2 rooms of a large variety of wonderful food, including plenty of fresh fruit, a wonderful variety of breads with jams and honeys, amazing sausage, and many, many other items. We are Gold level Hilton Honors members, so the breakfast was free for us; I'm not sure what the regular price is, but regardless of what it was...it was wonderful and probably worth it at least once. The fitness center was fantastic (lots of machines), and the indoor pool wasn't large but is very nice and nice and warm. They also delivered a complimentary bottle of champagne to us for our celebration of our anniversay...which was a wonderful surprise/gesture. With the balcony over facing the sunset/city of Rome, it made for a very memorable/relaxing time. I could go on and on about the wonderful experience, but the bottom line is if you are looking for a relaxing oasis a bit outside of the action, this is a fantastic place to say. If you do splurge for the hotel or if you cash in on Hilton Honors points for a reward stay and are otherwise budget conscience, just note that again it is a bit outside of the heart of the action. The hotel offers a convenient, complimentary shuttle service. Currently the last shuttle back to the hotel leaves the city at 8 PM, so again just keep that in mind. It would be a shame if you didn't fully appreciate this hotel because it wasn't in the right location or the right situation for you. That being said, I understand that they may consider a later shuttle in the future, so check into that before making a final decision if you are concerned about the shuttle time. Also, if you are out past the shuttle's last run, or if you aren't near the pickup location, ask the hotel staff before you leave for the day for a current estimate of a taxi fare back to the hotel. I heard other guests say (and read on another site) that some taxi drivers take advantage of customers when they hear the words Waldor or Rome Cavalieri and charge a higher fare. In any case, this isn't uncommon among taxis in Rome - just make sure you know a fair price beforehand and negotiate a price before you get in the car.

We chose the hotel based on the suggestion of friends, who also highly recommended splurging for a room with access to the Imperial Club. As a result, we took advantage of Hilton\u2019s standby upgrade program (for a cost) and got upgraded to a room on the 7th floor with access to the lounge. The front desk representative who checked us in was friendly and professional. She gave us a thorough overview of all the amenities we could access with our Imperial Club room, unfortunately we didn\u2019t have time to enjoy all of those perks. In fact, all of the staff we encountered were extremely professional and efficient. We were pleased by the offerings in the Imperial Club. They had a nice breakfast of hot and cold items, light lunch (including a great pea soup!) and canap\u00e9s in the evening, as well as beer and wine throughout the day. The lounge didn\u2019t open until 7:00 a.m. which seems late, especially for a hotel that appears to cater to business people and conferences. Since we had a 7:00 airport pick up on our departure day it would have been nice to have had a cup of coffee before leaving. The view from the lounge was spectacular, especially as we enjoyed a glass of wine from one of the terrace tables at sunset. Our room was on the front side of the hotel (non-city-view side), and far enough down the hall that the satellite tower wasn\u2019t as bothersome as others have mentioned. We weren\u2019t looking directly at it. The room had a good amount of space with the seating area and terrace. We especially liked the size of the bathroom, having just come off a cruise where the bathroom in our suite was tight. My husband particularly liked the large flat-screen TV and the towel warmers in the bathroom. From the hotel we walked down the hill to a nice neighborhood restaurant (Ristorante Luciano) that was recommended by the concierge. That same area also had a small grocery store where we bought some wine and snacks. The hotel is in a quiet, residential area which for us was a nice change from the hustle and bustle of the city. Rome was very crowded when we were there, more so than I recall from a previous visit, making a quiet hotel and a walk-able, residential neighborhood that much more appealing. Our one difficulty was the temperature and lack of adequate climate control. The air conditioning in the room wasn\u2019t cool at all when we arrived. We were told it was because the week prior had been cold, so the hotel\u2019s climate control system had been switched from air conditioning to heat. We like it to be fairly cool when we sleep, especially in a bed with such luxurious linens & fluffy duvet. The days we were there it did get warm in the room during the afternoon. We opened the door to our terrace which helped, though first thing in the morning there was some noise from people arriving & departing at the hotel entrance. The second night we left our terrace door open when we went to dinner, only to have it closed by housekeeping during the turn-down service, so it was very warm when we returned. We called the front desk to see about getting a fan for the room, which was not possible. The hotel representative offered to refund some of our cost in compensation for the lack of climate control. We were very pleased with her offer (we had not asked for compensation) and felt the problem was dealt with as adequately and professionally as possible given no alternative to impact the climate control system.

A hamburger 28 WTF!?!, pizza margarita 25 etc. Order roomservice and they charge you 5 Euro per person deliverycharge ( wtf?). Of course you order and pay but it leaves an aftertaste behind of a a place that delivers and makes you feel good but is after your money in the first place.

When we arrived, there were tons of police cars and secret service in the parking area because apparently Vice President Biden was staying at the hotel as well. Despite all the extra hoopla, staff could not have been more friendly or efficient during our check in. They noted it was our honeymoon, and immediately upgraded us to a beautiful suite. When we arrived at our room, there was prosecco, a selection of fruit, and a handwritten card to greet us. The room itself was absolutely amazing. Beautiful, elegant touches were everywhere, and the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The thing that really blew me away however was the view. We had a gorgeous terrace outside both the living room and the bedroom, with the most amazing view of Rome. I cannot express how worth it it is to spring for a room with a good view. I spent most of my stay lounging on the terrace and just soaking in the beauty of it all. We dined at La Pergola one night, the Michelin three star restaurant on the top floor of the restaurant. I'm going to write a separate review for La Pergola, but it was by far the best evening of our trip, and one of the top three meals of my life. Not only was the food outstanding, the service could not have been more perfect. You have to book months in advance to get a reservation, but it is absolutely worth the effort.

The welcome we received when checking in made us instantly feel like VIPs. My husband is a Hilton Honors Diamond member, and we used points to stay for two nights prior to embarking on a Mediterranean cruise. All of the amenities we were to receive during our stay were described to us, and then we were escorted to our room. As others have remarked, I don't know of a better property to use Hilton Honors points than this one. The art is stunningly beautiful, and the pool area and grounds are luxurious. The views from our balcony were very good, and could have been have been the best if we had been willing to wait for a room to become available on a higher floor. But since we were tired after the overnight flight from the US, and we planned to be out and about in Rome during our stay, we opted to get into a room immediately upon arrival. The room was beautiful, the bathroom large with all the expected amenities, and the balcony quite nice with that lovely view of the grounds and Rome below. The only thing we would have wished to change was the mattress - it was on the hard side, but in the scheme of things, not a big deal. We were thrilled to be in Rome in such a beautiful hotel! The breakfast buffet was one of the amenities we received as Diamond level guests, and it had everything you could possibly want for breakfast in a very pretty setting. I loved the wall paintings of the cherubs in the smaller room. We enjoyed the buffet both mornings during our stay. We took taxis to and from the city, since we started each day in the Vatican area. Coming back to the hotel each night was like returning to a glittering oasis. It was so amazing to have such a restful retreat so near to the hustle and bustle of downtown Rome. There were several tips I gleaned from other Trip Advisor reviews that are worth repeating. Piazza le Delle Medaglie d'Oro is within easy walking distance (less than 10 minutes) of the hotel; turn right out of the hotel entrance and stay on Via Alberto Cadlolo until you run into it. There you will find ATMs, pastry shops, bars, a fresh market, restaurants, and more. It provides other options for dining within walking distance if you prefer not to dine in the hotel. We ate dinner in a Sicilian seafood restaurant here on our first night. My sister and her husband walked here each morning for their breakfast, as the hotel buffet breakfast was not complimentary for them. If you are a Bank of America customer, there is no charge for using BNP Paribas ATMs, and there is a BNP Paribas branch with ATM in this Piazza. We used RomeCabs for transfers from the airport to the hotel, and from the hotel to the port, and we were very pleased with their service. All our interactions with the Rome Cavalieri hotel staff were professional and cordial. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay Oct. 8th - 10th, and highly recommend the Rome Cavalieri to anyone visiting Rome!", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSlightly dated and rough around the edges\u201d", "Author": "RST1974", "ReviewID": "UR119615386", "Content": "Over the years I have tended to agree with tripadvisor consensus and trusted the sight so much that I only use this site to do my research.

The vast majority were very positive, but a few of the negatives ones caused me a few red flags and I am SOOO pleased to report that any concerns disappeared immediately upon arrival! Honestly I've decided that some people will complain about anything... I booked using Hilton HHonors points (I am a Diamond member) for 5 nites pre-cruise beginning October 4th and used Rome Cabs for all ground transportation (also highly recommended except for one issue - review will be posted on another thread for that). We arrived at the front entrance and I was prepared for aloof and unfriendly doormen from numerous reviews but even after the overnight flight and arriving looking less than beautiful :) we were warmly welcomed, given a claim ticket for our luggage and escorted to the front desk. When I provided my name, I was advised that there was a special registration area for me and I was taken to a small alcove next to the front desk, seated, offered something to drink, and all of the registration paperwork was handled by a wonderful front desk representative (I am sorry I didnt catch his name to thank him since I was so tired from the flight but he was really welcoming and professional!). We were given all of the information we would need, including shuttle schedule, access to spa and breakfast and escorted personally to our room which we were delighted to discover had an AMAZING view of the Eternal City. (I did not pay for an upgrade to the Imperial floor as we knew we would be in the City most of the time and I was prepared for a room without the view but this FAR exceeded my expectations!) When we arrived to our room, we found a lovely bottle of Prosecco with a Happy Birthday note to my Mother (the reason for this trip!) which was such a nice surprise. Thanks to the Management for this very thoughtful gesture! The room was SO much more beautiful than the photos I have seen online! Just perfectly appointed with the two beds that we had requested, beautiful furnishings, flat screen TV, amazing bathroom with all of the accoutrements, fluffly towels, robes and slippers, pillow and bath menus (those would have had extra cost but we didnt use them). There were complimentary bottles of water at all times and thankfully, since we were jetlagged, a room service menu. Our housekeeper did a great job keeping the room clean! The room felt and smelled clean, and there was turndown service at nite with a box of little gumdrop candies, fresh water, ice and towels. We enjoyed the remote-operated metal blackout curtain for the balcony slider door although the morning view of the City was a beautiful thing to wake up to...the giant hinged floor to ceiling mirror in the entry foyer doubled as a sound barrier and served to muffle any hallway noise - although we were close to the end of the hallway and out of the traffic pattern, we didnt hear much noise at all. We could have spent the entire time on the balcony overlooking the view. We had room 663 and I cant say enough how beautiful the sweeping view of the City was with St. Peters in the right foreground and the entire City sprawling before you! You could look down and see the beautiful pool area and the al fresco dining areas, along with the atrium covered indoor pool. Every nite there was a live musician singing out by the pool and on the first nite, for some unknown occasion - there were fireworks! We decided they were to welcome us to Rome! We opted to stay in the first nite and rest up so we could start fresh in the morning and took a closer look at the room service menu. Now you have already read in previous reviews that the cost of food at this hotel is not cheap. I was prepared and since we used points for the room, we splurged on a club sandwich, a beautiful panini with proscuitto and cheese, a caprese salad, some desserts, tea and coffee, and it was about $150 euro. Just know this and be prepared to bring snacks or go out for your meals if this is an issue for you. Even such a casual meal was served with complete flair though! Two waiters wheeled in elegant cloth covered tables with silver domes on the plates, little fruit tarts to go along with the tea and coffee service, and wonderful bread basket, along with olive oils, balsamic vinegar, etc...everything we could possibly need was there for us. I have never enjoyed room service so much and it was part of the fun of that first nite to be able to watch the fireworks from the balcony - in our robes - and enjoy that wonderful view. Just WOW! We overslept most of the time and missed breakfast, but we did catch it one time. The buffet is on the lower level below the main lobby and takes up two rooms with every imaginable option. The breakfast was free for Diamond members (I am not positive of the cost if you have to pay), and it was again presented with the style you quickly get used to in this elegant property. Now for Americans you will likely find a few things to complain about at any European breakfast buffet. The orange juice is not our \"fresh squeezed\" variety - they do olives better than citrus I've decided :), and the scrambled eggs are always undercooked, but this is just what you find in Europe - but in every other way, you are blown away by the dozens of choices of jams, preserves, every type of milk, yogurt, pastry, meats, etc. Since we are not big breakfast eaters, we only did the buffet once, opting instead to grab pastry and coffee in the City as part of the local experience. As you know, this location is not in the City center, so know this before you book, and decide whether a 15 minute taxi ride morning and evening is OK for you, or if you would prefer to be in the middle of the City. I have done it both ways now and can honestly say I am OK either way. Obviously there is a short drive to/from the City, but the plus is that you get dropped off exactly where you want to go every day. The taxi drivers are part of the experience also - some friendly, some gruff, some will let you practice your Italian and tell you what that statue was that you just passed...it's nice to see the various neighborhoods too that you would not get to see otherwise...I actually kind of enjoyed the experience of leaving the hustle and bustle of the city at nite and rising the hill of Mount Maria to our gorgeous view. For us - again - it was a no brainer since the room was free, the taxi's were a small cost alternative. The shuttle schedule, while easy enough to work with the written (and reliable) schedule, didnt always match our plans, so we ended up using taxis except once or twice. The shuttle bus is nice and large and it was never even 1/2 full. However we always wanted to stay in the City later than 8PM, so we taxi'd back to the hotel in the evening. The shuttle stop at Piazza Barberini is in a good location (surrounded by some pretty good Italian restaurants, pastry shops, pharmacies, etc - look for the giant shell sculpture for your landmark), but we sometimes wanted to end the nite in, for example, Piazza Navona or Campo de Fiori and it was easy to grab a taxi for approx. $12 euro each way. We just anticipated the taxi costs and were prepared with lots of $2 and $5 euros at all times. (Keep in mind you cant hail a taxi in Rome - they wont stop...you have to find the nearest taxi stand...usually just outside the perimeter of the piazzas.) We did not use the pool or spa - were just too busy in the City so I cant speak for those. We did visit the Concierge lounge on the lobby level a couple of times for a lite snack or coffee. They have pretty basic fruit, cheese, beverages and prosecco but it is a very nice lounge with good service attendants...the only thing I could find to complain about there is that they could use some \"mood\" lighting - the place was so brightly lit I felt I was in an operating room. ... Maybe a dimmer switch would work well there. :) The checkout process on Sunday morning as we were departing for the cruise ship port was a bit hectic because a couple of exiting guests were arguing with the 2 front desk clerks about their bill. I was finally taken care of by a third representative who opened another PC to help me out since my car was waiting...no big deal there at all but just allow yourself a few minutes on a weekend morning to check out because they do not have an express check out process that I could see. Without hesitation I would recommend this as THE best place to use your Hilton points and I am already planning a return trip!

We immediately jumped on the chance to spend more time together in the luxury of this suite. We were not dissapointed. Incredible views of Rome, a sliding roof to the terrace with a jacuzzi, this place oozed luxury.

I used my HHonors points (this is a popular HHonors destination) and was able to upgrade to an Imperial Floor room for about 90 euros per night. In addition to a more spacious room, beautiful view of Rome, a private elevator on the lobby and spa levels, it also gave us access to the Imperial Club. The Imperial Club is essentially the most impressive, souped-up concierge/executive lounge I've ever seen (and I've seen a few). It has some form of food available all day long, serving breakfast, lunchtime items, and afternoon tea selections of treats and beverages (the coffee beverages are made-to-order by the Club staff). Various spirits for cocktails are available at night, and water, soda, and beer is available all day. There are semi-private sitting areas outside that also provide a great view of Rome as well as St. Peter's Basilica. The room had everything we needed, except for an iron, which we found was available for sharing in a room near the elevators. High-quality toiletries (Acqua di Parma if I recall) were stocked in the bathroom and the room was equipped with remote-controlled full black-out shades, which were awesome, but almost caused us to completely miss breakfast one day. Beds were EXTREMELY firm. First morning or two was a bit painful, but you adjust. The workout facilities and pool areas were superlative (I understand most hotels in Rome do not even have pools), and the spa provided about any service you would expect and was also equipped with an indoor pool and Turkish bath. The grounds were immaculate and the lobby staff were extremely helpful (while I tried to use Italian whenever I could, it was helpful that all of them seemed well-versed in speaking English). La Pergola, which is generally considered one of the very best restaurants in all of Rome, is the hotel's rooftop restaurant. Their restaurant on the lower lobby level (L'Oliveta I believe?) was very good (we had breakfast there everyday and dinner twice). If you're paying for the room, it will be very expensive (but it is a 5-star hotel in Rome, so what do you expect?). However, I've found few better uses of my HHonors points. TIP: The hotel is off the beaten path (northwest of Vatican City) and you will be forced to drive or take a taxi or the complimentary hotel shuttle if you want to go into town.

Unlike others that post I do understand that they have to pay the bills and when you are a points stay you have to be willing to pay 8 Euro for a coke at the amazing pool. I have read a great deal about the differences in the lounges I have to say if you go in with the expectation that the lounge will be some place in the evening to get a coke, wine or beer you will be fine. I do not feel that the appetizers etc come anywhere close to what the standard should be considering this property. I am taking the imperial lounge out of the equation. My biggest complaint is that when I booked this room several months ago I had the diamond desk put comments in that this was a trip that I was taking my mother on to celebrate her 70th birthday. I even went so far as to send guest relations a follow up email a week prior to our arrival. I received back the following response \"Dear Mrs B, Good morning from Roma, I am pleased to confirm that we have taken very good note about the reasons why you are coming to visit us and of course we will do our best in order to make your stay absolutely memorable !\" Imagine my disappointment when there was no mention, not so much as a sticky note- recognizing this special occasion. Even more disappointing is the fact that I sent the same individual an email after three days at the property reminding them of this and getting no response what so ever. Considering the Cabo Hilton decorated the entire suites for my sister's birthday and the Washington DC Embassy Suites provided a congratulation basket for my Godson when I took him there for his high school graduation. In nine years I could go on and on about what other properties have done. This was so disappointing and something you just can\u2019t get back. What is sad is that my mother has heard me praise Hilton time and time again. She is left wondering what there is to brag about. We did go to the pool side restaurant on my mom's actual birthday and I did mention to waitress that it was her birthday. They did decorate her plate and brought out sparklers to recognize the day. I was very appreciative of this. In addition one night the cashier all but refused to convert money for my mother and sister, this after we have converted funds all week. \" Our stay was finished by me telling the bellboy we needed a cab to the airport that would fit six bags and took credit. Before we knew it they were trying to load out bags in the smallest car possible. I mentioned that this would not work and asked if the cab driver took credit. He said no. I was promptly chastised by the Bell captain how informed me \u201cYou should have told us you needed a cab that took credit\" I share with him that I did share it with the bell boy. The bell boy did speak up and take responsibility for forgetting this. I guess the bell captain forgot how to apologize. Bottom line - some staff are outstanding- others need to be relieved of their duties as they are making a beautiful property. There is a need for this property to go back to what made it such a monarch property and remind all staff they are there for the guests. We made our way to the FCO Hilton and found what I was accustom to with regard to lounges etc. and consistent customer service. I would recommend this for any stay you need to be close to the airport. One note there is a shuttle that will take you to terminal 5 for US departures. It is a very long walk and I was glad we took the shuttle. The shuttle to downtown Rome goes every two hours and will drop you off close to the Nation Museum (Ten Minutes walk). The last pick up is 11:45 pm so if you want a late night in downtown Rome you are able to do so. Will return to the Hilton FCO- it is however doubtful I will return to the cavalieri.", "Date": "October 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palos Verdes Estates, California", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, Distance from other parts of Rome not an issue\u201d", "Author": "Albert S", "ReviewID": "UR118821814", "Content": "I took my family of four (wife, kids 6 and 10 years old) for our first visit to Italy in the middle of August.

Needless to say, it was just your average \"roided out\" Hilton. As far as large scale luxury hotels, WA seems to be lacking in comparison to Fairmont and Ritz-Carlton properties. The service overall was good considering the staff was assisting two groups staying at the hotel at the same time. On that note, however, the hotel overbooked and some members wound up having to re-locate to the Grand Via Veneto, thus adding unecessary travel for meetings, etc. The food was also subpar for a five star resort, but alas, we're still talking about a once great hotel franchise now cheaped down by the Hilton name. Frankly, you can pay \u20ac15+/- for a cab into Rome and get a much better meal than the \u20ac30+ sandwiches, etc offered at the hotel. The actual location and property, apart from the building, were very nice. The pool side of the hotel had a fantastic panoramic view of the entire city of Rome with the dome of St. Peter's basilica situated off to the right. The grounds were well landscaped and the pool area was well kept. The rooms were a bit cramped and disappointing overall, along with the fact that the balcony was just dirty looking. Frankly, the entire building is in serious need of updating. The rooftop terrace is a nice touch, especially for a great night light view of Rome. The biggest drawback to location, however, is the distance. For being so close to the heart of the city, it still usually takes about \u20ac15-20 to reach certain parts of the city in a taxi; plan accordingly. In conclusion, if you're looking to overpay for a semi-familiar American presence while staying in Rome, this is your spot. Otherwise, try one of the botique venues in Rome.

Now for a hotel like this you are not going to do it on the \"cheap\" so if you are expecting budget meals and pool bar burgers then think again. The food is superb, from breakfast right the way through to dinner. Tip 2/ Book a pool-side table in the restaurant to really appreciate the live singer and pianist with dinner and sit there and relax alongside the blue lit pool.

Depending on the price you can find a room for, it ranges from decent to excellent value. Make sure you get a room with breakfast in the price, it is top notch, with excellent quality and huge variety. All personnel was very helpful. Due to a family health issue we had to leave earlier, but we had a room at a very good rate wich we had pre-paid (that is why we had a low price). Obviously, we could not get a refund, but the dutty manager was helpful and found a solution: alla our extra charges (room service, dinner, etc.) were covered from the payment for the 3 nights, so we did not pay anything extra. Nice gesture....sure I was expecting something like that, but I am fully aware that they were not obliged to do so. Rooms are very spacious and beautifuly decorated, with excellent soundproofing. Bed is very comfortable and you can choose from many different pillows! Because it is not in the center of Rome, you have to either use the shuttle bus or take a taxi. Are there any negatives about the hotel? Of course there are, at least form me. Mainly 2 things: 1. When you pay so much money for a room, I find it ridiculous to charge you 9 Euro per day for WiFi. We live in 2011...it is free even at hotel that cost 1/3 of the price of this one. 2. I agree to charge visitors for using the swimming pool, but to charge the guest 18 Euro per person is very insulting. 3.

This place is grand, no question about it. Some will love it and feel right at home, some probably might feel uncomfortable with all the real or perceived pretentiousness. Most of the guests looked like they just failed Real Housewives of Beverly Hills casting and went to Hilton Cavalieri as consolation prize. We were warmly welcomed upon arrival, asked to step in a special area, offered a drink and a seat while we were checked in. As Hilton Diamond members, we were told of all the perks we should expect: upgraded to an executive room, free access to Colosseo lounge, pool and spa, free breakfast and internet access. The WI-FI Internet, by the way, is excruciatingly painfully slow, maybe the cable is better. As we entered the room we were impressed with it and disappointed with the view: 6-lion statues and a \u201cbeautiful\u201d monument dedicated to Guglielmo Marconi. I became even more disappointed later on when through an opened door across the hallway I saw the breathtaking views of Rome. So you know, all the even number room have no views, all the uneven have great views. Maybe I should have asked for another room, but I did not, I assumed either no rooms with a view were available or we did not have the special credentials to deserve one. At any rate, it is hard to complain with the accommodations. The breakfast was really good, with lots of choices and the staff was very accommodating. The Colosseo lounge was nice for a drink and some very light refreshments after a long day of walking. These days all you get in the Hilton executive lounges are very, very light refreshments. We visited the spa and were offered a quick tour, but we run of time and did not had a chance to enjoy it. The shuttle was full and few people were turned away, only one time (leaving the hotel). Rest of the time was not an issue; it was very convenient and runs great. The only complaint was that the last bus leaves Piazza Barberini at 20:00 (8 pm) which is way too early. Several times we had to take taxis back to the hotel and that cost about18-20 Euros. We did not eat any meals other than breakfast (in the hotel) and cannot speak for the quality of the restaurants.

For me, I felt it was better managed as a Hilton.The transformation to a Waldorf seems to have softened some of the warmth and benefits. The rooms are large, comfortable and well planned. For HHonors members, there are two lounges, the ground floor and one on the Imperial/executive level. There is only access to the lounge on the first floor for Hilton HHonors members if you are not in an executive room. While it has drinks all day long, there are few to no snacks. A salad until middayand then some small sandwhiches until 5 or 6pm. You must stay on an elite floor to have access to the other lounge. Breakfast is included for Gold HHonors and costs \u20ac38. for everyone else. A hamburger for lunch costs \u20ac39 in L'Uliveto, the casual restaurant. The free shuttle bus goes to a stop near the Spanish Steps but there is no transportation to the Vatican. The bus is hourly until about 8pm and has a break in the afternoon. Since the hotel is not inside the city wall, every taxi ride is metered and instead of a flat rate had to pay by the kilometer. We arrived in Rome via train and had trouble getting a taxi willing to go to the hotel (about a 15 minute wait) . It's the same when you leave the hotel. Traveling by taxi to a restaurant in the city is about \u20ac15 each way; about \u20ac45 to the airport; or 90 by hotel car. If you are not Diamond, you must pay to use the pool. I'm not sure but think it's around \u20ac18. Although it is a nice pool, it is quite deep - 5.5 feet at the shallow end, 11.5 feet at the deep end. The workout area is very nice and incorporates the new Hilon standard of Technogym Equipment you see worldwide.The \"free\" internet is capped on usage and you get enough to make one 10 minute Skype call per day.

Additionally, the shuttle stops running at 8pm. - Upgrades: Unless you are a Gold/Diamond Hilton Honors member, don't expect any special treatment.

I have never been asked to pay for a room upgrade at any Hilton property ever. Usually, if an upgrade is available (which it was in this case) it is complementary. - Garden View: The garden consists of some grass and lion statues - not impressive in the least. - Restaurants: The poolside restaurant is overpriced and the food is mediocre.

As for the trade-off, this was well worth it as the cab rides to/from central Rome were quick an not too expensive (10-15 euros). Keep in mind, we were there in August, when street traffic is nearly non-existent. (The bus schedule is very tough to plan your day around and one time, even though we timed it perfectly, we couldn't use it as it was already filled by other guests...) As for the food, we found the breakfast, although an impressively varied spread, to be rather average. It was certainly a case of quantity over quality. However, given the large number of guests having breakfast each morning, I give them the benefit of the doubt. (I also think I am a bit jaded from my breakfast experience at the San Clemente Palace in Venice last summer, which was other-worldly). Overall, I would put breakfast in the \"positive\" category. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant twice (note that this is not the 3-star, premiere restaurant upstairs, which was closed for August) and found it to be below average. In addition to the expectedly high-prices, we found the food somewhat bland and the service to be pretty spotty. Note that this is not a totally sleepy hotel restaurant... as a result of the hotel's somewhat remote location, it seems to get enough activity from guests to warrant a better experience. My most important advice would be to include the Imperial Club in your reservation (to the extent they are charging something reasonable). The Club serves light fare and juices, sodas and some alcohol from 7am to 11pm. Another positive would be the Concierge desk, led by Marco. They were enormously helpful and friendly, especially when it came to touring the city. As for restaurants, they didn't seem to have a lot of conviction in their choices....some of which may have been because many restauarants are close in August. As for the negative, I found that the front desk, altough staffed with polite and cheery young women, had a strange, negative attitude from the moment we checked in. Given that we had booked 12 room-nights (2 rooms for a 6-night stay), they were less than totally cooperative in getting us two non-smoking rooms. (Tip: As you should everywhere in Europe, it is essential to check the rooms at this hotel before moving your bags in if you do not like the smell of cigarette smoke... it is prevalent in the hotel, even in non-smoking rooms). What was irksome was that, on several occasions, the front desk staff (and even the hotel manager) referred to our \"excellent rate\" as an excuse for not being more helpful. This was particularly offensive in that I booked the rooms directly through Hilton (and not through Expedia or some other cut-rate agent) and received a good rate solely because I was willing to pay for the entire trip in advance, non-refundable, even before I left the States. It was almost as if, since they already had my money, they didn't feel that they had to ensure my satisfaction. After having a direct conversation, it was clear that this attitude came from the top (i.e., the property manager) and flowed down from him. This is extremely disappointing from a hotel of this caliber. Finally, I need to note that this is a particularly \"Americanized\" (almost exclusively English language) hotel. While this worked well for us, it may not work for those looking for a more authentic, local experience", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cMixed feelings.

After our 3 days escapades we had in Venice, where we also stayed in another Hilton property - Hilton Molino Stucky, we decided to make a very short visit to Rome to have our Ash Wednesday there. We took Easyjet flight from Marco Polo Airport to Fiumicino Airport early in the morning. We reached Fiumicino around 10am as far as I remember. We took cab which has a fix price of 60 euros from the airport going to hotel. Travel time took around 50mins to an hour. The distance of the airport to city centre is quite far... Upon arrival at the hotel, we were greeted and welcomed by the courteous staffs of the hotel and lead us to the very elegant desk of their reception. By the way, If you will have a look the exterior of the building (view from outside) it's like an old apartment building on top of a hill. You will feel a li'l bit disappointed coz the building is quite old and no appeal to your eyes... But as what others saying : DONT JUDGE THE BOOK BY ITS COVER. When we entered the hotel, we were so amazed coz it seemed that we went in a museum or an art room of a palace; the paintings were so elegant and the ambience gave me a bit of goosebumps because of it's luxurious interiors. The receptionist was very welcoming and check us in very quickly. The receptionist who assisted us was very helpful coz she almost come with us to accompany us to show our room. Our room was upgraded since I was a Hilton Honor Gold Member. Upon entering our room, I just can't describe how I feel. I was so amazed coz the room was so huge. It has a terrace with some chairs and a garden table, it has an office desk in the room, it has a big sofa, big bed, big tv and big bathroom. This was the first time also I experienced and saw a metal blinds - an automatic partition between the terrace and the room itself aside from the glass door by the terrace. They've got a double mirror door as well at the door entrance of the room so that you can't hear anything from outside and vice versa. I cant say anything bad with the room, it's like me and my wife were dreaming. Like you're a living in a Palace. They said that it's better if you will have a room viewing the city of Rome but unfortunately we were on the opposite side of the building - viewing nothing special. We also got an access with their executive lounge and compared to Hilton Molino Stucky Venice... I think the executive lounge in Venice is much better in terms of selection of drinks, canape's, sweets, nibbles and sandwiches though in Rome the only good was you have a good view of the garden of the hotel and the pool with some hint of the city's view. Though others said that the Rome Cavalieri was quite away from the city centre, me and my wife didn't had any difficulties going down to down town. We went by cab at the city centre and paid just 8 euros for 10 - 15 mins travel time. Though the hotel got free shuttle bus to and from the hotel going to the central; we just used their shuttle service once when we went home on that night from Plaza Barberini. We also used their indoor pool and since it was still March at that time the water of the pool is not that really warm enough to stay longer in the pool though it doesn't really matter coz we just stay their anyway for about 20 minutes. The pool's slippers was nice though. I was looking forward with the outdoor pool but it was close due to still winter temperature during that time though the max temperature reached 24 degrees celsius when we went to Rome last March during day time. The best part of Rome Cavalieri was the breakfast... It's like you're having a proper lunch buffet though in reality your just having a breakfast. Alot of selections from drinks to hot and cold food to pastries as in EVERYTHING... they've got japanese section as well. Their orange juice was strange though i love it so much coz the taste was so unique and the color as well. I can't describe their breakfast buffet... just amazing... utterly genius. Rome Cavalieri impressed me and my wife so much and we're planning to come back and stay their not only for 1 night... We're planning again to go back in this hotel by February particularly celebrating Valentine's Day... Not just only for 1 night but for a week.

I have stayed in several Waldorf properties in the past and (sigh) must admit the Waldorf=Astoria has been surpassed. Every member of the staff are world class and allow you to feel as tho you \"belong\" as silly as that sounds I think you know what I mean by it. Never at any time did we \"want\" for anything that the staff couldn't provide! And the room, well what can I say? It was tremendous, large, expansive and completely comfortable. Loved it (and no I am not being a shill) The hotel has two restaurants (both world class with the most attentive and knowing wait staff we've encountered) the facilities on site were also world-class, the workout center and trainer perfection, the swimming pools and attendants fabulous. We stayed on the 7th floor and had access to the Imperial Club, again well worth the expense. The young ladies staffing the Club were extremely helpful, courteous and well above what you'd expect. Professional and attentive. The view from the club's balcony were/are OUTSTANDING!, really, if I used terms like 'breath taking' that would describe it after dark, the city seriously twinkles below you (we had the same view from our room and wow, wow) No kidding, this was the absolute best place to spend your anniversary as we were (as were several people we met in the Club) or any other reason to visit Rome. Honestly, I really can't put into words how much we appreciated this property and the staff and the VIEWS!! Trust me, there may be less expensive properties in Rome (and I'm sure there are, but no where will you feel like you will when you're actually sitting in the lobby and appreciating your surroundings. Love this place and oh yeah, (like Douglas MacArthur), I will return! However, the weather in Rome in August is a bit HOT, didn't know that - or realize how hot it would be - when we arrived, just be aware of that if you're thinking of a summer visit But then, like we discovered, there's very few reasons to leave the property (souvenirs, the vatican, sight seeing etc., granted) Just think as I did, while walking in the sun, of what awaits you on your return. The hotel provides hourly shuttle service to the Piazza Barberini, which is minutes from the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain and there's a metro stop as well which places you minutes from anywhere in the city. The metro is air conditioned (like my mom's refrigerator) so no heat worries there. I have nothing to complain about; seriously, nothing at all.

A small grumble and not the end of the world, but the reception staff did not seem interested in trying to change our room allocation for us. What I found jaw-droppingly unbelievable - and what has prompted me to write this review - is the 18 euro charge to use the pool. We were a group of 6 and were entertaining another family of 5 in the restaurant, spending no small amount of money. I can understand that they feel the need to charge non-residents a fee to use the pool (although, if they are eating in the restaurant, I don't think it would be unreasonable to waive the charge), but we ended up paying 200 Euros for our group to have sun-loungers (two of which were subsequently misappropriated by other guests) on top of the 500 Euros we paid for (a delicious) lunch.

Similar to many reviews here, our experience ranged from poor to great. For us, the location was fine. I would strongly recommend getting a pre-arranged car service (we used romecabs for 50 euro which was fine). The shuttle bus service was very convenient and efficient. We had them drop us off at Plaza Flamingo which is a great area (1/2 way to the normal drop off). Taxis were reasonable to the hotel from city center and the Vatican. We liked being out of the city center as it allowed us to see areas of Rome we had not seen before (e.g. we really like walking from Plaza Flamingo to the city center). However, I would not recommend staying here for a first trip. I think the hotel is very geared to conventions as there is a large convention hall in the building. So it seemed like service for non-convention goers was not as good. I was also staying on points (as I think many at this hotel do) so that seemed to result in a poor experience at the front desk. I can understand from the hotel's perspective, it has to be annoying having guests book points stays and then asking for \"city view\" upgrades so I understand why they are not very hospitable, but it was disappointing none-the-less. For instance, I asked for a late check-out of an hour and the manager (K Khaled) told me the hotel was fully booked and one was not available. He was quite obnoxious. I checked online and the hotel had at least 12 rooms open and I have never had a Hilton deny a late check-out even when they are booked up. The room was nice and spacious but furniture was a little dirty. The bed was great, as well as the bathroom. I did have a weird experience with a cleaning lady barging into the room checking the mini-bar. I asked her to leave and she wouldn't until she checked the mini-bar. I always thought those stories were a hoax until it actually happened to me. The outside of the building is not so great (thay's why there are no pictures on the website) but overally the grounds are very nice and the common areas are well decorated. The gym and pool are great. There are some restaurants near the hotel. I tried \"The View\", which does have an amazing view but the food was just OK. There is a little town square about 7 blocks away and the restaurant the concierge recommended was fantastic....one of our best meals. The HH lounge was nice and the snacks were fine. Breakfast was included with our stay (which was only pointed out on our second day) so, for free, it was fine. However, I would have been very disappointed if I paid for it. The coffee was horrible and the eggs were cold - of course, we ate around 9:30 each morning. If you can look past potentially awful service, the Cavalieri is a nice place to stay. I could see it as a great place with kids because of the pool, or if you are part of convention, or staying on points.

The front desk staff was helpful, although at times there was a difficuly of understanding English. We were using our points as HH diamond members so we had the access to all the faciliies at the hotel. We liked the breakfast buffets a lot. My kids eat different foods so it wasn't a problem at all to make them happy. The fruit table was rich, there were many different fresh juices, cold cuts, cheeses, bread selection and pastries. There was even a Japanese breakfast offered, I've never seen that in any other country before. In the other reviews I've read the complaints about the hotel shuttle, during our visit, when there were too many people they added another minibus, so transportation was never a problem. The drivres even accomodated to the passengers wishes and changed the route and dropped them off closer to their destinations. I don't know how the other passengers felt when there was a custom made route each time though. The hotel website does nor specify where to take it from, if you want to ride it from downtown the first time.Piazza Barberini is a big plaza and you might be waiting for it at the wrong side, the shuttle stops on the corner of Via d Basilio, there is a clam shaped mini fountain on the corner. My only negative comment is about the wifi connection. From our rooms we could get on the internet, but it was either too slow or cutting off every five minutes.In this day and age I believe Hilton can upgrade its system, better than any no name hotel.We did not have a chance to eat at La Pergola because it was under renovation, but we have seen a lot of people especially traveling with young children eating at Ulvieto in the evenings.

Yes, the hotel is not in the middle of the city, but it's not that far from major sites. There is a shuttle and we took a cab to the Vatican which was only 7 euros for 5 people (we had a tour guide with us). When we arrived my wife and daughters started crying at how beautiful it was. The art collection in the hotel is incredible. The large commode/dresser that greets you as you walk is something you should take the time to look at. An amazing piece of craftsmanship. I have to say that our trip through Europe was not spent in hotels this nice so my review might be a little biased. The staff was very accommodating and the concierge really helped me put together my 20th anniversary celebration with my wife. The rooms are large, nicely appointed and very comfortable. The bed was so welcoming after some of thing things we had to sleep on. Finally the view over the city was amazing. Yes I paid for the upgrade to the city view room. Being able to control everything in the room from buttons next to the bed was really nice. I have to say our room was beautiful and clean for the most part. The bathroom needs a little help (see below). For our anniversary we had the most amazing dinner at La Pergola. It is a Michelin 3 star, it is expensive and if you like to dine it is worth it. You don't have to have the tasting menu (6-9 courses) which is what I think people really complain about when talking about price per person. We had an incredible 4 course meal, champagne, sauterne and a bottle of wine and our whole meal was less than what I see some reviews quote per person. I would say 200 euros per person is a fair estimate. The only problem we had was a table that was seated next to us had a guy that had to keep bragging about how he has eaten there before. He ran his mouth so much we actually had to be moved inside. Still the dinning experience was totally worth it and Chef Beck even came out and answered our questions about some of his preparations. Okay, I'll get back to reviewing the hotel. My stay is not without complaints. The hotel is confusing regarding the use of the pools. We were told on check-in that we were allowed to use the indoor pool and that we would have to pay to use the outdoor pool. We later found out that we could swim in the outdoor pool, but couldn't use the lounge chairs. The whole pool situation was a little strange and I wish it was clearer. It didn't bother us to use the indoor pool because you weren't allowed to smoke in there. The outdoor pool was like a smoking lounge. The hotel has some really beautiful grounds, but they really need to work on where people are allowed to smoke. It's allowed everywhere outside and if you want to enjoy a evening cocktail overlooking the beautiful city be prepared to have a pack of cigarettes to go with it. It's really sad that a non-smoker has to suffer the consequences of a human chimney. A couple other complaints. The jacuzzi tub in in one of our rooms didn't work and the shower head needed to be replace or cleaned in the other. The toilettes need some work too... The breakfast was very nice and a nice variety of foods. The smiley face in the cappuccino was a fun touch. We had to sit inside though because of the smoking issue. The hotel also has an incredible looking gym and spa. I say looking because I didn't have time to use either, but they looked nice. Bottom line, I would come back to this hotel if I came back to Rome. My expectations would be higher though and if the problems (pool use, bathrooms and smoking) I mentioned still existed I would probably only rate it a 3 star place.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bermuda", "Title": "\u201cBusiness Travel with Wife\u201d", "Author": "SOCalTraveler1952", "ReviewID": "UR116438936", "Content": "If you are looking for a marvelous experience then this is the place to stay.

Wow - The Imperial bedroom on the 8th floor, forget the view of the telephone mast and apartment buildings, this is Italy and the balcony also gave a delightful view of the front of the hotel and the gorgeous fountain. Far worse views from many top class hotels in numerous other cities. Not a negative factor at all. The bedroom wanted for nothing, even an umbrella if it should be needed - the amazing thunderstorm viewed from the balcony one evening was thoroughly enjoyable but maybe the hotel can't take too much credit for that! The hotel, however, did provide the balcony complete with canopy so thanks for that. 5. Wow - The bathroom deserves its own Wow, everything you needed, expertly cleaned, very ornate but functional and apologies but there are now a couple of Cavalieri soaps in my bathroom at home with instructions not to use them! 6 Wow - The shuttle bus, always on time, loved being driven through the crazy roads of Rome, a fascinating insight into Rome life, a very modern coach, air conditioned and a very professional service. 7 Wow - The amazingly friendly, professional, caring, attentive staff who speak excellent English. I do not think I ever had need to open a door for myself, every single staff member whom we passed, whether it be housekeeping, concierge, restaurant, shuttle driver, or just staff simply passing by - always, always took the time to smile and afford a greeting. They make you feel so welcomed. 8 Wow - Last but not least Wow - The Cavalieri Hotel itself - never apologise for your location, its just perfect, not only for the views it affords across the city of Rome but from the enjoyment we got from being at the top of the dome of St. Peters and being able to see the Hotel clearly and say \"that's where we are staying, yes that lovely hotel on the hillside so clearly visible from here\".

It is ugly from the outside but boy is it beautiful inside!! Truely magnificent, rooms are 50 sq meter and furnished lovely. Ignore all others that tell you to upgrade. I got the cheapest rooms (family of 5) . We're only in the room to sleep so a view didn't matter, Beds were big and very comfortable with pillow menu. Interconnecting rooms with full marble bathrooms and usual Hilton freebees. Breakfast included and at best was adequate, certainly not worth paying for on the day. Lots of fruit that you can take to snack on during the day. The pools were fantastic main pool 25m long and approx 15 m wide and strangely very deep even in shallow end, staffed very well indeed but a bit heavy handed on the kids not allowing them to dive or jump in even in the separate kids pool. Every one moans about the 18 euro fee for a lounger. Well we just got towels from the attendant didnt ask for a foam mattress which is what they charge for not for the towels and used any free lounger around the pool or better still to avoid looking like a tight git use the loungers around the kids pool were more cost savy people are all lying on loungers without the foam mattress for free!! get extra towels for extra comfort. Pool bar way too expensive, 29 euros for a burger and chips, same for a sandwich and pizza, 6 euro for small bottle of water-get real guys, charge less and more people will eat. Consequently most tables are free. Service poor considering price. Money saving tip -portions are huge therefore order food to come to your lounger and share with your partner. kids menu is good and reasonable order from that for them, the adult sized club sandwich will feed 3 kids easily. Buy water down town and keep the bottle, there are water stands carefully hidden around the pool which you can use to fill your bottle up. Lunch time better still to leave hotel turn right at exit and 200 meters brings you onto a nice little square where we had great service great paninis, drinks, coffee, kinder eggs all for the price of one burger back at the hotel!! get your water and wine there to drink back at the hotel. Everyone says there are no restaurants nearby-however there is! Tturn right out of hotel 100 meters on there is a tiny park, take the steps down and immediately opposite is a restaurant called 'The View' takes max 5 mins to walk there. The food was fantastic and very good prices indeed nearly as good as the view over the city-quite stunning. It is a quality place so dress up for it, we didnt and consequently a very snooty waiter took some offense but after I sent a bottle of wine back with a few choice words to him ie 'your a waiter drop the attitude' amongst others and generally made sure he knew what I thought of him things did pick up, needless to say for the first time in some time I left no tip, he didn't say goodbye but his colleague who obviously found the whole thing amusing came to shake my hand when I left!! Cheque out was easy and quick, stayed around the pool rest of day and used spa changing areas. Used rome.net transfers which were punctual and reasonable price. Coliseum tour booked in advance for the underground and third tier tour-well worth it, go early am or late pm to avoid the queue (absolutely massive and make sure you get in the right line)), even with a prepaid voucher you will have to wait, always leave 30 mins of queue time even with prepaid voucher, many people missed their time slots and got very angry so beware. Vatican tour again great, get a guide when you book, ours met us outside took us through then got all the tickets and took us around, go at 3pm tour time then you will have the place almost to yourself. The little cafe is very reasonable price for a pitstop!! If you can afford to eat at the Hilton why is everybody moaning about the Taxi price?? The shuttle into town is fine, Taxi to furthest point we went was 15 euros for 5 of us either way. Taxis everywhere and easy to flag down, we couldn't be bothered to wait for the shuttle or walk to it. Value for money. In summary beautiful place, fantastic pool, average service, great location, pool bar too expensive, bring in your own water, take the fruit at breakfast, eat outside hotel or inside carefully. Visit the view restaurant for great food with a grumby waiter with the small goatie-ish beard for a fun time provided you can handle and stick up for yourself.

The breakfast was good and we were glad to have it included in our rate, otherwise it would have been too expensive to buy it ( like everything else at the restaurants ) and no other options close to the hotel. Our room was spacious and nice. We did not receive the paper, the turn down service on the evening kept living us a message saying she came and we did not answer, which was not truth. By the wy she came apparently at 22 .30 in the night, which I find kind of a funny time for such a service. Although the hotel has indoor and outdoor swimming pools and a gym we were told at reception that we could not use any of them unless we paid an additional fee of about 25 Euro. Although we knew that there was an additional fee for the spa, it was not clear to us that all swimming pools from the hotel belong to the spa and either you have a rate that includes them all or you cannot use them. This was specially dissappointing for not being able to use the gym. I mean what is the point of booking in such a hotel if you are more or less confined to your room looking at the radio antena and feeling like a second class citizen because either you pay much more or you canno use the facilities which even in three star hotels are normal and free of charge to guests (gym and swimming pool).

While we had been to Rome on three previous cruises, each time we had been limited to 8 hours as part of private shore excursions. This time we wanted to visit some of the Roman sites at a more leisurely pace. As has been mentioned in other reviews, the primary disadvantage of the Rome Cavalieri is it's location outside of the city. We used the shuttle into town twice and taxis on four other occasions. The shuttle was larger than I expected and operated on schedule. The drop off location was okay, but somewhere closer to the Trevi Fountain would have been better. We had no problem finding taxis on the occasions we used them, with one way prices ranging from 7 Euros to/from the Vatican (about a 10 minute ride) and 14 Euros from downtown (about a 20 minute ride). As a result, we found the location outside the city to be mostly a non-issue for our needs. While our room was located on the side of the building facing away from the Roman skyline, It was one of the more luxurious hotel rooms we've ever experienced. The room was large with a very comfortable bed, had a marble surfaced bathroom complete with towel warming rack and higher quality bath products, a 32 inch flat screen TV, plenty of storage space, and a nice balcony overlooking a park-like setting. The air conditioning was excellent, which was important in late June. Two interesting features of the room were a mirrored inner door between the bathroom and the closets that could be used to block sounds from the hallway (we heard none, with and without the door being closed) and an electric external metal roll down shutter that blocked out light and sounds from the outside. As Hilton Honors gold members, we took advantage of the free drinks and snacks in the Colosseo lounge on several occasions. The staff in the lounge did an excellent job of keeping the drinks and snacks in stock and were constantly attending to the area. Note that the small sandwich bites are little more than a snack, not a substitute for a meal. BTW, I had the opportunity to visit the Imperial Lounge and, while it's nicer than the Colosseo lounge, I wouldn't pay for an Imperial Room to get access to it. The breakfast buffet was wonderful, with tables inside and outside along the pool. Eating breakfast poolside was one of the highlights of our stay at the hotel. Speaking of the pool, there is no charge to use either the indoor or outdoor pools. However, sunbeds around the outdoor pool area are available for 18 euros. We found some chairs in the indoor pool area and swam in the outdoor pool. Taking a dip during the hot afternoon, between trips into town, was wonderful. Note that the outdoor pool is too deep to stand (I'm over 6 ft tall) except for very near the wall on one end. Not a problem, but different from most pools. The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly, with all staff members smiling and greeting us wherever we were on the property. We stayed at the hotel using Hilton Honors points.

Full Diclosure: We used Hilton Points as it seems had most of the Americans staying at the property. That Said, they were points very well spent! When we arrived we were informed we had been upgraded to an Imperial City View room. The room was large, particularly by European Standards, and the balcony overlooked St. Peter's Basilica. The room was very nicely appointed, if you are a fan of marble, this is your place. Nice inlaid marble floors in the bathroom and plenty of room for 2 to get ready for a day in Rome at the same time. The room came with access to the pool, gym and spa so we did not experience the nickel and dime (multiplied by Euros) others have talked about. But I would say that the level of service at the pool by the attendants must be factored into any discussion of price. The pool stewards were very attentive, brought thick pads for the deck chairs and would make sure umbrellas were moved to give you shade from the July Rome sun. The spa attendant was equally quick to make sure you had a robe and towels for use in the sauna and jacuzzi areas. The service in the Imperial club was good. They had a nice selection of waters, juices, wine, liquor, beer or would make you an espresso drink. Breakfast was very nice including everything from eggs to the more standard meats, cheeses and fruit. In the evening light appetizers are put out, we had carpaccio and octopus salad, both tasty. My wife and I actually enjoyed the location and access to the city, but do not expect to walk anywhere from this hotel. The shuttle bus runs on the hour from the hotel and returns from Piazza Barberini on the 1/2 hour. I believe the last shuttle back is at 8:30 PM. From the drop off point Trevi Fountain is about a 6 minute walk, the Pantheon another 5 minutes and Piazza Navonna another 5 minutes. We had the best time just wandering the streets between the Pantheon and Navonna. After 6 PM or so, after all the tour buses have left town, the city feels more intimate even in July. There is also a Metro station at Barberini and for a Euro you can go toward the Vatican in one direction or San Giovanni in the other. If you find yourself with 10 minutes before the shuttle arrives about 50M up Via Veneto from the pick up spot is a small church with the stacked bones of monks in the crypt. Cool and creepy. We found the shuttle service worked well for us and returned us nightly to the quiet of the Cavalieri. If going to the Vatican it is easier to grab a cab from the hotel and costs 7 euro. Our only real complaint was the wireless internet. While it was complimentary for us, there was about a 10 sq meter area in the room where it worked well. From the club or the balcony reception was flaky. If I had paid 20E for it, I would not be happy. This hotel is a nice sanctuary from the noise and traffic just down the hillside. In my opinion the service and quality is fitting with the Waldorf Astoria brand and we would look to stay again at the Cavalieri the next time we are in Rome.", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cStay in Central Rome\u201d", "Author": "candaceblattner", "ReviewID": "UR115391601", "Content": "We chose this hotel for our two day stay in Rome based on the high ratings and how nice it looked on the website.

True 5 star (with that touch of professional \"aloof\" that Americans find so \"unfriendly\"). It was really wonderful to be away from Rome's bustle and noise. The Cavalieri is pricey, though, and no \"points\" here; so, every euro counted. But. The rooms are HUGE by European standards and they don't charge for a roll away. It was me and my two 17 year old boys. We were all truly comfortable (and, really, any good 3-4 star triple in the heart of the city is not that far off in price from a Cavalieri room with a free roll away - check it out). Pay for the Rome view. Spectacular. Don't pay for the \"Imperial\" stuff and don't get the bed and breakfast room rate. There's a slew of Americans eating away in that category and you can't eat enough to make it worth it (even by 17 year old boy standards). Instead, simply, take a right at the hotel entrance and take the very short, easy (flat) walk to the Piazzale Medaglie d'Oro where there are two cafes, a wonderful fruit seller, everything you need (including wine merchant to take a bottle or two back to enjoy at the hotel). The cafes have lovely sandwiches, too, that you can pick up for a song and eat for picnic lunch in Rome (at the pool) or where ever. The neighborhood is fantastic; very expensive on the top of that hill the Cavalieri sits on. The valet will even give you a huge umbrella if you need it for the walk. That little piazza is a wonderful, friendly treasure at the Cavalieri's doorstep. Also - no taxi should be more than 10-12 euro anywhere you need/want to go in Rome (keep an eye on the opening price on the meter - should be 2.80 euro on weekdays and Sat - a bit more on Sunday). The pool is fantastic. And the hotel does NOT charge for swimming OR for the lounge chairs; It's the white cushions that go on the lounge chairs that are 18 euros a pop. Instead, you can use the big white towels they hand out , and which are free (btw get to the pool early on Fri and Sat if you want a good spot, and make it your own for the day by draping your stuff around - then you can leave and come back to \"your spot\"). Splurges for family: A 30 minute massage in the Cavalieri Spa - over the top special and reasonable. The Florentine steak at Il Pomodorino off the Via Veneto (can easily feed two) - the Cavalieri's concierge can set that reservation up for you.

After he attempted to get the attention of a bellman, he turned to us with a puzzled look on his face and shrugged. My wife and I then brought our own luggage into the lobby. The desk clerk was apologetic and did arrange to have the concierge store it as the room was not yet ready. We decided to have some lunch while we waited for the room to be ready. We used the hotel's restaurant. The woman who seated us was quite pleasant, but it ended there. Having been seated for less than two minutes, our waiter asked if we were ready to order. Having barely looked at the menu, I ordered a bottle of rose. It arrived promptly. The wine steward then proceeded to pour the wine and sloshed it on the table, my wife's menu and my menu, then jammed it back into the ice bucket and fled.

Upon arrival we were upgraded to a corner suite with panaramic views of the city - thank you so much! The room was well worth the extra wait (for it to be cleaned). We had seen reviews on here and the one element that caused us some small concern was the location: well, forget about those concerns, the location is perfect, far enough away from the buzz of the city to give a really relaxing experience, but close enough to be a short taxi ride (cira 10 minutes and EUR 12) or bus ride (hotel shuttle, free and takes 20 minutes) to all the main sights. The hotel itself is very luxurious and the staff are so very helpful. The rooms are great (recommend a Rome view) and the commmon areas with all the artwork are splendid. We booked Imperial, and we would urge you to do the same: getting access to the Imperial lounge and the Spa is a benefit not to be sniffed at. If you are only planning on sleeping at the hotel and not spending any other meaningful time there then the 'normal' rooms would, I am sure, be more than fine; but if you plan on relaxing at the hotel at all then please do upgrade to Imperial, otherwise you will find yourself spending a lot more money (on snacks/food and drinks, spa, pool etc) and possibly end up with a false economy. The Spa is incredible and worth a visit or two, and the swimming pool is lovely. Our room was a highlight, with its panoramic views and incredible furniture and art, but the main highlight must be La Pergola, the rooftop restaurant. We went for dinner there on my Birthday and had the nine-course tasting menu (with recommended wines), and it blew our minds. This is a must, the best restaurant I have been to. Quite pricey, but still good value!

Be aware that the other reviews are true - this is a place could be extremely expensive if not prepared. This is where the rich and famous spend their time and they don't worry about what it costs to stay alive like most of us do. This fact hit us upon arrival when we were sent away from the entrance by an enormous group of security personnel to sit down the street for about 15 minutes so the PM of Isreal could come or go. The place was covered up with Security for two days of our stay so it was probably one of the most secured areas in Rome.

Our Hilton status got us free use of the pool areas, we were able to use the Hilton Member lounge for free drinks/snacks after our long days walking through Rome, we used the 5 Euro a day parking option and the free shuttle to the city was very nice. The staff was fantastic and extremely helpful. Other Hilton members like us vacationing in Rome clearly stoodout against their normal clients who get to use the real \"Executive Lounge\" but we never felt treated differently by the staff. We did do two things at the Hotel that I highly recommend; 1) Did a private tour of Vatican arranged by the hotel that was absolutely amazing. The guide was an offical Vatican tour guide employed by the Vatican to tour/escort guests of the Popes. The Private tour of the grounds was the 5 of us truely wandering alone where the Popes have for generations and was completely away from the crowds of tourists. We got to sit alone in places were various Popes regularly sit/sat each morning to gather their thoughts and insperations. The rest of the tour throughout the Public areas of the Vatican was equally as fantastic since the guide was so very knowledgable, friendly, and interacted so very well with us. The guide paid for the cab to us from the hotel to the Vatacan, bought us water to prepare for our walk and refused to even talk to us about a tip at the end of the tour. Absolutely first class all the way. 2) Did dinner at La Pergula on the top floor at 8 pm on our last night. Fantastic food, fantastic service and the view of the city was simply breathtaking. We did Dinner early so we could see the transition from day to night and highly recommend doing it that way. (See seperate review.) Okay - so both of these events cost a bit of cash but I'm telling you without hesitation that each was absolutely fantastic.

I LOVED the location. My wife and I had a tough time deciding between here and a hotel with a city location. We could not be happier with the decision. You are outside of the city, but only by enough to climb a large hill that sits beside the city and affords a spectacular view of the eternal city. If you are considering this hotel, you probably already know it's not cheap. The additional cost of cab fare to/from the city is insignificant in my mind. We did take the shuttle a couple times and it is a very nice amenity, though it only runs once per hour. We booked an Imperial Rome view room, which gave us access to the 7th floor exec club lounge. This is a huge perk and much nicer than other lounges I have seen. They are open from early morning until 11PM daily. The club is well stocked, well staffed, and they change the food choices 5 times/ day. I highly recommend paying the extra for the club. The rooms are gorgeous. beautifully appointed, very spacious (a rarity in Europe), and with the most incredible view of Rome that I will remember forever. Don't even think about staying here without getting the Rome view- you will deeply regret missing this view and the view on the other side of the hotel really does stink. Here's a tip- pack a good pair of binoculars. It's a good way to get acquainted with the city. You can easily spot the Colosseum, Palantine hill, the Forum, St. Peter's Basilica, the Pantheon... etc. My wife and I ended every evening sitting on our balcony (usually with a bottle of wine) totally captivated by the view of the city. I saw a few reviews where people said the staff was rude. I found every employee there to be friendly, hard-working, professional and truly genuine in their desire to help. You can tell they are well trained. You can't pass a single staff member without a pleasant greeting, any time of the day or night. The concierge desk was amazingly patient in answering questions, providing directions, restaurant and tour suggestions, making dinner reservations, and even providing an AC adaptor for my laptop. The facilities and the grounds are truly outstanding. The artwork displayed throughout the hotel really gives you the feeling that you are in a truly special place. OK- I have Hilton Gold priviliges, so I did not have to pay for internet or the pool. I booked a second room for my daughter and her friend. Julia later called our room to tell me that the rate was reduced (2nd person free) and the room was upgraded to a Rome view because of the HHonors. Thank you, Julia! OK, for the bad part, and there's only one- the restaurant prices are ridiculous. We sat at the poolside restaurant for a quick lunch shortly after checking in. 39 Euros, roughly $55.00 USD, for a hamburger!!! I had a plate of risotto for about hte same cost and it was the last time we used their restaurant.

At least as good as the Breakers or Four Seasons in Palm Beach, and better than the Plaza in NYC. But note the caveat at the bottom of my review. Rome is a hectic, noisy, crowded place, but this hotel is away from all that, and set in a large property so all we heard were birds chirping and people playing at the pool. Sleeping late (if one is so inclined) is assured by the amazing shutters which roll down with the press of a button to shut out every single photon of sunlight trying to disturb you. The view of Rome is amazing. Breakfast was sumptuous.The pool was a jewel. We did not mind at all that the hotel is outside the gates of Rome. The hotel has a free shuttle to Via Veneto, and a cab to any other place was about 10 euros. (Although I think its weird that the shuttle doesn't run between 12 and 3 pm.) It was well worth the incovenience of a suburban location to gain the relaxing, quiet time we needed after a day in Rome. But be prepared for the cost. Not only are the rooms outrageously expensive, but the cost of any food you consume will stop your heart. 46 euros for tortellini! 49 euros for a hamburger! And 55 euros for loin of lamb and vegetables! For that price, it better be the loin of the mythical lamb with the golden fleece. So the Rome Cavalieri is OMG in every category. Beauty, relaxation, but also cost. Note to the management (it appears you read these reviews): When we went to the pool, the woman at the spa desk asked how she could help us and I told her we were trying to get to the pool. She then asked me if I was a \"member.\" It is a rude question to ask. As a guest of the hotel, I have the RIGHT to use the outdoor pool. I don't have to be a member of anything, and I didn't like feeling like I was someplace I didn't belong. She should have said, \"Of course, the pool is right down this hallway and through the door as the end. Would you like a chaise lounge poolside?\" I also think staff should provide towels there at the desk or at least tell me where I get them. I had to ask where the towels were, and then I was sent over to the Lifeguard, of all people, to get towels. Why is the Lifeguard at the kiddie pool in charge of handing out towels? Shouldn't the Lifeguard be dedicated to guarding lives? If for some reason yo need to know whether the person using using the pool is hotel guest or a member of the \"Club,\" then she should ask, \"Are you a member of the club, or are you a guest of the hotel?\" That way the guest immediately knows he or she is welcome as a guest. By her tone, question and response to my inquiry about the pool, she definitely made me feel unwelcome.

It is located in a suburb in the middle of no where that is 30 minutes away from the city. If you take a cab from the airport, since it is not within the walls, it is not covered under the cab flat rate of 50 Euros. It cost us about 65-70 Euros one way.

The check in rep was extremely rude reiterating again & again that 'things have changed' and \"we wouldn't have access to the imperial lounge once our points stay began.' No mention of anniversary stay even though it was in the reservation and my wife mentioned it....kept requiring verbal acknowledgment that we understood 'we wouldn't have access to Imperial lounge at 12 Noon the first day our point stay began'...Really?

The air conditioning/heating system can be rather difficult to figure out. When I noted that I was hot in the room, the front desk quickly arranged to have a portable air conditioning system. Most hotels, even luxury hotels, would not go through such an effort. Going back to the location issue, the hotel does provide a shuttle that runs frequently to a central area of Rome. A cab ride was not expensive at all. Again, the location of the hotel all comes down to what you want at your immediate doorstep.

I also noticed that those who did not like it did not temper their expectations. General problems I've seen in reviews: 1. Hilton Diamond Members. Many (but not all) of these people expect to be treated like royalty. They skew the reviews of everyone else. I've done my research on other forums like flyertalk and tracked down a couple of people doing these reviews their expectations were ridiculous. Staying at Hilton Garden Inn's through work will eventually give you Diamond status. It's funny because in the Diamond Perk's details it shows exactly what you get from a property like the Waldorf. 2. People Booking non Imperial Floor rooms. If you book an imperial floor room then the issue of nickel and diming disappear. Yes they do charge you for almost everything but you don't have to purchase the service. 3. Location Location Location. If you love public transportation and want to walk everywhere in Rome then this isn't your place. It's explicitly called out that you have to shuttle into the city. Also if you do a Google map search of the location you'll see how far it is from things like the Vatican or Coliseum. On to the Review. This was one of the best hotels I've stayed in top to bottom. I saw an amazing promo for 1/2 off the bed and breakfast rate so I booked the hotel. I am the type to take public transit and originally this wasn't the most convenient place to book, but the rate was too good to pass. Honestly from the moment I arrived to the moment I left we were treated professionally. We booked the imperial lounge based on previous reviews and I was not disappointed. If you have to choose from a Rome View or an Imperial Lounge floor room, then take the later. It is worth it especially because of the rates charged for the mini bar or restaurant. We had a view of the antenna which we didn't mind because the room was for sleeping only. We hung out in the imperial lounge drinking champagne overlooking the Vatican and Rome. We arrived around 8AM at the hotel but our room was not ready. Because we had imperial lounge access we hung out their for about 2 hours. They provided breakfast and for the other hour we decided to our the property. Because I needed wifi access they provided me with two days of free access because I had an Ipad and our room wasn't ready. Once we got to the room I realized this was an older property but the room was absolutely within our expectations. We did not use the pool because we wanted to tour the city but it was available for free to us because of Imperial lounge Access. The included breakfast there was superb except for their Japanese section, which was horrible. But once again why would I want a Japanese breakfast in Italy. Everything was fresh. The shuttle was useful as we took it in the morning and came back in the evening. It's good to take the last shuttle into Rome to find an amazing place to eat. Just take a cab back. It's about 10 euro's. The one overseen benefit of this place is the fact that it's spacious and on a hill. You don't see much grass when in Rome. Service: Top Notch. You ask and they can do. Gave us a bottle of Champagne when we came back during turn down service. Provided places to eat and directions to places to go. Room: Very spacious for Rome. Comfortable bed.

One of my biggest beefs with this hotel is that even with its pricey rate, they insist on charging you for every amenity. There\u2019s a fee to use the lackluster pool, a fee to use Wi-Fi, and a fee to get a boxed breakfast (even though breakfast was included in our room rate). Moreover, the hotel is decidedly undeserving of its Waldorf Astoria branding. The hotel and its rooms exhibit all the signs of an aging property \u2013 peeling paint, non-working lights (four in our room upon check-in), water temperature issues (half of my showers alternated between lukewarm and cold), and a mediocre breakfast buffet. The service also left much to be desired. The staff did not appear to be too concerned about our feedback, and the attitude overall was largely dismissive and somewhat arrogant. I am well aware that my opinions regarding this hotel appear incongruent with most of the other reviews here on TripAdvisor (I am sad to say this is the first time TripAdvisor has failed me on a recommendation), so perhaps my experience was simply an unfortunate incident.

I am a Gold Hilton HHonors member (same for Marriott\u2026I travel A LOT), and used points for the three nights. Per my status, we received daily Internet vouchers, access to the Colosseo Lounge (free drinks and snacks), and 2 free, small water bottles in the room each day. After the various reviews, I simply had the expectation that I was getting a free room in a nice hotel. That\u2019s it. I didn\u2019t have expectations of great service or anything like that. Truthfully, I\u2019ve had better service\u2026but I\u2019ve also had far, far worse. I would have loved a room upgrade, but the hotel was packed. Again, I had an expectation of a free room\u2026and that was met, so I can\u2019t complain. If I would have paid for the room, I would have had drastically different expectations. What I liked: ** Clean, clean, clean rooms ** seemed like a safe area; plus, the Israeli Delegation to Republic Day stayed there while we were there. ** safe in the room ** convienent, relatively private ATM machine ** Colosseo Lounge for free drinks and some snacks. ** Air-conditioning ** Prompt shuttle, polite driver ** Toiletries were Crabtree and Evelyn, and replaced daily ** Beautiful hotel ** Staff spoke great English and for the most part were very friendly. I was impressed (and they didn\u2019t laugh at my poor attempts at Italian). What I didn\u2019t like: ** There was no iron in the room. \u201cNo iron\u201d is common throughout various hotels that I\u2019ve stayed in, but I just personally like an iron. ** There also was no hot water kettle; again, simply a preference. ** I don\u2019t fully understand why the hotel guests can\u2019t use the outdoor pool for free? I had free access to the indoor pool. ** I had a full understanding of the location of the hotel but I didn't like the distance from Rome. If we were on a looser budget, I would have stayed elsewhere, but the free room was too enticing, so we dealt with it. What I really didn\u2019t like: The bellman basically stalked my husband and me about wanting to \u201ctake our bags to our room as our room might not be ready.\u201d I explained several times that I would keep my bags as a) we packed very lightly and I would be happy to carry them to the room if the room was ready \u2013 as I did over 2 countries, 3 airports, and 3 train stations; b) that I would give them the bags if the room wasn\u2019t ready, but that I needed to get some items out of the bags first. Rinse and repeat twice in the 5 minutes before I checked in! While I was checking in, and my husband had the bags a few meters away from me, the bellman came up to the receptionist. He clearly said something to the receptionist about the bags, and he turned to me and indicated that the room wasn\u2019t ready yet and that he could store my bags. Receptionist then told me that my room wasn\u2019t ready and that the bellman would take my bags. As the bellman started to take my bags, I told him to stop (as I still hadn\u2019t gotten out what I needed) and he literally stood there and waited until I finished obtaining my items. As soon as the bellman had possession of my bags, the receptionist told me that the room was ready. TO THE MANAGEMENT TEAM: As a guest, this really, really irritated me. I can deal with a dirty room - it happens. I can deal with a surly staff member - it happens. This just drove me absolutely MAD since I was very clear multiple times with my expectations. I repeated my stance on the bags to the bell staff no fewer than 3 times in the span of approximately 10 minutes. I get that the bell staff wants a tip -- they made that clear with their behavior. However, the occurrence with the receptionist and the bell-staff made me not trust her EITHER. Why should I want to hand my bags over to someone who so clearly is interested in taking them for their own purposes? Seriously, it made me wonder if they will be looking through my bags. The bell staff should BACK OFF if a guest says \u201cno\u201d -- and don't play games with the receptionist/check-in. Bottom line: I\u2019d come back, if I could use my points. I personally wouldn\u2019t pay to stay here. This level of luxury hotel is not my style at this point in my life. Tips: ** We found the shuttle to be convenient going into Rome, but not returning to the hotel (simply based on how early it stops running in the evening). ** The hotel shuttle stops running pretty early. We took the Metro to the Cirpro station, and then grabbed a taxi from there, back to the hotel. It was about 10 Euro. ** It was about 13 Euro to Termini from the hotel. ** Line up early for the shuttle bus. While we did not have difficulty getting a seat, other\u2019s did.

Very nicely appointed and luxurious. No complaints, The executive lounge was nice with free wine/champagne/beer from 11am to 11pm. We enjoyed this thoroughly. They serve some light appies and we pretty much filled up on them for dinner as unless you are rich you could never afford to eat in their restaurants. Dinner with wine would run you about 300 euros here or much more. The pool was nice and we were glad it was heated. Very large, deep and nice. The 'Hot tub' was the same temp as the pool.... not sure what the deal is with that... unusable. If we had paid to stay here and I was not a diamond member we would have been very disappointed with the price for what you get. everything here is very expensive... even 18 euro to use the outdoor pool (each) and breakfast is VERY expensive. The breakfast was easily the worst we encountered on all of our travels on this trip and we stayed at other comparable properties that were excellent such as Molino Stucky Venice, Conrad Cairo and Hilton Athens.

At their suggestion I also contacted the Concierge who was able to help me with restaurant reservations. Arrival We were picked up at the airport by Rome shuttle limousine. Their website is http://www.romeshuttlelimousine.com. Very good service, cost was 40 euros Porters were there to swiftly help us with our luggage. Check in Friendly attractive check in staff who immediately recognized me as a Hilton Gold member. Ran through the list of benefits and told me that we had received an upgrade to a Rome view. Also provided me with the vouchers/codes for the use of the wireless internet service which worked well throughout the trip Room Our room was on the 4th floor so I was a little concerned about the view. However when we entered the room we were immediately impressed with the quality of the furniture and fittings. The view was excellent. Hopefully you can see that in the pictures. Two (small) bottles of mineral water were provided and regularly replenished In addition sweets and chocolates were left on the room at night while we were out to dinner. The rest of the room you can see from the pictures. The luggage was also swiftly delivered to our room. Colosseo Lounge By now it was close to lunch time and we decided to explore the hotel before starting our sightseeing. So we wandered down to the lounge and found a welcoming if not super luxurious space. I\u2019ve also posted some pictures to help. Although not as richly furnished as some of the Hilton lounges I\u2019ve visited, or as well supplied with food, it is I believe it is adequate for the task. Free wine, beer, and sodas are provided as well as a simple array of foods. We made up a small salad and some sandwiches and that was enough to keep us going until dinner. During our stay we usually dropped into the lounge on returning from the city to enjoy up some water, soda or wine before returning to our room. L'Uliveto Restaurant and Breakfast The restaurant and terrace is located on the lower (pool) level of the hotel. Although the restaurant does not have a view of Rome it does have a pleasant pool side terrace where it was warm enough to have breakfast on two of the three days of our stay. The interior of the restaurant is pleasantly decorated and is not an unpleasant place to have breakfast. The buffet selection was excellent. They really do cover pretty much all the possible breakfast options. There are juices, cereals, various breads, fruit, yoghurt, hams, cheese as well as multiple hot options. I have never seen so many jams and preserves. Finally there are some Japanese and Asain options as well. Very comprehensive and excellent service as well. More impressions This not an ideal base for touring the center of Rome. However the hotel have mitigated that problem with their shuttle service which we found to be efficient and very comfortable. If you are reasonably fit you can walk to the Vatican from the the hotel. It took us about 30 minutes, return will be longer as it is uphill. It took us about 40 minutes so you may want a taxi for that. We also noticed that people could get dropped off from the shuttle near the Vatican. YMMV! Driving into the city by taxi averaged around 10 euros. Summary It really is a wonderful hotel with a real 5 star ambience.

My stay began wrong, because I had to argue with the front desk staff and threaten to leave in order to finally get a room with a view of the city (rather than the parking lot view which half of the guests must endure - the hotel rooms face one of two directions, towards the city view of Rome or towards the parking lot). It was a long and somewhat arduous discussion with the front desk manager. The city view is so much nicer, although for me it was an exhausting and tense conversation to get it! The rooms themselves were once magnificent, although they have not always been well cared for, as there are signs of neglect in many places. The pillows on the sofa were ripped, the drapes were quite old, the A/C system outdated and did not function (it was either too hot or too cold at all times). The hotel itself is quite grand, sitting on a large plot of land with a nice overview of the city below. After long days of walking the streets, it is nice to return to this quiet oasis. This alone might temp us to return, albeit with very low expectations. One major downside for being \"away from it all\" is that you need to get a ride to go anywhere. You can't even go to a local restaurant without taking a taxi. Plus, the taxis can be scarce at peak times. When we went to go out one morning there was a line of about a dozen people waiting to get a taxi. This also means that the hotel has you as a captive to some extent. They charge exorbitant prices for even the most-basic things (e.g., tiny bottle of still water costs $10). While Rome in general is not a cheap place, this hotel seems to takes that up a notch. The breakfast buffet in the restaurant is quite nice, and one of the better services on the property. They appear to do many large banquets/weddings there, as they are organized for large-scale coordination of serving food. Our only complaint here was the eggs - which they seem to love raw. To avoid the pre-prepared runny ones, we special ordered hard-boiled eggs twice and both times they came back liquid, and the staff didn't seem to understand why we wouldn't want to eat them that way. Talk about risk of salmonella! The gym and pools are also decent, and worthwhile if you have the energy left after touring Rome. There is of course a fee for using any of these. As a top-tier member of their hotel's frequent traveler program (HHonors), you get access to the Colosseo Lounge, where they provide you with free drinks and a few snacks. However, I found this to be a quite annoying and uncomfortable experience. The lighting in the lounge is overly bright, it was normally crowded, and rather than a \"benefit\" it felt more like a little torture to get a free drink. When we visited, one gentleman got yelled at by the staff for walking out the door with a soda in his hands as he looked for his wife. Talk about poor service! That lounge was really just was a bad experience. The best part of the hotel experience was the bedding - with oversize pillows and comfortable beds, along with the quietness of the property, we were able to rest well. Again, getting away from the hustle and bustle of the city is a big plus. Thus, overall, the hotel has much potential. The beautiful photos on their website are of course more gorgeous than anything you are actually going to see as a guest there, but it is in fact a beautiful property - and quite an accomplishment to have such a place located in the midst of a large city like Rome. I'd recommend looking elsewhere if there were better options available in Rome, but we've tried several and have yet to find \"wonderful.\"", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExpected a bit more for the money\u201d", "Author": "MaxWatty", "ReviewID": "UR107371432", "Content": "Visited Rome for the first time with my extended family to celebrate a birthday.

Thats like $38 dollars, and get this, they block netflix and movie downloads so you have to pay the $20 euro fee for their terrible movie selection. Thats 28 dollars per movie, you can't be serious.

Well, unfortunately the Waldorf Rome Cavalieri is not the place to use your points nor even pay for a stay. For the first time in all my travels have I encountered such visual image evaluating personel with no sense of knowledge of customer history. One would hope a Manager would do his research on a HHonors customer prior to arrival and make sure they are treated accordingly. Well, when using 60k points per night (in which they bill back Hhonors $$$), one would think an upgrade as a Diamond member would be automatic especially to earn future travel. Think about a Diamond member and how much one must travel and of course all the people a Diamond member must know on all his travels. Would it not occur to a Manager the valuable importance of word of mouth marketing from such a customer. Unfortunatley not at the Rome Cavalieri. Ok so a Rome City view Room is not available, one would be fine if they were to accomodate such a view with Imperial Lounge access to enjoy the view for a couple hours on your stay. Instead you get a Lounge on the ground floor with no view and if you would like the Imperial Lounge it comes at a cost of 120 Euros per day.

The concierge staff are unqualified and indescribably uninformed. My teenage son wanted to visit a music store, and he was told to go to a general intersection on the via del Corsi--a major street. No address, no phone. I thought he hadn't been clear, so I asked and got the same response. I asked for dinner reservations one day--the concierge forgot. The next day I asked for reservations at another restaurant--4 hours later he still hadn't called, saying he would wait until evening. I had to inform him they were open for lunch. Umm, isn't he supposed to know that? Watch out for the staff in the restaurant. If you are in the way, they will push past you with vigor. ALL of them. Seems customers rudely show up and should know better than to try and serve themselves at the breakfast buffet. The bellmen? Watch out for them, too. I really liked asking for a cab and having it arri e, only to have the bellman give it to the leggy blond who came after me and asked for a cab. And watch out for staff on the elevator! I had one mockingly wave at me as the door was closing while I was trying to get on. I can still hear him snickering. But the best of all was reception. My flight was delayed due to weather, so my teenage son arrived 3 hours before I did. They did not offer him a drink of water or a place to sit. He wasn't allowed to check in without me--I am okay with that--but a bit of courtesy or an offer to sit in the Hilton Honors lounge (I am gold level) would have been a small kindness. Did I mention my request for two beds was ignored? Apparently, this kind of treatment is only for regular folk--Hotel staff blocked the way to the elevator so some soccer team could ride without delay. All in all, I would rather have spent money on lodging than to put up with this pathetic excuse of a supposedly luxury hotel.

The staff are courteous and attentive, the rooms have great attention to detail and the food is exquisite. The hotel lobby is large and reminded me somewhat of the London store Harrod's: elegant, elaborate and yet still tasteful. Check-in was a breeze, despite arriving a few hours early. The polite staff really put the guest first, as you would expect at a Waldorf Astoria hotel. I cannot recommend the Imperial Club enough. Should you stay in one of the beautiful suites or Imerial rooms, you will have access to the Imperial Lounge on the 7th floor. The view overlooking Rome was the highlight for me. The most romantic moment of our trip was eating by candlelight out on one of the Imperial Lounge balconies. Breakfast with the same view was a close second! Food and drink are available 7am-11pm, so not only will you not go hungry during your stay, but you will be able to relax in a luxurious setting. It is the perfect place to escape the noise and fumes of Rome's centre. Although staying in the heart of the city is great for exploring, the location of Rome Cavalieri cannot be faulted. There is a shuttle service provided, but a taxi to Termini station only costs about 20 euros (tip included). We walked to the Vatican City from the hotel, but returned by taxi (15 euros after a little negotiation) as walking back up the hill in the heat would not have been a worthwhile experience! My only fault with Rome Cavalieri is the sound-proofing. The window shutter and mirrored pull-out door specifically created to block out sound did help, but we could hear so much from the rooms either side. Of course, it depends on whomever should occupy those rooms, but unfortunately we were adjacent to someone who liked to watch TV very loud in the early hours. I did not sleep much. I am yet to give a 5-star review as I am in search of absolute perfection, but the Rome Cavalieri was so very close.

I was perfectly fine with the location, as long as you have a room that faces the city and not the communications tower. The shuttle to downtown was very convenient and is right next to a Metro station. We went down in the morning and caught the metro and went directly to the Coliseum.

It was beautiful, but not work $110 for two people. However, seeing 8 different kinds of milk was cool (soy, almond, goat etc..) The location is the biggest problem. The shuttle is great, but it is tough to be on their schedule. Any cab is at least USD$14-16 to get back to the hotel each night.

I personally think it is great were it is located as it is in a quite neighborhood away from all the hustle and bustle of the city. also one should remember this is not a 2 or 3 or even 4 star Hotel it is rated as a 5 but I'm calling it a 5 + Most people say the food is too expensive but for the top quality food they serve especially the awesome breakfast buffet I don't think it is over priced. just remember this a Mercedes cost around $ 50,000 a Rolls Royce about $ 200.000 To me this Hotel is a Rolls Royce I can't wait until This July 2011 I will be staying At the hotel with some family members and I can't wait for them to experience this place.

We were grateful to check in early and sleep but the Hotel never moved us to a room with a bigger bed. My wife is a diamond member too! Also the room had issues with the alarm system, so every 20 minutes someone from hotel security would knock on the door and wake us up. We were both trying to sleep and they thought we were pulling the emergency cord in the bath tub. The breaker box was open and kept tripping or something because we weren't doing anything but trying to rest. Good grief... The Hotel shuttle goes to the city which is 25 minutes away... but it ends early at 8PM so you must take a cab back which can be costly, you have to pay to use the pool and service was just OK - expected much more.

I imagine this hotel must be great if you're in Rome in the summer, the pool area and gardens were really fantastic. The building exterior isn't the most beautiful but this shouldn't be a problem as most people are looking out admiring the view. My only negative point really would be the mini bar prices.........9 euros for a mini box of Pringles seems a bit steep but then I guess you're in a 5 star so it's to be expected.

We read all the reviews previous to coming and reserving our rooms - and most are spot on. The hotel is not at the \"center of the universe\" - it is a 20 - 25 minute shuttle ride to the center of Rome and a 10 minute cab ride to the Vatican museums. We took a taxi directly from the airport vs. the fast train into Rome Termini, then taking a cab or dragging suitcases to meet the shuttle to the hotel. Cost is about 50 Euro and was much quicker and not much pricier than the train/cab/ shuttle option. Take the cabs vs, the airport shuttle services which were about 20 Euro more. The rooms as stated by most reviews are very nice - very large by Euro standards. Half the rooms will face the city - the other half the apartment and the infamous \"tower\". As a Hilton Gold member, we were upgraded to a City View on a lower floor. As Gold we were also given vouchers for internet (you can use the wi-fi function on your \"smart phones\" if you don't have a pc or even a phone that works in Europe - worked great for us) as well as access to the lounge on the top floor. The lounge is a lovely place to unwind in the evening with a glass of winer, sparkling, beer or something stronger. Different times of the day/night different snack type items were put out -but don't count on it for your dinner! Yes, membership has it's priveleges - as a Gold you may eat breakfast in the lounge, or enjoy the superb breakfast spread at L'olivetto downstairs. Eating the breakfast there carried us for the rest of the day. The staff across the board was terrific. I strongly suggest going to the Hilton website and looking for \"specials\". I saw a couple on-line that were really excellent deals that included the above mentioned excellent breakfast buffet. At that point it becomes an a real all around deal compared to alot of hotels in the area. While in Rome we booked several tours through Viatour - a large tour consolidator. We used them for several tours throughout our trip. Viaotur was very easy to use, both by phone and the internet. Two of our tours were over the top and I would very strongly recommend them. The half day Vatican tour and half day Coliseum tours presented by \"Dark Rome\" were phenomenal (prices direct with Dark Rome or Viatour were about the same). The knowledge of our tour guides totally made the experience. The groups are kept small - 20 for the Vatican and 25 for the Coliseum - made for a more personalized experience. The guides had wireless microphones while we carried receivers with an ear plug. This allowed us to wander a bit while the guide was talking without always being bunched up together. Be prepared to walk! Our evening bus ride to the monuments was a mediocre selection at best and we wouldn;t recommend. Last bit of advice. We took trains between Rome and our other destinations. I strongly recommend going directly to the \"Trenitalia\" web site vs. going to Eurail. Hit the British flag on top of the site and it will be in English. This allowed us to find the very best fares and was a real bargain compared to Eurail. As an example - we used a \"Mini\" fare between Venice and Milan and it was 18 Euro for the both of us - I saw someone who purchased a ticket same day - 62 Euro. Personally, you do not need to upgrade to 1st Class - 2nd Class was more comfortable than your average airline coach seat. Italy and Europe in general are very expensive by American standards - don't come and carp that everything is soooo expensive - it just is! You order from room service - it will become your conversation starter with your friends when you tell them how you spent $55 for a turkey sandwich and a piece of cake. Don't ruin your holiday by fretting about the cost of everything - you have been forwarned! Bottom line, we would strongly recommend using this hotel as your Roman base!", "Date": "February 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cOh, the view!\u201d", "Author": "flyntasticmom", "ReviewID": "UR96391653", "Content": "My husband and I went to the Cavalieri for our anniversary with our dear friends who were celebrating the end of a difficult year as they had battled Leukemia .

We were upgraded to a room with a view of Rome (561) but not an Imperial Room, although we did have access to the Imperial Club (the Colosseo lounge was closed, perhaps they have read the bad reports on it)! If we had not have had the view of Rome or had the view from the Imperial Club I would not have been impressed with this hotel as the back view is of a phone mast and apartment block! The hotel was not at all busy so normally you would expect an upgrade which luckily we go (though to only 5th floor) and also our request for a late check out was denied which although not too much of a problem was a bit odd seeing as they were not busy. We at breakfast at L'Uliveto restaurant rather than in the Imperial as the spread was better. In fact breakfast choice was excellent, room not busy and food was lovely. The food in the Imperial was also good (not as good as the Hilton Arc de Triomphe, Hilton Waldorf London or Park Lane Hilton though) but they serve sandwiches and cakes throughout the day and also they serve alcohol until 10.30pm at night which is a bonus as you are not near any restaurants. After this, we went down to the lobby to listen to the pianist. Friday night's pianist was excellent but such a shame that the bar area was not busier. We walked into Rome on our first day to the Vatican (Around 30 minutes downhill) - turn left out of the hotel, right at the mini roundabout, left at the traffic lights (or down the stairs on the left) and head towards the dome and keep straight, you come to some steps which take you up to the Vatican Museum and a v lovely walk. The other days we got the free shuttle which was excellent. A cab from the Vatican cost 10 Euros. We did the usual tourist sites and didn't find any of them that busy, we also did an open top bus tour which was OK (We did 110 Route think other buses looked better). We did get ripped off eating out, which I rectified by not leaving a tip and I had my hair mousse taken off me on the return flight just before boarding as it was flammable - she let me keep my lighter though).... Overall hotel location lovely for amazing views of Rome but ONLY if you get a front facing room. Our room was definitely tired looking, bath was old, carpet was ripped by the patio doors and paint all scuffed. But it was very clean (balcony a bit shabby), bed very comfy, large room, great view.

That being said, the location was pretty bad, you're far from everything. I'm a frequent Hilton guest and used my points for a free room (4 nights VIP rewards), which made it even more of a bargain option for me. We had a room on the 4th floor with a balcony and beautiful view of St Petere's basilica-Vatican City. The amenities in this hotel are incredible-plush beds, huge bathroom, 2 closets, bathrobes and slippers, even a little area that you close off near the door to help sound proof your room. I also had free access to the Imperial room and spa, which the room is on the 1st floor and you have to consume everything \"In\" the room. Snacks are very light, nuts, chips, and finger sandwhiches. Free wine, sodas, and water and the room is open 11-11. The hotel breakfast is phenominal-traditional breakfast of eggs, meats, etc or a Japanese breakfast, gluten free options and even a fruit smoothie bar w/blender! My daughter and I tried to outsmart the taxis because they charged more on Sundays and take the metro/bus to the hotel. We managed but it wasn't easy w/luggage so don't bother. Get a cab. It bothers me that the hotel shuttle can't go to the termini metro stop, would make it so much more convenient for their guests. The shuttle runs hourly and we took it the whole time except for 1 morning we took a cab to the vatican and it was (I think) about 15 euros which we included a tip. Swimming pool was so nice and warm (indoor) and the gym is huge! You miss out on the sounds of Rome-church bells, convenience of evening gellato runs, etc, but you do get big hotel amenities. Not sure if I'd stay here again for that reason (but given the room was free for me, this would be a hard call)-would rather soak in all of Rome-but make no mistake, the hotel is amazing!", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Freiburg", "Title": "\u201cluxurious interior\u201d", "Author": "kwc196", "ReviewID": "UR88382892", "Content": "The Cavalieri is an unusual deluxe hotel, as it is located atop a hill overlooking Vatican city and Rome, which both makes it much quieter and more remote than its competition.

It was the best hotel experience we've ever had. Here is what I encountered firsthand. The exterior of the hotel is actually quite nice, but the interior is incredible. The works of art surpass many museums. We were amazed. The Colosseo executive lounge was large and airy... I honestly have no idea why it has gotten such criticism from a few folks. It is modern and well lit. I loved the design and decor. Two walls are glass -- one glass wall looks into the hallway (with some great paintings by the way) and the opposite glass wall looks out on a private patio. There are ten tables that sit four people each, so there's seating room for 40. There is a large glass refrigerator that holds juice, soda and several quality beer selections. There is also coffee, tea, red wine, white wine and champagne. Food is \"snacky\" such as nuts, finger sandwiches, etc. Our room was gorgeous. The rooms are designed to feel like a mini-suite, and the woodwork is beautiful. The marble bathroom is quite large. The balcony is also large and has complete privacy from neighboring balconies. The side walls of the balcony have mirrors, which is a novel way to make the view even more striking. We were fortunate to be upgraded to a Rome-view room, which overlooked the City and also the Vatican, not to mention the beautiful grounds. We will never forget sitting on the balcony drinking champagne. It was among the most romantic settings we've ever experienced. The location of the hotel is, as everyone knows, on a hill on the outskirts of the city. To us that was a huge advantage. The city itself tends to be dirty, noisy and crowded, and the Cavalieri served as our \"retreat\". True, it wasn't convenient to all the historic sites, but the shuttle ran like clockwork and we had no problems getting around. Restaurants are in walking distance (20 minutes). The breakfast buffet was without question the most varied, luxurious and decadent spread we've ever seen. It had everything. For example, there were fifteen different types of jams! If I were to rate all of the breakfast buffets in my life from 1 to 10, this would be a 12. The spa was also incredible. I loved the Turkish bath (a huge steam room), which had a cold plunge pool inside of it and a large jacuzzi nearby. I'm shocked and a more than a bit embarrassed by Hilton members who complain about the Diamond perks. Wow, what can I say. Upgraded room; unlimited wine, beer and champagne; free use of the spa; free Internet; and the most amazing breakfast buffet ever. The service was also exceptional. As a Diamond member, I was greeted in a special check-in area. We were treated almost like royalty. Our luggage beat us to our room. We were personally escorted to our room by Mr. Khaled, the manager on duty. He couldn't have been nicer. I also had the opportunity to meet the General Manager, who is a truly great guy. He obviously lives and breathes the Cavalieri and takes great pride in it (to say the least). We discussed briefly why the Cavalieri has taken a beating from a few posters, and he was sincerely perplexed because he feels that they work hard to make every stay a memorable one. They certainly did that for us. I guess it's obvious by now that I love the Cavalieri and can't recommend it highly enough.", "Date": "November 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alliston, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel but a disappointed HH Diamond member!!!\u201d", "Author": "Ragu_ON", "ReviewID": "UR87702293", "Content": "We were so captivated with this hotel 2 years ago ( Sept/2008) that we had to come back to enjoy the splendor of this fine hotel.

I was a bit concerned considering some of the reviews that I had read; however, the experience that we had at the hotel erased all of the negative reviews that I had read. Below is a highlight of our experience: Limo service - We arranged to be picked up at the airport to avoid and hassles of trying to explain where we were staying. We were prompted met at \"the meeting point\" at the airport and quickly brought to the hotel. We felt that this was money well spent. Originally, we had only arranged the service to the hotel, but was so satisfied that we arranged for the service for our return. Just a note about driving in Rome - Rome drivers are probably some of the most aggressive drivers that I had ever seen in all of my travelers so I would never suggest driving here. There were a couple of times that I just had to close my eyes and stop looking at the speedometer. Hotel - From the moment you stepped foot on property, you knew that you were at a 1st class resort. Upon check-in, Julia brought us to a private area for VIP check-in (Diamond HH member). She was wonderful in explaining all of the amenties and advise us that we were upgraded to a room with a view of the city. The room was absolutely great. It was a huge room by Europe standards with a balcony (all rooms here have a balcony). Executive lounge - This is the only area that I would be a little critical of. In most Hilton properties, the executive lounge has a private access. At the Cavalieri, it is down the hall on the first floor. It just seems that anyone could walk in (although they asked for your room number). In my opinion, the Imperial level should be your executive level and it was give your distinguish guests a better overall experience. Room service - Although I read bad reviews about the price of room service, I would tell everyone that it is worth the price. One of the night, we did not feel like going out and finally gave in to the \"expensive\" price of room service. When they delivered our food to our room, we got over the sticker shock. The presentation was gorgeous and we felt like we had our own private dining room in our room. Shuttle service - This is a wonderful service offered by the hotel.. The shuttle was prompt and was a great money saver. We took at taxi to the Vatican on one of the days of our vacation and it was 15 Euro. Trust me this service is a true benefit and worth tipping the driver considering the cost savings. The drop off/pick up location is easy to find. Gym and spa - This property has a full gym with state of the art equipment. With the exception of the Hilton - New Orleans, I have never seen a better gym in all of our travels. Nearby restaurants - Believe it or not, there are restaurants near the hotel if you don't mind a little walking time. We ate at 2 wonderful neighborhood restaurants and got the chance to witness a true Italian eathing experience. Finally, I know that individuals complain about the huge tower in front of the hotel, but here is a good thing about it - it can help you find the hotel when you are walking. One day, we decided to be adventureous and walk from the Vatican back to the hotel. We did use the tower as our guide. Although it was quite a long walk, we felt like we had won \"the Amazing Race\" when we got back to the hotel. Thanks to the tower we were able to find the hotel. Without it, we would probably still be looking for our way back. Overall - I would highly recommend the Rome Cavalieri for its outstanding service. The hotel website is on target - you know exactly what your experience will be.

The gym was definitely the best I have ever seen in any hotel I have ever stayed, easily competitive with any fancy chain fitness center. ( I admit that gym was compliementary).

And marble inlay on bathroom floor. And smaller recessed ceiling accent lighting using halogen bulbs not those ugly CFL bulbs. These features make the room a step above most high-end rooms. The room looked just like the website photos. We chose a non-city view since there were many trees that have grown up to block the view. Excellent value since we booked the advanced non refundable rate. The buffet breakfast had the largest selection of jams I have ever scene- 21 and 11 types of milk. Only downsides were location- must use their free hotel shuttle or taxi to get into city since location is on top of a hill- no sidewalks along busy steep road. Also, they charge for the outside pools but there is no sign as you walk into outside pool area stating so and it's a whooping 16 Euros per person per day. Never heard of a hotel charging for a pool. This is a horrible trend. There is a free indoor pool. Very nice. TIP: Hotel shuttle runs hourly on the half hour into the city and drops you off at Piazza Barbarini Square. (close to most things) Return is on the hour and stops at 8pm (20:00) TIP: GET ROMA PASS 25 Euros at most tobacco stands- gets you onto subways for free and by pass Colosseum lines.

A lot of people have commented on the location, I have to say I loved the location and never once had an issue taking the shuttle, Any time the shuttle was overloaded the Hotel arranged for complementary taxis for the guests that did not fit on the bus.

The bathroom fixtures were not working properly and we had to repeatedly call for service.

First impressions Driving up to the hotel by the hotel shuttle bus felt a bit disappointing. The building, especially in daylight, isn't very attractive. Once you walk up in doors that changes, though. It feels like an American hotel at this point. The room Reception upgraded us to a Club room on the higher floors. The room was spacious, the bed was every bit as comfortable as it looked. The colour of the furniture felt a bit dated although everything was in pristine condition. The bathroom was spacious and well-appointed. About the view from the room - The Cavalieri is located in the hills with, from some parts of the hotel, views over the city and the Vatican. The room from our room was not very good, however. We were located on the \"wrong\" side of the building facing the hill side. The room has a big balcony but with that kind of view and very basic furniture, it isn't very tempting to use. The breakfast The breakfast was served indoors and outdoors by the pool. The selection was vast and the quality was good. Facilities The Cavalieri hosts hundreds of works of art around the building, especially on the banquet floor beneath the reception. Definitely worth to tour the hotel. Overall Staying in a Club room entitled us to use the club lounge. I'm not big on hotel lounges, I really don't understand the concept, however the lounge was nicely decorated, service was efficient and the view was wonderful (the right side of the building) - especially from the balconies.

My wife and I arrived by taxi from the airport through the usual \"do I really want to visit this place\" areas and arrived at the hotel which surprised me even though I had seen the pictures - I assume it is an early sixties building but has aged well! Got out of car, staff took luggage, welcomed by reception staff. Asked if I wanted the free upgrade to the Imperial Floor (HHonors Diamond member!) or the chargeable upgrade to a suite. Were shown both rooms and given a choice - opted for the suite on the third floor rather that the Imperial Room on the seventh. Seventh has the better view (the trees prevent some from seeing a great view of St Peters) but the suite was awesome! Signed in, went to room, luggage arrived. All the staff were incredible helpful - nothing was too much trouble. Suites and Imperial rooms give access to the Imperial Lounge (Executive Lounge in normal Hilton terms) - food available all the time, drinks available most of the time (unlike in UK where they tend to lock the alcoholic drinks away at 8:00pm). If you have had a reasonable lunch the \"snacks\" here will quite happily do as a light dinner.

We stay there 2-3 times each year for 5-10 days per stay so feel pretty familiar with the property (most recently this September). Value of Imperial Floor Upgrade: First, Diamonds used to be regularly upgraded to an Imperial Floor room... but this seems to have become extremely rare... even when the hotel is quite empty. If the Imperial Lounge was even a shadow of its old self, then paying the up-charge would be a no-brainer. Currently, its sort of a toss-up and I am not certain whether we will bother with the upgrade when visiting in January. The food in the Imperial Lounge has declined dramatically and is really not worth eating. Also, the drink options are diminished. Staff attentiveness is mixed. On each shift there seems to be one person who might be helpful. Most of the lounge staff struggle to avoid eye contact lest they be asked to do something. The decline in the lounge is dramatic in comparison to 5 years ago... and more subtle in comparison to more recent stays. The view remains as remarkable as ever and the porch (in good weather) is a wonderful place to have coffee or answer email. A nice feature of the Imperial floors is the \"ironing room\" near the Imperial Lounge (not sure if there are ironing rooms on the other floors). The rooms on the Imperial floor have nicer toiletries, etc than the rooms on the other floors. If you stay on the Imperial floors avoid room 842 which is next door to a very large house keeping facility with an automatic door that slides open every time someone walks past in the hallway. Each time it opens, the door shakes room 842. We spent one night in this room and changed rooms the next day. Desk staff insisted that the sliding door was not a problem but did (rather cooly) move us to another room. Also the wireless internet does not work in room 842 (or at least did not during our stay). La Pergola: A fabulous restaurant, expensive but worth it. Given the situation at the Imperial Lounge, we sometimes came up to Pergola for a better quality glass of wine and a snack. Equally great view. So one option is to skip upgrade to Imperial Lounge and have a few glasses of much better wine at La Pergola. A small complimentary snack was served. Jacket required. Internet: Gold and Diamond receive free wireless... this did not used to be the case at the Cavalieri ... it is normally very expensive (something like $27 Euro per day). I realize that this is a Hilton-wide policy and not unique to the Cavalieri ... but its a big improvement anyway. Breakfast: Breakfast has also declined over the years, but it is still very good. I would only avail myself of it for free as it is very expensive otherwise. Again the breakfast staff seem to have attended the same training as the lounge staff which permits them to avoid all eye contact with customers and breeze right by. If one is able to flag one down... they were unfailing polite. We much preferred the breakfast offerings downstairs to the breakfast at the Imperial Lounge. Of course, if a porch seat is available, and the weather is fine, sitting outside and soaking in the view is hard to beat at the Imperial Lounge. Location: Ok, this is a topic where reasonable people might disagree. But I LOVE the location. Quiet is rare in Rome ...or most big cities... and the Cavalieri is quiet (the design of the rooms help on this issue also). The Shuttle makes runs to town (except Sunday) and Taxis are cheap (be sure the meter is set to zone #1 within the central city, including Cavalieri). On this last trip, our Shuttle driver was rude and obviously disdainful of the passengers. Shut the door in an older passenger's face as he tried to board and made a rude gesture at him. Also more frequent shuttle runs would reduce crowding. City View Rooms: If one is staying on the Imperial Floor ... I see little reason to pay extra for the city view as the lounge has the best view of all. If not staying on an Imperial Floor, the city view is often obstructed by trees unless the room is on 5th or 6th floor. Colosseum Lounge: This is a miserable space. Bright white and overly lit. Food and drink are even more limited than in the Imperial Lounge. Skip it. Bad even for free. Overall: We still like the Cavalieri. Concierge desk still very helpful. Fitness facility unusually good (especially for Rome). The artwork on display is remarkable, the best I have ever seen in a hotel. The grounds and solitude are unsurpassed in Rome. However, perhaps there has been a change in management over the last couple years as there has been a substantial decline in the lounges and in the attitude of the desk staff. Also, previous Diamonds received various perks like newspaper, gift, sparking wine upon arrival, etc. This month we received none of these. We did get water in the room each day and this was greatly appreciated.

It was on the lowest floor and nothing to write home about. We were granted access to the \u201cExecutive Lounge\u201d which is about a 20x20 room with a very small patio attached. The room is kept EXTREMELY cold and the food offerings consisted of items rotated throughout the day which ranged from green or pasta salad, potato chips, nuts, a bar mix of some type and sandwiches of mostly bread-hardly any meat and always a slice of cucumber on top\u2026as if that can camouflage how chintzy and ultimately disappointing and flavorless the item you just picked up is! There were ample soda/juice/coffee/tea options but the only choice of alcohol were some second rate wines and prosecco. Honestly, my husband and I had a good chuckle at the entire set up and would have been completely pissed if we had actually paid for this place. As this was my birthday trip my husband tried to get us reservations at La Pergola. The concierge basically turned up his nose saying that it was not possible\u2026.I\u2019m a foodie, we\u2019ve eaten at Michelin rated restaurants before\u2026it\u2019s always possible! Whatever, we heard from another couple who dined there that it was overrated and the service was snooty so we saved ourselves $400+. Be warned that you want to be lined up for the shuttle at least 10 min. before it\u2019s supposed to leave if you want a seat\u2026coming and going. (Also, and they won\u2019t tell you this unless you specifically ask, there is a public bus not a 5 min walk away which runs every 10-15 min and costs a Euro to get over to the city. It runs until midnight (bus #913).) And, there is always cab service which will set you back a few Euros but it is convenient. Now, let\u2019s talk about breakfast! On first blush it appears to be a fine spread and, in some respects it is, however, while there were ample servers we could never seem to get coffee refills (we had this same issue in Sorrento so maybe it\u2019s just an Italian thing?), the egg selection offered was HORRIFIC\u2026the \u201comelette\u201d was a cold, rubbery, corrupted version of its elegant French cousin, the scrambled eggs were runny and lukewarm, and the \u201cfried\u201d egg looked baked actually and was tepid and rubbery as well. No seasonings on table (salt/pepper should be de rigueur). The meat selection was nice and well stocked as were most of the other offerings. I just expected more considering the establishment. I should say that we experienced the same issue with the eggs each day we dined there so it was not just a one-time occurrence. There were several conferences going on while we were there (Bank of America being one of them) and the noise from the on-going set ups was, at times, distracting. As far as it being expensive; yes, it is and they don\u2019t make any apologies about it but when heading to this sort of property it should be expected. Overall impression is that it\u2019s just a former Hilton that they spruced up by adding some fancy furniture to the common areas and some nice artwork. Using total generalities, the staff is LAZY in every respect and then gives attitude-and not the good kind. In my book, if you want to be a 5 star property, SERVICE should be your first priority because when it comes down to it, pretty things are nice to look at but what people remember is how they were treated. Please, if anyone from Waldorf Management or Guest Services happens to read this, don\u2019t bother sending the pedestrian \u201cThank you for choosing/we apologize for\u201d reply\u2026focus your attention on your staff and kindly remind them they are in the \u201cservice industry.\u201d", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cA glorious end to our honeymoon...\u201d", "Author": "kdch1", "ReviewID": "UR81762463", "Content": "We stayed here for the last 3 nights of our honeymoon.

As business brought me back to Rome, I booked another stay. it is often the case that you see far more of any hotel's flaws on the second visit. I am please to say that I found the Rome Cavalieri to be at least a good overall as my last visit, and as I experienced some additional amenities, and with a change in the Hilton frequent stayer program, perhaps even a bit better. The stay started poorly. As my arrival in Rome was in the very early morning, the start of my booking was made for the evening before. I emailed the hotel to let them know that I would arrive early in the morning, and to hold my room for this early arrival. Unfortunately, this was not done, and my reservation was cancelled as a \"no-show\". Thankfully, the hotel was not full, and the end result of this situation was the need for the hotel to manually recreate the reservation. This took nearly 30 minutes, and created an unfortunate bad impression at the start. This was the only service lapse during my visit. I was again upgraded to a view room on the Imperial floor. The view over Rome remains incredible. Since my last visit, Hilton has begun to offer free internet to its Gold and Diamond (I am Diamond) members at all of its hotel, and one of my key complaints - 30 euros per day for internet - went away. The internet worked well. My service requests were responded to very promptly, generally within five minutes. The Imperial Lounge continues to have a very good breakfast, including bagels, french toast, eggs (a bit runny), bacon, cereal and lots of fresh fruit. There is food of varying types offered throughout the day. During this visit, the check-in staff let me know that I could also have breakfast without charge in the dining room. The buffet here was very large. This trip, I did use the pool/spa/exercise facility, and believe that it is the best of its kind in Rome. Free use is given for Imperial floor. I also ate two dinners at the hotel (last visit I did not have the opportunity to do so), and the pasta and main courses were very well prepared, and room service, with an oven as part of the delivery cart, was also very good. Rooms on the Imperial floor are very quiet, thanks to the soundproof closable door in the vestibule of each room. This remains a very high priority for me. The downside of the hotel remains its location. While the walk to St. Peters is only around 3 km, it is over some steep hills. The shuttle was completely filled one morning, which resulted in the need to take a cab.

Firstly given it was mid august we figured it would be a nice respite from the heat and secondly given we were driving It was more accesible by car than some of the hotels in the centre. The hotel delivered on both these points and was pretty accesible from Rome Fiumicino airport from where we were travelling. The hotel itself is very odd - and feels like you are staying in a 1960s office block, there Is a good reason they don\u2019t show that many photos of the hotels fa\u00e7ade on the internet. If you're lookng for a historic experience, this is most definitely not the hotel for you! The interior \"design\" in the communal areas was also patchy, again the photographs on the website were very good, as in the flesh there was definitely an uncomfortable juxtapposition of 1960s fixtures and fittings vs antiquities - not in a cool way either. That said the room itself was very comfortable, and pleasant - (once you were inside looking out!), and having paid EUR 75 extra for a city view room we had a very pleasant evening on the balcony which had beautiful panoramic views over rome (nb. you should get a room on the top floors if you want to see the Vatican which costs ANOTHER EUR 250+)\u2026 On this note you should be aware before you book the hotel that absolutely EVERYTHING costs extra - I appreciate in high end hotels that this Is often the case having stayed in many. But when, as a paying guest, you have to pay to park the car, for the spa facilities, to get a sun lounger by the pool, and your burger in the pool bar costs EUR 30, the blatant profiteering leaves a bad taste\u2026. It should also be noted that when we declined to pay extra for the lounger the spa staff were very snooty -- apparantly they couldn\u2019t grasp the concept that we were not interested in paying on principal and because we only wanted to swim for 30 mins before we left, not because we couldn\u2019t afford it. Additionally the changing areas were very poor and dated and yet again there was no shampoo, shower gel or conditioner in the showers. Extraordinary!

We have nothing but good things to say. In the thick of the summer heat, there is, without a doubt, no better place to stay in Rome than this hotel, which has the true feel of a luxury resort in the hills overlooking the city. The massive, magnificent swimming pool (one of several on the property) was a glorious relief after hot days of seeing the sights and great for a full day of just plain relaxing. The grounds were extensive, beautifully landscaped and well-maintained. The hotel is luxurious and comfortable. Our room was spacious and elegantly furnished. Our bathroom was well-equipped and we were happy to find a US-style shower. True, the Rome Cavaliere is a 12-minute cab ride from the city center sights and restaurants ($12 to $20 US each way and readily available) but figure that into your trip plans--it is well worth the additional expense, especially in the warmer months. You do have to figure on taking cabs, as the hotel is in the middle of what is essentially its own hilltop park and we didnt' see anything you could walk to from here. There is a shuttle bus, but it never fit into our plans and with just one dropoff/pickup point in the city center, wasn't particularly useful. But I digress. Tthe fitness center was expansive, well-equipped and as good as we have seen in any 5-star hotel. The indoor pool was also large and gorgeous. Everything was quite up-to-date. Try to get a room overlooking the garden, which also gives you a city view of Rome. The staff was very nice, helpful and friendly. There was never the feeling they had their hands out for a tip. Pool staff was equally so. The trick here, especially if you are coming for the pool, is to stay in a room on an Imperial Floor, which will include the cost of sunbeds at the pool plus access to their lovely Imperial Lounge, with views and balcony tables overlooking all of Rome, plus a great place for your breakfast or light snacks/drinks the rest of the day. Cost of internet is high, it's true, but certainly not a deal-breaker. This is not a hotel for those on a tight budget, but if you are willing to pay for a top hotel, you should be quite happy here. Not sure I would stay here in the winter time, however, the courteous service, indoor pool and spa, and excellent accomodations might beckon even in the cooler months. We booked through American Express Platinum travel service and were greeted in our room with a chilled bottle of Proseco and sweets, as well as receiving other special amenities during our stay.

For a family with small children it offers the perfect balance between sightseeing and relaxation by what must be Rome's best outdoor pool. We took advantage of Hilton's little publicised \"family promotion\" which gave the second (children's) room at half price and included free food and drink for the kids when ordering off the children's menu. A fantastic deal when you have 4 children! We also opted for two Imperial rooms, giving access to the Imperial Club, a very nicely appointed \"lounge\" with great views over Rome, providing breakfast, a light lunch, afternoon tea, pre and post-dinner snacks and drinks, all complementary and open throughout the day. Again, a great facility when you have small children who need quick snacks and drinks at all hours, particularly on returning from a thirsty morning wandering around the dust of the Colleseum and Forum. The icing on the cake is complementary access to the fantastically equipped gym and pools (beware: \"ordinary\" room guests must pay a hefty charge to use the pools, which would strike most guests as odd). We ate every night at the poolside Ulvieto Restaurant which combines great cooking with impeccable and friendly service. The 3 Michelin starred rooftop restaurant was closed during our stay but we were more than happy with what its little sister had to offer -- clearly there is some cross-fertilisation between the two kitchens. Throughout the hotel, the service is top notch and genuine, with nothing too much trouble. The warmth and tolerance shown to our children was particularly notable, even by Italian standards. We ended up spending a fair amount on taxis as although the shuttle bus into town is useful, with 2 possible stops (first near Popolo, then near Barbarini), we found the return trip of limited use as invariably we ended the day on the other side of town and didn't want to return by foot to the pick-up point and wait for the shuttle. This is however a small price to pay for the privilege of retreating to the calm of the Cavalieri and a dip in the pool! My only gripe (and it's one I have with many hotels of this type) is the lack of complimentary wifi access for Imperial rooms (with all the other freebies on offer, charging 22 euros a day for something with no marginal cost to the hotel doesn't stack up).

Rooms , if you staying in the front at least you have a Rome panaromic view but if you are staying at the back all you have is gardener noise. Really annoying. And best part is yet to come. They charge you for everything. Minibar prices are like four star michelin restaurant. You are charged 10 \u20ac fro beer which is almost same price in a very poshy italian resturant. Even water is really 2 times more expensive than average cafe. Yet, they have pool and spa if you dare to pay. Otherwise as a guest you can not use these facilities. For example they charge you 8\u20ac per person cushion fee for using the outside pool. Even internet in the business center ( not your room business center !!!) is a rip off can you imagine a hotel without internet or printing services in business center......I will not spend more time on this topic as they have millions of these type of charges.

The restaurant up top is fabulous if you have ~400 Euros to drop on a dinner for 2. I think at the time we went, they had the #1 chef in the world there. Amazing view of St. Peter's basilica at dinner. I feel, as a whole, if you drop as much dough on this place as most people do, you should not have to pay for things like access to the spa. The spa was awesome but you had to pay a stiff daily fee to go and sit in the sauna or turkish baths. They charged you by the minute to use their internet downstairs and we actually had to print something (cost ~7 Euros total for about 5 minutes on the computer and one page printed). I hate places that nickel and dime you. Also, it is far from the city center and secluded and you have to take the crowded (free) shuttle or a cab. Point of advice on a cab. . . negotiate the rate before hand. They sometimes go the long way up there so they can charge you more. The up side is that it is very quiet. I'm used to free breakfast, free spa access, and free wi-fi at 3 and 4 star hotels, but maybe I'm spoiled.

We arrived at Rome Cavelieri after hiking for last few days in the Swiss Alps and perhaps were not looking quite the hoity toity expected of the Cavalieri crowd, we got the caverlier attidude of the Cavalieri front desk! With two young kids in tow, I was told that I did not read the fine print that room had a restriction on number of guests per room and the manager can make a call on whether she could accomodate us. But this is where Rome Cavaleri showed its true colors! Yes there was a misunderstanding on my part on the number of guests that were allowed in a room since I did not read the fine print. Yes, the manager on duty offered me another room, but it was on a separate floor and I told her that we have small children and we need to be together in the same room or in adjoining rooms. She told me that they were fully booked and there in nothing more she could do. At that point she bluntly said \"let me get the bellboy to bring your bags out\". Here I am with my family, just arrived in a new country, during peak summer holidays completely dumbfounded with that response! There was absolutely no offer to help us find another hotel, or any other help!! Whatever happened to the Hilton's statement --\"Be My Guest\" is still the gracious and warm way we want for our guests to feel at Hilton hotels and resorts?!? I very politely asked if as a courtesy I could use their wifi to find ourselves a hotel in Rome. I was asked for my passport information (which I gave) to be able to use the internet and was politely asked for a credit card to pay for the service! For me to spend 12 euros/hour did not pinch but was quite amusing that the \"courtesy\" meant allowing me to sit in their lobby while I frantically searched for hotels online. I have no arguments with the stated hotel policies of number of people in the room. However when it comes to number of guests per room, I wonder what was meant by the statement by one of the front desk receptionist when she said that it \"depends on the manager's decision\". What I question is the criteria the manager use to make that decision--did she judge us by the our appearance (hicking gear and all), or some other arbitrary subjective criteria? What are Hilton's policies on this and how can we be assured that I, my family or may staff who travel with me will not be subjected to this humiliating experience in future. As a disclosure, I travel widely and have been to over 60 countries and typically stay at the such 5-star hotels and am a diamond/platinum member for most of the hotel chains.

We had one 'issue' during our stay, but the hotel's response to it only improved our opinion of the place. We arrived via taxi from Rome Termini train station, which cost about 20 Euro. As some reviews have noted, the outside is nothing special...very \"1960s\" facade, but nothing terrible. The entry way is very nice with excellent doormen. On our arrival there was a Ferrari 458, and Lamborghini Guillardo in the parking lot, so we figured it might be an OK hotel! The lobby is spectacular, with some great artwork all around and a spiral staricase leading down to the lower level where the 'cheaper' restaurant is located. We were fairly early, and our room wasn't ready, but we were given a pass to the Imperial Lounge to wait, and the Concierge took our luggage. As an aside, when booking we HIGHLY recommend getting the Imperial level. The perks include unlimited food and beverages in the Lounge (nothing to go, you must consume in the lounge), as well as admission to the pool and spa, which otherwise costs extra. For the additional cost we felt like we got our money's worth. The view from the balcony tables at the Imperial Lounge is incredible, with the city vista laid out in front of you. Slightly to the right is the Vatican, and the Vittoriano very prominent, with the Colloseum also visible....just a beautiful view (see the pics). Our room was just a few doors from the lounge, so our balcony view was almost identical. We also highly recommend the extra for a city view room. As another reviewer mentioned the view from the other side of the hotel is nowhere near as spectacular. The room itself was a King Deluxe, with a VERY comfortable bed with lots of pillows. The bathroom was huge with a great shower and lots of mirrors. Everything worked, including the AC, which we found can sometimes be a challenge in Italy. One point though, irons are not provided, though the hotel will wash and/or press clothing. Still...when a $49 Super 8 at home has irons you kinda wonder why this place doesnt... In addition to the Imperial Lounge, the amenities include a beautiful pool area with an olympic pool, a kids pool, and an indoor pool. US visitors may find it a bit odd that the pools close early (8pm), but they are very nice, with a bar located by the olympic pool. The indoor pool is adjacent to the olympic pool, and part of the spa complex. We didn't take advantage of the spa services, but did spend a little time in the Amethyst Pool...basicaly a very nice hot tub, and very private. We didn't eat at either of the two restaurants during our stay. We had planned on one night at the rooftop restaurant \"Pergola\", but a jacket is required for men, and I hadn't packed one. It is supposed to be one of the best in Rome though, so next time I will. Each night after sightseeing we spent some time on the balcony at the Imperial Lounge drinking a glass of wine or champagne and enjoying the late night snacks (which were wonderful). We also had breakfast each day in the lounge. They offer a good selection including bacon and eggs, french toast, a wide variety of fruit, cereal, and pastries. For the more continental tastes there was also prosciutto and a lot of cheeses. Several juices, both fresh and bottles and tea and coffee rounded out the menu. Overall a great breakfast buffet! Lunch and light dinner is also served in the lounge, free of charge for Imperial level guests, and seemed to be sandwiches, pasta salads, fruit, etc. The hotel location is mentioned as a negative by some reviewers, and it is beyond walking distance from the city center, but the hotel has a shuttle which operates to Piazza Barberrini every hour on the :30 mins (9:30, 10:30, etc) and back every hour on the hour. Though we found the hard way that the shuttle takes a little siesta from 1:30-3:30. If the shuttle doesn't fit your plans a taxi is about 12-15 Euro, is safe with no price haggling, and is summoned by the doorman at the push of a button. The shuttle was nice, but we used cabs more frequently for the convenience. The one \"issue\" mentioned above was on our checkout day. Throughout our stay we noticed that the two elevators were somewhat slow. And as always happens on the last trip down to checkout and make a train reservation our elevator got stuck. We were stuck for over 20 minutes, BUT, stuck with us was the Chief Concierge, Markus. I cannot say enough good about this man. Throughout our time stuck in the elevator he was on his cell phone with the front desk, getting our invoice ready, getting a cab ready, and even gave us his car with instructions to call him if we missed the train and incurred any extra charges to rebook. Once the maintenance man got the doors open on the Third Floor Markus grabbed BOTH of our suitcases and basically ran down the stairs with them. The checkout was VERY fast and apologetic, with an adjustment to the bill for our inconvenience. We were sent on our way with two bottles of water for the cab ride, and their best wishes. We DID make the train with a few minutes to spare, all thanks to the great service from Markus and his staff.

We also had a sitting area and a balcony (which overlooked the cell phone tower -- wasn't expecting that, but then again we didn't pay extra to have a view of the city, so a little disappointed but not surprised either). The best part of our stay was the overall service and access to the Imperial Club lounge. We had breakfast and evening hors d'oevres (lunch was also available, but we were always out sightseeing) sitting out on a terrace that provided breathtaking views of Rome (so, it didn't matter so much that our room overlooked the cell phone tower). There are only 4 tables outside, so you have to be lucky enough to snag one, but the lounge itself is very nice. The staff was friendly and helpful (not snobby at all, which can sometimes be the case at fancier hotels). The biggest negative about this hotel is the location (and that's really depending on whether you want to be away from it all or in the thick of things). It's in a residential area and about a 20-30 minute shuttle ride into town. By the way, we didn't have any issues with the shuttle being overcrowded, but I guess most people go on vacation later in the summer, so I could see how it could be an issue then. For us, it just meant that it was less convenient to go out to dinner in the evening. One night, we went to a local restaurant just down the street and the other nights we just ate at the hotel.

We also had access to the lounge on the ground floor. This was light and airy with a selection of food (nothing big but soup and small sandwiches, pastries, etc) and lots of wine, beer and coffee. The lounge also has an outside area so is a good place to have a drink and catch some rays. We were there for four days, and spent most of the time in Rome. We had a couple of tours (booked by the concierge), and they picked us up from the hotel and would drop us in town afterwards. We also took the courtesy bus a couple of times, and when we got a taxi to and from Rome centre it was between 10 and 15 Euros. We did not eat in the hotel but I did not have a bad meal in Rome, and it was not as expensive as I feared (around 12 euro for a plate of pasta) and the house wine was without exception excellent. I used a great place on Via del Lencino at Via del Clementino, the Trattoria del Grotto on Via della Vite (both near Via Conditti, the main shopping street) and a place named \u2018La Taverna dei Monti\u2019 on Via del Boschetto. So, in summary, this is a great hotel near the Vatican but which is a short distance outside Rome. This is a good thing to me as it is good to escape the bustle of the City centre. It is expensive, but I managed not to spend money other than cocktails at the bar, which are no dearer than hotels in London.

In short, let me just add a few obsevations for your consideration: Breathtaking panomamic views from the private veranda in our room...overlooking romantic Rome, with the Colosseum, Pantheon, Piazza Venezia, and St. Peters Basilica in view. We were fortunate to have captured a rainbow shining down upon the city after a brief shower during our stay--I'll post a picture after I finish downloading the pix from my camera. The beds were comfortable, the bathroom was roomy and well appointed and there was ample closet space. There is an in-room safe. The location is quiet and very private, which is why many athletes/celebrities have chosen to stay here when in the Rome area. We selected this property because it was away from the hustle and bustle of the city, and the hotel shuttle bus provided frequent and convenient drop-off and pickup at centrally located Piazza Barberini, which is only a short walk from the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain. The service was outstanding: At check-in we were escorted to our room so that the hotel could be certain that we were satisfied with the location and view. The conceirge was most helpful with restaurant recommendations and in securing advance reservations to various attractions, like the Vatican museum. Be sure to visit a local neighborhood restaurent/gem--Luciano's (a short walk from the hotel). Enjoy the veal and home made pasta, and tell Antonio that the couple from Atlanta said \"hi\". Even the doormen provided outstanding service: When the Merdedes-Benz shuttle bus was delayed because it became hopelessly caught in traffic (due to a huge soccer match that night) the hotel paid for individual cabs to take guests to the Piazza Barberini. There is a very convenient Bancomat (ATM Machine) within the hotel, so getting Euros was easy and safe. There is a travel agency office in the hotel: we had them make our train reservations for Florence and Venice. Immaculate grounds, pools, common areas, prompt/polite service and beautiful artwork helped make our stay very special. The daily breakfast buffet was elaborate and delicious---can you ever really have too much cappuccino and Prosecco in the morning? The executive lounge was always well attended and well stocked with terrific beverage selections (did I mention the Prosecco?) and tasty small bites/desserts and a variety of coffee/tea/expresso drinks.

I had booked through hotels.com and got a great rate. As my booking said \"city/garden view\" and the hotel boasted of acres of mediterranean gardens - I expected just that and would have been happy with either view. I had emailed the hotel a month in advance to inform them of our special occasion and that I wanted a good room as per my booking. However, when we checked in, I found that I had neither a city nor a garden view - I had a view of a residential apartment building and a TV transmission tower (see attached photos). If I had known that while booking the hotel, I would never have done it. When I objected to the view, they said that city view rooms were all booked out and that they had put in a request for a room change the next day for a garden view room. The next day the receptionist told me that my request was tantamount to an upgrade request for which I would have to pay an extra 75 Euros per night - which I was unwilling to do. Rather than start an argument during our Babymoon, I chose to write this review and never to return to that hotel again. Furthermore, as a Hilton Honors member, I had given a preference for a high floor and they told me that they have non-smoking rooms only on the 3rd floor - this is the lowest floor with any rooms on it. So I neither got the view I paid for nor a high floor. Contrary to what the hotel's website says (1400 yards from the Vatican City etc) - the hotel is miles away from everywhere. You will find yourself chasing the shuttle to/from the city all the time. If you want to hang around downtown / in Central Rome after sunset, you would have to get a cab back (approx 20 Euros) as the last shuttle leaves at 8 pm from town. Moreover, the shuttles are popular and even if we queued up 15 mins before departure, we were still not guaranteed a seat - it's cramped, crowded and not frequent enough. I would hate to be there in high season and try to get the shuttle. If you want to enjoy Rome without worrying about logistics to ferry you to/from the centre of town, choose another hotel. The pool closes at 10 pm too - so if you come back after a long day of sight seeing and want to relax after dinner in the sauna etc - you better hurry up as they shut off everything by 10 pm. We could never use our balcony because of the view and had to stand and look at a 70 - 90 degree angle to view any kind of garden. Finally, all prices in the hotel are horrendously expensive even by 5 star standards - and the service levels (especially of the Reception staff) need an overhaul - I say, send them to Asia to understand what true 5 star service levels are like!", "Date": "April 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Normandy, France", "Title": "\u201cVERY VERY NICE INDEED\u201d", "Author": "ChristineGrisel", "ReviewID": "UR60764386", "Content": "The outside of the hotel isn\u2019t anything special at all but inside it\u2019s quite delightful. Not modern like the Hilton hotels but not as luxurious as the Ritz for example. It was built in the early \u201860\u2019s and doesn\u2019t yet have a \u201csoul\u201d to it. Beautiful statues and paintings everywhere. We stayed for 3 nights at the Imperial Club, on 8th floor (Room 857) with a private lift for the Imperial guests. Throughout our whole stay there, I found the personnel to be most helpful, courteous and friendly. The room was lovely with a magnificent view over Rome and the enormous outdoor swimming pool, from the balcony. The rooms on the other side though only had a view onto the front of the hotel, (nothing special) or else an ugly satellite tower. There were two small complimentary bottles of water each day and a lovely little box of (2) chocolates each evening. The bed and bedding were very comfortable and big. The toiletries were of a high quality and for once, I\u2019m looking to buy the same brand. They were replaced generously everyday The hairdryer actually dried my hair but the weighing scales didn\u2019t work. I didn\u2019t bother to ask for new batteries for them. From 7am to 11pm in the Imperial Lounge there were complimentary light snacks, non alcoholic drinks, desserts, white wine, Beefeater, Vodka and Martini. If you\u2019re a light eater, you won\u2019t need to eat out but if you\u2019re not, you will find this is not enough even though you can serve yourself to as much as you want. It\u2019s not a restaurant. Nevertheless, the food was really delicious and of a high quality. The Imperial Lounge is only for the Imperial Club guests, (special card and lift) which I was rather dreading at first imagining all sorts of old snobs, but it was really wonderful and a huge plus to our stay. It\u2019s rather cozy and never crowded, with comfortable sofas and warmly decorated. Newspapers and magazines are available. At most I saw about over a dozen people at a time. Meals can be taken on the balcony equally. On a warm evening, with Rome all lit up, it\u2019s absolute heaven with a glass of champagne! I felt very special indeed at the Imperial Club. The complimentary shuttle bus left every hour but most of the time, rather than wait, the doorman called us a taxi immediately (about 8 euros into town). It\u2019s true we spent a lot on taxis but rather than wait for the shuttle bus to arrive either at the hotel or from the centre, it was faster to get a taxi. On Easter Sunday, we had beautiful chocolate Easter eggs awaiting us in our room. They were so beautiful we asked for them to be put into a box to take home to the children but unfortunately we had to break them into pieces as the plastic box was too small. I took advantage of this & tasted a piece and the chocolate was really good. The outside swimming pool is gigantic and the inside one is open \u2018till quite late. The spa is really good. The gym is quite extraordinary. I\u2019ve never seen one so big with so much equipment. Due to lack of time, we didn\u2019t use the gym or any of the massage treatments. The shuttle runs from 8.30 to the city centre and last pick up from the centre to the hotel is 8pm. We were always tired at the end of the day and preferred to go back to the hotel to the spa, and for a swim rather than eat out late. We probably would have done that if the hotel weren\u2019t so far from the centre (a 40 minute walk downhill) but as we ate in the restaurants at lunchtime every day, we had just a light snack in the evening at the hotel, which sufficed.

The price of food and drink was expensive. 8euro's for a small bottle of water or coke. 24 euro's for a nicely presented bowl of pasta. There are some shops in the foyer but, you guessed it, no drinks. The mini-bar fridge is too small to put your own bottle in but there is an ice machine on each floor.

I can describe myself as a real seasoned traveller, one with an exceptional taste for luxuary and thurst for anything and everything that is NOT tacky and extra ordinary and always have to find out myself if a place or food etc is good or bad and never pay much of attention to that what other might say. I judge things independently and based on factors that might not be important to others. Waldorf Astoria Cavalieri is absolutely a great hotel. One I can best describe as a place woven in the history of the city of Rome, where in its early days of the 60's and 70's many famous celebrities did stay, did hold great parties and sang beautiful songs and still to this day, although this hotel has become old, but still it does feel different and one of those few places that breaths history and has become a landmark on itself, yet capable of holding to its tradition of excellent service and attentiveness towards its guests and people of all ages, degree's and background. I recently stayed here using their January Sale promotion with an upgrade request to a delux or Imperial room with Rome views. 2 hours before my flight departure, I found out that Imperial rooms with Rome view are not available but I could stay at an Imperial room with a residential view. I objected and asked for assistance. The reservation staff (Christine) was very helpful and right before boarding she told me that I will be appointed a delux king room with Rome view which I accepted. The front desk staff were so helpful and so kind and fast. They give each new guest, first visitor a private tour around this hotel personally and once the check-in is proceeded and they do take their job seriously and make sure each guest, no matter how famous or not, feels welcomed and extra ordinary. Once in the room, She told us that since I couldn't have the Imperial room with their Aqua di Parma toiletteries, they have replaced their Evelyn & Crabtree products with Aqua di Parma during my whole stay which was such a pleasant surprise and the views!!! WOW , that is all I can say about that. The rooms are spacious, very quiet, very airy, feels homey and the beds are really heavenly and there is absolutey nothing missed out or left unnoticed except for an iPhone or iPad docking station which should/would be fun to have placed in each room. The bathroom was spacious too and very well equipped and in fact is the most \" American\" hotel I 've come across during my trips in Europe. Even for women like me who does wear make-up and pay attention to the comfort and fun while putting up make-up, they have special desks available with seats in the bathroom which isn't the case in almost 99% of European hotels. The bell boy, concierges, the front desk staff, the business center, the bars both Imperial lounge with its excellent high tea service at 16:00 PM and the one at the lavish and colorful lobby and everybody else is so attentive, so friendly and most of them just know to call you by name.

Room Service was excellent and fast, I ordered hamburgers and one of the best hamburgers and fries I ever ate was at this hotel plus those off course across USA and Canada. The breakfast is legendary. There are more than enough choices and such a variety and everything is really freshly made and really nothing nothing is left out. They even offer Japanese and Chinese goodies for Asian travellers while having their breakfast and for children a large variety of cereals and other goodies are included and all that again included in the price of the hotel room and off course the staff is again so very friendly and remembers each and every guest and greets you personally. I also did eat at the restaurant on my first night and both the quality and service were excellent. I ordered minestrone soup and was suprised to have my very first and only really freshly and home made Minestrone soup in years at an Hotel and as for breakfast I asked whether they had my favorite which wasn't so I decided not to order a dessert but the staff did surprise me with a big smile when I was waiting for my tea as they somehow had managed to prepare my favorite dessert in secret and it felt like a huge victory to them to surprise me with that which it was. My first night did begin so really enjoyable and fun. There is a shop in the hotel where those with a good taste can buy beautiful shoes and Italian designer goodies for discounted prices and if you don't have time to go on shopping or can not take much of luggage with you, don't worry and the shop owner will gladly be there to help you personally with an outfit and all that designer stuff for a very very low price of sometimes up to 80% discount. I even found DeSquared brands in there! You won't be disappointed. This hotel also offers a large collection of paintings and tapistry all around its lobby, the conference center, the lounges and many corridors and hallways you enter which is really fun to just hang around in the hotel and do nothing else but to enjoy. Furthermore, the quality of each and every service is truly unique and so really Italian. Stylish, tasteful and excellent. La Dolca Vita!!! that begins at Cavalieri. This hotel is located on a hiltop close to Vatican city and offers really beautiful amazing vista's and views over the eternal city which is specially so romantic at night. The hotel is surrounded by a large park and many Cypresses and Palm trees and its Swimming pool is of a reasonable and large size and all around the poolside there are different lounges, terraces and cafe's and places to relax and one can also walk around the gardens and smell the jasmines, palm trees, azalia's and enjoy lemon trees with lemons, Olive trees, really many of them all around this hotel full of olives, while looking at Rome in the distant and the Saint Peter basilica very close to the hotel. And when the sun does shine which is almost everyday, this hotel offers the best place to start your relaxing fun day, wake up, enjoy a good tea/coffee with complimantary cookies and home made pastry, soak up sunshine, hear the music and get ready to go out and explore the city in STYLE! They offer a free Shuttle service to Piazza Barberini where the famous statue of Triton by Bernini is located that immediately makes your holiday being one of an exceptional one and if you don't have time to get the shuttle to/from hotel/city, don't worry as a taxi will only cost you \u20ac 11,- max to both Piazza del Popolo or Barberini as well as right to the heart of Saint Peter Piazza/Vatican and even less to the enterance of Vatican Museum. So, why take the shuttle when a limousine with handsome helpful experienced taxi drivers can take you anywhere you want! I also enjoyed a relaxing massage at the Spa which offers various treatments and the staff is pro-actievely thinking and helping you with a schedule and treatments. It can be pricey but surely worth trying and value for the money. Don't skip it and otherwise at least try to relax at its Turkish baths and hot/indoor spa facilities. Overal impression: This hotel is absolutely a gem. Each woman will be treated like a Sofia Loren or a GinaloloBrigitta and all men like an Al Bano. ... Don't waste your time looking for a place in the historic center of the city which is also so small and easily accesible on walk and located all close to each other and avoid noise and sleazy hotels and start your visit to this beautiful city in elegance, style and lavish green parks and amazing views of the city that only is laid there in front of you to welcome you into this exciting city! All I can say is again: ... wherever you go and do in and around this hotel, you will only hear music in your head ... Peppino Gagliardi 's \" Come le Viole\" or \" T'ame e T'amero\" or Al Bano's \" Bianca di Luna\" ... is all here and makes you feel \" A STAR\" !

I just completed a two night stay at the Cavlieri on the Imperial Club floor, and believe it to be the best in Rome. The Imperial Club itself is terrific, and I can see why Hilton top stayers complain about the fact that they are no longer upgraded there. On the other hand, this change has corrected one of the two problems in previous Cavalieri stays - the Imperial Club had been too crowded, and the Hotel is not in town. The Imperial Club is no longer overcrowded, and this change has resulted in significant service improvement.Morning coffee is now at your table in an instant. The food was always terrific, and remains incredible. Where else in Rome can you get a toasted bagel, smoked salmon and cream cheese for breakfast? Five food services are presented each day in the club, and I have not seen a rival for the food and service excellence here outside of Asia! My room had an amazing 7 hill view, from a patio which (despite the cold weather) presented the view beautifully. The bed was very comfortable, and a top sheet and face cloths were present without the need for a request (unusual for Rome). Shower and heating/air conditioning worked very well. The room also had a feature that I have not encountered in hundreds, perhaps thousands, of hotel stays. There is a second interior soundproofed mirrored door, between the main door and the bathroom entrance, that can be closed and that completely eliminates hotel corridor noise. Every traveller has been woken at one time or another by early morning door slams. Not on the Imperil floor of the Cavalieri. The location of the facility offers the aforementioned view, but also means that you need to take the shuttle bus or a cab into town. This is inconvenient, but the plusses of the hotel clearly outweigh this 15minute ride. Because I wanted to be near the place of business visited, I also stayed at the De Russie in the same week. It is hard to measure up to the De Russie in terms of the quality of service, but at least for my stay, the Cavalieri did.

The lobby looks, on first inspection, rather dated and a little bit like a throwback to the 1970s. The hotel's website really plays up its strengths and the slightly faded glory of the building can come as a bit of a surprise. However, once you get past the first impression the Cavalieri really holds its own as a truly Five star experience. The service was excellent and the rooms are very luxurious, with lovely bedding and Acqua di Parma toiletries. Definitely stay on the Imperial Club floor if you can, the club room and concierge are excellent and a good place to start the day, or to have a drink before you head out at night. The Cavalieri is a little bit further out of town, but the upshot of this location high on a hillside above the city is the beautiful view - it is worth making sure that you request a room that looks out across the city. But clearly if you are just in Rome to shop you might be better at one of the hotels right in the heart of town. The Cavalieri does offer a shuttle which makes the short journey into the city pretty painless. The greatest draw of this hotel is the wonderful outdoor Olympic sized pool, in the middle of summer when the temperatures routinely touch 40 degrees this is the best place in Rome to be. There were many chic Romans and a few well known Hollywood stars lounging by the pool which helps create a very exclusive atmosphere. There is also a wonderful indoor pool, gym, spa complex. The food in the hotel was excellent, the restaurant on the terrace above the pool was really Michelin star quality. Not to be missed are the fabulous buffet breakfasts and the Sunday lunch buffet which was among the best I have seen in many years staying in the world's best hotels. The restaurant service was similarly excellent. If you are price sensitive it is worth noting that all this luxury certainly doesn't come cheap, but its certainly worth it. We had friends who opted to stay at the Westin Excelsior but who ended up at our hotel for the majority of the stay because they were so won over by its charms and facilities.

The gym was also one of the best, with great equipment and free fitness classes. The indoor pool tended to get overcrowded but I guess that with warm weather, with the two outdoor pools this will not be an issue. We spent new year's eve there, and the menus were really expensive, so we ate in our rooms, but this was still great cause we had all of Rome in our feet and watched all the amazing fireworks that started from 11pm and the whole spectacle was breathtaking. There's a shuttle bus at the hotel, and this makes really easy reaching the center of the city. Also there's a great tratoria, da Luciano's, ten minutes walking from the hotel, so at night you don\"t have to go to the city again. The only slight inconvenience we faced, was that although I was quoted free breaksfast when I booked the rooms, when we went to actually eat we were told that the breakfast was not included. And although I talked to the reservations person that had told me that, she didn't remember it and we would have to pay 75 euros every day to eat breaksfast.

Our room was huge, quiet, well-appointed, comfortable, and we had a beautiful view of the city and the hotel pool from our balcony. After staying the first few days at a Bed and Breakfast, this hotel made our honeymoon feel more luxurious! We were able to access the Colosseo lounge which had a great selection of drinks and a few light snacks at all times, though we were carefully policed that we did not remove any food or drink from the lounge, which was a bit disheartening.

The first thing we noticed about the room was its stunning view over the city of Rome. St. Peter's Basilica was a stretch to the far right of our view, and the rest of the city flowed around to the left. The Colesseum could be spotted in the distance. Sunset was especially nice! The room itself was standard for a five-star hotel - very clean, well-maintained with good equipment. Toiletries were Crabtree & Evelyn. Worth noting was a sound-proof door that you can pull close to keep hallway sound in the hall. The balcony was small and the paint was peeling \u2013 the exterior of the hotel is a bit worn. The minibar was extraordinarily expensive, at least compared to our usual experiences in Australian hotels. 12 euros for a beer. 10 euros for a 100gms of nuts. Normally we don\u2019t hesitate cracking open a drink when we arrive at a hotel, but this time we had to pass. There were, though, complimentary small bottles of water. We had room service a number of times during our stay. The service was quick and excellent, and the presentation was immaculate. The food was ok, though food is never quite as good through room service as it is in the restaurant. A real treat, though, were the wonderful petite fours that came with each service. In fact, with all the little extras that come with the room service, while it is quite expensive, it also feels as if they\u2019ve spared no expense. We wanted to book into La pergola, the 3 Michelin star restaurant at the hotel, but it was fully booked. Booking well ahead is probably essential. The buffet breakfast was another real treat. There was a very wide selection of foods and drinks (including champagne) to choose from. The service was also pleasant. We rate the breakfast as one of the best we\u2019ve seen in a long time and were happy that we had included it in our room package. The menu price for the buffet breakfast was 38 euros per person. The hotel is a fair distance from Rome city. We used the shuttle bus to visit Rome on Day 1, and then a taxi to the Vatican on Day 2. The shuttle bus was comfortable and quick (about 15 minutes). It ran every hour to Piazza Barberini in the morning and late afternoon/evening. The taxi to the Vatican Museum cost about 8 euros. As we left the hotel, we noticed that some work was starting. An elevator shaft was closed for renovations, the pool was emptied, and some rooms were being openly renovated on our (fifth) floor. However, this didn\u2019t affect our stay.

Be warned- they don't have much tolerance for those who do not have money to burn. As first time travelers to Rome, we decided to indulge in the Roma Cavalieri. The hotel sits outside of the center of Rome on a hilltop overlooking the city. That being said- the hotel is beautiful. The rooms are very large. The furniture and decor have a modern Italian flair. The balcony overlooking the pool and the city make it worth the stay. We stayed on two separate occassions (start and end of trip). We stayed in rooms 363 and 365. NOTE: The higher the floor- the better the view of the city/Vatican. Get a room with a balcony- there is a piano player that plays every night by the pool. The music streams up to the balcony. There are two pools- inside and outside. Warning- A lounge chair at the pool is 20 Euro. The gym was large and was free of charge. The hotel bar will run you 15 Euro per drink. The bar has no atmosphere. Mellow vibe. I can't speak to the food- after the drink tab, we decided against dining in the hotel. As for getting into the city, there is a shuttle bus that drops and picks you up at Plazza Barbieri. The shuttle runs fairly regualrly and we never had a problem getting on it (never full to capacity). On multiple occassions, one of the gentleman at the Concierge's desk was completely useless or incorrect. For example, the hotel rental car office had no cars available. The Concierge directed us to a rental car office several blocks from the hotel. Upon arrival, the office was closed for the MONTH due to holiday. Upon returning to the hotel, the Concierge attempted to redirect us to the SAME office. Long story short- we had to return to the AIRPORT to rent a car. If you do rent a car, you can park the car on the street. The hotel will charge you 5 Euro to park in the outdoor lot and 30 Euro to park in the inside lot. WARNING- Upon retunring with a rental car, they tried to force us to pay the 30 Euro for indoor parking b/c they were working on the outside lot. They refused to drop down the rate, even though it was the hotel's fault we could not park outside. 25 Euro is a BIG difference. My husband had to put up a stink to get the parking for 5 Euro.

Just one other thing, my sister and nephew wanted to use the indoor pool (since it was January and the outdoor one would have been a tad chilly!) however they would have had to have paid for a spa package in order to do so, which they didn't do. Might be nice for guests to have the use of the indoor pool only at no extra cost when the weather dictates this. On a slightly different note, we kept hearing birds in the grounds of the hotel and upon further exploration, came across many parrots in separate aviaries around to the side of the hotel, tucked out of the way. I do not know how they all came to be there and although strictly speaking, they are cared for and maintained in terms of adequate food, water etc.....we could not help but notice that many seemed either stressed or bored due to lack of stimulation, toys etc. On our departing guest comment card, we did mention that we would love to see some stimulating toys provided however whether this kind of comment is ever taken onboard is another thing.

The hotel has a free shuttle to the center, but taxis are cheap and plentiful and we used those. The spa is lovely and the gym is top notch. There are also three outdoor pools and one indoor, so if you like to swim, you're set. Many Romans have weddings and parties here so you get a real feel for the people of Rome.

We are diamond members, meaning we stay at the company's hotels on a very regular basis and are usually taken care of well above the necessary. Not this time though.

She forgot to give us our pool card (which we found out later, when we almost loudly got kicked out of the pool) and did not put us on the executive floor, as she were supposed to under our reservation. When we asked about it we were told rudely we did not qualify for that floor. But, being diamond members (yeah I know, it's silly but still) we are supposed to have access to that floor and the lounge on it.

Well an hour goes by and were are about to head out for dinner so we call down again and they apologize and say it will be there soon. We get back from dinner about 3 hours later and still no ice..... there is no ice machine for you to get it yourself so we personally went down to the front desk and asked.

The lobby seemed to be in the same decor but the rooms, club floor and other facilities like gym, healthclub and pool complex are all updated in a sumptuous and total glamorous style. The club lounge is absolutely stunning, with different seating areas and beautiful outdoor seating overlooking all of Rome and the hotel grounds. The room is equally gorgeous and spacious and over the top in finishing and furnishing. Our balcony was spacious and offers full privacy. We found the hotel staff lovely. From check in to house keeping and lounge staff, everyone seemed to be genuinely kind. The lounge offers five f&b servings a day, and all day wine and Prosecco. Food was of good quality and continuously replenished. This weekend the lounge seemed quiet and the guest who were there were classy. Our stay also included the use of the health club and pool. It;s quite remarkable that regular guests have to pay to use these facilities including a pool bed. Since this hotel is extremely expensive I would feel that that is not right. The pool is gorgeous, large and very deep which keeps children away. There is another pool that is more suitable for them, so the main pool keeps nice and quiet even when all beds are taken. I hate children, especially those staying at exclusive hotels, they can ruin your experience with their obnoxious behavior. This pool is also used by local members and this certainly is a glamorous crowd that ads to the feeling of being at a very exclusive resort. The fact that they reserve their beds and don't show up until late in the afternoon is a concept that is plain tacky. Pool staff is not good. Any question asked was answered with 'room number?'. I had the impression they have the feeling they are more security than pool attendant. i have no idea why, you have to pass at least three security points to get to the pool, so if you are there, you have the right to be there. The weather was absolutely fantastic and we did not leave the hotel grounds until check out. We took a hotel limo back to the airport, the driver seemed very tired and drove exceptionally fast which got us to the airport in no time, but I would recommend to keep the speed limit and observe some safety in driving.

There is no access to public transportation near the hotel. You can only take a taxi into the city or the hotel shuttle that runs until 8:00pm. I would not recommend this hotel to someone who is going to be doing a lot of sight seeing because you have to plan your day around the limited hours of the shuttle or pay a lot for taxi trips. Also, there are no restaurants near the hotel. So again you have to plan around this.

I did not tip and still found the level of service very good.some people think the shuttle bus stops to early again it is only 10 or 12 euro back at night and again if you cant afford it there are a lot of very good hotels in Rome at the same price.It is very opulent, very grand and you fell a bit important staying there but i would go back in a shot", "Date": "August 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel in Rome\u201d", "Author": "cdjWashingtonDC", "ReviewID": "UR38453565", "Content": "I just returned from the Rome Cavalieri.

We slept like babies. I've read reviews that claimed the hotel was noisy, however, we never even knew we had neighbors. This is a great hotel because sightseeing in Rome is tiring and it is very nice to go back to a clean and quiet hotel to recharge one's batteries. It was perfect for a honeymoon because there were mostly couples and very few families with children, so it made for a romantic holiday.

The hotel is beautiful, as noted in other reviews. There is marble throughout the hotel, including in the rooms and bathrooms. The lobby area and lower level have a lot of paintings and other artforms, giving guests their own art museum. Being a HHonors Diamond member, we had access to the Colosseo Lounge, which served complimentary wine, beer, snacks, and other non-alcoholic beverages starting at 11:00 a.m. The service was great. The only annoying thing was watching some of the guests sneak beverages out of the lounge when the staff were not looking (how cheap can you get?). The people at the front-desk when checking in were very friendly and efficient. We arrived about 10:30 a.m., and had to wait about 20 minutes until the room was ready, but they were very apologetic (even though we were clearly there before the hotel's check-in time). The hotel is not in a convenient location, but it offers a free shuttle service to the guests throughout the day. The shuttle service was excellent and right on time, both when leaving the hotel and for being picked up in the city (note: arrive about 10-15 minutes early for pick-up in Rome if the hotel is busy, as the shuttle can fill up). Some of the shuttle drivers were very friendly and pleasant, while others were just as efficient but did not make an effort to smile. We were given complimentary breakfast (including sparkling wine) during our stay, which is one of the best buffet breakfasts we have had (and we've had many). In addition to standard breakfast buffet items, it also had a decent Japanese breakfast selection. Despite the hotel being crowded (peak season plus the FINA event), we did not have to wait to be seated at breakfast. We ordered room service one night, and it was fast and very good (a sampler of grilled mediterranean fish plus a pasta dish). What made it expensive is that we ordered a bottle of wine (which alone was 35 euros (yet one of the cheapest on the menu)). The room service charge alone was what appeared to be a flat-rate of 10 euros. We felt it was worth the expense once, but would not have done that every night. In-room internet access was very expensive (as noted by others on this site), but I have seen it just as expensive at other major hotels throughout Europe. Overall, we were pleased with the hotel, but there were a couple of negatives. First, not all rooms have a view (as someone else claimed on this forum). We had a beautiful room with a great balcony, but it overlooked some type of radio tower (the room faced the opposite direction of Rome). As noted, we checked in early, and the hotel was full, which is probably why we were given a room without a view. Our room did NOT have a coffee/tea maker, which surprised us. Finally, when we checked out (around 9:30 a.m.) there was only one person at the check-out desk, such that there was a relatively long line. There were three people at the check-in desk who were not waiting on anyone. It did not seem like an efficient use of staff, since the check-in and check-out desks are right by each other. In sum, I would stay there again if the price is right. It is not only expensive in terms of the actual rates, but also in terms of HHonors points.

I find it absolutely fascinating how different our experience was with the hotel than that of the previous reviewer. The previous statement is made knowing that happenstance often determines the quality of one's stay at any property. Because of Hilton Diamond membership, we were placed in a 6th floor room with a Rome view, including complimentary breakfast buffet and use of the \"Colisseo Lounge', which may or may not be the same as the executive lounge but in any case is a nice benefit.....refreshments from 11AM until 11PM daily, on the Lobby level....very nice. The guest room was spacious, immaculate and comfortable. The A/C worked extremely well, sheltering us from the sweltering Rome summer when we returned from outings. We enjoyed a spectacular view of the city of Rome, and the pool area, with forested surroundings. The hotel is a great refuge from the bustle of the city....about a 20-30 minute, 12 Euro cab ride from Piazza Navonna. The frequent free shuttle to the city (except Sundays) is also helpful in defraying cost. This property reminds us of the way great resorts were a half century ago. Perhaps the best buffet breakfast spread I've seen anywhere in decades. An Olympic Pool. A classic bath house/spa. People leisurely swimming laps while breakfast eaters are enjoying their food alongside the pool. A country, exclusive setting. Spacious and elegant hall and stairways. Great art throughout. A Concierge operation that's run like an army; any request greeted by a prompt and enthusiastic \"subito, Signore\".....\"Right away, Sir\". It's very hard to hear the word \"no\" from that crew. One of the Concierge team that we met had been at the hotel since it opened in '63. The pool is lighted at night and there is live entertainment along side it, with a pianist and a vocalist....until late in the evening. The one problem I encountered was a \"flakey\" internet situation, which seems endemic (perhaps epidemic) in Europe. In fact the first time I tried to write this review (last night), when I had completed it, the connection just died on me....and I lost my work. Once I phoned the vendor (Swiss) and their \"help\" desk person was terribly rude and not very helpful. She was almost shocking in her sarcasm. Yes! The hotel is expensive. Five Star Hotels are expensive. It costs a great deal to run a business like that and they have to make money. I wanted a memorable experience and I got one. We even lucked into a spectacular fireworks display on our last evening; I suspect it had been arranged for a party that was going on at one of the swimming pools on the property. One note about our sightseeing in Rome. We got off the beaten track and went to Villa Torlonia.....a two centuries old public park (since 1977), which had been owned by a noble family; Benito Mussolini and family lived in the main house from the late 20s until 1943. The estate was occupied by Allied forces in 1943 or 44 and they just about ruined it. It has been undergoing extensive restoration for some 15 years and is an extremely worthwhile and educational attraction. The main house is close to exquisite....much memorabilia from the Mussolini era.....photos....displays....a film with home movies from the M. era.....there are a number of other buildings inside the Villa in various states of restoration. La Casa delle Civette (The Owl House) has some wonderful Art Nouveau windows.....at least one of them original from the early 20th century. The Limonaia (The Lemon Grove) has been reconstructed into a very nice refreshment and restaurant area, with a pizza oven and very reasonable prices....remarkable my Rome standards. This entire site was notable for its low quantity of foreign visitors.....I would recommend this attraction to anyone interested in Roman history of the past 200 years....and in particular of the WWII years.

My wife and I are planning another trip to Europe, and once again Trip Advisor is proving invaluable. As such, I feel obligated to balance all my \"taking\" with a little \"give\". We spent four nights at the Cavalieri last May, and it was unbelievable. Had we not been using Hilton Honors points, we never would have stayed at such an expensive hotel. Boy am I glad we did! Hooray for the Hilton Honors program, and maybe all that business travel wasn't so bad after all. :>) Rome was the first stop on an 18-day Italy visit, my first to Europe. We got off the plane typically frazzled after a trip across the pond, and proceeded to suffer a clueless cabdriver who got hopelessly lost in the middle of the night looking for the hotel. It is rather \"out there\". It wasn't until we finally checked into our room that we discovered how lucky we were. Wow! Big closets, a plush (if somewhat small and dated) gold and marble bathroom, a luxurious sleeping area as well as a sitting area with desk, and to top it all off a balcony with a spectacular view of the Vatican! There was even a box of chocolates left as a gift. We ordered a bottle of wine, a salad, a pizza, and a gelato, sat on the balcony at midnight, and pinched ourselves to confirm we were really in a place this plush! This small meal was about 100 Euros, but it was convenient and it was the only meal we had at the hotel (other than the free breakfast). The pizza and salad were pretty mediocre, but the wine and gelato hit the spot. We were not told about the executive lounge, by the way. Our impression was only enhanced the next morning, when we went down to the breakfast buffet (free for Hilton Honors gold VIPs). We sat under a beautiful shade tree by their inviting pool, surrounded by the well-manicured grounds. Unlimited fresh-squeezed orange juice and espressos (we were pretty wired that first day!), and a buffet that went on for miles. What a selection! Much better than the Hilton Molino Stucky in Venice. We later spent an afternoon swimming and sunning by the pool, and felt totally \"hollywood\". We took advantage of the shuttle each morning, but typically came home at night by taxi. Other than that first driver, everyone else seemed to know where the hotel was located. Yes, it cost more than we would have spent on a ride home to a downtown hotel, but when we're staying for free we don't mind. Like the Molino Stucky, where we stayed for six nights later in our trip, this Hilton gets lots of conference business. The chain-smoking, frenetic italians in business suits clogging the lobby diminsh the otherwise idylic vibe of the hotel, but it's a small complaint about an otherwise perfect setting. I don't know if this is the best Rome has to offer, nor do I know if it is worth the price, but it was the best hotel we visited in Italy, and one of the best hotels we've stayed in around the world.

The view at sunset and sunrise, the view of the grounds, the incredible breakfast buffet, the snappy and helpful service made this a great honeymoon spot. We actually liked the fact that it was far from the city--downtown Rome is very noisy, busy, and very dirty. Plus, the people are not exactly charming. We also took full advantage of the Colosseo lounge (the free VIP lounge) and so rarely paid for lunch and afternoon drinks. We did notice most tourists did not tip the lounge staff--that is shameful :( Now to address some of the complaints by reviewers. The staff is excellent if you tip like you are staying at a 5 star hotel--don't stay at such a place if you don't know how to tip. The place IS expensive, but it is a 5 star destination hotel. While we were there, we saw athletes, celebrities (as well as the dogged paparazzi), and many weddings and special events. It is an LA kind of scene--this is what I liked least about the place, actually. The gym was full of local women looking to be someone's trophy wife...though that will make some readers more inclined to go. The bottom line is that the critics got a bad room (one with no view) and didn't spread around the wealth. With that said, how to save money: take the shuttle--though taxis are cheap and fast (10-15 euros), and eat out. Many reviewers have vaguely referred to a Sicilian trattoria down the street. It is cheap and wonderful and will save you from spending an enormous amount of money at the hotel on food. The trattoria is called \"Ai Vespri Siciliani\"--turn right out of the hotel and walk five minutes down Alberto Cadlolo way--it will run into Medaglione d'Oro as a T. Turn left, walk 50 meters and there it is. There are also other places to eat on the same street.", "Date": "June 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Lobby and Extra Comfortable Bed\u201d", "Author": "jmewantstotravel", "ReviewID": "UR32927089", "Content": "We stayed at here for 2 nights.

For example, on the day we checked in we arrived at the Cavalieri at 12:15 extremely tired after our flight. We were told our room was not ready, but that they would get it ready as soon as possible. The Diamond Desk person then escorted us to the Colesseo lounge and told us that she would come and get us as soon as the room was ready. At 2 pm no one had come to inform us that our room was ready, so I went to the front desk and inquired. As it turns out, our room key was just sitting there and our room was ready, but no one had informed us. We went up to our room to discover that they had put someone else's luggage in our room. Our luggage was no where to be found. I went down to the front desk and was taken to the luggage storage area to look for our luggage. When it did not turn up, a bellhop escorted me to another guest's room where our luggage had been taken (we had his luggage). The bellhop sheepishly apologized, but then added \"anyone can make a mistake.\" Which is true, but not the attitude I wanted to hear when I was exhausted and just wanted my luggage and to take a nap. We never received an apology from anyone else other than the one bellhop, and the front desk took a very nonchalant attitude. There are other examples of poor customer service, but the experience above and the attitude adopted proved typical. Additionally, as written elsewhere the location is not convenient to the tourist spots and the last shuttle back to the hotel is at 8pm, so unless you wish to end your night very early you are likely to be taking a ~ 15 Euro cab ride back to the hotel.

But I give them points for at least having a shuttle. The punctual and safe drivers were probably the best staff we came across at this hotel. The valet and bellhops outside were useless. I show up with luggage and a cane, and no one even open the DOOR for me, much less take my luggage. The front desk was not too friendly and I was not treated like a VIP guest (I am \"only\" HHonors Gold and used points for my stay, but I still expect courtesy). I was not given my choice of room upgrade vs. access to executive lounge, which would have been appreciated since the Internet point was $0.50 a minute! Each time I sought to speak with the concierge, I waited at least 15-20 minutes.

We'd go to the included breakfast buffet and, while the labels indicated a sumptuous assortment of goodies, the platters and chafing dishes were almost always empty and we would have to ask multiple time (3 on average) for a simple a cappuccino or a glass of prosecco. Who would actually PAY $60USD a person for that sort of breakfast experience?!?!? Luckily, not I. I always brought tips for the waitstaff, but they most certainly did not deserve any of it. The little boutiques in the Cavalieri were so sad -- small and either empty or out-of-date (very 1960s feel). In any case, I left all except the last comment for the manager, and of course I have not heard back a single word. The contrast between my most recent Hilton Stays -- a $89 room at the Hilton Washington versus this $1250/night room in Rome -- showed me that you cannot beat plain and simple CUSTOMER SERVICE!

Service was mediocre at best and obviously the location isn't great. When we arrived and tried to check-in the computers were down and no rooms were ready yet.

No city view unfortunately, but we didn't mind lookin at the notorious radio tower after days of taking in the Roman sights up close. The room was massive and beautiful. Breakfast was probably the high point., I am not a breakfast person but I have never seen a more varied, delicious, and impressive breakfast. The shuttle into the center of Rome was OK, but we had to plan around it sometimes. Catching a cab was OK too, beware you will pay much more if you have the bell man grab one for you. We didn't try this, but there were always at least a few cabs right outside the gates so maybe you could walk out and grab them on your own. There was a nice little commercial area down the hill outside of the hotel. Just head to the right out of the gate. Wish we had found this earlier in our stay. Everything at the hotel is very overpriced so I thought it was worth the nice 10 minute stroll through a quiet residential neighborhood.

Therefore, will write about the other 'stuff'. Food: First of all, I overheard complaints that dinner was running about $350.00USD so we opted to walk down the street instead. If you make a right and head towards the main intersection, (do not cross) turn left, you will find a wonderful Sicilian restaurant. Dinner for 2, (food only, salad, main, dessert) 27euros!!! Breakfast buffet was 38 euros per person, and well worth it. The selections were vast: 12 types of granola, 25+ jams, 5 types of milk, 9+ juices, seperate juice bar with blender and protein powder. All sorts of fruits, oatmeals, cheeses, antipastos, breads, organic offerings and more. Once again, 'breakfast' only, so if you want brunch, you won't find it at this AM buffet. Transportation: I would skip the hotel shuttle to town. It drops you off in a busy part of the city and you have to walk blocks to get to any of the sights. Since the hotel is used for trades/conventions, the shuttle is always full. Therefore, take a taxi to the Cipro Station (10Euros) and then take the train(s) to many of the sites. (you may have to transfer one or two times depending on your destination) When you return from town, find the train(s) that will take you towards Baste, get off at Cipro and taxi it back to the hotel. (11Euros). Mid-city to hotel was about 20 minutes or less. Trains were either 1 or 2 Euros depending upon destination. As for the pool area, we did not use it, however, we were 'followed' while meandering through the beautiful grounds. We laughed because it's just as everyone described here on Tripadvisor. The view from the room was absolutely spectacular, and we used points, and did not have a view of the 'tower.'

The excuse given is \u201cEuropean fire regulations\u201d. Strange, I\u2019ve never encountered that regulation in other, lowlier hotels in Europe! Might it have anything to do with the exorbitant prices they charge for the hotel laundry to iron clothes? I did see one guest scuttling down a corridor with a contraband iron! It was cheaper to buy one new and smuggle it in than pay ironing prices (eg 11 Euros per shirt, 3 per pair of nickers, for those so inclined) Be prepared to bring your money with you, not only for laundry....a coffee costs 8 Euros, a small coke from the minibar the same. A hamburger is 25 Euros. Check your bill on the TV regularly - we found mysterious minibar charges appeared which we had to query. They were politely amended. The hotel has a shuttle bus which operates a few times a day to Piazza Barberini in Rome; be sure to queue at least 10 minutes before departure to get a place; otherwise it is a taxi ride, or there are public buses from nearby, but you won\u2019t be volunteered that information by hotel staff. You pay the same whether you have a view over Rome or not. The \"other\" side where we were has a splendid view of an enormous communcations tower and the hotel driveway. There is no need to pay the hyper-inflated food prices at the hotel as there are some terrific restaurants nearby for those who venture out of the \u201ccompound\u201d. Turn right out of the hotel and walk about 10 minutes to Piazza delle Medaglie d\u2019Oro and you will find some good options, including a Sicilian restaurant . A bit further on, in via Prisciano, da Luciano can be recommended. Good local fare in a middle-class neighbourhood.", "Date": "July 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "KC, MO", "Title": "\u201cHighlight of our Trip\u201d", "Author": "bemison", "ReviewID": "UR17378782", "Content": "My wife and I ended our honeymoon in Rome at the Hitlon Cavalieri -- what a way to end our trip!!

The hotel was luxurious, the grounds impeccable, and the rooms strikingly elegant. There were a bit too many stone lions dotted around the grounds. It appeared as if the hotel stumbled on a warehouse of them and tried to use every single one. After spending a week at a rugby tournament in Dublin, I was really looking forward to this hotel to refresh the batteries and relax. The rooms were stunning, the A/C worked like a champ, and the patio black-out, roll-down door was a huge surprise! When this door came down and you used the sound proof door, the room became the ideal sleeping space. You could sleep for 24 hours in this room. There was one day where some contractors started to do some major work in a mechanical space directly beneath our room at 8am. We contacted the front desk, which was completely unaware of any scheduled work. I was able to guide one of the assistant managers to the work site, which he promptly stopped. We had no further issues. The Managing Director sent up some champagne as an apology for the interruption, a thorough class act. Now be aware that like all luxury hotels, this place is not cheap. There are fees for everything. A burger from the pool bar cost 22 Euros (about $30), and from what I saw from those that ordered one, it wasn't anything particularly special. If you are using points to stay here and are on a tight budget, plan on eating at the restaurants a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The shuttle runs to the AV Venezia where you will find a subway and bus stop and a tourist bus stop. The shuttle pauses from noon to 3pm and finishes at 7:30pm.

Huge room, huge bathroom, robes, privacy sound proof door to keep hallway noise out, automatic metal shutter blinds to keep light out of room from balcony, large balcony, pillow menu, soap menu, soft bed, tons of pillows. HOTEL: The prices are unbelievable! The food prices are really high, appetizers (primas) start at 20 E, and entrees are 40 E. Didn't eat there. The pool looks amazing but it costs 18E per person for a towel and lounge chair! You would think for the price of the hotel the pool would be included! The SPA looks very nice, but didn't use it. The good thing is the shuttle that runs in the morning/evening. It drops you off in downtown Rome, after about a 20 minute drive. The shuttle runs every hour, with the last pick up at 8:30 pm in town, that means you will be taking a taxi back to the hotel every night, which is about 15 E. The bus is very prompt, so don't ask the driver to wait, he won't! OVERALL: Great place to stay if you are using points. I would never pay to stay here, even if I could.

We could see it from the corner of our room. I was pretty upset about this but as it turned out it didn't really matter. When we weren't in Rome we were in the great executive lounge. What I didn't expect was there was a very large conference in the hotel and I'm sure they got the bulk of the view rooms. The executive lounge Iis the best i've been in. To save money we had breakfast in the lounge and snacks. We'd get a late large lunch in Rome and finish up with snacks, drinks and espresso back in the lounge. When was the last time you were in an executive lounge that made espresso and lattes? We didnt get the room we wanted but when we got into the room not only did I have the roses I ordered but they gave me and extra dozen roses, a bottle of champagne, a great chocolate cake. We were also give free passes to gym and pool area. The staff were all great. Be advised, unless you have a lot of extra money don't expect to eat or use room service. two small pizzas will run you around 60 euro. No drinks, no salad, just pizza.

Being a Hilton Gold member (I usually bounce between Gold and Diamond) probably helped but this is a fantastic resort in Rome. My only complaint is the hotel is a bit long in the tooth but everything is still outstanding. The rooms are great. We were just on a regular floor (not club level) but the beds were Hilton-tastic. There are 3 pillows so you and your Goldilocks can pick the one that is \"just right\". The shower has great pressure. The TV has 40+ channels although the only english-speaking channel from the states was Fox News (all election, all the time). The view overlooks the city-- St Peters and the Victor Emmanuel II Monument are clearly visible. The breakfast was outstanding. Multiple cheeses, thin sliced meets (plenty of dry-cured ham plus beef and lamb on one of the days). They didn't have bacon, they had Pancetta. They had swordfish and salmon. The fruits were awesomely diced, not the simple big melon ball cubes like other restaurants. The shuttle (while I wish it ran more often) got us into the city on most days. And a cab to the Vatican Museum was 8 euros. Taxis from the city were 12 euro. I don't know what people were doing getting E50 cabs. Maybe it was midnight or maybe they were getting some crazy luggage surcharge. Over New Years, it was anarchy for cabs and cabbies were gouging. And there are also some \"Mercedes cabs\" or something like that where they charge extremely high rates. But regular cabs are around 10 euros. Again, I don't know what people were doing to get ripped off but I don't see how that is the hotel's fault. Cab transfers from the airport were around 40-45 Euro. We usually just tipped the driver up to a 50. The hotel has a full spa with Turkish bath and all the rest. I didn't have space in the luggage to pack a suit and tie so we didn't go to La Pergola. But if it is even better than the regular dining experience (awesome chololate mousse, egg+cheese finger sandwiches, etc.) then I can see why it is so hyped. The only possible cons are the prices.

It was just above the city of Rome so it had amazing views from the room, and it was away from the noise etc. The pool area was beautiful, the rooms are modern with flat screens and beautifully decorated. Shops line the hallways of the lobby (everything from Gucci to souvenirs!). The concierge is very friendly with any questions.

Negatives: The first night we were in Rome, we decided to eat at the hotel at the poolside Terrazza Dell'Uliveto...BIG MISTAKE! While the candles, white linens, and surroundings were beautiful, the food was terrible and overpriced.

First of all, they make you pay for the gym facilities. We were very excited to lift weights and perhaps use the treadmill after weeks of carbs....but once we found out that the gym cost 25 euros a day, we decided to ignore the urge to exercise. Also, the hotel is quite far from the city centre. The hotel does have a shuttle, but it is generally full...and it does not operate late enough to catch a ride after dinner and drinks.

If you need to get something like water, a bottle of wine, snacks etc you exit the hotel and turn right, just follow the street for a 5 minute walk and you are at a small square with grocery store, icecream parlour, cheese store and a great Sicillian restaurant that I absolutly recommend. The shuttle, during our stay we had two drivers for the shuttle. I'd say that the first driver was a bit more service minded. But in general I think the service was great. If you asked they did a stop at the Vatican on the way downtown. I reccomend to be in good time for the shuttle especially some of the departures are more popular. Be out by the bus 15 minutes before departure and you have no problem getting a seat. Going back I'd go for a taxi. We took taxi from downtown Rome two times and it's a 10 - 15\u20ac trip Getting there, one of the official white taxi's from the airport is 45 - 50\u20ac depending on trafic. In general I would say that taxi's was inexpensive I would absolutly go back as long as I'm a HH gold member", "Date": "October 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco/Orange County", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel for the right people\u201d", "Author": "TravelGal415", "ReviewID": "UR8682775", "Content": "I would recommended the hotel for the following reasons: 1.

We had read the reviews prior to booking so we new exactly what we were letting ourselves in for...namely the high prices charged for everything outside your room, i.e. can of soft drinks or meals in one of the hotels restaurants. Because of this factor we opted for the Executive Floor option which includes an ever changing array of snacks and drink options throughout the day in the very comfortable lounge, this is open from 0700 to 2300hrs every day. On entering the hotel the doorman took our bags which were promptly delivered to our room. At reception i requested a 'city facing' room as per the recommendations on this site but was informed that there were none available unless of course i wanted to change from a room with a Kingsize bed to a twin room instead...oh and that would cost an extra 75 Euros .... i declined. I should hasten to add that i was a full paying customer, and not one of the many Hilton Honors awards customers who, according to the reviews on here seem to get the good rooms and the free upgrades! As it was, the room was tidy and comfortable and the view of the RAI TV mast was superb. There were 40+ channels on the TV with the typical five or so English speaking news channels, any extra movie channels would cost you either 20 Euros for a single play or 40 Euros for the entire selection for the length of the stay. Rooms were cleaned daily, i think the sheets were changed daily also (nice touch) and there was a turn down service in the evening. We made good use of the Executive lounge and the free 15 minutes of internet access (you need to provide passport before internet use), the staff were excellent and spoke good English. When ordering alcohol, be warned that they do not use standard measures as in the UK so you may get an occaisional G & T that is 'extra strong' , this is not a bad thing :) If you get to the lounge early enough you can get one of the outside balcony tables which provide you with 'the city view' and a degree of privacy. Apart from one meal in the poolside restaurant, we opted to eat away from the hotel, in the city centre, which we travelled to in the free shuttle bus. The shuttle is a great service but you need to get to the bus stop at least five minutes prior to departure time to guarantee a seat. It takes around 20 minutes to get to the centre. On occaisions we used the Metro from the city back to the Vatican stop (1 Euro each) and then got a 6 Euro taxi ride back to the hotel rather than have to wait for the shuttle bus to return. The Metro is very easy to use and appears to be clean and safe. If we returned to Rome we would probably use this hotel again.", "Date": "September 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carlsbad, CA", "Title": "\u201cThe most beautiful room I ever had!!!\u201d", "Author": "philc128", "ReviewID": "UR8517064", "Content": "Spectacular room with an incredible balcony and view of Rome!

We came from 2 nights in central Rome and were looking forward to luxury, peace, relaxation, great service...all of which we got in spades. Through my job back in the UK I have a corporate relationship with the Hilton, so one of my contacts there booked the hotel for me. I wouldn't otherwise have considered staying at a Hilton as I prefer \"Boutique\" hotels, but tripadvisor had good reports & my contact got me a great rate so we gave it a go. My friend and I arrived hot and tired after little sleep in the B&B Best Vatican in Rome. The cool, spacious lobby of the Hilton Cavalieri was a dream and the porters and check in team got us quickly and easily ushered up to our room in the 5th floor. The room had a balcony overlooking the pool....and an unbelieable vista across the Eternal City. Breathtaking. I've attached some photos but they just don't do it justice. We spent hours on that balcony morning and night, taking in the view and celebrating life and our ability to enjoy such an experience. The room was gorgeous, the comfiest bed I have ever had in a hotel, not to mention the \"pillow menu\" so you can order different types! Big mirrored bathroom with fab power shower and marble tops. Seating area in the room where we enjoyed afternoon tea and wine in the early eve. Service was fabulous throughout, other than one particular receptionist in the spa area who sadly ruined the 100% success rate. Shame on her and her miserable ways. We assumed she was having a bad day and didn't hold it against the hotel. Big thank you to the team around the pool and pool bar who always have a smile and treat you like old friends. It is rather naughty of the hotel to charge residents extra for access to the Spa and to the pool area. I understand that those on the upper floors get it all inclusive, but my friend and I did think it rather strange to keep being charged extra on top of our bill. I would much rather pay a higher room rate and get all amenities included than keep having to sign additional things off. On our last night we dined al fresco in the Giardino dell'Uliveto restaurant by the pool. This was again fab, service, food, setting, all amazing. sadly we could not get reservations for La Pergola, we would certainly have taken opportunity otherwise. We popped up there and the views were phenomenal. We also got the shuttle bus a few times into Rome, and had a meal before getting a cab back. We found this no hassle at all. Indeed, having spent our previous 2 nights near the Vatican, it took us just as long to walk from Vatican area into central Rome as to get the CAvalieri shuttle bus in. Don't let this put you off. On the contrary, its great to relax away from the hustle of the Rome but still get in quickly when you wish. The spa was BRILLIANT and so relaxing. We didn't have treatments as no spaces free, however we spent happy hours in the sauna, steam room, whirlpool, and then relaxing on the day beds listening to the music and just drifting off in the big fluffy bathrobes. Bliss. We also enjoyed having cocktails in the lobby bar and the pianist/singer was fabulous. Service again great. Some minor points to note - I believe that the rooms with views make a big difference and are worth the extra euros. I would'nt have enjoyed my visit as much if I had a room facing the front of the hotel. - We did miss tea and coffee in our room and the room service prices are extortionate. I think it was \u00a35 for a tea or something silly. - you have a sound excluder door in the room, use it! we only discovered ours on our last night unfort, but once in place you cannot hear a thing from the corridors.

Of course, Hilton has some other nice properties, but this may be the nicest of the nice Hiltons. It is a great hotel, with beautiful rooms, balconies and service, as described in the other reviews. If you don't want to stay in the city center, it may just be perfect for you. As noted in other reviews, only one side has the great views of the city, while the other side overlooks a residential area and a large phone tower. I've had rooms on both sides, at various times, and although the ones with the city view are definitely better (and more expensive, of course), I don't really think there is a bad room in the place. One word of caution -- The hotel is located outside the center and is a 15 - 30 minute (depending on traffic) taxi ride into the city, and taxis in Rome are not cheap. Aside from the hotel, pool and grounds (Did someone mention the great views?), there is not a lot to do in the vicinity of the hotel. If you are one of those who doesn't like to spend the money on taxis, you may find yourself at the mercy of the free hotel shuttle. On some days, the shuttle may be fine, but whenever we've been there, it always seemed to be the busy season, and the shuttle was always loaded to maximum capacity, with people lining up well in advance to make sure they got a seat, thereby having to stand in the hot sun or sit inside the hot shuttle bus, waiting to take off. Because of that, we actually never used the shuttle. Even though the taxis were expensive, they were well worth the cost, to avoid all that. But I know that some folks just have an aversion to paying for expensive taxis, so be warned -- it may come down to a choice betwen an expensive taxi and sharing a crowded bus with a lot of hot, sweaty, cranky people.

We joked that the Hilton had to look long and hard to find a random hilltop to build this hotel with the spectacular view. As Diamond members we reveled in the view from the club room, arguably one of the best club rooms that exists. With binoculars we found the Vatican and Colesseum and other notable landmarks. If you don't have club room privieges, I'm not sure how to access this same view. My best advice: work hard to become a Diamond member because this club room was amazing. The complimentary high quality food and beverages were gorgeously displayed, the service was first-rate and we had 15 minutes of free internet per day. Wandering the hotel interiors and exteriors is quite another peak experience. The owners art collection makes the hotel another Roman museum piece. Exquisite! We found the shuttle service easy, friendly and reliable and were able to make full days of the sites and look forward to the club morning and evening views.

Everyone at the hotel was so nice and we were treated like royaty. We were not able to get a reservation at La Pergola, but ate al fresco at the poolside restaurant which was unbelievable. The pool, gym, spa, and resort grounds are very nice. The weather was 80-90 degrees everyday, so we enjoyed a daily cool dip in the pool. We found the shuttle service easy to use, but also didn't mind at all spending 8euro for a cab. I laugh when I read reviews of people complaining about the hotel's location. Did you not look at a map or read any reviews before booking? The hotel is off the beaten path, but it is a resort and that's exactly what we wanted. Everything is very expensive at the hotel. Luckily we didn't pay for any food or drink because of lounge access. It's 25euro for a burger and fries! No hotels in Italy have irons or ironing boards. I would suggest bringing an iron or buying one on arrival. It costs 3euro to have one shirt pressed at the hotel. We booked a Mercedes through the hotel to pick us up from FCO for 85euro. That is way overpriced. You should be able to get the same service for 50euro. Lastly, if you have Hilton pts to burn, do it here. If you have Diamond status, even better. You get everything for free. You do not get executive lounge access at Gold level. You only get free gym and spa access. I've read past reviews of Diamond and Gold members being charged 30euro/day for gym/spa/pool access. This is definitely not the case now.

The subsequent 2-week cruise of the Med on Oceania Cruiselines was the icing on the cake! You will enjoy every moment.

It is a very popular hotel with locals, business groups, and tourists alike. Even Romans flock here for the spa facilities, which are excellent. Like many Hilton's, this was designed in stunning concrete monolithic bunker style (from Budapest to Sydney, they really have scarred the face of most cities they were built in. They must have had a very big chequebook as they roamed the world in the 60's convincing people to let them build horrible structures in places where it was totally inappropriate). In Rome, however they do a very good job obscuring it on the outside with plants, and inside, well, it's so damn nice you soon forget. I stayed in a city-view room on the executive level, which I guess is about as good as it gets without going for a suite. The private terrace is large and deep, easily sitting four. The view is sublime, with St Peters just over a mile away in the valley of Rome below. Everything has been very very well thought-out, including the very large mirrors flanking either side of the deep terrace to create an even greater impression of the view.

Don't even think about not getting a city view, it undoubtedly costs more but it is so exceptional there would be no comparison to a room that does not have this. The spa is very nice, if expensive.

I would recommend this hotel for people who have done the tourist thing in Rome before and want a resort-type experience with the ability to get access to all Rome has to offer. If it's your first time in Rome, I would suggest trying something in the heart, as you will be up for frequent taxis or not-too-convenient shuttle buses to get you to the sights otherwise.

A really romantic place to have a drink before dinner. The lounge opens at 7 in the morning and closes at 11 in the evening. They start with breakfast in the morning, serve light lunch, then high tea ,cocktails and pre-dinner snacks to after dinner sweets. It is more or less self service, but if you need help the always very attentive staff is bringing you everything. They cared for the older guests and gave them a hand whenever needed. Because of Easter there were a lot children too, that were treated always very nicely. Everything we tasted was of excellent quality. All kinds of soft drinks, fresh juice, beer, a nice Italian red wine, white wine, sparkling wine, coffee and tea, cocktails in the evening and all the snacks are complimentary.

We were sitting outside next to the olive trees and the outdoor pool. A beautiful place.

We called them 2 weeks in advance and were on the waiting list. But we were lucky and got a nice table there. By the way, jacket and tie are required. The view from the terrace is overwhelming. Even from the indoor tables (it is still too cold for the terrace) you have a fantastic view. The 9 course menu was 198 Euro per person and featured an amuse geules, caramelized duck liver escalope on lemon foam with mint ice-crush ( delicious), scampi and caviar cannolo, tortellini with seafood, a porcini mushroom soup, fillet of red mullet, lamb sweetbreads, fillet of veal with black truffle and apple puree, cheese and dessert after dessert (at least 6). Food was, like expected, very good and the service great. You could study the wine menu for days, so we asked for a recommendation and we got an excellent Castello di Monsanto , Il Poggio 2001. They have a mineral water menu, that offers water from every place in the world with an exact description of the ingredients (minerals) and the location and depths of the source. This was a fun thing to read. Two other nights we tried the Restaurant Il Giardino Dell\u00b4Uliveto and had Pasta with Lobster (28 Euro per person). There was not much lobster in it, but the taste was very good. The salad was fresh , the steak with stuffed zucchini flowers (55 Euro) good, too. Staff efficient and friendly. There is an outdoor pool which hotel guest can use free of charge. Sun beds are comfortable and clean. Pool was opened on Easter Sunday and was still cold, but refreshing. For the indoor pool and spa they charge 31 Euro per person. It is very good too. The hotel runs a shuttle bus to Piazza Barberini at 8.30 and then every hour till 12.30 and from 15.30 to 19.30. (Sundays the schedule differs). After breakfast everybody wants to go downtown, make sure to line up early for the 10.30 and 11.30 bus . As there is a limited capacity. One day we walked to the Vatican. It is not too far. You leave the hotel at the main entrance. Turn left and follow the road through a residential area (safe) down to Via Trionfale A little later you cross Via Andrea Doria. There are markets there, where the locals buy their food. Very interesting. Three more blocks and you reach the Vaticano. On this side of the Vatican there are many cheap, simple but good restaurants. A 3 course lunch for about 9 to 12 Euro is quite common. We had a pizza with fungi porcini for 7.50 euro in \u201cLa Gondola\u201d in Via degli Scipioni. House wine was not bad too. You can sit outside there. We didn\u00b4t want to climb the hill on our way back, so we took a taxi from the foot of the hill at Piazale Clodio to the hotel (about 5 Euro) . Try to book the Executive level room, as 31 Euro entrance fee per person for the spa , breakfast, all drinks and snacks are included. Really nice lounge with a great view. What we liked: This Hilton has a special atmosphere of relaxed luxury. Friendly staff everywhere and every time from room maids, concierge, check-inn staff, waiters and lounge personnel to pool staff.

We did find a downside, and that was that there was not an iron and ironing board in the room. When I looked in the service guide, it said was a \"fire hazard\" and that you could use the on site cleaning service. When I looked at the prices, it was 8.00 or 9.00 Euro to get one shirt pressed. We ended up hanging our clothes in the bathroom when we took our showers and let the steam get the wrinkles out each day. Also, there wasn't an alarm clock in the room.

The Cavalieri Hilton has everything you could ever want in a hotel. Hotel: The Hotel itself is not much to look at from the exterior, however once you walk in, you will find a beautiful interior full of 19th century original art work, antiques and plenty of marble. The hotel has 8 floors of rooms, the top 2 being reserverd for executive and suite rooms. The hotel sits on its own park and overlooks all of Rome. The property includes indoor/outdoor pools, outdoor dining, tennis courts, rooftop bar and restaurant, spa, and of course a helicopter pad. For those who don't speak Italian, the staff is fluent in English too. Note: It is rumored that this property will be added to the Hilton Waldorf Astoria collection. This mean during high season HH rewards will be 60k/night and low season will be 40k/night. Today, it is a category 6 property and only requires 40k/night all year. Rooms: I stayed on the 7 & 8th floor which housed the executive rooms. For my first stay, I stayed on the 7th floor with a room that overlooked Rome from the private balcony. That was a great room!! The Hotel uses Hermes of Paris for its toiletries which is also a nice touch (opposed to the normal Crabtree and Evelyn). Rooms come with both a pillow and soap menu. House keeping is twice a day. An executive room with a Rome view is a MUST in this hotel. The lougne which is one of the largest executive lounges I have seen is stocked with food and drink all day. Since food and drink are very expensive in the hotel (10 euros for a beer, 24 euros for pizza), the executive lougne is a savior. For my second stay, I was in room on the 8th fllor. This room, which was apart of the executive floor, was very nice however the view was not of Rome, but of buildings across the street from the hotel. Spa: The spa is terrific. Although, as a Hilton Diamond I received free access, I believe the daily rate is 30 euros. The spa has a great Turkish bath, large indoor pool and huge workout facility. The Turkish bath is definitely worth using. After a long day of sightseeing, you will feel great relaxing their. I really could go on forever about this hotel. The staff was always every helpful. We were welcomed with a cake and a bottle of champagne in our room. We also enjoyed New Year's Eve there and were able to watch the fireworks across all of Rome. The Cavalieri also puts on their own fireworks show which is one of the largest in the city. There are a couple of cautions I must note, however they do not really take away from the class and level of this property. The Cavalieri Hilton is outside the city and will cost about 20 euros one way to the Termini (rail station) and average of 12 euros to go the city center. You cannot walk to the city center from the Hotel. Taxi rides are required unless you utilize the hotel shuttle service and runs every hour with the exception of 12:30-2pm. Beware that this shuttle can fill up quickly, so get their early. Lastly, everything costs in this Hotel. Please do not go there and not think you have been warned. With that being said, I would go again in a heartbeat.

Having accumulated a heap of HHonors points, I booked a free 5 night stay at the Cavalieri Hilton for our time in the eternal city. From the outside, the hotel is a rather unimpressive vine-covered rectangular monolith located on a hill northwest of the city center. The outside decks, pool and gardens are beautiful and inviting. Inside, there is a sophisticated opulence reminiscent of properties you would find on the Riviera or similar coastal locations. Numerous artifacts and art adorn the public spaces. Being a free stay, we were given a room on the non-view side of the hotel. If you can get a view side, by all means do it since you have the splendor of Rome and St. Peters to gaze upon. The rooms are large and generously appointed. All have a balcony of some sort. Bathrooms are spacious and completely done in marble. Maid service is impeccable and twice daily. Broadband internet access, like many European hotels, is extremely pricey. If you are going to be there for more than one day, consider the multi-day price schedules since it may come out cheaper than paying for each day. We ate in the downstairs restaurant our first night and were stunned at the prices. Two pasta dishes, a bottle of water, and a 10 euro bottled beer set my account back nearly US$100. We had read about the steep prices earlier and it is absolutely true. We did not eat again in the hotel, preferring instead to hit spots in central Rome that we\u2019d been told about. The food was nothing worthwhile to justify such prices and I would recommend you avoid eating here if you can. I was so numbed by the \u2018regular\u2019 restaurant prices that I did not bother to see what the Michelin-starred restaurant \u201cLa Pergola\u201d on the rooftop were. I workout when I travel so I intended to use the fitness center during our stay. At the very well equipped health club in the basement I was told that my Hilton Gold status did not apply, the daily fee being 31 euros (!!), despite my having received an email reservation confirmation signed by the Hotel GM indicating that my status qualified me to use the fitness center \u201cat facilities operated by Hilton\u201d. Apparently, this was not one of them which made getting a personal email from the GM a bit misleading in this regard. I brought this to the attention of the hotel staff and they politely removed one day\u2019s charge from my account and sent a complimentary bottle of wine to our room. I had to pay for the other days that I used the facility, which remains irksome. There is a regular shuttle bus that takes you into central Rome. We found this to be quite reliable and the driver, Pierro, simply a delight. Your alternative, if you do not take the bus, is to take a taxi for approximately 15 euro each way. This can add up quickly. The bus stops running at 8p, requiring you to taxi back if you have dinner in town. The concierge desk is staffed by a number of very helpful and courteous agents. They assisted us with dinner and tour reservations and offered suggestions for the order in which to see the big sights in Rome. All told, we were very pleased with the property, service, facilities and staff. This is a very expensive hotel, however, and it may not be the best choice if you can find something closer to the city center of similar quality and service. But for our needs, it fit the bill very well and we would be happy to return on a future trip.", "Date": "November 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLuxury - What a View\u201d", "Author": "WhenAreWeThere!", "ReviewID": "UR6018217", "Content": "My wife and I just returned from a 6 night holiday to Italy - 3 night in Rome and 3 nights in Sorrento - this was to celebrate my 40th Birthday. As a Hilton Hhonors Diamond Member we used my well earned points for this holiday. First impression of the hotel is amasing, with the water fountain, top hatted doorman and the smell of lilly flowers - the check in was fantastic as they took us to a \"special\" sitting area away from the main check-in. The receptionist explained everything about the hotel and then took us up to the 7th floor for a tour of the Executive Lounge and then up to our 8th floor room. What can I say about the room view - looking out over the pool, gardens and the WHOLE of Rome City - Awesome. The hotel and rooms are very clean with a VAST amount of gold, loads of marble and fine roman art. The bed was vast with crisp white sheets, loads of pillows and also a pillow & soap menu. The wall mounted plasma TV was amasing. Pool/Spa - Outside pool was VERY cold, but it was October. Inside pool was nice, but you need to visit the Spa and experience the biggest steam room I have ever been in - then relax on one of the beds with your white dressing gown and a warm blanket - this was so peaceful and relaxing. On the morning of my birthday we had breakfast on the room balcany, although it was 150euros - the champagne, caviar & salmon was worth every cent. Later that day, a cake, chocolates and champagne was delivered to the room - compliments of the hotel - NICE TOUCH! We could not get into the roof top resturant - even through my wife tried to book it 4 weeks in advance - stressing it was for my birthday - but then the hotel booked another resturant in the centre of Rome, closer to St Peters with a fantastic view of the doom from their roof top balcany. The meal was 370euros but the whole setting was so romantic. We found the hotel shuttle bus to be a good service and dropped us off close to the vatican one morning. The last bus back is at 8.30, but it was nice to sit and have a drink in one of the bars waiting for the bus to depart. If you are out flate the taxi back will be between 10 and 15 euros. The best part of the hotel is the 7th floor executive club - this is the best hilton we have experienced - the furnishing was top quality. There was also a good selection of beer and wine throughout the day. Excellent breakfast in the morning. Good selection of spirits in the evening. Nibbles were ok, with soup served in the evening.

I have never seen so much marble in a hotel (apart from Burj Arab in Dubai): floor laid with marble, reception and concierge areas made of marble, the whole bathroom complete with marble. Being on top of a hill, the view over Rome is fantastic; only 10 minutes taxi ride into central Rome (about 10 Euro each way). It's certainly much quieter to stay here, as Rome is notorious for its noise. Having said that my only criticism of the rooms is poor noise insulation -- as most rooms are interconnecting, you can hear literally everything in the next room (conversation, TV, music). Use of the spa, gym and swimming pool costs 32 Euro, even for hotel residents. Perhaps that's why the gym was empty. Penny pinching considering the hotel's obvious aspirations. Lying on a sunlounge with umbrella and beach towels will cost another 16 Euro. I had to say that the spa and pool lacked the wow factor(certainly didn't look as spectacular as the hotel's website photos). The topfloor (9th) restaurant, La Pergola, recently received 3 Michelin stars which it definitely deserved. Lovely view over Rome, cosy atmosphere with lots of table candles, attentive service from the waiters, and last but not least, the most imaginative and delicate cooking. And they had an extensive wine list as well as special coffees and teas menu. Certainly it did not come cheap, as the 6 course tasting menu cost 170 Euro (there is also a 9 course tasting menu).

The room itself was very pretty, although the view of the huge antenna outside didn't help. I will say that the bathroom had great water pressure and was nicely appointed in marble. We ate all of our meals out of the hotel for a couple of reasons: first because we wanted to see as much of Rome as possible before going on to the next part of our trip.

Having said that, I can understand that this hotel may not be for everyone and I will try and be as honest and objective as possible in my review. To fully understand the advantages of staying at the Cavalieri Hilton, you must realise that Rome is a VERY hot, busy, noisy, somewhat dirty city known for small, expensive, often run down hotel rooms with poor, or no air-conditioning. We found the Cavalieri Hilton to be an oasis removed from the heat and craziness of Rome, that we could escape to after wonderful, but tiring days of sightseeing. The hotel is a modern building, sitting on top of a hill overlooking the Vatican. It is a true 5 star property in every way. It is a large hotel, with a multi-level lobby, many restaurant and dining options, indoor and outdoor pools, extensive fitness facility, large hotel rooms even by North American standards, 400+ sq ft, with VERY comfortable beds, and wonderfully cool air-conditioning. The location is removed from the centre of Rome, and that may be a negative for some. However remember that Rome is a very big and spread out city, and staying near the Spanish steps still means you are far from the Vatican etc.. We found the complimentary shuttle service offered on the hour to a central location in Rome to be very convenient. It does stop a little early at 8pm, but taxies are plentiful in Rome, and are also very convenient. They can be hailed easily on the street, found at taxi stands, and instantly appear when called by the doorman. Most locations are aprox. 10-15 euro by cab, which I found reasonable. While in a mostly residential area, there is a small square within easy walking distance that has banks, restaurants, grocery stores, gelato, and shopping. The Cavalieri Hilton is not cheap. As many reviewers have noted EVERYTHING is expensive. We decided to stay at this hotel knowing this fact and were prepared for it. If you are on a budget or will be annoyed by some of the high charges, this may not be a good choice for you. We did our research and decided to book an Executive room with a City view and were not disappointed. I would highly recommend this approach, because most of the extra charges that the hotel is fond of charging are included. Although the room was 100-150 euro a night more, we found it worth the extra cost. We were able to access all of the hotels facilities, and were never charged anything extra, which took away the feeling of being \"nickel and dimed to death\". The Executive floors (7th & 8th) have spectacular views of Rome. We paid extra for a city view room overlooking the Vatican, however even if you don't you can enjoy the views from the executive room on the 7th floor. We could see all of Rome spread out below, sitting on our balcony at night. With a full moon, St. Peters below, and with the breathtaking terracotta colours of all the buildings; it was magical. Having access to the executive room was fantastic. From morning to night free food and drink were available. The room is VERY comfortable and enjoyable to relax in. Breakfast consists of hot food, bacon, eggs, toast, bagels, as well as a large supply of fresh fruits, cereal, and juice of every description. Free drinks, including soda, juice, water, wine, and liquor are available all day until 11pm. Light snacks, and Hors D\u2019oeuvres are served throughout the day as well, but would not be enough to substitute for lunch or dinner food. When you consider the cost of Breakfast (something like 50 euro each), and even the price of a soda (aprox 8-10 euro) you can see how this can quickly become a reasonable option. Other things like free internet access, officially limited to 15 minutes at a time, but I found if no one was waiting, longer periods were never a problem, are included free. And one of the nicest benefits was being able to use both the indoor and outdoor pools at any time without any extra charge. If not staying in an executive room the outdoor pool is free, however you do not get a towel, or lounger unless you pay 16 euro each. The outdoor pool is large cold and deep, with no shallow end, so it is not really suitable for relaxing in. This fact makes you want to use the indoor pool (especially if you like to relax in the water, or have children). The indoor pool is warm, shallow, and very relaxing, with attached hot tub, and waterfall. However there is an additional charge of aprox 33 euros each. Being able to come and go as we pleased, never worrying about extra charges made it enjoyable instead of annoying. And in July we REALLY appreciated the pools! Our 10 year old son was loving it. This was our second week of a three week vacation, and our first hotel with a pool. We spent an entire afternoon relaxing and rejuvenating poolside, and we really needed this rest. I can't think of any other hotel in Rome where this would be possible. My advice is if you are looking for a \"reasonably priced\" hotel, a hotel \"close to the action\", a hotel with a distinct Roman ambiance or feel, you might be wise to look elsewhere. If you don't mind paying a little extra for a modern oasis, complete with great service, food, and views, sitting on a hill slightly removed from all the hustle and bustle of Rome, I would highly recommend the Cavalieri Hilton. We will definitely return. Just remember to do you research, understand what the hotel offers and what it does not, be prepared for the charges such as they are, and enjoy. I would also strongly recommend staying in an executive room, we feel the benefits are worth the extra cost, and not having all the extra charges on the bill allows you to just relax and enjoy the hotel rather than worrying about being \"nickel and dimed\" to death.", "Date": "August 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cNot Worth It!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "blumoon76", "ReviewID": "UR5530885", "Content": "I read all the reviews about this hotel before we left for our trip.

It is also crowded with all the local Italians who buy passes to use it. It was very hard to get a seat and when we did we were packed in and surrounded by topless women and chain smokers on all sides. The pool is very deep so everybody hangs on the side which also makes it hard to get in and out. Don't even think about bringing your own towels, we saw a family get chased out for that! The food was extremely overpriced but you don't have a choice because you are so far away from everything (2 pasta lunches-89Euros, a coke was 12Euros!)

Rooms: I echo the sentiments of the previous reviewers. The rooms at this hotel are very nice, particularly when compared to most other standard hotel rooms in Europe which are typically very small. Be sure to ask for a room with a view of the city, otherwise, you will see a very large antenna tower. Also, we were awakened every morning around 2:30 am by the workers spraying for bugs in the front of the hotel. Staff/Service: The staff was very friendly and very adept at saying \"no\". We arrived early in the morning, around 9:00 am. To our surprise, our room was ready. After being told about the 7:00-10:30 buffet breakfast that was included in our stay, my husband and I thought we would go grab a quick bite to eat after checking in. We were told (with a smile), that our complimentary breakfast did not start until the following morning and they would charge us for anything we took from the buffet. Immediately after arriving to our room and realizing we had the view of the antenna tower, and after noticing the MANY rooms on the other side of the hotel that were being serviced by housekeeping, I asked if we could be moved to the other side. I was told, in a nice way, no. Hotel Offerings: Again, I echo previous reviewers. This hotel is extremely overpriced. 28 euros for a hamburger and fries. 30 euros a day for the spa with the gym and indoor pool. 5 euros for 15 minutes of internet use. The shuttle takes you downtown, which is nice, however, it stops at 8:00 pm when most restaurants start serving dinner and most taxi services start the evening surcharge. I would not stay here again.

We are Hilton Grand Vacation Club member and exchanged our HGVClub points for the Rome Hilton stays. Both the Cavalieri and Airport Hiltons are OK comparing to most of the US Hilton Club resort rooms. Beds, pillows, bathrooms,...etc. as described on the reviews are truly nice, but, they are still 'hotels', didn't give guests any 'homey feelings'. They are both a little pricy on the food and facility usages. As far as the transportations, they both have shuttles going into town every hour. To our surprise, both takes about the same amount of time to go in and out of town ~ approximately 25 minutes. The Airport Hilton will run the last shuttle from Rome around 11pm which is very convenient. Though the Cavalieri has a smaller shuttle bus which serves like a personal limo services.

Not because we could not afford to but simply because they are outrageous prices compared to so many other options. Every piazza in Rome or along Via Venoto has wonderful outdoor dining options at half the prices. Make sure the breakfast buffet is included if you stay here. Also we did not elect the Club room charge and were very glad we did not. We were not at the hotel enough during the day to come close to making it worth the price. Others who had told us their breakfast was not as good as the il Giardino buffet either. Only if you plan much time at the hotel and drink alot would this make any sense. There is simply no reason to charge the way they do. Fitness and pool service should be standard with every room. To top it off the concierge arranged tours of Rome for us and then with no disclosure to us charged a commission!?

My wife and I had a farewell trip from Europe after living in Spain and Germany the past nine years. Most of our adult lives we have worked and traveled overseas. We have been grateful to have been guests of a number of nice properties around the world over the years to include the Oriental in Bangkok on the river, the Grande Bretagne in Athens facing the Acropolis (great at night when the Acropolis is lit up) and other great spots to include the quaint Bavarian hotels like the lone hotel on Lake Ebsee.

The hotel is set off by itself on a hill overlooking the City. From the balconies on the city side of the hotel one can view this magnificent city. The Vatican is on the right and a pleasant walk down the tree lined streets to the old neighborhood around the Vatican. We spent 3 nights on award points. I am a Hilton Diamond and we were upgraded to an absolutely beautiful suite on an exec. floor. Fine art, large flat screen TV to include the bathroom, classic Italian furniture and space to roam. An entrance to the room through two pillars and the most romantic balcony with a view. This is the lap of luxury. We arrived from the airport a few hours before the normal check in time and the hotel desk person told us we would need to wait about an hour for the room to be prepared but they thought we would like it. My wife was elated at being in the city she adored, and in a fantasy hotel suite for 3 days. We ate breakfast in the exec. club each day, which happened to be the best I have seen of the Hilton exec. floor clubs. Lots of wine, champagne and foods and plenty of hideaway spots and balconies in the club to take in the view while sipping a cool drink. In the morning we took the hotel transportation to the middle of town and got off and walked to the historic sites of the city. One evening we went downstairs to the restaurant \"Giardino \"Dell'uliveto\" and my wife had the sea bass and I tried the choice of Sicilian cuisine and wine. Impeccable service and very good food. I asked for a sherry and realized I didn't request my favorite, which is Tio Pepe from Jerez. I was brought another brand which was known as a premium sherry but I wanted Tio Pepe if I could. I mentioned it, and It was no problem and my heart went out to the poor waiter who was lambasted by the wine steward for not insuring I received my favorite in the first place. There is a high level of service at the Cavalieri Hilton. I noticed that treating the staff with respect and admiration of their knowledge of their profession seems too enhance the experience.

The Coliseum and the Sistine Chapel are well complimented by a night view from the balcony of our suite at the Hilton after a day of exploring.

Our visit to Rome was absolutely fabulous. Rome and the Cavalieri Hilton have something in common, they are both extraordinary. We returned to Germany and have now moved to Hawaii.

Location- great views from the balconies over looking St. Peters and the city 2. Quiet- at night we slept with the windows open and enjoyed the cool breezes. 3. Bathrooms- large with really good lighting and if you forget your favorite soap well just consult their soap menu and choose from over 6 special types of soap. 4. Beds- comfortable with lots of down pillows - don't like down well they have a pillow menu ( yes- a pillow menu!) so if foam or horse hair are to liking they have it. 5. Rooms - ready when we arrived in the morning after our flight and much larger than most european hotels I've stayed in- oh and plenty of closet space 6. Pools- large outdoor pool plus an indoor pool and tennis courts 7. Restaurants- they have one of the best restaurants in Italy on the top floor (was not able to dine there though) and their main restaurant located just off the pool was excelllent both for breakfast and lunch. 8.

Staff- the staff are simply charming and were able to accommodate all are requests Negatives: 1. All this luxury does't come cheap- but they do have specials (check out their web site) 2. If you travel with kids- seal off the mini bar - those 8 euro cokes in really small bottles (6 oz.) will really p--- you off 3. Room service- again if you don't mind paying 26 euros for a cheese pizza- go for it, although I must say it was a really good pizza. Overall we left with a good feeling about this place and would not consider staying anywhere else in Rome.

It brings you to Piazza Barberini, which is a great starting point to hop on the Metro or walk to many famous sites. The only problem with the shuttle is that the last one runs at 8 p.m., which cancels out an opportunity to have a nice Roman dinner without the extra cost of cabfare. Granted, the Hilton reportedly has the best restaurant in town. Our only other complaint, which just may be something we're unaccustomed to, is the exorbitant charge for everything: internet connection, pool use, phone calls, and minibar (9 euro for a mini can of pringles!).

The rate may seem a little high, but in fact we had access to the Club Room on the Executive Floor, where complimentary food and drink are served from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., which was quite a big plus, so in the end I feel the value for money wasn\u2019t bad.

We took taxis into the city, which cost between \u20ac10 and \u20ac20 depending on the time/traffic/day. However, we sometimes had to queue for a taxi (for as long as half-an-hour on Sunday) and it wasn\u2019t easy to hail a taxi in the streets of Rome. There is also an hourly hotel shuttle bus to Piazza Barberini, but we didn\u2019t use it. I say hourly, but in reality there was a three-hour (four-hour on Sundays) gap between 12.30 (11.30) and 15.30, perhaps for the driver to have lunch and/or a siesta. The last shuttle was early in the evening, meaning a compulsory taxi ride back (the hotel isn\u2019t accessible by public transport). On balance, I liked staying slightly out of the centre \u2013 it was nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city, as well as the traffic pollution, after a tiring day\u2019s sightseeing. The hotel\u2019s hilltop location means great views of Rome (from one side of the hotel).

The marble bathroom was beautiful and quite large and the toiletries were by Herm\u00e8s. The only problem with the bathroom was a rather unpleasant smell emanating from the toilet. I was surprised that the TV reception was very poor and the choice of channels was very limited (the hotel probably tries to encourage you to use pay-per-view).

We were on the executive floor, so we didn't get nickle and dimed the way others do, so please keep that in mind.

It is comfortable, offers a wonderful view overlooking the city (probably the best in Rome) and offers spectacular food and service all day long. The rooms are fantastic. You will not believe how comfortable the beds are (however, the top sheet was quite rough, we kept taking it off at night). There are automatic blings with a switch next to the bed so if you want to sleep in or take a nap you can close out every bit of light. The rooms are quite large and in comparison of other hotels we stayed at in Italy, they were very large. The spa does cost extra unless you are on the executive floor, but the facilities are wonderful. There is a wonderful pool with a whirlpool that has a nice waterfall flowing into it. The saunas and hottup area is just great. There's a cold (and I mean cold) plunge pool right inside the steam room. It take some nerve to take the plunge, but what a great feeling when you do and then lie back in the steam. The hotel will arrange anything you need, from tours, dinner reservations, transportation or any type of travel - there is an onsite travel agent that can book trains or anything you need. The professionalism of the staff was bar none. You will have a difficult time finding a hotel with a better staff.

This was done at no extra charge. The room was beautiful, a huge queen size bed and pillows that you just sank into. There is a seating area and desk with mirrors everywhere. A television at the end of the bed and lots of wardrobe space. The bathroom was marble with a fantastic shower as well as a bath. The towels were changed twice a day and were soft and fluffy. The only thing missing from the room was tea/coffee making facilities, so take a travel kettle and a couple of cups.

Fast forward 35 years, to my 25th wedding anniversary trip, and I stayed there again, based on my fond memories. My wife and I were certainly not disappointed! The hotel has retained its top-of-the-line service and ambience, and has updated the decore and amenities of the hotel to 2005 5-star standards. From the moment we arrived, the friendly staff ensured our stay was memorable. We were upgraded to a \"city\" view (This is a \"must\" if you stay here...even if you have to pay extra) where each morning we were treated to the Roman sunrise overlooking St. Peters/Vatican City, with the Spanish Steps in the far distance. From the top of one of the hills surronding Rome, this is truly the most breathtaking view I have ever had from a hotel room. The spacious rooms were richly decorated, and had separate sleeping and sitting areas. The room actually reminded me of the rooms at the \"Venetian\" in Las Vegas, which may have taken some cues from the Cavalieri. A wonderfully comfortable bed, complete marble bath, and a roomy balcony made for an exceptional setting for our Anniversary (we stayed 4 nights). In the evenings a piano played in the pool patio bar below our room and keeping the patio door open to enjoy the sounds was enchanting (not so loud, though, that you couldn't shut most of the music out with the door closed, however). The grounds are a joy to walk around, and the pool is relaxing and refreshing. Be forewarned that the pool is \"free\" but the chairs/umbrellas have a fee. Also, the spa, which is very nice, is not \"free\" to Hilton Gold members, as it is in many locations. One of the special delights of the hotel was the free breakfast, courtesy of our Gold membership. Although we were not upgraded to the Executive Floor, as the hotel was sold out during our stay, the Hilton provided us with thier morning buffet. This was absolutely the best hotel breakfast buffet I have ever seen. It took us actually three days before we found all the different tables and \"stations\" with various foods. They have a selection of about 8 fresh juices, all made on-site, including home-made tomato juice. They have the obligitory \"traditional\" eggs/bacon/sausage/omlet bar. Then there is the meat/smoked fish/cheese bar, with no less than six different varieties of smoked fish every morning, including salmon, swordfish and tuna. Also a wide selection of fresh Italian cheeses, and the best Buffalo mozzerella I've ever had. If you like natural foods, they have a specific table with probably 30 \"all-natural\" items from cookies to breads. And their pastry table is--you guessed it--unbelievable (don't miss the apple strudle-like pastry with vanilla sauce!). For the work-out crowd, there is a smoothie bar, where you can blend your own shakes, complete with all the protien powders, and a bowl of egg whites. A desert bar is set up with a plethora of fresh fruit tortes, cakes and pies. Additionally, the desert bar also features home-made jams, jellies and preserves of every conceivable variety--I counted at least 40 jars. A piece of plain toast becomes an adventure whith these spreads. It is true that the hotel is out of the city proper, but the complimentary bus service is very reliable. Additionally, if you are in the city and need to get back after the service is ended, or don't feel like going back to the stop (Barbarini Square), a cab is about 10 Euros from most parts of the city. Barbarini is right on the subway line, so you can get to most places of interest fairly easily via the sub or walking from Barbarini. Additionally, one day I took the public bus from the square about 1/2 kilometer from the hotel, and this was cheap and easy...just ask the concierege for information/directions. Frankly, it was nice to come back to this hotel after a hot day of touring in the city, kind of like a cool retreat in the hills (actually about 2 km or so behind Vatican City). As alternatives to the very pricey hotel restaurants, there are at least tow nearby alternatives (which we tried): a nice pizzaria and a spendid Ristorante in the square down the street...these are where the locals eat so you get a nice \"taste\" of typical Roman eateries here, out of the hubub of the city down below. Of course, the main parts of the city are chock-full of great places to eat, too. If you really want to live it up at the Hilton (and in Rome), I would highly recommend dining one evening at La Pergola, the rooftop restaurant. The reviews in Zagat/Fodors etc. are not kidding when they say this is one of the best (if not the best) restaurant in Rome (throw away your stereotype thoughts of a hotel restaurant). La Pergola was truly the finest restaurant I have ever eaten at (and I do a lot of \"expense account\" eating at fine restaurants). Make sure you arrive early to have cocktails in the lounge or patio (a nice experience in itself). The personal service was exceptional--very attentive but not overbearing. The \"extras\" and \"surprises\" that are included make for a memorable experience. The food was the best, perfect to celebrate our anniversary. The chef, Heinz Beck, personally said goodbye to us and queried us on our meal. You will pay a lot for your this wonderful experience, but if you are looking for that one very special dining experience, I guarantee La Pergola will not disappoint. The hotel manager sent a personal note and gifts on our anniversary which was a nice surprise.

My favorite part was the constant scent of the millions of tiny white flowers blooming on every balcony of the hotel. The previous reviewers are correct about the expense of the hotel, and using the executive level supplement as a way to keep from feeling nickel and dimed (or should it be five and ten'd?) The club room at this hotel might not be for everyone, though - the wee little elegant snacks and the constantly hovering and helpful attendants might have you feeling like a show poodle after awhile. If you want to take care of your own creature comforts, walk out the front door of the hotel and go past the fountain to the street (Via Alberto Cadlolo). Turn right and walk about 300 yards to a sort of a town square, which abuts a main commercial street that winds up the mountain (I think both the square and the commercial street are called Medaglie d'Oro). There is a supermarket, produce stand, tobacco shop for stamps etc, restaurants, gelato stand, beauty shop, bakery, and on and on. Pretty much everything you would need. On the opposite side of the square there seemed to be a funfair area on the hill that little children might enjoy. Folks here seemed a little more glad and amused to talk to me then shopkeepers in Central Rome, who probably see a tourist with limited Italian about four times a minute. Also, the bus stop for the 907 bus that runs to the Cipro Metro station is on this main street, at the shop marked \"libreria.\" It is true that this hotel is sort of distant from the \"sights\" (although the view of Rome from here is quite a sight in its own right) but it's not to hard to cross the distance. (I didn't try it, but the map says that this street also has the 991 and 999 to the Lepanto Metro stop, the 990 to Piazza Cavour, and the 913 to Imperatore) The bus you want going into Rome will be headed downhill. Coming back, there are about five stops that say \"Medaglie d'Oro\" but with the name of another street underneath. You are looking for the one that says \"Medaglie d'Oro: Prisciano.\" To be honest, the 990 was crowded and was a long wait, but the hotel minibus wasn't running the first day we were there, because it was a holiday. The minibus also doesn't run after eight p.m. or for about three hours in the afternoon. There are also taxis that are waiting for customers on the street outside the hotel. The hotel minibus, called the navetta, is a big silver contraption that can seat at least 30 people. It has soft jazz music and wonderful air conditioning. It make a trip, about 20 minutes long, down the hill, through the neighborhood north of the Vatican, across the Tiber and through the Borghese park. Although technically it only makes two stops, one at the Via Veneto and the other at Piazza Barberini, I saw the very kind driver let one person out at a different stop (it was clear they had arranged it beforehand). From the Piazza Barberini, you can walk or take the Metro pretty much anywhere you want to go. The shuttle leaves the hotel promptly once every hour in the morning from 8:30 to 12:30 and in the afternoon from 2:30 to 7:30. The shuttle leaves Piazza Barberini once every hour in the morning from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and in the afternoon from 3 .m. to 8 p.m. At Piazza Barberini, the driver often waited a couple of extra minutes to make sure there were no stragglers. If you missed it, it would be perfectly easy to grab a drink or a snack at an outdoor cafe and wait for the next one. Also, a final word about the hotel pool. In hot weather, it alone would be reason to come to this hotel. It was deep. It was wide. It was cold.

Many people have said that you need the Rome view, i somewhat disagree (although the Rome view *is* amazing) - we did not have the city view but we were the last room on the hallway so the TV tower was way off to the left and we had a nice view of Monte Mario - the small village behind the hotel.

Oh and finally - if you're coming from the airport take a taxi with a meter - it is only about E50 and if there's 2 or more of you in your party it's about the same as the train (E10 each) to Rome + taxi to the hotel (E20)...

We ate in town or at local trattorias a few minutes away for next to nothing. You pay extra for a view ( worth doing) - but the biggest rip off is the SPA.

Yes, the hotel is a bit out of the way, but they do provide a shuttle service into town hourly. Its location on top of a hill allows for a magnificent view of the city. As we are Hilton Diamond members, we were upgraded to the executive floor. The Executive Club room was fantastic...a great breakfast spread (eggs, bacon, meats, cheese, cereals, yogurt with fruit, breads, etc.) snacks throughout the day and desserts at night. You can eat breakfast outside on the balcony overlooking the city....a great way to start the day. We had a beautiful, spacious room with a balcony. The bathrooms are lovely...marble and well-appointed. The bed was extremely comfortable. We were welcomed to our room with champagne as we were celebrating our 15th anniversary. The service was akin to that at a Ritz or Four Seasons in the US. The concierge was extremely helpful. The driver, Claudio, picked us up at the airport. He was prompt and very outgoing. We found it to be our little haven away from the hustle and bustle of the central city...very peaceful and quiet with a lovely pool and gardens. The workout room was one of the best that we've ever encountered in a hotel. We got to use it for free due to the diamond membership, I believe that there is a daily fee to use it, otherwise. Not to be overly gushing, on the negative side...it is very expensive as others have noted. There are not a lot of restaurants in the area, but the nicest restaurant in the city is on the top floor of the hotel if you are looking for a very expensive splurge. We did not because we packed lightly and didn't have appropriate dress for a restaurant like that. We will be staying there again the next time we are in Rome.

Also, they treat their customers well. We checked out for a trip to Amalfi that didn't turn out too well. When we called to see if they had a room for us if we returned to Rome, they accommodated us (even though they were quite full and we didn't give any advance notice). Would I stay here again?

I'd spend the extra $20-30 to get a city view - the alternative is a massive tv/radio mast out the back which isn't particularly attractive. Try not to buy anything in the hotel, as the prices are seriously inflated. I wrote this on my comment card, and got a nice letter from the manager who felt this was appropriate for the type of hotel, and it's location. At least they're honest.

The hotel also charges you to use their health club (indoor pool, whirpools, gym). In theory the outdoor pool is complimentary. Assuming you don't want to sit down or dry off that is!
