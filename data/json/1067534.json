A bit noisy during the night due to the tram passing through. There were a couple of nice nearby cafes/bars in the area. Our hotel room was very clean with fresh towels everyday, however the room we had needed to be maintained and updated due to a broken toilet seat and a leaky sink. It also needed a lick of paint. The breakfast was very basic and the staff only spoke a little amount of english, although they were very friendly. Overall, the hotel was small and quaint and was good value for money.", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cDisgusting!

Middle of nowhere needed a taxi to get there. or walk 15 minutes to public transport. The building was falling apart. The reception Staff was eating Curry on all the documents and it stunk horribly. The room ceiling was peeling off and had cobwebs in the corners. the shower tiles were falling and on the ground, the shower curtain had mold on it, I was told it was a non smoking room but it stunk like smoke. breakfast was a cup of coffee!! I was so disgusted that camping seemed much more hygienic than this place!", "Date": "February 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cDeceptive Website\u201d", "Author": "Simivic", "ReviewID": "UR54951576", "Content": "While the staff were friendly & we managed to communicate with my minimal Italian the hotel bears no resemblance to its website See attached photo. It was incredibly noisy at night and was set in a fairly run down area w/o nearby eating except a small supermarket & snack bar only open during the day. The rooms had been redecorated but badly and awkwardly furnished.

Cracks in the wall give testimony to the fact the room quite literally shook everytime a tram went past. Just when you were looking forward to the trams stopping for the night the boom boom boom from the bar next door took over. It was enough to wake the dead, which it might easily have done since there was a huge cemetery literally 5 minutes walk from the hotel! Hotel inside was quite charming, facilities had been modernised yet it was still decorated very traditionally. Continental Breakfast was provided and coffee good. If its a basic value for money hotel you're looking for about 20 mins walk from Rome centre but in a small studenty suburb (San Lorenzo) this might actually suit you quite well.", "Date": "November 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seaford, Aust", "Title": "\u201cChoose somewhere else!\u201d", "Author": "Breffa", "ReviewID": "UR39744572", "Content": "The service, location, breaky and view were terrible.

It is in a loud part of Rome (tram passing near) but with the trams and buses, you can get almost everywhere (#3 to Colosseum and antic rome, #19 to Vatican) breakfast was OK, they prepare me the best coffee in italy", "Date": "July 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheltenham", "Title": "\u201cDon't trust good reviews.\u201d", "Author": "skysea3", "ReviewID": "UR32037197", "Content": "Hi. I went to the Hotel Vibel Roma with my parents. It was absolutely nightmare! There was not public transportation to the hotel vibel from the main train station. When I arrived there, the lady of the hotel - she seems like the owner - but she can't speak english at all and she gave me totaly wrong information about the tram 19. At night in your room, you can feel the vibration from the tram and it's quite loud until 12 in the midnight. Breakfast is horrible, not enjoyable - coffee or juice (which sometimes you can't have it because they didn't prepare it.), toasted tiny bread in the bag (5cm x 4cm big), croissants. That's it and it's going to be served by only one person. When I was in Rome, it was beautiful day but we were worried when we left the hotel. - it was really far from the city and no public transportaion. I can say that it is cheap hotel but I paid same amount of money in florence with better breakfast.
