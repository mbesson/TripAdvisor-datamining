Noise was not a problem as we were a few floors up, however, when we returned to our room on our first night and turned on lights and air con the electricity in the room tripped. We eventually changed to a room that faced into the courtyard that had twin beds rather than a double bed and were told that a room with a double bed would be available the next day. The rooms facing into the inner courtyard are quite dark during the day, and of course if you pull back the curtains then you're facing into another bedroom. The following morning, the reception staff had no knowledge of our moving the previous evening which I thought to be pretty poor for a 4* hotel so I had to explain the situation to them.

Overall, it\u2019s a good hotel that\u2019s moderately priced considering the good location. Here are some of my thoughts on things that stood out: BOOKING \u2013 My local sales office booked the room through booking.com for something like 110 Euro/night plus tax with about 1 week\u2019s notice. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a great deal or not, but it seems reasonable. Price included the daily breakfast buffet. LOCATION \u2013 This was my first trip to Barcelona, so I have no basis of comparison what it\u2019s like to stay elsewhere in the city, but I must say I really liked the location. It is about a block away from Plaza de Espana which offers access to the subway system (all the way to the airport if desired) and the double-decker tour buses from which one can enjoy checking out the entire city at one\u2019s own pace. The plaza includes a bullfighting arena converted to a high-end shopping mall with some nice restaurants. The surrounding streets that branch out from the plaza like bicycle spokes include plenty of good restaurants with outdoor seating; I think I\u2019ve had enough tapas, paella and sangria in those 3 days to last a lifetime. The Gran Via road is a fairly direct route off the highway from the airport, so a taxi ride to/from the airport is a breeze. The rightmost lane is a dedicated taxi/bus lane so hailing a cab from the hotel\u2019s entrance takes all of 20 seconds at worst. ROOM \u2013 The hotel d\u00e9cor has the art-deco IKEA look-and-feel throughout. The hotel did appear to be recently renovated as nothing appeared significantly aged. As for the room itself, it was cozy\u2026code for small. Still, it was adequate for my business needs as it included a desk and queen bed. The bathroom was quite large, almost half the room size. The closet included a built-in safe (free) which was large enough to hold my laptop bag. The fridge was empty save for some complimentary bottles of water which were replenished daily. The hotel offered free WiFi in which the front desk provided the user name and password, but the performance was spotty at best. The TV had a handful of analog channels which included English-speaking CNN and dozens of digital channels all in Spanish. Some of the channels late at night had infomercials that were\u2026interesting to say the least (don\u2019t let the kids watch). The maid service was good as expected\u2026by the time I got back to the room after a long day with the customer or sightseeing, the room was made up. Note: The door to the room included a double-deadbolt and the in-room catalog of hotel services recommended strongly to keep everything locked, even while in the room, and to report any suspicious people in the hallways to the front desk. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s standard operating procedure for the hotels in Barcelona or if there\u2019s something to be concerned about that location in particular, but nothing ever disappeared from my room. FRONT DESK \u2013 The hotel had no bellhops or doormen. The front desk is immediately at the entrance. The registration staff is very friendly and provided me pamphlets and advice for the tours offered on my free day. Note: I arrived on a Saturday and called to ask about ironing service for my wrinkled suit. The text on the cleaning bag mentioned no service on the weekends, but I thought I\u2019d try. The front desk told me that they would send someone right up. Nobody came. I called a 2nd time. Still, nobody came. On the 3rd call, a different receptionist informed me that the service was not available on the weekends. When I asked to borrow an iron, I was told they had none to lend me. RESTAURANTS \u2013 The breakfast buffet was pretty good. The main offerings are breads, pastries, cheeses, salmon and cold cuts and fruit along with juices and coffee. On the first morning (Sunday), they also offered eggs, ham and potatoes. On the other mornings the hot offerings were not readily available, but instead were available by custom-order with the waitress for no additional charge and the food came fast! I don\u2019t know if the hotel had other restaurants for lunch and/or dinner, but the surrounding restaurants are so good and abundant that one should venture out for those meals. I think that\u2019s all I have to say. It\u2019s a lot and I\u2019m sure I missed plenty.

I took advantage of the Aerobus whose stop is also located on the Plaza Espana. It cost me 5.30 Euro for a one way, 20 minute trip to the airport. I came into Barcelona by train to the Sants Station. It was a 10.50 Euro taxi ride to the hotel. I did not take advantage of the hotel buffet breakfast which, at 16 Euro, was too expensive and too much food for me anyway.

I can suggest anybody to ask the receptionist to get an internal room, which makes your sleep much better, if you go to Barcelona to visit the city you likely don't care much of the internal exposure.

(a lovely Spanish champagne) on ice; 3 different juices (orange, a berry mix, the other, I think, was pear juice), mineral water, hot and cold milk (didn't notice any skim milk), 2 fancy expresso machines with all the bells and whistles and 4 different brews in individual brewing cups; nescafe, 2 kinds of hot chocolate, s selection of teas; 4 cereals, including granola; yoghurt; fresh bread rolls and sliced bread (next to the toaster), butter, lots of jellies, marmalade & jams (try the green plum); cold cuts: serrano ham, turkey, salami, cheese; baby greens salad, cherry tomatoes, canned tuna, green and black olives; a selection of sweet pastries, including chocolate rugelach, ensaimadas, a light, delicious almond cake. If you happen to be here on the weekend, don't miss the lovely & free light and sound (classical music) show on Fri and Sat nights from 7-9PM, at the Magic Fountain, just behind the hotel (turn right as you leave the hotel and walk up the hill). If you don't flash money or jewelry on the street and stay alert in crowds, you'll surely enjoy beautiful Barcelona.", "Date": "January 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA bit disappointing\u201d", "Author": "tom60", "ReviewID": "UR89814636", "Content": "We came to Barcelona for my birthday.

We took plain to Barcelona airport and took the shuttle bus which was quite convenient, cheap and quick. The bus stop is 150 yards from the hotel. We arrived in the morning on purpose to profit of the day and left our luggage in the reception. We were advised to come back at 1.30pm to finalize the check in. We came back at 2.45pm but the room was not ready. After a bit of wait we started to get annoyed as we wanted to get change. First we were given a room on 3rd floor which was overviewing the main road (there is no double glazing) and we asked to change room as . In the meantime while waiting for the room to be ready we went to the bar following the view of promotion on cocktails in the lift. This was just a joke we ordered 2 cocktails one Long Island Ice tea and a caipirinha. There was no cola in the long island and it was really horrible, the barmaid was adamant there is never cola in a long island ice tea!!! when I requested the coke a bottle was given and then she came with a mesure of cola ???? never seen that before! appalling and the best is that we had to pay for this!!!! the brazilian cocktail caipirinha had barely sugar in it unmixed. Then we got our room, still noisy but we said that it was enough and decided to head to the port. The room is modern, it lacks foreign channels but it was not the purpose of our trip. For a room for this price I expect better quality, the mini bar had only water. Breakfast was really good but the staff were not really friendly, no smile or talk. We did not go to the restaurant following our disappointing experience of the bar. On the good side the location was perfect nearby Montjuic area as well as lot of buses and tube lines were going through this area. As an overal this is a disappointing experience.

I travel frequently (on my own dime - not on an expense account) so in the US I stay at Motel 6 and Days Inn level places; in Europe I pay more to be in a safe area and avoid the hostels. Hotel Gran Via was perfect for many reasons: quiet, inexpensive (I paid less than 90/night USD including taxes which did not include the breakfast charge), very clean, upscale and convenient to public transportation and shopping. The room had a small refrigerator stocked with mineral and still waters (at no charge) which allowed me to shop at local markets and keep food cold in my room so I wasn't paying to eat out every meal. The staff was friendly and courteous and the neighborhood felt safe, even late at night. The hotel is situated next to a convention center so it definately had a business hotel feel. The Aerobus from the airport drops off and picks up less than one block from the hotel and the metro, city buses and the two Barcelona hop on/hop off tour buses stop about 1 block away. I found the hotel breakfast to be ample compared to what is offered at hotels in other European cities, the offerings include hot eggs, breakfast meats, fruit, cheeses, breads, juices and champagne. If you book the breakfasts when you check in you are charged less than if you pay later or day-by-day. I did not have my laptop with me and thought the internet/computer use fee was a little high; however, there are several local internet shops within a few blocks of the hotel that offer access for about half the price.

My room did not have a bath but a powerful large shower instead [there are bath's in other rooms so you may want to state that on booking].

Breakfast was 15euros per day and was mainly scrambled egg and sausages except one morning when the chef decided to put fried egg and bacon on the menu, other breakfast items included fresh fruit, meat, spanish pastries,cheese and of course you can have a glass of sparkling Cava wine as well.

My advice is to go out and look for breakfast in the area, there is a nice bakery shop not far from the hotel [out the door turn left and walk down the Gran Via], prices for food outside the hotel are very good and competative, your money will go a lot further.

For a very cheap and very tasty breakfast walk down the other end of the side street next to the hotel and eat at the stunning museum's cafe, they do some amazing pastries. The only negatives I can think of are that there was a weird odor in the corridor outside the room. It smelt like old carpet or something. Thankfully you only have to smell that for about 5 seconds! Also the area around Fira was a little threatening late at night when coming out of the metro station but at least it's only a 2 minute walk between there and the hotel. Overall it was a really nice, comfortable hotel at a pretty good price and I would certainly go back there.", "Date": "October 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Halifax, England", "Title": "\u201cComfortable & Ideal\u201d", "Author": "Dalesman87", "ReviewID": "UR47088250", "Content": "My wife and I were looking for a comfortable hotel, away from the immediate city centre & La Rambla area, to avoid the noise at night..

The hotel is very close to Montjuic, where the olympic stadium and the art museum is. It is also within walk distance to the magic fountain, where they have fantastic magic fountain performance at weekend night time.

You hear no noise from other rooms or from the hallway. Our room did not face the street. Ask for one that faces the interior. (2) it is clean and very modern in decor. The rooms are large. (3) the hotel left us two bottles of plain water and two bottles of sparkling water every day, for free. (4) the hotel restaurant had a separate area where we could avoid the 15 euro breakfast in the morning and just have a reasonably priced (and delicious) caffe con leche and pastry. There are a couple of downsides: the air conditioning works, but not very well. We were never able to get the room much below about 76 degrees. The hotel is a five minute walk to the Plaza Espanya metro, but there isn't much in the immediate area in the way of shops, restaurants or tourist attractions. Sometime in the future the old bullfighting arena at Plaza Espanya will be turned into a mall, but for now the only thing you can walk to from the hotel is the hill of Montjuic, which has the art museum, the fountain that is lit up at night, various botanical gardens, various smaller museums, the Spanish Village, and the cable car up to the castle. The rest of Barcelona is really out of reach on foot. The other thing we did not like is that, although the hotel has free WiFi, if you don't bring your laptop, using the hotel's computers costs 6 euros an hour. Finally, if you stay here, be very careful when going down into the metro and all of the time you stay on the metro. Even going down the metro escalator steps at a good clip with my husband behind me, someone slipped in between us and opened my backpack. The petty crime and pickpocketing in Spain is completely out of control: there were three attempts that we know of on us in two weeks, all in or around the metros. Plus we saw a thief on a main street walk into a restaurant and calmly start to walk out with someone's camera. We felt more unsafe in Spain than in any other place in Europe. There is no police presence except at the metro turnstiles, where they're trying to deter farebeaters; apparently the Spanish police don't care that tourists are being preyed upon. Put your valuables in a zippered pouch inside your clothing, don't carry a backpack, keep an eye on anything you put down beside you in a restaurant, walk in caravans, don't let people surround you on the metro: make sure you are near an exit door.

On the weekends, the room out by the road was actually quite quiet.", "Date": "May 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riga", "Title": "\u201cModern, new, free wi-fi, goo location\u201d", "Author": "GMRiga", "ReviewID": "UR16115023", "Content": "While in Barcelona on a business trip, I thouroughly enjoyed staying in this hotel. Firstly, location: it is next to Placa Espanya, so its quite touristy but not noisy or crowded like Las Ramblas area. 2) Transport: the A1 express bus from the airport stops 50 metres from the hotel. Get off at the first stop, walk back 50 metres and here is the hotel - I found this superb. 3) Rooms - modern, stylish, very clean and have free (!) Wi-fi internet, which allowed me to do a lot of work on a computer without worrying about the bill. 4) Staff - friendly and polite, no complaints. room service is ok, too. Overall - yes, I would definately stay in this hotel in the future! p.s. some the rooms on high floors have a great view of the square.", "Date": "May 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sheffield, England", "Title": "\u201cthe promise of a good nights sleep\u201d", "Author": "cndybrks1664", "ReviewID": "UR15513827", "Content": "We had been traveling around barcelona, staying in basic hotels and even camping, and as this was the last part of our trip we booked this hotel as a bit of a treat due to its promised of a top class service, good location and reasonalble price. On arrival we were impressed by the secure under groud parking, (that was before we were told that it was 16euros a day to use it - but the going rate for a city I suppose) The welcome at reception was professional if a little cold and un friendly. Our room (409) was compact shall we say but adequate for what we needed given we were only staying 2 nights. The hotel proudly advertises that all its rooms are completly sound proof and the hotel istself is very quiet, however our room over looking the main road still got quite a lot of traffic noise from the window, and the heating system was nosiey, even on its lowest setting. But the traffic noise - especially in the mornings did wake us up earlier than intended. The room itself was immacutatly presented though, and the bathroom was big and shower great. Again a minor dissapointment was the fact that the radiator couldnt be turned down or off in the bathroom, making the whole room very warm. When we mentioned the excess road noise and heating fault at reception, there was little appology and no offer of an alternative room, for which we felt quite dissapointed. The bar area was modern and the prices reasonable, although lacked a little atmosphere. The hotel has great transport links with the metro less than 5 minutes walk away and pleanty to look at in the surrounding area, though there wasnt much is the way of bars and cafes to eat out, and the ones that are there were not very good- we found it better to get the metro to the ramblas where there was far better choice. The hotel promises so much quality that maybe we set our expections too high, and as such we felt dissapointed with the poor customer service and the flawed promise of a good nights sleep-which at the end of the day is all you really need out of a good hotel.", "Date": "April 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, average location\u201d", "Author": "EQ1980", "ReviewID": "UR15500731", "Content": "Stayed for 4 nights at the end of April 2008. Hotel was very very stylish, super clean and the staff were really helpful. Only downsides for us were the location - only 4 tube stops outside of town but there isn't anything of interest in the vicinity or any decent bars/restaurants. Also the hotel itself could maybe do with a few more practical touches... - No kettle provided in the rooms so missed my morning cuppa. - They won't provide irons in the rooms for \"safety reasons\" so everything has to go through hotel laundry unless you want to look like you've been to bed in your clothes. - lights in the rooms are either full on 'ON' or its pitch black. - no dressing table/mirror that you can see while sat down so had to blow dry my hair stood up (complete girly point I admit but it annoyed me no end). Other things to note/tips if you're thinking of staying here: - specify in advance that you want an interior room. We were orginally in a room overlooking Gran Via which is an awful view and really really noisy. Staff were great though and moved us to another room which faced the courtyard and was nice and quiet. - save yourself cab far by taking the shuttle bus from the airport to Placa Espanya - the hotel is right there and its basically the first stop so takes the same amount of time as a taxi for a fraction of the cost. - don't pay for breakfast in the hotel unless it comes as part of your nightly rate. We were told it would be \u20ac16 per person per day but there's a great little pastry shop about 50 yards down the road where we ate breakfast for the grand total of \u20ac6 for the two of us each morning. Overall a lovely hotel if you're not bothered about being in the centre of town.", "Date": "April 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "southampton", "Title": "\u201cUltra modern and friendly hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "rachbrown3", "ReviewID": "UR15260435", "Content": "My boyfriend booked for us to go to Barcelona for 2 nights at this hotel for my birthday. I initially looked the location of the hotel up on a map of Barcelona and thought it was a long way out of the centre......how wrong was I!! The location is perfect for exploring all of Barcelona's beautiful areas. We were welcomed by a very friendly member of staff on reception who spoke good english and was very helpful. Check-in was smooth and we were given the key card to our room. The interior of the hotel is ultra modern but not uncomfortable looking. Our room was big with a really lovely bathroom. The BEST SHOWER I have ever used in my life!! Air con was easy to use also as we were quite hot. You are a 2 min walk from the main line metro station which takes you to all the major areas, the metro is the best thing in barcelona for getting around, so cheap (10 euro for a 2 day pass) and so quick, there is a train every 5 minutes without fail. My best advice is the following: - Get the Barcelona Bus from Girona airport to the Arc de Triomf metro station and get the metro (2 stops) to Placa Espanya which is 2 mins from the hotel (20 euro return) - DO NOT GET A TAXI as we missed the bus on the way back and had to pay 120 euros!!! - Go to the beach at Barceloneta and eat lunch at one of the cafes - Go to the Picasso Museum and walk around the Gothic Quarter and have lunch near the Cathedral - Walk along Las Ramblas in the day and look at all the human statues and stalls (lots of animals for sale though which isn't very nice) - DO NOT EAT ON LAS RAMBLAS as they over charge, eat on one of the side roads, much nicer and cheaper - Shop and eat tapas on Passeig de Gracia - Walk up the road directly next to the hotel and watch the Magic Fountains at Castle Montjuic (shows 7pm - 9pm). Have a glass of Cava at the top and sit on the cool bobbly chairs (you have to see them) Overall, this hotel is perfect and I would definately stay there again.
