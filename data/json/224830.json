They were clean, if spartan, with a small kitchenette - our primary concern. We had reservations for a week at this facility, but when we saw the room, we bacame concerned. It looked liked the housekeekper replaced the towels but didn't clean. There were coffee grounds still in the coffee maker and a sticky drink ring on a table. We proceeded to look at three more rooms, none of which were accepible. One had a full trash can under the sink. None had a full complement of cooking or eating utensils in the kitchen. They all had stained, worn furniture and the hallways needed to be painted. We finally decided to check for bedbugs and found no mattress pads on the beds and stains on the bedspreads. At that point it didn't matter whether there were bedbugs, we were going elsewhere.

We looked for apartments but had to settle for an extended stay type hotel. I relocate last year to Indy and had to stay at the regular Extended Stay just a few blocks from this one. The other one was the worst place in the world to spend even one night. I figured the word Deluxe in the name of this one would make it a better place to stay. So far after five days of our 32 day stay we can hardly wait to leave. It\u2019s in better shape than the other one down the street but not by much. Cabinet are too high for wife to reach, microwave was broke, sink faucet was broke but worked, no oven to cook in. We picked this place because we thought it was renovated but doesn't seem like it. Old out dated TVs with poor reception on an old satellite system for hotels. Every little thunderstorm caused problems for it. So far the whole time we have lived in Indy we never had a problem with our satellite reception. Furniture is old and worn which is expected a little bit. I know it\u2019s not a five star hotel but it shouldn't be a 1 star either. We have plenty of days left to see if things can turn around. I'll post another review toward the end of our stay.

Only downside were the pillows - too small and soft for our liking. There is a Cracker Barrel restaurant right in front within walking distance - another perk we like when traveling! First timers, for even short stays, have to remember the way the extended stay places work - - - it's like your own apartment. YOU have to pick up after yourself each day. YOU have to either hang up your towels to dry (or go to the desk for new ones yourself). YOU have to make your own bed. YOU have to do your own dishes (they do offer dish soap). YOU have to provide your own shampoo. The cleaning folks will only come in once a week during your stay, or more often if you pay for it.
