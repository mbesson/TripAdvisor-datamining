We were fine with having a bunkbed, but the \"double\" bed was barely bigger than a twin bed that had to be shared between two women. We were expecting two double beds like the pictures shown online. Overall, the room was not desirable at all, especially because of paper thin walls. We woke up throughout the night because of loud noises above us. We found out later it was a water pump, but the front desk personnel basically took it as a joke. Luckily we didn't hear any noises the second night.

Yes 'the rooms' do have the styling as suggested in the photo's, BUT, are the rooms rooms or small partitioned- off spaces in a building? By the time the 'over styled' 'rooms' have their furnishings in, there is barely any room to move, resulting in having to almost squeeze yourself around the bed, then squeeze yourself into the the shower-'room' (or, more aptly, 'shower-cupboard') that somehow defies physics and just about has a toilet and basin in and enough space to just about let you stand. Back in the 'bed-space', try letting daylight in with the 'broken in a pulled down position blinds' and you'll fail. This ridiculous experience is compounded by either taking the smallest lift in the world - choose between your luggage or yourself to use it in turn - or going up the stairs and through the strangest 'corridors' in the world; a labyrinth so narrow you have to almost call ahead to check no-one else is coming, as there certainly isn't any passing space, whilst at the same time very carefully studying the floor for the unexpected humps and changes of levels perhaps deliberately boobie-trapped under the world's most hideous carpet. Again you wonder if these are real corridors or partitioned off spaces in a building desperately trying - and evening more desperately failing - to maximise space to gain 'rooms' / (or perhaps cells is a better description)! You certainly have to allow yourself additional time to navigate your way through the corridors because they are indeed a tiresome puzzle with no windows in and what seems like endless turns: - if you do tragically find yourself in this nightmare, perhaps use a pen or lipstick to mark your route, don't worry about spoiling the decor, that would be impossible because the walls don't have any and it would be impossible to make the carpet visually any worse. OK, so that's the non-organic part of this rubbish hotel, now for customer service - there isn't any!

It is situated in a pleasant street; (with plenty of shops, restaurants and cash points all nearby.) We checked in with ease and received a warm welcome.

Also I do agree that their website is not entirely accurate to the reality - particularly if you are staying in one of the standard rooms.

We decided to go and find another hotel as this was not what we expected to find having booked from the web site picturing lovely rooms on it, how wrong can you be, we got the broom cupboard turned twin bedroom. We asked for a refund so that we could go and find a decent hotel but the hotel operates a 48hour cancellation policy also taking full payment before checking in. We now know why that is, this hotel makes a living from taking peoples money and not returing it when there is a genuine complaint, this is easy money for them. We left and spent a brilliant night at the Premier Inn Kensington just round the corner ( I would fully recommend this hotel for a really great stay) We were offered by the Mayflower an upgrade for \u00c2\u00a320 for the Saturday night , we took this offer as the Premier was full but what a mistake to think this would be any better, the room was slightly bigger but the bathroom was smaller than the previous room with very little room to even sit on the toilet properly, this was the last straw and we have cut our trip to London short and come home.

The usable size of the room (including the bed which felt smaller than a standard double) was roughly 7' square - smaller than some hotel bathrooms! Again, the quality of the furniture was very poor, the blind was torn and frayed along the length of one side. The bathroom was basic, and not well cleaned which may have contributed to the slight unpleasant smell.

The bathroom was a treat - quality fittings & fixtures and a big walk-in tiled shower with good pressure and an unwavering constant temperature. The beds were comfortable with fluffy duvets, and our 2nd-floor room didn't get too much street noise (not that I would have noticed, arriving back at 4.30am). There is 24-hour night porterage, and they are happy to hold on to your bags after you have checked out - although they didn't seem to be massively concerned about security, as we saw several bags sitting unattended in the small lounge adjoining the reception.

The lack of a room phone meant I could not communicate with the hotel reception.

It was obvious we interrupted a conversation of sorts when we checked in. Needless to say it was uncomfortable to say the least. Once we checked in we attempted to take our luggage up to our room. Operatiave word here is \"attempted\". The elevators (lifts) were the size of a vertical coffin (for 2). Yup - that's it. Seeing as we were traveling throughout the UK for 2 weeks, we had some luggage, so it took 2 trips EACH up the lift to our 2nd coffin - the large closet with a bed - yea, that was our room. The mattress was all of 3 inches thick, minimal closet space (not a biggie for me, but may be for some of you). I'll spare you the rest of the details, but you can imagine. The room was clean, I do have to admit that. The bath, also, was clean. And, breakfast (complimentary) was served in the basement level. It really wasn't bad. Upon leaving the hotel, we asked the front desk to call us a cab. A large Mercedes pulled up, (aparently a private hire car) a man speaking broken English (perhaps a nephew of the owner?) got out of the car and started putting our luggage in the trunk. We followed (again, we were green!), got in the car and told him to take us to Charring Cross train station. That was the longest ride of my life (all of 4 miles!). I actually caught the driver glaring at me via the rear-view window. Stupidly (isn't hind-sight 20/20?) I \"glared\" right back. It's a wonder I'm alive.

My husband, myself and our 2 daughters (ages 19 & 24) stayed at the Mayflower for 9 days in June. It was extremely difficult to find a room in London that would hold 4 adults for a resonable price. My husband and I had traveled in England before and knew that the hotel rooms are notoriously small as compared to the US so I was a little concerned about the amount of space we would have. We had a room in the main hotel, in the basement just down the hall from the breakfast room. The room was fairly quiet and much larger that we had expected. We had 2 double beds and there was plenty of closet space. There was a desk and 2 chairs in the room and we still had sufficient room to move around. The bath was unusually large with double sinks. The only anoyance was that the bathroom exhaust fan was poor and when more that 2 people took a shower the room became humid and muggy. The room did have a stand fan supplied that helped with that problem. We were at the front of the hotel and since we were in the basement our windows where below street level. They were frosted so that nobody could see in but that meant the we could not see out to check the weather until we left the room. We spent so little time in the room that this was not that big of a deal. Being in the front of the hotel also meant the we didn't have the annoyance of hearing the underground as other reviewers have mentioned. We also had a computer and took advantage of the wireless internet. We had no trouble getting connected and communicating with people back home.The complimentary breakfast became a little boring after the 4th day but it was filling and it was one less meal you had to buy. They had cereal, yoguart, fruit, cheese, crossaints, rolls, toast, juice, coffee and tea. You could order extra (eggs, etc) for an extra fee.The very best thing about the Mayflower was the proximity to the Earl's Court Underground station!!! It is litteraly around the corner! At the other end of the street was Earl's Court Road with a couple of grocery stores that were a good place to buy snacks and many eating places including Subway and some cute taverns. There is a great pizza place called Snappy Pizza, the pizza was really good.

A hotel employee showed us the way, to a building on the street in front of the hotel. As soon as he opened the door of the building we could see we were in for a disaster: The building was old, not well maintained and with poor light.

We were told there were no other rooms and that the one we've seen was the only one available.

We have stayed here twice and will continue to use and recommend The Mayflower. As in most hotels that are not part of chain in London, the rooms are small, but you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t beat the price (which includes a continental breakfast) and amnesties. We stayed in the hotel for four nights on a business trip in September 2007 and on a holiday in July 2006 and would recommend it to anyone who is seeking a deal but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to sacrifice too much. By American standards, the room and beds were small, but considering the current rate exchange with the pound and the US dollar, it was a bargain! In September, we stayed in one of the front rooms facing Trebovir Road, which had two twin beds and was fairly roomy for the hotel. The room came with an ensuite bathroom (not necessarily available in many of the smaller hotels) and the following amnesties: free wifi, hair toiletries, and kettle. The room we had in July had a single, queen size bed (ensuite bathroom) and was facing the back yard area and the rail lines, although neither the trains or the street were really noisy. You can also hear doors opening and closing in the halls, but hopefully all the hotels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 guests are considerate. (Although not used by me) the hotel can also provide guests with theater tix, secure parking facilities and a temporary membership to a local gym. If you are staying in London for a while, the hotel also offers temporary apartments. The few downsides are that the desk area is quite small and the room lighting needs to be brighter if one is going to work on a computer or have to read. The one major downside is that the rooms do not have air conditioning (again fairly typical in small London hotels) and can get quite steamy. The fan (in both my rooms) and the ability to open the windows helped (although for fair disclosure, when we stayed there in July, it was the hottest day ever in recorded history for London!). Not sure how draft-proof the rooms are either when the weather gets cold. The hallways and the elevator (lift) are tiny, making it difficult to navigate large luggage pieces, but an elevator in these small hotels is quite a luxury! There is lounge room with a small juice bar, a large and airy breakfast room (in the basement), and outdoor seating in the small backyard. If you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t carrying a wifi enabled PDA or laptop (consider yourself lucky!), you can access the internet for free on a computer in the lounge for short periods of time. Breakfast is served early, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plentiful with many fruits, yogurt and cereal, breads, and juice (you can view the breakfast menu on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website). Eat as much as you like! For a fee, you can get a traditional (cooked) breakfast. Local pub grub and Indian food abound (with the fancier restaurants further afield via cab or tube). At the Trebovir and Earls Court intersection is a Gourmet Burger Kitchen with the original Kiwi flair in food and attitude evident by the burger combos such as beetroot, egg and pineapple, and the Go All Blacks! stickers. There are a couple of small grocers on Earls Court Road to stock your room with snacks, you can visit Marks & Spencer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Food Hall (113 Kensington High Street), or for a really unique, eating experience go to the Babylon at The Roof Gardens for lunch or dinner (99-121 Kensington High Street, tube for both: Kensington High Street). If you arrive at the crack of dawn from an overnight flight (as many do from NYC), you can check in early if the room is available and/or drop off your luggage if you have other plans. Conversely, they will also hold your luggage if check out but have a late flight. You can easily take the tube or local bus (even walk on Cromwell Road or various sides streets if you just want a stroll) to the posh shopping areas of Knightsbridge (Harrod\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) and Chelsea, or visit the many museums in South Kensington. The hotel is literally around the corner from Earls Court tube station, it is highly accessible to London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Underground (locally called the tube) system. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re coming from Heathrow, you can take the slow Picadilly line train from Heathrow tube station (terminal 4) to Earl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Court and save yourself a few pounds by purchasing an off-peak 3 day Travelcard for zones 1-6 for \u00c2\u00a320.00 (which you can also use on London buses by flashing it at the bus driver). The tube is unwieldy and its map in no way reflects the streets of London, so if you are going to be sight seeing or traveling to places outside the normal tourist zones, do yourself a favor and buy an A-Z booklet of street maps (almost every newsstand has one).

There was a slight rumble from the tube in the basement, but it was much nicer than traffic and didnt seem to happen much. The rest of the hotel was clean and tidy, free wifi as well as a computer on site to use in the coffee bar, which also had the most comfortable sofa ever in it. The Complementry breakfast was the usual affair, cossiants and jams, cearals, tea and coffee all in a rather nice dining area. It looked as though there was an outside courtyard which im sure would be lovely during the summer but in november it was less appealing, mostly due to the cold and the rain.

It's literally only three minutes walk from Earls Court Tube station and sits in the beautiful Trebovir Road which is leafy and and very exclusive. Check in/out experiences, friendliness of staff etc aren't really relevant in this type of review in my opinion. Not unless they're rude for any reason which they weren't at all. We booked a 'superior double room' however, the size of the room was very, very small. If this is a superior double then I wouldn't like to be in the non superior. The extremely small bathroom was pretty nice to be fair. Our room had two double beds but they weren't really adequate enough to sleep two adults and were uncomfortable. On the second night we slept in a bed each so we could stretch out a bit. This room is designed to sleep four adults. I'll tell you now I wouldn't like to be in a party of four in that room. Unfortunately our room backed onto Earls Court Tube station which caused constant noise. The tubes run from around 6am to midnight. However, when the tube stops the all night maintenance work starts. This is very noisy and the double glazed slide-able window did a poor job of keeping the noise out. This hotel may have ticked enough boxes to make it a four star, but it certainly didn't meet our expectations of what we would expect from a four star hotel. No amenities, doesn't serve hot food, no room service, health facilities, generally very small. It serves continental breakfast (which isn't included in the \u00c2\u00a3100 per night room fee, \u00c2\u00a315 extra roughly) because it is obliged to for its star status. There isn't a cooked option and no evening meal dining option (four star hotel?) The continental breakfast is nice, however the orange juice was clearly watered down quite a bit on our second morning at breakfast. That's very poor. We've stayed in five star accommodation in Edinburgh (The Scotsman) for the same price as the mayflower (\u00c2\u00a3100 per night) and that place was a like a palace compared to the Mayflower (Yes, I know its London). The next time my girlfriend and I go to London we're considering just doing a budget hotel and going out for a paid breakfast. The tube service is so good and quick it matters not where you actually stay in Zone 1 or Zone 2. After reading some of the other reviews it seems to me that your experience of staying in the Mayflower will be decided entirely on the room that you stay in and its location within the hotel. That isn't really what you should expect for \u00c2\u00a3100 per night now is it? A two star hotel hiding in a beautiful building, in a beautiful street with a 'lottery' room allocation system.

For 105 pounds you do get a luxury room (mine had a balcony) on the front of the hotel, first floor. When we checked in, I suppose they only had one of these rooms available so my friends were given the Pasha Suite, just next door, street level, a very spacious suite with kitchen and king sized bed (for the same price as the luxury room). They were very accommodating to us. The rooms were nicely decorated, although I think they could have put a little more money into plusher mattresses and pillows, but we still slept well. The lift was rather amusing due to its tiny size, but at least it worked. The location was excellent. Every day we walked to Earl's Court Road and did our shopping, dining, anything you need is just a short walk away, including the tube station around the corner. We didn't take avantage of the continental breakfast included with the room because we enjoyed sleeping in a bit and it wasn't served after 9:30.

We booked into the Mayflower Apartments at which point they informed us that our accommodation was down the road at their other apartment. We walked about 50 mtrs dragging our luggage down to the apartment. Then up a very narrow staircase with worn carpet some parts had had tape put on them places just holes. Finally at the top (4th floor) we entered the apartment 1st bedroom had a queensized bed in it, then into the lounge were we saw the next bed it was pushed into an alcove with a 45deg attic roof surrounded by three walls. This meant that the person on the far side of the bed had to either get the other person to get out of the bed so they could get out, or roll over the top of the other. This was totally unsuitable for us as two members of the group had medical conditions that would prohibit them from climbing steep staircases or trying to roll over another person in the bed. We went back to the office with luggage in tow, and requested another apartment to which they replied there is none the towns fully booked as there is tennis on. At this point we asked for a refund which was also refused. They then instructed a representative of their business (cleaner they said) to go back to the apartment, two of our group went with her. At this point they discovered that the apartment was inhabited by long term residents which again was not satisfactory. The remaining two in the office retrieved the voucher and asked if they could try and find us some accommodation, again the answer was no. We then asked if they could ring us a taxi again no was the answer. I wonder if we would have had a better reception if we had told her we were in fact Moteliers from New Zealand. This is an appalling way for people in the accommodation business to be treating overseas guests, what a poor opinion we will have of the people of London.

Its only saving grace was the bathroom - really lovely and clean with contemporary fittings. Anyway, I complained and we were offered another room on the top floor - it was brighter and slightly cleaner but still tiny and had a shoddy feel (also dirty windows with a large crack in one of the panes). This hotel has apparently undergone major improvements but the room sizes are definitely compromised, the paintwork and general finish is poor, the towels provided were clean but threadbare and if you are on the back of the hotel the tube will probably disturb you as the overground station is within spitting distance. To its credit, the staff were friendly, the breakfast room and breakfast was as expected for the price (cold buffet style) and the en-suites were clean and contemporary. Trebovir Road is also a pleasant quite street really well placed for the tube and nearby shops and restaurants (Wagamama, Masala Zone etc).

The kitchen/lounge was copact but ok, with a decent oven and washing machine and LCD TV which only had the five channels. The apartment was described as two bedroomed which was stretching it a bit as you accessed one 'bedroom' through the other. Both of the bedrooms were tiny, one had a double bed (actually two singles pushed together) and you were undable to walk around 3 of the 4 sides, this room also had ineffective underfloor heating (it worked but was just not man enough to heat the room) and a couple of damp patches on the walls. The other bedroom had a wardrobe and two single beds with less than 14 inches between them. The bedroom arrangemnt was fine for us, but if the apertment had been rented by two couples then they'd need to be friendly as the door to the double room was glass and led off the first bedroom (see pics). The overall impression was that the apartments had been 'tarted up' but were not well maintained, for example all of the radiator covers were damaged.

Since most hotels in London's older buildings have a variety of room sizes I knew better than to book the standard room. The room was perfectly adequate in size and bigger than those of other hotels on the same street that I had stayed in on previous trips. I was also impressed with the cleanliness.

I understand the hotel had recently been refurbished and certainly this seemed to be the case judging from our room which was nicely furnished. It also had digital tv, cd player and radio alarm. The only thing we didn't like about the room was that it was not lit adequately - the dark furnishings and spot lights didn't help here, plus a lot of natural light was cut out by the heavy curtains and wooden blinds. Continental breakfast is included in the price, and very nice it was too. You can pay extra for full English if you wish but what's the point?

Would recommend rooms 6 and 7 although the bathroom facilities are tight in room 6. The hotel is not perfect by any means, but provides good value for money and recent renovations make many earlier 'poor' reviews redundant. The hotel does not currently provide anything other than B&B so there is a need to identify local restaurants that suit your palate. The location of Earls Court Station is within a few minutes walk and is very convenient with a lift to all platforms on both District & Picadilly Lines.

I had pre-booked a parking space at the hotel which was jsut round the corner frm the hotel. The only problem was that when we got there the parking was full. The managers son had taken it upon himself to park in one of the spaces so we had to wait for him to come and move his car. We were staying in one of the apartments accross the road. On first inspection everything seemed fine. Within minutes of arriving there was a knock on the door. It was a local resident who was complaining about our stay there and telling us that the hotel was letting the apartments out illegally and that we would not be covered in the case of a fire. We went accross and spoke to reception at the hotel who denied all of this and said they had never heard of this before. Anyway it was not the sort of situation you expect to face when paying good money. After a few minutes in the apartment it became clear that the place was very shoddy. Furniture was dirty and stained. Some light bulbs were broken and the wiring in gerneral looked pretty poor. On eof the lights even sent a spark of electricity close to my friend. The TV reception was also very poor. Other than that the apartment was not too bad but did not in my opinion represent good value for money. The good point is that Earl's Court station was just a minutes walk away from the apartment. The poor customer service continued on our departure. We went to the reception to hand the keys in and collect the car. The girl on reception said there was already someone at the car park so we could jsut walk down and meet them there. We walked to the car park only to find it locked and no one in sight. So I called the hotel to get them to send someone back to the car park. We waited for ten minutes and still no one so I called again and again they said they would send someone. After a further 5-10 minutes they still had not sent someone so we had to walk al the way back to the hotel to get the keys ourselves. Their porter made Manuel on Fawlty Towers seem like a realistic character.

We are 4 seasoned lady travellers who take our leisure time very seriously - we pride ourselves on researching our destinations and our places to stay and between us we have been extremely fortunate to have experienced most types of accommodation, from huts on the beach through to 7 star establishments. We are well aware of trick photography and artistic licence with the written word and therefore expect smaller rooms and less sumptuous soft furnishings than advertised - but The Mayflower Hotel really did mis-sell itself this last weekend. We were advised to take an Apartment - this being considered most suited to our needs - so we did. We read Johanssens and other reviews (unfortunately not Trip Advisor)and were looking forward to a new hotel and a new area of London. The Apartment was not connected to the hotel either structurally or by telephone line, it was located in a separate building, 5 minutes walk away - a building that was old, tatty and housing private apartments. The staircases were filthy dirty, stank of urine and littered with childrens toys. The Apartment in no way whatsoever resembled the advertising for The Mayflower Hotel - it was old fashioned, very dirty and a complete shock after having entered the reception of the hotel. Maybe the hotel is not misselling, but actually employing a very clever marketing campaign - our cries of horror were immediately placated by offering us 2 family rooms in the main hotel. Our initial reaction was \"wonderful, exactly what we ordered\" but unfortunately after a few hours we became aware that the rooms were noisy, grubby (poorly laundered linen) very badly ventilated (1 window that would not stay open) and very, very small to house a family of 4. The lighting was inadequate for anyone wishing to apply make up and the toilet in one of our rooms so small that a large bottom would easily get stuck! Had we entered these rooms first, again we would have complained, but compared to the Apartment, they were wonderful. So, are the hotel aware of this - do they offer you a poor room first, so the replacement always looks better? We heard 3 other sets of guests complain also about their rooms and again, they were immediately placated with replacements - how does a small hotel find so many alternatives? The main hotel and the staff were nice and the breakfast a pleasant surprise (fresh fruit, cheese, salads, etc - although they did run out of bread!)but they should not continue to offer such utterly shoddy accommodation to paying guests who are clearly expecting something very, very different", "Date": "October 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buxton, Derbyshire", "Title": "\u201cEveryone beware!\u201d", "Author": "kathkenyon", "ReviewID": "UR4028395", "Content": "We returned from our short sojourn at the Mayflower in a state of shock!

The flats in question were not next door to the Mayflower Hotel, as some would appear to be, but a good five minute walk away past Earls Court Tube station. The entrance, and four flights of unlit stairs, stunk of stale urine. There were filthy food stained carpets full of cigarette burns in the actual flat. The beds had covers that were fit only for decorators dustsheets. The beds were not full length and resembled \"camp beds\". There was no phone, no towels - we didn't hang around longer than a few minutes as the stench was overwhelming. Subsequent to our threatening them with the Public Health Officer we were placed in two \"family rooms\" (why are there always spare rooms when purportedly, intially, they are full?).
