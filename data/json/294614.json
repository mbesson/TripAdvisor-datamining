CONs: - for tourists I would recommend accomodation closer to Sultanahmet area - in general you could comfortably commute with public transport from Hilton, but it will take you about 1 hr each way with combination of walking, funicular and tram, so... - no slippers and bath suite in the room - first decided that this was a mistake, but my colleague had the same issue, so we had to ask for this separately; - none was able to help with WiFi connection issues, the lady who was sent to help just passed me the phone asking to talk to service provider, which I was surprised with.

On the plus side, the upgrade to the Executive floor provided me with a slightly larger room and it is a fairly decent view to the bridge. However, - If you want to sleep before 12.30am, then perhaps look elsewhere as the hotel has a very noisy night club right beneath. The staff know of the issue. This is on the river facing side, so how does Hilton quite charge extra for 'water front facing rooms' when residents have to put up with trashy disco music all night is a wonder - The rooms are very warm. And I mean, bad warm. The temperature controls are locked to be reduced to a maximum of 3 degrees +/- their standard. This means it should theoretically go to 20 degrees at the lowest. But the room was no where close to that and both my wife and I felt very uncomfortable. Opening the window is a good idea only till you realise you can hear the thumping of the nearby club even more loudly. - After two nights I was offered to be moved into a garden room. Not nearly as bad as a water facing room, but still very bad - On the Exec lounge I once asked if the staff could brew a fresh pot of the Turkish tea as it tasted sour - basically over brewed for hours on end. I was met with a 'Oh you cant have strong tea, I get you lipton'. Overall, poor and not worth it if you are into see the town and need a good night's sleep after spending a whole day out.

Only one with a balcony at each room. Unbeatable view of Bosphorus, vast garden, the best hotel pool in the city. Non of the newer hotels can even get close to having something like it as the land is getting ever more expensive. If weather is nice, teras bar and pool are best in Istanbul. Please just pay yhe extra and get a room with Bosporus view if available. You can not beat having a drink at your balcony while watching one of the most beautiful straits in the world connecting Black see with the rest of the world, as well as the the Bosporus bridge connecting Europe with Asia. Executive lounge is the best i have seen in many Hilton properties i stayed worldwide; they simply make it happen for you if by chance you wish to fancy something other than plenty of high quality gourmet choices that is readily available throughout the day. Room service is quick and delicious. They have the fastest service i have seen in a hotel in that size. Breakfast choices are very rich both in the lounge and the main restaurant. They have the best restaurants of the city in house. If you fancy a chinese, city's best \" Dragon\" is at Hilton. From the front gate to housekeeping, entire staff is just amazing. Front desk personnel and executive floor reception are working at an amazing speed. They are quick, they process the routine rapidly and focus on the details that will surprise you. Throughout 55 plus years of history, celebrities, politicians, world power icons stayed Hilton Istanbul. Yes, there are newer facilities today, yes some sections may look outdated but Hilton Istanbul is a long standing legend that will be defining classic luxury for many years to come.

When someone in our group of travelers found a cockroach in their room, they even gave us another room at no extra charge! By no means is this hotel cockroach ridden though.

Also, it is close to subway that connects to other attractions such as Grand Bazaar, and Blue Mosque/Hagia Sofia, etc. If you like to eat, their breakfast is great. They have a lot of variety and quality is quite good. The Bad: Front desk service is not that great. On our first day, we came in early (our fault) so our room wasn't ready which is reasonable.

It was a disappointing waste of money. The building is impressive and facilities generally good. I found the two reception staff who checked me in and out extremely professional and helpful and the bedroom clean and spacious. These were the positives, but there were far too many negatives. Service I was surprised by the generally poor standard of English (with the exception of the two reception staff). This inevitably detracts from the quality of service and is surprising for a hotel aspiring to major international status when English is now so widely spoken. All rooms have a balcony but not, it seems, chairs and tables (in the absence of which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure how management expect guests to use them). These were provided on request. They should be supplied as standard. I sat for five minutes in a near empty bar without any approach from a member of staff. Eventually I had to interrupt a conversation between two of them to get served. Not impressive. On arrival my room key/card did not work. I had to return to the reception to get it changed. The same happened the next day. Again it was changed, when I said that there clearly was something wrong with the lock (a remark that was either ignored or not understood). It happened again the next day, putting me again to the inconvenience of having it changed. Security When my room key/card failed for the third time a member of staff was sent with me (I thought, since no explanation was given for this, to check that it worked). In fact, he had been sent to ask for my passport \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsecurity check\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that would have been entirely unnecessary if the faulty locked had been changed. I would have been more impressed by the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to security if the same check had been made the previous day. Slack security was also evident at the baggage store. I left my case there on leaving, but after about five minutes returned to collect something I needed from it. The door to this store opens straight onto the main entrance road (not the lobby) and finding it open and unmanned I went in, found my case opened it and was taking out what I needed when two members of staff returned. Neither challenged me. Internet charges These are extortionate and wholly unacceptable for a hotel of this alleged class. It is also deeply disappointing that while management make a point of responding to adverse comments on Tripadvisor, they seem to have made little effort to rectify the problems identified.

Short and sunny, yes; romantic- we didnt sleep very much but it wasnt because of romance! The hotel is surrounded by music venues and nightclubs, running until 0400hrs most nights we were there! Some reviews recomend various rooms but to be honest, we moved rooms three times and there wasnt any better than any other, so sleep wasnt a great option. Be warned. However, the hotel itself is lovely- the rooms and decor are respectful of its history as the first Hilton in Europe, the facilities are great, and the staff very friendly and helpful with advice of where to visit etc. The executive lounge provides food and drink throughout the day- quality is good, variation less so, but all in all a nice interval before going out. The hotel has a couple of restaurants- we tried the famous Lebanese one and the Dragon Chinese; both very good but in terms of value, the Lebanese wins. Eating near to the hotel is varied and considerably cheaper, but it depends on how far you want to go. Outdoors pool is large but sectioned off for \"cabana\" guests so dont be fooled into thinking that you can do some serious lengths! Also at the weekend there are some locals that feel that it is their right to move your stuff if you leave the sun lounger for more than a few minutes, and the pool staff wont stand up for you. Ignorance is worldwide so its not specific to here but it was a real problem. Keep your Kung Fu skills up to date as some of the locals were absolutely obnoxious.

The architecture was 60s vintage but the hotel and grounds were beautifully kept and I apperciated the large pictures of the celebrities from bygone eras that graced the walls behind the lobby desk. But what truly impressed me was the concierge level where we were lucky to stay. Our room on the 9th floor was incredibly spacious, the bathroom lovely and the view of the Bosphorus (toward the Asian side) from our large and comfortable balcony was breathtaking. Each afternoon we watched the freeway-like waterway as big ships, small boats and ever-present ferries manuevered around one another. Evening came and the sunset was brilliant; night fell and the lights of the city were stunning. I would have happily stayed in that room for the five days of our visit but there was a lot more to the hotel than that. The executive club down the hall was fantastic. Lots of chairs, sofas and tables for those who wanted to work or those who just wanted to relax. The bar - wine and mixed drinks - was always fully stocked. There were snacks left out overnight but during the breakfast and dinner hours you had your choice of any number of wonderful dishes. Had we not been curious about the surrounding restaurants, we could easily have dined in the executive club all day. There was a perfect balance between hot and cold, sweet and savory. Dishes were replenished so they were always fresh. Jars of candy and nuts were always available as were bold water bottles, sodas, juices, etc. As for the location (the Taksim district) we easaily got around with taxis or by walking. Friends who stayed in the Old Town were frustrated because of the gridlock on their side. We walked to the old town (easier going down than coming back but find out about the funicular). A lovely walk through real neighborhoods, across the fabulous bridge and into the bazaars. This was a definite plus by staying at the HIlton. On the downside - as there always must be - we did have a slight disappointment with this hotel. While those manning the conscierge desk were handsome, articulate, multi-lingual and charming, we were never once steered right. The military museum around the corner from the hotel was something we wanted to see. However, the concierge was wrong about both the hours of operation and the cost of admission. A restaurant (quite far from our hotel) was touted as the best we could get for seafood. The ride there was so jolting I got carsick, the restaurant itself was horrendously overpriced and I felt as if the recommendation was one made from a mutual business agreement rather than a true sense of a fine dining experience. Honestly, I should have known better when I was handed a very slick brochure. I've traveled enough to know that there are business relationships that work in the hospitality industry. This is more shame on me than on the hotel. Bottom line, my husband and I would go back to the Hildton Istanbul. In fact, we are already planning to stop on our way to Albania.

Built in 1955 and being the first 5-star hotel in Istanbul, it has welcomed a myriad of history figures, stars, royalty, sports legends, polticians etc. The hotel is a fine example of the early post-war European achrictecture. It has a somewhat Le Corbusiersque look about it, with large straight, yet perfect proportions, interrupted by occastiona frivolities like, a dome shaped restaurant roof or a flying rug shaped entrance canopy. That being said, my feeling is that today this hotel is a bit out of touch with its glorious history, and trying to be just another 5-star hotel of them all. Don't get me wrong - there is absolutely nothing wrong with the hotel experience itself - the staff are excellent, rooms are spotless clean, quiet, with wonderfully comfortable beds, very good air conditioning (although a little bid loud), excellent location with great views of the Bosphorus and the quarters of Istanbul sorrounding it. It is just that you can get all of that at a much lower price next door, and the way the rooms are decorated you get the feel you are staying at yet another 4-star, that could be located just anywhere else in the world. The rooms have this impersonal, non-specific feel about them, that cliched look, that perhaps may be expected from a 4-star establishment, but not from a flagship of the Hilton \"fleet\" especially at the price they are charging for it. I don't know who is the culprit, perhaps the tacky, non-descript wall art used (the \"four vases\" composition, that you can pull out of every mass prints collection), or the tacky room lights, which exhibit a pret-a-porter room design, or the attempt to partially renovate and fix new on top of old (albeit painstakingly done). The final result is clear, the look and feel of the accommodation is nowhere near the character and excellence that you would expect nowadays from a 5-star establishment, of the caliber that Hilton Istanbul is trying to be. I think the way forward for this hotel is first to find its identity and stop trying to be just another 5-star hotel, which ends it up into being just another 4-star looking hotel. Maybe going back to its roots and borrowing on the esthetics of the 50s and 60s, or totally reinventing itself, I don't know, but for sure my next time staying there will be once I have seen the pictures of re-decorated rooms on their web site. The flagship deserves it, as it was not built to be yet another 5-star hotel, but The 5-star hotel of Istanbul. To many of you the above may sound pretentious. And indeed it probably is, because at the time we stayed the hotel was full to the brim, and probably for almost all of them, there was nothing to fault this hotel for. But some of you, who always look for that \"wow-factor\" in your accommodation, I believe, will share my humble opinion. So in summary, don't be put off by my comments.

I booked online and specifically booked a Twin Room with a Bosphurus view (as opposed to a Twin room with a Garden view which was the room class below the River view). I'm a diamond member, so was offered an \"upgrade\" to an executive floor room. To my surprise, this was a \"Garden View\" room, which in fact was nothing more than a room with a view of the grounds at the front of the hotel. This was surprising as I'd paid a 60 euro premium for the Bosphurus view room, only to be stuck in a non-river facing room. I obviously went to the executive floor room to challenge this. The answer I was given was that all Bosphurus View rooms were booked, and the best they could do is move me to this room after 2 nights in the \"Garden view room\". This was unacceptable as I did not want to put up with the inconvenience of repacking and unpacking for a single night. The rather ordinary excuse I received was that the executive floor garden view room is a better class room than the normal Bosphurus view room. Maybe in theory but I can't imagine the normal room itself to be of lower quality than the executive floor room - the only \"upgrade\" I got was access to the executive floor, and I guarantee if I were to poll a large sample size on which view they'd prefer they'd go with the Bosphurus over some grass, buildings and parked cars. As \"reparation\" I was offered a 20 euro per night rebate on extras incurred during my stay (a rebate on extras only as I had prepaid). All well and good except a) I wasn't planning on any extras so had to do laundry and make phone calls that I otherwise would not have made just to recoup that rebate and b) the difference between a garden view and Bosphurus view room was 60 euros per night when I made the booking, not 20 euros. Somewhat unsurprisingly this 20 euros per night was not rebated when I checked-out, so I had to spend another 20 minutes explaining my situation again. So my word of warning - don't bother paying more for a river view room if you are an elite member eligible for an upgrade as you could be upgraded to a room you don't want. This to me is a creative way to shuffle so-called elite members to ordinary rooms and essentially offer more river view rooms to the public. Now to the hotel itself . The hotel rooms itself are definitely aged somewhat - I'd say maybe another 2 years or so before renovations would have to be considered. That (and the above shenanigans re room) aside, it is a decent hotel. Good quiet location near Taksim square, friendly staff including a helpful concierge and the usual quality amenities of a Hilton hotel. So yes, whilst some quasi-attempt was made to correct the situation, it's still a huge shame as the view from the executive lounge (and hence I presume the rooms as well) was nothing short of spectacular.

The service was wonderful. In fact all the staff were helpful and very friendly.

He even got me antibiotics within a few minutes when I diagnosed myself with a sinus infection. So nice to not have to jump through hoops to get anibiotics like in the states:))) The room was GORGEOUS! The view was fine. There were two views the city and Bospherous. We took the city view but I'm sure the Bospherous would have been lovely. The bed was like a dream and both my husband and I slept like babies. Room was just perfect. The location is not that ideal. It is a bit far from all tourist sites. When we went to Topkapi Place and other attractions, we noticed all the beautiful local shops in the area and thought that it might be nice to explore a hotel in that area next time. At the Hilton, you have got to try the Turkish bath. I went for the scrub down and massage (don't remember the fancy name for it:) Once I got over the embarrassment of being washed by someone else lol I REALLY enjoyed it. The only thing was the door to the bath did not lock but the lady assured me that no men were allowed. There are specific times for men and women to use the bath. Anyway, the lady was wonderful....an expert. and at one point she said you are the baby and I am the Mama! YES!!! Exactly what I was looking for:) You must try it... I don't remember how much we paid for the room but it was NOT inexpensive and how many Hiltons are anyway?? The gym was fine with enough machines and other equipment such as weights and an ab rower. There was a bottled water machine too. The steam and sauna room were nice. There was a faint mildewy smell in the steam room but we overlooked it and still enjoyed it . No one was ever in the steam and sauna room and one time I took my 9 yr old daughter who always wants to go with me in Chicago and isn't allowed. We had great fun!!! We did dessert in our room once which was delicious. The TV was of great quality but the shows leave a lot to be desired. We didn't see much in the way of English speaking shows. Some movies or options for ordering movies would have been nice. Also, there were some wierd shows on at night semi porographic....anyone with children should BEWARE. Where are the blocks?

The hotel location is very marginally out of the way (around 10 minutes walk to Taksim and the Metro/Tram system) but this is a minor inconvenience. A taxi ride to and from the airport will run around 50 lira and takes 30-60 minutes depending on traffic. The hotel property itself is very historic and one can spend a very enjoyable hour (as I did) just browsing through the wonderful photo displays in the lobby of the various celebrities, dignitaries and events that the hotel has hosted through the years. The hotel lobby was a complete zoo during the day with hundreds of tourists always checking in and out, but the Executive floors (where I had booked) had a separate check-in at the 9th floor Executive Lounge. The lounge itself had a view over the Bosphorus that would be hard to equal anywhere in the world. Truly magnificent. The lounge staff as well were fabulous, with the patience of saints as they dealt with all the special requests over New Years. The only complaint I have about the lounge was the uncouth behavior of some of the fellow guests and their inability to control their children, but sadly that is to be expected at any hotel lounge in the holiday season. Breakfast was another zoo, with the Exec Lounge, the Bosphorus Terrace restaurant and the ballroom set up for overflow breakfast all packed to the rafters. I had to wait almost 30 minutes just to be seated at the Bosphorus Terrace, but the quality of the food and service were excellent and worth the wait. The hotel rooms were typically Hilton - well appointed and comfortable with all the modern conveniences one expects. The balconies were a nice touch but unfortunately the weather was a bit too cold to use it. One thing that constantly stood out from this visit though was the exceptional staff and their positive attitudes. They went out of their way to make their guests feel welcome, despite challenging circumstances, which is very hard to do at peak demand periods. The hotel management has done extremely well in selecting and training their staff.

In fact, this is one of the better Hiltons I have stayed at. The lobby area was a bit chaotic (stayed here during the New years weekend, they were fully booked), but the separate check-in at the 9th floor (at the entrance to the executive lounge) was fantastic. The room: Had a lovely Bosphorous view room at the executive floor (8th floor). The room was large, with a great balcony. (However, it was too cold outside to take fully advantage of it. ) The executive lounge was very nice: Large, with a lot of tables. Four or five computers in one of the corners. Great selection of food and beverage, especially in the morning. The restaurant: We had dinner at the new lebanese restaurant one night. The main courses were just average, but the meses were great. Ok prices. The location: A bit isolated. A 10-15 min walk to Taksim, however we didnt find the square itself very attractive. Be prepared to take a taxi to see sights and other parts of the city. Some minor negatives: The beds were very firm/hard. Good for your back, I guess. But I must admit i had a hard time falling asleep the first night. The lounge was full all day, people really knew how to take advantage of the free food/snack and drinks. Getting a table with a view was difficult, people seemed to hold on to the good tables for hours and hours. Service at breakfast was slow and not very attentive. We had to seat ourselves both days, and it took ages getting coffee. The first night, there must have been a malfunction with the hot water. No matter how long it was turned on, I couldn't get the water really hot. However, this problem did not occur the second day.

Of the three Hilton properties in Istanbul, this is certainly the most conveniently located. It's just a short walk to Taksim where you can get public transportation. And there's always a bevy of taxis on que at the hotel. We reached the hotel in under an hour by taxi from Ataturk (very heavy traffic) and it was only 40 minutes out to Sabiha Gokcen. We had a number of situations during our stay to interact with staff. This is a longstanding hotel (actually, I think it was the first five-star in town) and you can tell that the staff stick around. Service was high level and very personalized. While it is an older hotel, it has been updated and upgraded. It is super clean - virtually spotless - and has also done a decent job in staying modern, which is hard for an older hotel sometimes. If you're in Istanbul on business, this should be highly considered. If you're there as a tourist, it offers you consistency of a well-known worldwide hotel brand that you can't get in Old Town.

I'm posting this to echo the other very positive reviews of the property. I don't usually start my reviews by mentioning a hotel's lounge, but the Hilton Istanbul is a worthwhile exception to the rule. The lounge is great! Great views of the Bosphorous, nice breakfast spread and hours (6:30 a.m. to I believe 11 a.m.), plus a comfortable place to meet, have drinks and evening snacks other times of the day. It's also a very large room with lots of tables, so was never too crowded at the various times we showed up for breakfast and a couple of evening drinks. Four comfortable computer terminals that usually are available and that work pretty well, though the slightly different Turkish keyboards take a bit of getting used to and a couple of times I had trouble using websites via the terminals. Ayse, who runs the lounge much of the day and is the Executive Floors and HH Manager is a real gem, in terms of being friendly, helpful and efficient. And the rest of the staff there is also excellent. For someone like me who has trouble even talking before drinking coffee in the morning, a minor but nice aspect of the service there is that you can help yourself to coffee from a decent coffee/latte/etc. machine without having to flag down the service staff to get your caffeine fix--though, again, they are more than willing to be of any help they can. Speaking of the staff: throughout the hotel, it was uniformly fine. For example, nice pre-arrival message from the concierge perhaps a couple of weeks before our trip, offering airport transportation options. All we opted for was the free meet and greet service by a hotel rep as we emerged from customs/immigration at the airport. He pointed me to the ATM and showed us to a taxi, instructing it re our destination. Given that my wife and I travel a lot and that Istanbul is a relatively organized airport, the help wasn't necessary at all, but was still a nice touch given our jet lag. And I guess it probably helped lessen the already small chance of getting overcharged by the taxi driver on the ride to the hotel, which in Istanbul rush hour traffic took maybe 75 minutes. Another example of fine staff: My wife needed to transfer an uploaded document from the lounge computer terminal to a flash drive, but had problems doing so. Two staff members helped her out a lot and managed to overcome the difficulty, even apologizing for the problem even though it wasn't their fault. This was going beyond the call of duty. Back to taxis: the couple of taxis that we took from the hotel were fine; they apparently need to register with the hotel to service it, which is good. Of the two we took on the street, we found we had to negotiate prices with both rather than their using the meter. One was easy to deal with, the other something of a hassle. Don't expect them to speak English. As an HH Diamond I was given an upper floor Bosphorous view room. Certainly a nice enough, roomy enough room with that great view and a pleasant balcony. Not state of the art, but more than sufficient. Either here at TA or at Flyertalk, I'd read a few otherwise favorable reviews noting noise from slamming doors. We didn't notice that at all--perhaps because after those reviews were written the hotel installed devices that slow the speed at which room doors close and thus cushion the closing. From the room, you can see two other two Hilton properties, the Conrad and the Hilton Park SA. The TA and HH member in me was vaguely interested at stopping by them to compare, but the good husband and relaxed vacationer in me decided not to pursue that. The only thing I will say is that they seem not quite as well located as the Hilton, at least in terms of walking to other parts of town. The hotel is located on some pretty nice, expansive grounds off of the main street you walk along to get there. It's an easy, ten-minute walk from Taksim Square, from which you can get public transportation. We love to walk, though, both for exercise and to see a city on foot, so basically didn't use Istanbul's p.t. system. I'd say from the hotel to Sultanahmet, the older part of town where a lot of the prominent mosques, markets, museums and other sites are located, is about an hour or more. Most of that walk is on a gentle down slope heading away from the hotel and up slope heading back, but it's a steep 10 minute walk up and down as you approach the Galata Bridge (about 45 minutes from the hotel) that connects to the older area. The neighborhood near the hotel is generally nice, with some parts of it quite upscale. Lots of shops and restaurants. Less interesting than Sultanahmet, but a pleasant change of pace, including a nice park near the hotel with a few pleasant places to get a bite to eat. The Military Museum, with a show by the military band every afternoon that it's open, is a tourist attraction right nearby. One suggestion I'd have for the hotel is to post a polite notice in the bathroom, saying that the tap water is not suitable for drinking (which is what the hotel told me after I asked) and that free bottled water is always available from housekeeping. My wife did drink it a couple of times by mistake and suffered no ill effects. But this is the kind of thing that can ruin a vacation or business trip. And in such a nice hotel, some guests might assume that the tap water is fine. As for Istanbul itself, I'll just offer selected observations for those who haven't previously been there. Great views and a ride on the Bosphorous aside, we didn't find it a romantic city, but it's a fun and fascinating one. Some great food and cafes. It really is a stimulating East meets West place, in terms of lots of modern and Western features on the one hand and traditional culture and sites on the other. We generally liked the Turks a lot, mainly in terms of their friendliness, but also in terms of helpfulness and efficiency. Some minor inconvenience with folks near the big tourist spots in the older parts of town (but not the hotel or Taksim), in terms of guys approaching us on the street, asking us where we were from, engaging in conversation, etc., mainly just to eventually try to get us to go to their carpet stores, handicraft outlets, etc. It helps to simply take it in stride with good humor--if you wish, telling them you've already bought all the carpets or handicrafts you wanted--that seems to be a better \"no\" than simply saying you're not interested. Same with the greeters outside restaurants, who'll entreat you to come in to eat---tell them you've just eaten. On balance, then, we really liked the city a lot. But be prepared for a big, bustling town, very crowded in some spots. In the evening, for instance, the pedestrian mall/street that runs down from Taksim much of the way to the Galata Bridge is an incredible scene, with lots--and I do mean lots--of folks out shopping, strolling, dining. Some great advice I got here on FT from FrAAmer was to take time to relax in a cafe or a park, as a break from the bustle. I'd also suggest not going there during the summer, when the combination of the crowds and the heat could really be stifling. Folks here at FT who travel with small kids certainly could better address whether and how suitable Istanbul would be for such family trips, but my two cents is that the crowds and busy-ness of the place (such as in spice market) might not make it the best choice. Then again, take some more taxis and go to more museums than we did, and the dynamic might be different.", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cTop Notch Hotel\u201d", "Author": "1NicePerson", "ReviewID": "UR64276435", "Content": "This is a superbly run hotel with excellent housekeeping and competent service.

Only instant coffee in the room but otherwise well stocked minibar. Yes, the TVs are ancient but there is a (relatively) large selection of English and foreign channels.

However, I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given much chance to view the initial elegance, since as soon as the desk clerk realised I was booked into an Executive room, I was escorted up to the 9th floor exclusive check in at the Executive Lounge. Here, check in was relaxed and (almost) correct; at least my name was correct but all other details belonged to someone else \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not even on the same Continent! My Executive room on the 7th floor was nice and large (an advantage of 1950\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s architecture when space was plentiful!) and had the added bonus of a staggering view of the Bosphorus!! Probably one of my best hotel views ever! The room itself was clean and recently refurbished with desk, chair and a huge (and very comfortable) bed, but the 20+ year old television was a bit out of place; where was the modern flat screen TV that would be expected in the Executive room of any other hotel of this calibre? Wifi was good and strong; not free, but there was a variety of tariffs to choose from. The rooms all have large expansive balconies (another advantage of that 50 year old design!) that allow the opportunity to sit out and soak up the great view. One problem arising from the old design of the hotel, however, is the lack of sound insulation; antagonistic followed by amorous noises from a nearby room at 4.00 in the morning caused me to imbibe from the well-stocked minibar! (though why no tonic in the bar to accompany the three miniatures of gin??) The breakfast buffet was busy and bountiful, and nicely included in the room rate. The bar on the 9th floor was cosy, with the addition of that great night time view over the Bosphorus!

All means of transportation are available you can walk to the subway, bus station, but I preferred the taxi and walking above all.

Upon our arrival this was the scenario that happened, the taxi took us to Conrad and we stayed at Conrad for couple of hours at the executive lounge we enjoyed the view of the Bosphorus, after then a Taxi took us to Hilton (on their account). We had our check in at the Executive floor reception; we had our room at the 8th floor, it was ok but not too clean for a baby as carpet seems not washed recently. Bathroom was good.

Although some hyper-expensive properties have sprouted near its enviable location at the best spot in the city center, they all lack the expansive grounds and balconies in every room, which the Hilton Istanbul has. There is a small price difference for a room on the Bosporus side, which is well worth it. The view of the water, the Asian side of the city across it, and the Big bridge are stunning. Having a delectable meal from room service in front of that view is a wonderful experience. The rooms are not quite as large as those in newer, more expensive hotels, but nicely furnished, and equipped with all the accoutrement that one would expect from a 5-star hotel, like the well stocked minibar, coffee maker, iron with ironing board, internet hookup, generous bath amenities, freebies on arrival, etc. The daily breakfast, which was included in the price was magnificent. The Turks really know how to cook, and the ones at the hotel outdid themselves. I could go on and on, but needless to say that our 4-night stay left us wanting more. What impressed us the most was the friendly, pleasant and respectful service we received from everyone we encountered among the large staff of the hotel, from the multiple, spontaneous greetings that met us each time we entered the building, to the impeccable room service. When upon arrival I inquired about the \"mattress softener\" on the pillow menu (all free of charge), a staff of 2 was in my room within seconds.

As a former gold member of HiltonHonors I know about 15 of the often mediocre 4 to 5 star Hilton Hotels across Europe (where only the rate is 5 star always) but even compared to the better ones like London Park Lane or Cavalieri Rome - Hilton Istanbul still is the best of them. This doesn't mean that there is no gap to the top level with hotels like Four Seasons Istanbul or Ciragan Palace, but do you know any Hilton Hotel where you get a welcome drink at the reception desk at arrival? The arrival was excellent, a formal dressed doorman opened the door with a welcome greeting, bellboys took care of the luggage. The check-in was very friendly and efficient. The room was very clean with an arm chair and writing desk and stunning views. Avoid rooms to the back, there is definitely no view. The bathroom was standard, one sink, one tub and quite small. All rooms have balconies with two seats and a small table. The included dinner-buffet was nice, the staff very polite. The wine card was small and totally overpriced (50 - 60 Euro for a bottle of bad quality - you can buy such wine for a maximum of 5 Euro/bottle in every supermarket). We tried three wines, the third was at least mediocre so we ordered a bottle of this wine for 50 Euro (beverage was not included in the rate). The concierge service was efficient as the business center was, too. Pay attention to the pricing at the business center: a telefax to Germany did cost 20,-- Euro (4,-- Euro/page). Housekeeping was well done. Two complimentary bottles of water were placed in the room. An additional plus compared to the direct competitors Hyatt and Interconti are the spacious outdoor facilities with tennis court and big swimming pool. An inside pool and spa area is also available. All in all a nice stay.
