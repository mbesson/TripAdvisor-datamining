{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good quiet location We had a lovely comfortable and clean room overlooking the gardens but we did notice that some of the other rooms were quite small. It was lovely and warm in the hotel and the reception staff were very helpful and welcoming. The hotel's own directions from the airport were excellent, and the short walk into town (across the River Main) was pleasant. We spent 4 nights here and found plenty to do in Frankfurt and the surrounding area (using the S-Bahn to get around.)

When looking online for hotels near the airport or train station, it seemed like the neighborhoods were questionable or the prices were very high. We decided to get a little farther away from the transit areas, so we booked our overnight stay at the Maingau which turned out to be a great find! From the airport we took the S train and then had a short walk to the hotel. Our rooms were small, but clean and the area was quiet with many restaurants within walking distance. You must try the small restaurant on the corner for some great coffee. We took a train the next day and it was just a short taxi ride. It turned out to be an excellent value and a good location.", "Date": "Nov 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR575616098", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Coastlvr"}, {"Content": "Enjoyable stay, very nice neighborhood       Maingau double room", "Date": "Oct 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR819019401", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Massimo1"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel Stayed at the Maingau for 2 nights and had a wonderful stay.

I'm not sure I would want to stay here if I were spending a lot of time in the room, but it was entirely adequate for the one night stopover we had.

The hotel was about a 20 minute cab ride from the airport and a 10 minutes cab ride from the main train station but it was conveniently located close to main square of Frankfurt. The hotel is located in a quiet, residental area across the river from city square. The staff at the hotel was very professional and helpful. The room was a standard size and very comfortable. Breakfast was included in the price of the room and it consisted of great buffet of meats, cheeses, jams, spreads, breads, eggs, fruit, juices and coffee or tea. The best part of staying at this hotel are the restaurants within a couple of blocks. One of the specialities of Frankfurt is an apple wine and all of the restaurants near the Hotel Maingau serve this wine along with German specialties.

The location is in the historic Sachsenhausen area of Frankfurt. It was an easy walk from the Bahnhof to the hotel and then to the sights in the area.

The hotel is not for the out of shape. There are many stairs, and the elevator is almost ineffective. The breaksfast is great.Despite its shortcomings the Hotel Maingau is an excellent value.

For eight years now, we've been staying at the Maingau as we come into and go out of the city and have always been pleased. It's a nice German-run hotel with a German flavor as opposed to all those chain hotels at the airport. And it's less expensive too. The restaurant is top for the inclusive breakfast or for dinner (which is extra). But there's a multitude of eateries within walking distance for authentic German cuisine. We recommend the Gemalte Haus. Distance to the airport is very do-able. We take a taxi to and from. If you go, reserve in advance and be sure to ask for a non-smoking room or you will most likely get a room that smells like smoke, which can be unpleasant. Also, ask for a balcony. Bathrooms are generally small, but efficient. Parking is practically non-existent, but if you do have a car, let them know and they will usually arrange parking for you. However, you won't need a car once you are there.

The hotel staff here were all enormously friendly. In this small German hotel, they usually remembered my name and even my room number.

The shower and bathroom were small, and the sink was actually in the room, not in the tiny bathroom -- but the bed was comfortable, the water was warm, and the price was incredibly small. Breakfast each morning was delicious with a great variety of foods, and the restaurant in the hotel is outstanding. The hotel is in a pleasant residential neighborhood, and yet just a short walk across the bridge to the cathedral and the most scenic part of Frankfurt.
