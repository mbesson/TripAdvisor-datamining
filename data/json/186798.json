We opted out of the breakfast option, as it was a bit pricey and hadn't gotten good reviews ($8-10/person per day in addition). Given the wonderful food within easy walking distance at half the price, that turned out to be a good decision. The best internet rate for this booking after taxes and such came to 733 pesos per day. They accepted a visa debit card. The staff was pleasant and showed us to our fifth floor room which was spacious. During the rest of our stay the following problems surfaced: -- In the light of day, the room rug was simply filthy... -- There was a constant presence of an incredibly foul odor coming from the bathroom. It turned out that the shower drain was the source, and by covering the drain with the plastic sheet which came with our drinking glass we could eliminate that. Unfortunately it took us a couple days to figure that out. -- One of our room keys (magnetic swipe), either my wife's or my own, required reprogramming every day for some strange reason. The desk staff gladly did this. It became a bit of a joke. -- The elevator simply didn't work sporadically. Sadly, the day we left was one of those days. It's not much fun hauling luggage down 5 flights of narrow stairs. One of the desk staff helped us carry stuff down once he saw our problem. -- The hair dryer in the bathroom never worked, but c'est la vie. -- The bed was unbelievably hard. Imagine 2 inches of mattress on plywood. That's how it felt. I didn't check the actual construction, but I'm not exaggerating. On the good side, the staff was pleasant, the internet worked well most of the time and there was a laundry right around the corner. Walking in the area was safe and interesting, with shopping and access to mass transit very nearby. Would we stay here again? Sadly but truly, no. We had the good fortune to have input from a friend who suggested we stay at a different nearby hotel (think Camelot) which was much cleaner and functional with a better rate and breakfast included.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "M\u00e9xico", "Title": "\u201cOlder property, ok value, ok location, noisy neighbors\u201d", "Author": "YoungDiver", "ReviewID": "UR122522414", "Content": "This is an older property with a just ok maintenance.

When I explained that I was alone, I noticed just a bit more attention---NOT negative by ANY stretch of the imagination...they seems to make sure I was in at night and constantly asked if I needed anything. I was there with the intent of sightseeing tours, trying to duplicate the cultural experience I'd had during college some years before. When I asked about tours at the desk, they were full of options and did, in fact, direct me to the best out there. I was also near shopping and restaurants in the Zona Rosa...although I definitely prefer the sort of cart/street food and am luck to be blessed with a strong stomach. My ONLY reminder would be to ask if breakfast is included in the price you pay. I was certain that it was...only to be billed after I ate.

We spend 9 days (prepaid or we would have left the first night). The view over Paseo de la Reforma was great, but that's about all. We wanted this view to see the Independence Day Military Parade on Sept 16 or we would have demanded a change. When we arrived there was a coffee maker, but no coffee. When we called the desk, we were put on hold for almost ten minutes then told that \"the hotel is out of coffee this week\" (!) However, when we asked our maid the next morning, she had lots of coffee. We also discovered that the hair dryer (cemented to the lavatory) did not work and called reception again. My wife was told by a desk clerk \"well, just push the button if you want it to work.\" (which, of course, did NOT solve the problem - we do, after all, know how to push a button). When I called and threatened to leave, the desk finally (and ungraciously) sent up a portable hair dryer - but made no effort to fix the broken one. When we arrived, the toilet was also running very noisily. It took four days for someone to come fix it after we reported it. Once these annoyances were FINALLY seen to, the room was more or less OK. The only BRIGHT spot about the so-called amenities and the employees was Pilar, our maid, who went out of her way to make us comfortable, despite our being ignored and treated as though we were a bother by the rest of the staff. And for God's sake, find somewhere to eat besides the restaurant in the hotel. It is terribly overpriced for what you get. The \"breakfast buffet\" for $12.50 was pathetic: no toast, eggs ONLY if you request them (not on buffet or menu), cold canned sausages, watered down juices - need I say more?. And there were really only four items on the dinner menu. We tried only two of them before deciding to avoid the restaurant and eat somewhere - anywhere - else.

During my stay, the internet access worked on the first day, but then did not work for the rest of my (four night) stay. This was a major disappointment for me, as I had a lot of work to do online, so that biased me a bit against the Mision Reforma. On the topic of internet, they have disconnected the hardwired Ethernet connections in the rooms, and the only available connection is wifi. Those rooms near the center (near the elevators) seem to get the best signal. If the internet is not working, I found free internet at a restaurant named VIP's nearby. The business center of the hotel has a couple of internet terminals, but beyond that, it is pretty useless. The location of the hotel is pretty good - it is on the Reforma right at the statue of Columbus (Colon). The walk to the nearest metro (Hidalgo station) is about 10 minutes - it is three (long) blocks. You can also take a \"colectivo\" bus along the Reforma for just a few pesos. For me, one of the highlights was the shower! The water pressure was terrific and the temperature great. I find that important after a long flight. The rooms are a bit dated, but large. My room had a strange 1970-era orange/blue combination. The rugs could use a good replacement, but I found the hotel to be clean and the accomodations very acceptable. Television with the normal Mexican channels plus CNN. Refrigerator (for the mini-bar, but accessible) and safe included. On my last night at the hotel, the air conditioning stopped working.

The location is convenient--if you're walking to historic downtown or to public transportation--but it is very hard to get to during rush hour (which lasts late into the evening in Mexico City) and impossible when protests clog the Reforma artery (which is about once or twice a week). The rooms are a bit shabby, but functional. Some rooms and floors are in better condition than others, but they usually have extra rooms available, and are happy to move you if something is wrong with your room. For example, the room I was given once did not have working air conditioning--a definite problem in downtowm Mexico City in the summer. But they changed my room as soon as another one opened up. There is a high-speed ethernet connection in the room which works most of the time. (It didn't work one visit out of 4.) There are no cables in the room, but the front desk will loan you one if you ask. It is one of the few hotels in the price category that have internet in the rooms, so it's a good choice for business travelers. There is a business center, but it is very small and not always staffed. But, hey, at least they have one. There is an in-room safe. You need to get the key/lock from the front desk. As someone else said--use it. My general rule of thumb when traveling internationally is that if there is a safe in the room, there's probably a reason. The staff at the hotel are extremely helpful and professional. Definitely one of the best staff's that I've run across in Mexico City. Only one time did I get a rude front desk attendant. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt that she was having a bad day because everyone else has been so great. The breakfast buffet is one of the better mid-class hotel breakfasts I have had. But except for breakfast, I would avoid the restaurant. The food is really sub par, and it is a shame to eat bad food in Mexico City when so many excellent restaurants abound. The only thing about the breakfast I didn't like was that when I brought a colleague to eat breakfast with me and we wanted to pay, the waiter wouldn't let me charge it to the room. He insisted that I pay in cash. It happened a second time the same way--and he asked me for a different amount. I'm pretty sure that he was pocketing the money and not reporting it.

Anyhting over $40 is way too much for this place.", "Date": "December 8, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Steyning, England, UK", "Title": "\u201cMy opinion!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1398282", "Content": "The location of is convenient to the old town of Mexico City which, bye the way, is very interesting. I found the hotel comfortable. The room and bathroom were very nicely appointed and spacious. The staff were most helpful, cheerful and fairly efficient. The breakfasts were very good and catered to most needs and cultures. There is a safe in the room - use it - don't leave anything out you really need - some of my perfume disappeared. Having said that - I enjoyed my stay immensely and loved Mexico - especially the people who were always so full of fun.", "Date": "October 19, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat welcome and good value\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1142929", "Content": "It's a little outside the Zona Rosa, but in terms of price and welcome, I think it would be hard to beat. We also stayed in a glitzy five-star hotel slap bang in the middle of the Zona Rosa, and wished we'd returned here instead. It was so much more friendly and has a much better atmosphere. Rooms are really spacious with good views, the restaurant is good, and the staff really are some of the nicest people I've ever met. Nothing was too much trouble for them.", "Date": "July 22, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cgreat place\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR642445", "Content": "We booked four rooms here. the staff is terrific. They met our every need, spoiled our children terribly and generally treated us as though we were the most important thing they had to take care of. They booked a tour driver for us who was terrific, organized our bus trip to Acapulco, and even opened the restaurant up early to get us fed before heading us on our way. It's an easy walk to the zona rosa from here, and a VIps and McDonald's are a block away (as well as a pharmacy and small supermarket.) I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a clean, quiet, friendly place to stay.", "Date": "July 15, 2002"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Mision Zona Rosa Mexico City", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d186798-Reviews-Mision_Zona_Rosa_Mexico_City-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "Price": "$53 - $70*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Napoles No. 62</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Mexico City</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">06600</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Mexico</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "186798", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/3b/ee/3bee4b45ac75d4c35cff5e91ff60cf0a3large.jpg"}}
