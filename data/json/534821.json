Clean and courteous. Felt safe at all times. You could play quarters on the beds. Hard as a table top. It may be the price you pay for safety but I may have to seek therapy to find relief. Breakfast was plentiful and tasty. Walmart was within walking distance in case you forgot your shaving cream, tequila or motorcycle. A little different than the states. All part of the charm. The bar was nothing to get excited about. Very little selection. Over all it was just average for the accommodation but exceptional on location and safety.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brownsville, Texas", "Title": "\u201cPrimarily Business Hotel\u201d", "Author": "marsa18", "ReviewID": "UR122163120", "Content": "Pricey but primarily a business hotel. Pool was unusable. The staff at the Fiesta Inn was relatively friendly. However, communication between hotel and taxi service needed improvement. Even though I had made arrangements to be picked up at the airport, this did not occur. Wifi access was good throughout hotel.

It's been a year now and I've been meaning to write this review for a while... I stayed at Fiesta in Cuautitlan in March of 2007. I was there, away from family, for over 30 days. Not once did I feel out of place, my room was always tidy, and the Hotel Staff was always sensitive to my needs. Cesar, the bartender (although I've heard he's moved on) was always there for honest explanations of culture and local things to do. There wasn't a lot of free time while I visited, but there was enough to take his advice. He was also a mixology genius :) If in the area for business, especially a longer-term stay, I would highly recommend this hotel. It's located in a shopping district, complete with restaurants (fast food and fancy), as well as a Wal-Mart and several other conveniences that are secure and necessary for longer stays. A+. And if the staff ever reads this - thanks much for everything you do.", "Date": "February 10, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Fiesta Inn Cuautitlan", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d534821-Reviews-Fiesta_Inn_Cuautitlan-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "Price": "$103 - $139*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Av.
