I was very impressed by the housekeeping department,my requests (like a baby cot,assistance with washer) were answered within minutes! Great location right in front of Deira city center where u can grab a bite,watch a few movies and shop in carrefore.The thing I disliked was the old box-type TV in the bedroom,although there was a 32plasma in the living room,also the toiletries were too basic,I would've expected at least a tooth brush and shaving kit added to the shampoo/gel/cream/soap in the toilets.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tehran, Iran", "Title": "\u201cit was neglected\u201d", "Author": "peyman46", "ReviewID": "UR126393269", "Content": "a good hotel with poor manage make a very good opportunity to naught . excellent position can make this hotel unique .but poor maintenance decrease the quality of this hotel. the swiming pool was very beautiful but the water tempreture was very cold that made this pool impossible to swin . of course they gave us transportation to another city season but it was very uncomfortable to wait 45 min for a car to swiming pool and then 45 min waiting for a car to get back to suits. the breakfast was not excitable as a 4 stars hotels breakfasts. at arrival they asked 1050 ADE for excess bed . after that I knew this fact that \" up to 2 children under 12 years are free \" they gave back this money to me . what if I didn't know this fact by internet site????? one undeniable fact is the closest distanc to deira city center and it is a very good plus", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baku", "Title": "\u201cAlmost perfect!\u201d", "Author": "liliya_nebes", "ReviewID": "UR124665797", "Content": "Almost everything was perfect: big room (family deluxe for 4) will all kitchen facilities working (teapot,microwave,washing machine) and good service, impressive lobby, big elevators, good staff, complimentary water, tea and coffee...

The quantity is good too. The hotel provided a good baby cot and play pen for her so she was happy and so were we.

Also the gym facility was very poor! Half or actually all of the machine did not work, except one of them and there was no one who actually looked after and explained anyting.
