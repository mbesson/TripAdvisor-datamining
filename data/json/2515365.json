I had a few questions about parking. I emailed twice and never got a reply. Two weeks before my scheduled night there, I decided to cancel my reservation because of the lack of customer service/help. I called the front desk and asked how I cancel a reservation and the \"kid\" had no idea how to do it. He said he was new and did not know the system yet. I contacted the site where I originally reserved this room and they said to contact the hotel to cancel. Needless to say, I got ZERO assistance, horrible responses from kids who had no idea how to run that hotel, and zero answers to ANY of my questions. I had hoped that they would get my emails and cancel the reservation, but they did not. I was charged a full night's stay. I called and they refused to acknowledge their fault and error on the matter and refused to issue a refund or apology. I read reviews about this place and knew most of the complaints were from the quality of the rooms and customer service; however, I thought location and price would make up for said complaints.

We booked only because every where else in town was full and looked at the last review and thought ok great location and comfortable beds, made all the previous ones seem possibly an exageration. NOT AT ALL people believe me you will hate this place! Upon arrival we were greated by a woman that could not speak english hardly at all, unable to answer our questions about the age of the hotel, parking, etc. Upon check in we got our room keys and were placed on the 9th floor on the way up the elevator which sounded horrible BTW the elevator stopped on the 2nd floor to pick up another rider going up, I about vomited right there the carpet was so terribly stained and the smell emitting from that floor was horrible, We made it to the 9th and although stained carpet not even half as bad as the 2nd floor we were a bit more hopeful. We booked a standard double room, and that's what you get, a tiny double sized bed, old linens, filthy carpet, gross tiny bathroom but we had running water and heat so decided to make the most of it. We all (2 couples 2 rooms) headed out on the town upon arriving back at our hotel, the elevator was out of service we were told the stairs were our only choice, 9 stories later exhausted we finally made it to our rooms and literally fell exhausted into our beds, we awoke the next morning only to learn the elevator was still out of service, meaning we got to haul all our luggage down 9 floors, filthy staircase and something all over the stairs of the 4th to the 2nd floor made it treacherous as well. Today being 4 days later my muscles still ache I've yet to hear back from the manager (we requested some sort of a discount) I'm betting we won't hear back and we chalk it up to learning the hard way. I'd much rather stay in a hostel or sleep in a park then ever step foot in this horrid excuse for a hotel again!!!!

Eventually had to re-open the windows to hear the loud sirens, trash dumping noises, and strange animal cries at 2 AM. There are NO SCREENS on the windows, so YES, YOU OR YOUR KIDS COULD FALL OUT OF THE WINDOWS. Is that legal? I don't know. There was a metal object in my sheets, the sheets didn't even fit on the bed, the shower water was inconsistent, the bathroom dirty and hot, the hotel service TERRIBLE, holes in the walls, and cracks in the ceilings.

I called the Hotel Seattle based on it's location on tourist map near the Hilton. I didn't have access to internet to research any reviews, so did not see any until after our stay. The location is great, virtually next door to the high end hotels. It was half the price of the Hilton so we thought we would give it a try. When we checked in, I asked about a AAA discount, but the clerk's response was \"What's that?\". That was the first time I ever heard of a hotel desk clerk (in US) not knowing what AAA was. Our room could have been used for a low budget movie's version of a run down hotel, threadbare carpets, dingy curtains not quite hanging right, minimal lighting (a strange hanging light in the middle of the room), dingy bathroom. Although it was definitely dingy, it did not appear obviously dirty. No a/c but luckily we didn't need it. The bed was not particularly comfortable, a little on the boucy side and with two people you both definitely gravitated to the middle. There was no clock in the room, but we did get the wake up call we requested. It was ok for spending the one night, I wouldn't want to spend more. On the positive side, it was a great safe location, quick taxi ride to train station, and the shower was great. They have not invested in low flow shower heads so the water pressure was really high. We also really enjoyed the conversation with the desk clerk the next morning. When I mentioned the clerk the previous night had never heard of AAA, he told us that clerk was a moron and that the owner must not have asked him anything but his name in the interview. He went on to say that we should check out the reviews on Trip Advisor, they were listed as one of the worst hotels in Seattle! You gotta love that type of enthusiastic employee!

I read all the previous reviews and was concerned but decided it would be an adventure and if nothing else we would have a good story.

That's about the only nice thing I can say about this place. The photos of the hotel are very misleading. Standing outside looking at the hotel, you have to wonder if the photo on their website has been doctored at all. The photos of the rooms were obviously taken at a different hotel because the room I was put in, and then moved to another looked NOTHING like the room photos on their website. As someone else said in a previous review about this hotel, don't walk around the room without your shoes and socks on. Definitely not a romantic getaway (unless you're trying to break up with someone.) The sheets had hair on them. I requested a non-smoking room, but you could tell that someone had smoked in it previously. There was no air condtioning or a fan. Big deal, it's Seattle, right? Wrong. It was 90 plus degrees during my stay. The windows do open though, providing little relief. Cable television? Non-existant. I was told that sometimes it comes in, and sometimes it doesn't. What does that mean, really? It's sad when you pay $96 a night and can't even get the local channels (NBC, ABC, CBS.) Go on the internet for your news? There is no internet, unless you want to setup your laptop for dialup. The restaurant downstairs was a dive. Again, the service was great, but as with the rooms, you could tell that management didn't quite care about upgrading anything. Several times during my meal, I could have swore I saw something scurrying across the floor. The waitress seemed embarrassed while attempting to relieve me of my worries. I forgot to mention the lobby. The sofa was very comfortable. In fact, it may have been the nicest thing in the entire hotel. However, don't lean your head back while on the sofa or you'll notice that there is paint peeling off the ceiling in large chunks held together by duct tape in places. Speaking of duct tape, there was actually duct tape holding the carpet together in several places. The room I stayed in had scotch tape holding the wallpaper over this gaping hole. Security risk? Room keys have the room number and hotel name on the key ring. So, don't bring anything valuable, because who knows how often the locks are changed and if previous customers have lost their keys on drinking binges in Pioneer Square. There is no room service. It looked like there was only one person there at all times. If you're hungry, don't eat the food in the vending machine. Both the pretzels and Twix candybar were past their expiration date. At check out, staff was apologetic for the things I told them, but obviously not at fault. While you could sense their understandable frustration through their body language (not quite making eye contact, embarrased look on their face), you got the feeling that they hear about similar guest experiences on a regular basis. It's a shame because it's in a great location. You almost wonder if management is even in it to make money. I never did hear back from them after I sent a letter detailing my disappointments.
