For our last night we arrived into istanbul on the Sofia night train / bus at 6 am - and rocked up to the hotel mainly just to have a sit down and leave our bags somewhere (knowing we wouldn't be able to check in properly until later), the staff took our bags no problem, made us feel right at home and let us have breakfast there and then which was so nice of then. Rooms are lovely ad clean and the beds are really comfortable. For breakfast there is a great selection buffet style. Hotel is very centrally located walking distance to all the major sights.

It's in a good (albeit very busy) central area in Sultanhamet. It's close to a tram stop and lots of sights and restaurants. The rooms are a good size but some can be noisy. Ours was a noisy room but they did change it happily when asked. As you walk into the hotel you would swear it has had the same decor for the last 20 years but I was told it was refurbished in 2009. It looks a bit kitsch in the lobby with the velour oversized sofas and the cigarette smoke colored walls. Bedrooms are fresher looking and quite comfortable with hair dryers, tv's and kettle. Breakfast looks impressive as you walk in but on closer inspection some of the food looked a little wilted and there were 5 different types of olives which reduced the actual choices. The key cards to the rooms needed to be taken back to reception twice to be re-programmed which was annoying and I saw some other guests who had the same problem. The reception staff were nice but really need a bit more training and the hotel needs to up its professionalism a tad. I had pre-arranged a late checkout but reception knew nothing of this and I had to show them my copy of the email with the price I had been quoted. The inbound airport transfer was very efficient but the outbound one nearly ended in disaster when the driver was nearly 30 minutes late and we nearly missed the flight. So you see my problem - it was ok for the price paid and if you don't have high expectations then you will probably think it's fine. Woud we stay there again - no- we would pay extra and stay at the Amira or similar. Oh and if you are Turkish you pay half the price that we foreigners do!!!!", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Value\u201d", "Author": "alastaira1", "ReviewID": "UR127503437", "Content": "Very friendly, good service, well located close to lots of restaurants & close to public transport (trains, ferries & tram).

Having researched Turkish hotels for 2 weeks, I was dismayed to find that the hotels within my price range (about \u00c2\u00a375/night) had quite discouraging reviews. Recommended by a friend, I selected Maywood as the price was just right and reviews were very good in relation to the hotel's price bracket. Having returned a week ago, I can confirm that the hotel is entirely worthy of the rave reviews. The staff were friendly and helpful right through our stay and particularly prompt when it came to resolving any problems. Happy to provide touristy guidance, but never tried to sell us any tour packages or give dodgy restaurant recommmendations, which I really appreciated. Breakfast was fresh and varied and the service very customer friendly; there was no rushing people out of the door near closing time or reluctance to replenish supplies. The couple of times that we requested an omlette or a different kind of tea bag, the Hotel manager himself serviced our requests and was friendly and helpful throughout our stay. My children were delighted to find that there was a little parrot at Reception, and were regular visitors to it (and the well-stocked sweet jar at the desk!). Location wise, it's fantastic. Just a couple of minutes away from the tram stop and train station and about 20 mins away from the major sights. The immediate neighbourhood comprises several souvenir shops and restaurants which make for a pleasant stroll at any time of day. The rooms were very comfy and cleaned well every day. Tea and coffee making supplies were replenished regularly also. Do bear in mind that the room sizes can vary greatly, so do take a look at the available rooms to see what suits. And if you do find the room unsatisfactory for any reason, do tell them as they are very cooperative in relocating. As for the downsides...An issue we did have was with the water supply, which would stop and start at random moments, which was an irritation. We also found that the centrally controlled A/C system did mean that when the weather turned and the heating was switched on, our room did tend to get uncomfortably hot and the only solution was to switch the system off and open a window, which didn't help much.However, the staff did address/resolve issues immediately so i think the issues just indicate that some maintenance/renovation work is in order at the Hotel. Do bear in mind that the Hotel gives a 10% discount for cash payment (applied automatically) which makes the stay even better value for money.We were given Turkish Tea sets and Turkish delight as farewell gifts, which was a very nice touch and just summarise the essence of this cosy hotel...brilliant customer service.

The closet also had a safe which was helpful to keep your valuables in. The buffet breakfast was the best of all the places we stayed at in Turkey over our 2 weeks. Nice variety of pastries, fruit, meat, cheese and veggies. I highly recommend the Sultanahmet Fish House Restaurant near the Grand Baazar. The food was different, tasty and not overpriced.

The free airport transfer was 40 minutes late from picking us up (supposedly due to traffic, but I checked the traffic map at the airport and it didn't look too bad). I overlooked this and also overlooked the fact that the airport transfer from Erboy Hotel, where we stayed the previous weekend, was prompt, was in much better condition, and was private. But then we got to the Sirkeci neighborhood. Notice I didn't say \"hotel\". We got off about 3 blocks from Maywood because it turned out that there was huge construction going on on the street where the hotel is. Our driver led us through muddy roads with pipes, rocks, and loud banging noise everywhere. Why didn't they let us know about this construction ahead of time??? They said it had just started 3 days before, which still would've been plenty of time to give us a heads up. I was starting to get really irritated. And then when we checked into our room, which was facing the noisy street, it had 2 twin beds, not 1 queen or king bed that we requested. The hotel was fully booked, but they said they could put a king mattress in our room if we want. Why hadn't they done this BEFORE we checked in??? This was the last straw. But what quickly turned around this miserable situation was the staff's pleasant, professional, and calm demeanor. They completely understood our dissatisfaction and checked if their sister hotel, Hotel Sapphire, had anything available, but it was also fully booked. They then served us with beverages and helped us look for another hotel. While we were using the public computer in the lobby, they were also checking online and making phone calls to check other hotels for us. And when we finally booked another hotel, they had a taxi waiting for us (which we didn't have to pay for) to take us to the other hotel. They apologized about the situation, and one of the last things they said to us was \"Your vacation is more important to us, and we hope you enjoy the rest of your stay in Istanbul.\" If it hadn't been for the major construction and the beds, we would've stayed in Maywood Hotel, and I think we would've really liked it.

A short while later someone knocked on my door with a large plate of delicious cut fruit (for free). This was a lovely start to my stay. All hotels I came across in Turkey incl breakfast as part of the hotel stay, no matter how cheap the room. The breakfast at Maywood was good - lots of options in a nice setting. It's not easy to find good coffee in Turkey but if you're lucky enough to be able to refine your skills at achieving just the right formula of nescafe, coffee mate, milk, bad drip coffee and sugar, you'd think you were in a small cafe on Commercial Drive in Vancouver or on College Street in Toronto drinking day-old coffee - not everyone will be able to master this as it takes practice, practice and desire to drink something that resembles coffee. Overall the rooms, service and location were very good and I would stay there again. It was one of the few places in Turkey where I didn't feel like people were trying to sell me something in addition to what was agreed to and the staff were in fact very helpful with any questions I had. The airport transfer was prompt and well organized. Note that that part of Istanbul can be noisy but that's not specific this to this hotel but to the Sultanamet/Sirkci area so just be aware of that. The Maywood faces a somewhat quieter alley so may be less noisy than other hotels in the immediate area. And remember to outright ignore the people that will try to get your attention every time you walk in and out of the hotel from the nearby shops. Trust me,... don't even look or say 'no, thank you' or anything to them unless you want to lose money or time.

We had selected the Maywood on the basis of its location and reviews, and I can say that we were in no way disappointed. Once our booking was confirmed, the management wrote to ask about airline arrival and arranged for a free shuttle to the hotel. (And, later, probably because we were staying longer than most visitors, they kindly arranged a free return to the airport--at 3:30 am for an early departure!) The welcome at arrival was cordial and helpful. Our 'double room' was on the 4th floor facing the street, but when the window was closed, virtually no sound entered. \"Double\" in this case--as in other instances--meant two single beds. The hotel is in the Sirceji zone of the old city and like most other places, the rooms are not excessively large. However there was one chair and table, flat screen tv, ample drawers in the closet, a room safe and a mini-bar fridge that had enough slack room for us to store a few bottles of soda and Ayran--Turkey's marvelous yoghurt drink--very restorative after a day of tourism in hot weather! The bathroom was clean, with hair dryer, The tub and shower were effective, BUT the tub was high and its edge was higher due to the sliding shower panel. This could be a challenge for someone with mobility issues. It was the only problem I could see in the room. There is a free access computer in the lobby--though you have to get accustomed to a Turkish keyboard. We had a laptop and the hotel provides free 24 hour wi-fi that was highly satisfactory. The rate includes breakfast (7 to 10--but toward 9:30 the pickings could get slim). The selections were Turkish and Western and fresh and tasty. Many varieties of bread, rolls, muesli, cornflakes and another cereal, boiled eggs, usually one hot selection--vegetable or sausage; other meats, cucumbers, tomatoes, dried fruits, juice, filter coffee, turkish cay (tea) --also tea bags (and a hot milk urn). One caution which applies to virtually all Turkish places we went,--the concept of decaffinated coffee is not known--or else one gets instant Nescafe which did not seem very decaf to us. The staff at the Maywood were wonderful--helpful, courteous and friendly. We were not on a tour, and found our way around the city mostly on our own using the Akbil transit \"key\"--not always easy to find, but definitely worth using. The Maywood is close to the historic center--one can walk to Aya Sofia, Topkopi, Blue Mosque, Turkish and Islamic Museum, the Underground Cistern, the Grand Bazaar, the Spice Bazaar, the Rustom Pasha mosque and Sulimaniya mosque (tho that is closed for renovations at the moment). The tram line stations at Sirceji is about 2.5 blocks away in one direction and the Gulhane Park tram station is about 3.5 blocks in the other. Sometimes we used the tram to go up the hill to the Blue Mosque area simply to avoid the walk, but the walk is doable. Two blocks beyond Sirkeji are the ferry docks of the Eminonu neighborhood by the Galata Bridge--fish sandwichs are a must! Do you get the idea?--the Maywood is at the center of one of the most fascinating cities in the world. There are pleny of places to have a meal nearby--one of our favorites was the Grill House (est 1959) which has a Turkish name--located 1.5 blocks east and 1 block SE (at the big construction site which will be there for a while--no noise for us though). In short, we had one of the nicest holidays in our experience in Istanbul. It is a city no one should miss, and the Hotel Maywood was a perfect base for enjoying the visit. I noted that a number of shorter-term visitors were then joining or leaving cruises. On departure we each were presented with gifts--a small packet of apple tea mix with two tea glasses and a box of \"Turkish Delight\"---that was when we settled the balance of the bill the evening before departure. Early the next morning, the night manager wanted to give us two more! (In fairness, the Maywood's hospitality might be said to be not that unusual in Istanbul--most Turkish folks are very proud of their city and country and, even when they can't really solve a visitor's problem, will certainly try.

Maywood is one of few dozen hotels in and around the Sirkeci and Sultanahmet areas. My impression was that rooms were almost uniformly small in all hotels in that area and the main difference between the hotels was in the form of staff + breakfast quality. So Maywood hotel scored well in these 2 counts; Staff were generally friendly and helpful even though they seemed understaffed and as such, requests took some time to complete during busy periods. When we left the hotel, the front desk receptionist and the manager came over to the taxi and waved goodbye to us as the taxi drove off, a quite nice gesture that you wouldn't imagine in many 5* hotels. Breakfast was also good with a wide variety of food items (and fresh omelettes, something that many other hotels charge for in Istanbul). Location was excellent, the hotel was within walking distance to the Blue Mosque (15 minutes), the main tourist drag of Divan Yolu and the Eminonu pier. Did I mention the tram line was 2 minutes away as well? Sirkeci area provides a nice balance between the over touristy feel of some parts of Sultanahmet, and the completely non-touristy feel of Beyoglu, so it is often a good compromise for those unable to decide between Sultanahmet and Beyoglu for choosing a hotel. Rooms, as i mentioned, were small though clean. So if you want a no-frills room without any major issues in an excellent location, then Maywood may very well be your bet.

However, it was not needed because of the excellent staff and resources of Hotel Maywood. This hotel was one of two suggested by the bride and her family. The hotel was wonderful. The staff were available 24 hours a day -- good for jet-lagged guests -- and always warm and welcoming. They provided maps and directions, providing an indispensable tip to stay near the tram line for the first few days, so as to not get lost. We never took a cab during our 10-day stay because the public transportation was excellent and not hard to learn. The breakfast buffet was unbelievably good and ample. Be sure to check out the photos. And it was served 7-10 am on weekdays, but they never rushed you out. Access to a computer and to wi-fi was really helpful. The rooms were clean, comfortable, and well appointed. Quiet and restful. The location was fantastic as well. We were within a 5-10 minute walk to many things we wanted to see and the tram stop was less than 5 minutes away for destinations further away. I can't say enough good things about the hotel. Our room was a pleasant oasis in the middle of a huge and busy city. We are so glad we stayed here. I'll offer a couple of places to visit, outside of the usual sights. We went to Istanbul Modern, a museum of modern and contemporary art. and to Istanbul University on its fall registration day. Both afforded glimpses of the distinctions between modern and historical Turkey that we would not have had in only 10 days. We ate at two at the fish restaurants under the Galata Bridge, which were excellent. My favorite restaurant in this section of the city was Le Safran, which served Turkish food. And we liked the Arasta Bazaar behind the Blue Mosque and the Spice Bazaar better than the Grand Bazaar -- the Grand Bazaar is just too big! A great place to visit in this historical time, to see some of the effects of current events on everyday life. And, by the way, we were there during Ramadan and the 2010 World Basketball Championships. Although the basketball was televised in Turkish, it didn't really matter -- and it was fun to see some of our NBA players on their countries' teams.", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Suli", "Title": "\u201cWish I could have stayed longer\u201d", "Author": "jbean68", "ReviewID": "UR77659670", "Content": "Unfortunately, I only stayed at the Maywood hotel for one night as I was just passing through, but wish it could have been longer.

The hotel is located in the old part of Istanbul town, and it's a really strategic base for visiting various historical sites such as the Topkapi palace, which is just 5 to 10 minutes walk away, and of course the grand bazaar. The train station and tram line is just a stone's throw away from the hotel, you could just hop on the train to the nearest shopping outlet Ovilium (hope I got the spelling right) 7 stops away, or take the tram to Taksim, another shopping area. The hotel room is small but very neat, tidy and clean, the shower stall was a bit small though. And there is the bed, we expected a King size, but was a bit disappointed that it felt somehow smaller than a queen ;-P Nevertheless, the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful indeed. They made us feel very much at home and comfortable. At this point, I must make a comparison between this hotel and the 5-star one which we stayed at Alacati, Maywood's service was by far better than that of the 5-star hotel ! It is really amazing how good service can make an average hotel an excellent one, and conversely, poor service can break a 5-star hotel. This is a true comparison to Solto hotel (5-star) which we stayed in Alacati for 1 week, the way the staff handled the check-in and how they treated their guests was not very professional, although it was a nice hotel, we did not feel at home and service provided by this 5-star hotel, which didn't come close to the service we got from Maywood hotel Well done to the staff at Maywood hotel!

I happened to find a very good deal and paid less than the original cost. The hotel facilities are great, the rooms are very clean, the bathroom is very comfortable, nice shower. The staff is very kind and they were willing to help us in any way we needed. The breakfast is very complete, The location is very good, around the corner there are a lot of nice restaurants, very hippie style, which I loved. The train station is two blocks away. The blue mosque, and aghia sophia is like 10 blocks far, but you get very easily following the train lines. the grand Bazaar is a little bit far, you can take the train or walk 20 blocks I think may be less, depending the street you take. I would like to say a few things about this hotel that you should know, so you don't get any surprises once you are there. The lady that cleaned our room entered the room without knocking, with us inside, two different times. in one of them we had the non disturb sign on. It wasnt that bad, we were just relaxing. Many times we found this lady sitting in the floor next to our door with the door of service opened. sometimes we found tea cups and dishes in the floor and the cleaning cart. I think a four star hotel should not allow this things happen. There was internet wi fi but it didnt work in my room, i had to use it in the stairs or the hall. We took a tour to the bosforus (highly recommended by the way) offered by the hotel, it was perfect until the end of the tour in which we spent half an hour to go to some place, and when we realized we were in a tourist trap, they left us in a place where a fashion show took place with women dressed in leather. we couldnt believed what was happening, all of our free afternoon was being wiped out from our plans. after this fashion show they were going to some other place to drink some tea and after that they were leaving people at some point, not the hotel. we talked to our guide that we where very angry at this, and we wanted to leave. he was very nice and paid for a taxi to our hotel. we lost only an hour and could finally do what we wanted and went to the pedestrian street. I recommend you to ask your guide what are you going to do next, so you don't go through with this. We made reservations for the shuttle to go to the airport, and when the time came, there was a taxi waiting for us. they told us the van was not available that day.... The taxi took a high speed street and reached the 120 kph. We were going to the airport with a lot of time and I told him to slow it down, we were very nervous, there is no need to be stressed out when you are relaxing. I hope this review helps and prepares you for a very nice vacation.

I never leave reviews for hotels because I'm always just content with my stay.

I don't even sleep that comfortably at home! I have to guess that the rooms at this hotel are of different sizes because ours was HUGE! I could have easily invited 5 other people up for drinks had I been traveling with friends. Lots of floor space and extra chairs for sitting space. It was great. Request room 304 if this is important to you (\"french beds\" is what they called it, but it was one queen-sized mattress.) We've included photos so be sure to check out the photo tab. My husband is 6'3\" (190cm) and had no complaints about the size of the bed or shower cabin - you can see him sitting in a chair in one of the photos. For what we paid per night (just a bit more than some nearby youth hostels) this hotel met and exceeded our expectations. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the very friendly and knowledgeable Emol. Despite having only studied the english language for four months (I don't believe it!!!) he asked how our journey to the hotel was and if we found it without problems. {{We flew into Sabiha Airport and so were not offered a free pick-up service. Anyway, you can just hop on the Havas bus headed to Taksim and for 13 TL or 7 euro per person, make it to town in about an hour. From there, you would take the Kabatas funicular downhill for 1.50TL, then the connecting tram for another 1.50TL and exit at Sirkeci. Cross the road (carefully!) and head uphill, taking the second left. Please consult google maps because there are lots of little streets, alleys and passageways.}} Emol then offered us a welcome drink and some Turkish Delight then took a map, explained where we were and oriented us with the surrounding areas and things to see. We were led up to our room (reachable by one of the two elevators or a staircase) and explained what everything was and how it worked (the rooms and hotel have quite a few high tech details...like a sound system in room bathrooms and a doorbell for each room!!) Breakfast was served by Mr. Vural from 7am-10am each morning with coffee, tea, hot water, warm milk and cold juices and water. I believe you can order extra drinks, but we didn't need them. An assortment of pastries, fresh and dried fruits, cucumbers, tomatoes, cheeses, deli meats, olives, yogurt, bread, spreads, cereals and sweets are on offer. Though not what we normally eat for breakfast, we found it to be extremely filling and a nice glimpse into the Turkish lifestyle. Vural will take good care of you at breakfast....rest assured. Use this early morning time to really savor what Istanbul offers - and pick Vural's brain for any and all information you may need! He was truly and open book. We talked to him about the Turkish people, politics, religion, the economy, our safety as tourist (he was very frank about everything, as well...no BS...which was very much appreciated.) The hotel is literally meters away from the Topkapi palace walls. The staff are more than willing to help you with learning Turkish words and phrases, drawing maps (!!!), sharing their opinions and also just open to a little chat every now and then. There is a computer in the lobby with free access, as well as the free wi-fi throughout the hotel. There are restaurants nearby (we ate at the colorful \"Clas Restaurant\" on M. Hudavendigar Cad. the first night and received huge portions for very little money...no tourists were there, perhaps that's why? You can also buy 12 postcards for 1TL on the same street, FYI. At the Grand Bazaar they were 4 for 2TL.) Please contact me if you need any further details, but don't be weary about booking.

I was fortunate to come across Mehmet; he is the gentleman who checked us in.He is a thorough professional and gave us sound advice on exploring Istanbul.I am sure, I saved around a couple of hundred pounds by heeding to his advice of walking to the places of historical importance, rather than booking expensive city tours that cost around \u00c2\u00a335 per person. The location of the hotel made this possible, as it is pretty close to almost all the places worth paying a visit; this includes Blue mosque, Topkapi palace, Hagia Sofia, Hippodrome, Grand Bazaar, Spice Bazaar, Basilica cistern. Mehmet also advised us on good restaurants in the area. All the restaurants close to the hotel are two to three times more expensive, than the ones further up the tram line closer to the Grand Bazaar area. I would recommend a visit to Dolphinarium in Eyup, this is along the Golden horn and is perfect for visitors with children.They have amazing dolphin, whale and sea lion shows.

It was on a fairly quiet street, yet close to tram stops and some excellent restaurants. Walking to the touristy areas was quick and easy but we weren't in the thick of it. The staff was plenty helpful but impersonal compared to reviews I've read about many hotels in Sultanahmet -- however we are used to that in the states and we were fine with it. We rarely needed help anyway. I thought they had 1 of the better breakfast buffets we encountered on our trip. They had different options every few days and the fresh plums and other fruits and vegetables were excellent. Both white and wheat bread were available for toast. The smoked turkey meat was delicious! If you ask for it they'll cook an omelet for a bit more variety. The coffee and OJ are instant, but that's standard every place we stayed. They did pad the offerings with a bunch of packaged cookies/cakes (like Hostess or Little Debbie in the US) but the spread was large enough that it didn't matter and I suppose kids must like those? The rooms were fairly large for Europe. A single was a good deal and only a bit smaller than the double (though singles are darker generally, not a problem for us since we mainly used room for sleeping). Didn't use TV, but the WiFi access was the best on the trip with 2 routers on each floor. Great air conditioning system though a little cryptic to run. We never ran out of hot water and the tub was great for soaking after a long day walking up/down hills. Beds were very comfortable and the pillows were the best on the trip, with extra pillows in the room at check in. The in-room safe was easy to use and you choose the number to open it each time you use it. There was an electric kettle in room for making tea and instant coffee. Small fridge with mini-bar had room to chill a few bottles of our own water (and a small raki). There is a closet with hangers and a small dresser and some other storage in the room to keep things less cluttered, though there were no luggage racks.. This felt like a modern hotel, a little impersonal; but it did have the convenience of 2 fast elevators, wifi and clean modern room layout. We liked that. For this area I didn't see any other economical options with the same level of comfort and cleanliness in my research. Comparing this to hotels that cost twice as much (as many reviews and forum posts seem to do - referencing Swissotel or Sirkeci Konak) seems odd. One might as well compare it to hotels costing half as much - they'd be much much worse I'm sure.

Their triple room was not available, but they gave us a 'family' room; 2 beds pushed together, and a 3rd bed added. There was still plenty of floor space for suitcases and walking. Beds were quite comfortable, the AC worked well, the flat-screen TV had some English channels, and the front-desk staff was very helpful. There is wifi throughout the hotel, and a computer for anyone's use in the lobby. The breakfast buffet is plentiful and well-stocked, and the dining staff are also friendly and love to talk to anyone who wants to pick their brains about Istanbul. There is a parking garage on the premises (a huge plus if you are crazy enough to need a car in Istanbul), but I don't know if they charge for it. The best part of the hotel is the LOCATION. Istanbul is a big, bustling city. Maywood is a block off the main street with the tramline, so it is a quiet haven after a busy day. It's extremely convenient to get to - just an easy 5-minute walk from the main train station or the tram stop. All the major sights in the old town are easily walkable (or tram, if your feet are tired!) from the hotel, as are many restaurants and lots of shops. On the down side, with three of us in the room, we had to ask for more toilet paper every day! (The first day they put two rolls in the bathroom, but after that only one roll). Easy enough. Also, we learned to take quick showers or space them out, as the water totally turned off for about 1 minute by the time the third person was in there. I would recommend this hotel. The price is right, the location is perfect for touring, and it's a quiet setting in a busy city. It's clean and open, in a city that tends to be a bit on the dirty side.

My email correspondence for the reservation was with Mr Engin Evsen (the boss) as yours probably will be if you book the room electronically. I was initially somewhat nervous about providing credit card information on the web to a boutique hotel internationally but the hotel has a secure site - and I found the management to be straightforward and exceptionally honest. I needed to change the date of my reservation - all of which Mr Evsen handled without problem. We stayed for 7 nights and the location could not have been better. The hotel is located in Sirkeci which is an easy walk to all the must -see attractions. The key mode of transportation for toursits is the tram and the Gulhane Park and Sirkeci tram stops are a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel has 5 floors which gives it apersonal, boutique feel unlike the large impersonal 50 story hotels. The service is excellent, and the staff goes out of their way to accommodate special requests. The hotel is brand new - and the hardwood floors and brand new bathrooms were terrific. The bathrooms were super-clean, modern and the enclosed shower/tub area was very nice. Our kids were expecting bathrooms in Istanbul to be not-so-nice, and the hotel's bathroom area far exceeded our expectations. Mr Evsen also oversees the company's other hotel, Sapphire, but he is usually at the hotel twice a day. The staff's goal is to keep the guests happy...and tmanagement understands the value of satisfied customers. There was a sumptuous complimentary breakfast with enough varieties to please Eastern and Western tastes with lots of fresh fruit options. What I like best about Maywood Hotel is the prime location - to be honest the location is so convenient that we never needed to use public restrooms - the hotel was never more than a few minutes away from where we were. Secondly, I loved the size of Maywood Hotel. if we had stayed at a large chain hotel we would have probably have experienced an impersonal \"punch in, punch out\" type of service that is often associated with large organizations. With Maywood Hotel, we feel we got a great value; super-clean accomodations; a touch of local flavor; and, a location that just can't be beat - whether you walk or take the tram. I also REALLY appreciated the complimentary airport shuttle service. We had heard a lot of stories about cab-driver scams, and it was great to emerge from the passport line, retrieve our baggage and see a friendly and accommodating driver holding a sign with our name on it. Mr. Evsen was pro-active enough to give us a contact number if for any reason we did not see our driver - but everything worked like clockwork. Mr Evsen and his team made our stay thoroughly enjoyable.

It defines itself as boutique hotel. It truly is a cosy place with good service but the surrounding are quite ragged. If you like to be close to Bazaar district and Sultanahmet without being at the center of the tourist trap -- Maywood might be the place for you. The rooms are quite small, breakfast many-sided and front desk staff friendly -- even though only a few of them can English. The Bosphor boats are just a few blocks away, Topkapi around the corner etc. The hotel is very clean but they are not overly environmental friendly. Even though we asked not to change sheets and towels every day they did it anyhow. Anyhow we have absolutely nothing to complain.

As other customers say the staff is not helpful at all. As we arrived, we asked for a map, the man at reception pointed behind us where we could see a display stand with postcards and some maps, we had to pay 5 TL (2,5 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac) for a map that we later saw for half the price. Obvously they didn't have complimentary maps nor any kind of information. When we asked for direccions at the front desk, they had no idea and their answer was alway the same: take a taxi. As we returned to the hotel at night, we always found our safety box open, we complained at the front desk and they said thay may be batteries( ??????) were out. Crazy, isn't it? It was supposed to be wifi internet everywhere in the hotel but in fact it wasn't, not even at the lobby. All we get from the staff was \"we don't know why it doesn work\". Bedclothes were really coarse, particularly the upper sheet. Air coinditioned was very noisy, even at the minimum, therefore you had to decide between noise or heat. Breakfast was mediocre and coffee tasted terribly bad. To end, I would like to tell about someting that I found specially outrageous: the poor woman that cleaned the rooms didn't have a trolley or something similar to carry all she needed to do her job, so fresh bedclothes and all the products were on the floor, in the corridor and she had to walk up and down to get them. I suppose working conditions and worker rights are not like the UE standards but in this case it's just a matter of image and the image that customers get from Maywood hotel is really seedy.

I suspect this won't last. I don't want to send the wrong impression, this hotel is not that bad: it had the most comfortable bed we've had in our trip (2 weeks, 7 hotels), the room are small but of very high standard (it shows this hotel is new) and actually quite nice. Location is indeed great (and quiet). Mini-bar is also surprisingly affordable. Stupid detail, but I liked the fact that you can set the temperature of the room with 0.5 degree increment. Finally, it's a good value at 70 euro. But it's certainly not great. The lobby & eating area decor are uber cheesy & over the top. I'm not the Turkish design expert but I doubt this is very traditional like other TA reviewers mentioned. Service is as blend as it could be. I tried 2 classic test question: - What's my options to go to the airport? - How do I get to Bebek (Istanbul neighborhood)? All I got was: \"Taxi\"... (BTW, very easy to go to the airport with tram & metro) Breakfast is by far the worst we've had during our trip. Sorry, but either they changed the buffet or other reviewers had bad luck during their trip, but I can't see how someone could say the breakfast is great. Only one option for fresh fruit (water melon), no eggs, the biggest variety of dry & uninspiring crackers and cookies... I would be happy to land in this hotel with Hotwire.com, not so much with TripAdvisor top 5 Istanbul. It's just a bit blend, not that \"boutique\". I doubt you'll be very disappointed staying in at the Maywood hotel, but being at the end of our trip, after visiting gem hotels around Turkey, this one definitely didn't rock our world. Oh, and no roof terrace.
