We hadnt spent 5 minutes in that room when we asked for another one.. oh man! The second bedroom itself was not that bad, but the bathroom... the light and bathroom fixtures: Non existent, the toilet hadnt been cleaned in days, the shower floor and walls hadnt been brushed between mosaics so you could actually see the mold growing up there. This bedroom hadnt been dusted in days! It was late so we decided to stay just for the night... and then the fun part begun.. this hotel is located near one of the loudest corners in Playa so you can imagine how well we rested that night... The next morning we talked to one of the managers and showed her the awful conditions of the bedrooms, she was understanding but never offered any kind of apology not even the refund (or the solution to get one..) when we said we were leaving, after that we saw 2 cleaning ladies dusting and brushing the room but it was TOO LATE!. We had booked another hotel... Seriously, this is not the place to stay if you are looking for cleanliness and peaceful nights.

According to their web site, Costa del Mar said that I could cancel within 24 hours. Subsequently, later that same day, the Tropicana Casablanca notified me of a cancellation. When I went back across the street to cancel the reservation, I was told that there would be a 25% penalty, despite the fact that the reservation wasn't until Friday and this was Wednesday. Fortunately, my son, who is fluent in Spanish, talked the Mexican woman running the desk (who was polite, as was the Mexican desk clerk) into calling her superior and getting the penalty reduced to 10%. It should have been no penalty, but I figured it was worth the ten bucks and said, \"fine.\" If that had been all that happened, it would have been merely annoying. To add insult to injury, however, an older woman (probably American, but fluent in Spanish) who had been sitting in a chair with a cane was apparently affiliated with the hotel and said, \"Why did you make the reservation if you were going to cancel?\" When I gave the explanation above, she said, repeated her question in a hostile tone of voice. After a second, more brusque reply, she said sarcastically, \"Oh no, it's ok. That's fine.\" To which I replied, \"If it's fine, why did you intervene and ask me the question in the first place.\" Finally, I just walked out. She was clearly annoyed and it was clear to her that I was not happy that she had injected herself into the issue without being invited. Bottom line: There are plenty of nice hotels in Playa that are reasonable, well located, AND who won't try to scam you. The Tropicana Casablanca across the street is cheaper and much more quiet and Los Itzaes on 10th has very spacious rooms, a great quiet location, and with an excellent staff who are uniformly polite, and at least bi-lingual.

We were in room 23, lower level close to the office. Overall, we feel that this hotel is a very good value for the money.

Very tasty!! Drinks were average but the prices were good - couldn't beat the chair-side service. If you tip the waiters decently, they'll take good care of you. 5) The showers in the rooms are nice and large - very good for tall people like my finace! 6) The hotel grounds were clean and pretty. 7) Next door to the Blue Parrot - a great bar with nightly specials and nightly fire dances at 11PM - worth watching! Also has a big dance floor and nice atmosphere.....definitely one of the most popular night spots in Playa. NEGATIVES: 1) The hotel rooms do not have phones in them, and the beds are hard. 2) The noisy music from the bar lasts until 3 AM and as other have said, you can also hear the music from the Blue Parrot late into the night. Bring earplugs! 3) The A/C blocks out much of the noise, but it gets very cold in the room after a while (because you cannot regulate the temp. - A/C only has an on/off switch). I wouldn't recommend this hotel for little children because of the noise issue. 4) We were never given washclothes or hand towels - you might want to bring some from home. Also bring beach towels - they do not provide. 5) The bathrooms are small and the lighting could be better. All in all, we were very pleased with our stay. Nothing about the rooms was luxurious - BUT, once on the beach, it didn't matter. The essentials were provided and for the price, you can't beat it!
