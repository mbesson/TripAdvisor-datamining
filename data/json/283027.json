Didn't manage to make it down for breakfast (I blame the comfy beds), but luckily with Lydl selling freshly baked croissants literally across the road (at bargain prices), we didn't miss out. You're also less than 30 seconds from the nearest slightly dodgy, but friendly, coffeeshop, which is handy when you've just dumped your bags in the hotel after your flight. Also, just down the road (about a 1min walk) is the Albert Cuypstraat market which is great for buying all your souvenirs and Amsterdam-related tat at slightly cheaper prices than you would be charged in the centre. Don't be put off by the comments on the location of this hotel - it is out of the city centre yes, but it is situated on quite a quiet (and seemingly safe) street, which is the ideal retreat from the hub bub of the city centre. Perfect to come back and switch off. Plus it takes only 2 minutes to walk to the nearest tram stop from which you can get the number 7 or 10 tram which will take you through the museum district (past the Heineken experience) to Leidesplein within less than 10 minutes. Staff were also really friendly and helpful, and the rooms and linen were clean (I even brought bleach-wipes and pillowcases just in case, but had no need for them). I wouldn't say that the rooms were exactly sound-proofed, but I wasn't disturbed by any of the other guests. Only occasionally could I hear someone talking next door or walking upstairs - I brought ear plugs, but again had no need for them. All in all, it really depends on what you expect to get for your money - if you pay beer money, expect to receive beer, not champagne. I like beer, so it was fine for me :) I would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santiago", "Title": "\u201cwhat you save (if) doesn't worth all those dislikes\u201d", "Author": "Hansvg", "ReviewID": "UR127847383", "Content": "Amsterdam is a lovely city, but It was terrible because of the hotel...

Having to pay \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20 as a deposit on the TV remote and keycard is a perfectly normal way to operate a Hotel and ensure guests do not lose their hotel keycard. Although I have never encountered this sort of service anywhere else. I was travelling with 4 couples and one of them was lucky enough to have paid extra for the Garden Suite which was a fully detached property in the Hotels extensive grounds. I stayed in room 6 which was brilliant, overlooking the bustling market outside, it came complete with spacious bathroom suite and LCD TV system. The shower came with its own squegee ensuring that I could leave my room as clean and fresh as I found it. Which I thought was a brilliant touch, one which other hotel chains would be wise to emulate. After all I dont know about you, but cleaning my hotel room in a morning is the perfect way to ensure I come back to a clean room. Who needs cleaners? My bedding was of sufficiently high thread count that I felt like I was wrapped in a fine slice of parma ham. My bed was comfortable and luckily the LCD TV system extended over the bed so I could obtain maximum televisual pleasure whilst maintaining my core body heat. Breakfast was a voyage of discovery across many continents with freshly squeezed \"prime\" orange juice, delicious blue mountain coffee and fresh crisp patisserie from the local artisan baker. There was also a selection of the finest cheeses, with prime slices of Iberian cured ham and freshly picked Tomatoes which I convinced myself came from their extensive and highly cultivated Garden. In summary I have seldom been welcomed in such a fashion. staff were attentive yet not intrusive, always available, nothing was too much trouble, I arrived early for instance and they were absolutely perfectly fine with that, insisting that I leave my bags in their unattended, unlocked, breakfast room. I can honestly say you would be hard pressed to find a Hotel that offers such an amazing and at times quite astonishing levels of service and cleanliness. Amsterdam truly does not deserver this Hotel at all, I would recommend the park bench beside any of the canals before asking you to endure the Hotel Max.

We had two beds, one good and one too soft. The room as extremely small, low ceiling and one window. Actually it was almost half of Anne Franks hidden room, we've seen at the museum. But the staff was extremely helpful and friendly in every way, they made what they could to make our stay as pleasant as possible. The breakfast was ok, bread, coffee, milk, orange juice, cereal, cheese and ham. And the location was extraordinary. A quiete neighborhood, very close to the center. Walking distances from every touristic attraction in Amsterdam. So, if you can stand a bit of frustration, I really think this hotel is worth it.

Upon arrival we were at first accused of not paying for out hotel room in advance (as they could not find any receipt of payment)......we had to use to receptionist's laptop to log onto our online bank account to prove to her that we had paid them 2 months prior to our visit......she later found their payment confirmation \"filed in the wrong month\". We then had to pay 15 euros \"City Tax\" (no returnable) and a 20 euro deposit on the room key (which we did receive when we checked out). Our room was on the 3rd floor (reception however is in the basement) so carrying our bag up the narrow steep stairs was a bit knackering after our long journey to get there...but not the end of the world. Check in is at 2pm so we did initially hav 2 dump our bags in the \"breakfast room\" and return later in the day to move them into our room. At first it appears that theres not much going on in the area but if u take a minute walk round the corner you'll find a nice little market, and a few cafes and bars...Theres a Lidl right outside the hotel too...so we stocked up on pop and cheap beer (0.49 euros per can....compared to 5 euros a pint!!) and some munchies too. Once you get your bearing its quite easy to access Dam Centre from where you are. We walked everywhere for the first 3 days (taking about half an hour - ish - to get into the heart of things...maybe about 10 mins to get to the Museum areas. Did get a bit tiring after a while..so we started to use the tram which is a little confusing at first when you dont know what you're doing. Just remember to swipe your pass on the way on AND OFF the tram or your pass becomes invalid. The nearest Tram stops are Staadhauskade and Frederiksplein (about 3 mins from hotel)...I think it was Tram number 4 to get into the centre. There was a dodgy \"Coffee shop\" called Ibiza on the corner of the street by the hotel - for \"smokers\" - which was a bit scary and seemed to be full of dodgy looking blokes all the time...so if you do intend to go to a coffee shop..i would suggest you go to one nearer the centre...theres a few nicer looking ones near \"9 streets\". Yes, the room was teeny weeny - we already knew this after reading other peoples reviews...so as long as you know what to expect, you wont be too disappointed....we actually thought it was bigger than expected. We paid for a twin/double room.....take not that the beds are two single beds....as a couple, we tried to push them together however, if we lay too close the middle of them, we seemed to fall throught the middle...so maybe not such a good idea. The mattresses werent too bad, although my partner found them uncomfortable....but not very sterdy. The duvets were clean but very old n faded so could maybe do with some new ones...a little dusty under the beds though. And yes, the toilet is kind of in the shower...we found this quite funny more than anything though....although there was very little privacy when using th bathroom as the bathroom doors was a glass (not see through) screen! Shower wasnt too bad, generally had nice hot water....except for the one day i wanted to wash my hair ...and as if by magic...the water was freezing! It wasnt as noisy as we expected...although you could hear other guests talking outside the room (as they obviously dont have any respect for the other guests trying to sleep at 6 in the morning) and you didn hear beds shuffling from above and your next door neighbour elbowing the wall......still managed to get an ok nights sleep though. Breakfast was a bit crappy.....cheap sliced bread, cheap sliced cheese (like burger cheese) and cheap sliced meat, a few cereals to choose from (but warm milk)...and orange juice n coffee (kind of cold)..but we hadnt expected much anyways after reading reviews....it filled a hole anyway. Staff werent too friendly but there were a few who gave us travel advice when we asked,,,and theres loads of leaflets on things to which was useful. Overall we had a pretty great week in Dam and although the hotel was pretty basic...it didnt matter because we were out all day and only had to go back to sleep in it. Was a little expensive for how basic it was.....but was the cheapest place we could find at all in april.....this i guess was mainly due to the poor exchange rate. Everything over there is super expensive right now.. Would recommend to young couples or small groups of friends (for short stays)...not really ideal for older couples (due to all of the stairs)...and maybe not so family friendly. Not really suitable for super romantic weekends (due to single beds and not so private bathroom) but good for a laugh and giggle. As long as your not expecting anything too psoh or snazzy...it's not too bad..", "Date": "May 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo", "Title": "\u201cNo costumer care.

Also we couldn't open the window, because someone could just walk in. (since many people were passing by). One morning, a man unlocked the door of our room, without knocking or any warning. He CAME IN looking for something until I said \"hello?\" -shocked at the invasion of our privacy. He then just left the room without a word or explanation. Later, we realized this man was the receptionist at this hotel. In BOTH of our beds we found PUBIC HAIR and a USED CONDOM.

In the end we ended up having to change the sheets on the bed ourselves. The overall experience was unimaginable, and so horrific it couldn't be compared to any other hotel experience we had.

It is a 10 minute walk to Rembrandt Square and 2 minutes to the nearest tram stop. The hotel itself however leaves a lot to be desired. The room that we stayed in was about 50cm wider than the width of a double bed. There was a tiny (and I mean tiny) cubicle that housed the toilet and the shower (the toilet is in the shower) - one is unable to shut the door of the cubicle and sit on the toilet at the same time, such is it's small size. It also had a slight odour of drains. The sheet on the bed was made of terrytowelling and had a hole in it. But by far the worst thing about the room was the complete lack of any sound insulation. We could hear everything in the next room and any movement on the floor above was like a herd of elephants moving furniture around. Not great when people are returning in the early hours of the morning and it was certainly not conducive to a good night's rest. Breakfast is included but the dining room didn't have enough seating to accomodate all of the residents at the same time. We came down to breakfast and couldn't find a seat initially so we left and returned twice to check for space. When there was finally a free table available we were quite rudely informed that breakfast was over despite our protestations that we had in fact been on time but unable to physically get into the dining room. Some of the staff were helpful but one particular member was quite the reverse. To sum up, if the Hotel Max described itself as a hostel rather than a hotel and you are planning on not doing much sleeping then it's acceptable. If you however want a relaxing break with any level of comfort then do yourself a favour and stay somewhere else.

The room we booked was advertised as a double room, with TV and central heating. We had none of this. A room in the back garden (the only place people would smoke), with 4 single beds, 1 small radiator, and TV that had no ariel greeted us on arrival. Throw in a simple clothes storage (one tower with a coat hook and three small shelves) convinced us that the room could not get any worse! Read on...
