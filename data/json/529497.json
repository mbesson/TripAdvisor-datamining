The hotel is clean, but pretty far from city center. Although it's not such an inconvenient location because Berlin has trams, buses, trains (really fast and efficient public transportation). The hotel didn't provide much other than a clean bed and some heat from the cold weather. It provided breakfast for an extra fee, but we opted to eat elsewhere. I don't believe they had wi-fi. In the area of the hotel, there are some shops, supermarkets, etc. I would probably recommend a friend or family member who was visiting Berlin to check out a hotel closer to city center. Although, if they were securing a fabulously low rate for this hotel I would recommend it. Overall, it's clean and a place to sleep. What more do you need?

The hotel isn't in a central location but with Berlin's excellent public transport it is easy to get to. Get Tram M5 from Alexanderplatz to Freienwalder Strasse (approximately a 20 minute journey) and then a 2 minute walk down the street and you wil be at the hotel. If you arrive at Berlin Schoenefeld airport, the airport express train is a 20 minute or so journey to Alexanderplatz. Our double room, which was of a reasonable size,was clean and indeed was cleaned each day. It contained a desk and a TV but no mini bar. The ensuite was also of sufficient size and clean. It had a shower but no bath. Our room faced out onto the main street and thus there was some street noise from cars and trams but nothing too excessive Breakfast was in the form of a buffet with a selection of cereals, fruit, cold meat, cheese, yogurts, juice, bread and tea or coffee. Scrambled and boiled eggs were also available each day. There is a restaurant in the hotel but we didn't use it. The hotel has a bar which was reasonably priced compared to some places in Berlin. The staff in the hotel were very friendly and helpful. We paid \u00a348 per room per night including breakfast and this was very good value for Berlin. Obviously you have to pay for public transport between the hotel and the centre of the city. For this I would recommend a Berlin Welcome card which covers public transport. For a city the size of Berlin it is likely that you will need to make use of the public transport systems in order to see the sites. Thus we found the Berlin Card very useful and good value for money.", "Date": "June 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairfax, Va", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice - But a little far\u201d", "Author": "JeffCarter", "ReviewID": "UR22763698", "Content": "Booked through europeandestinations.com.

If you do stay here, don't eat nearby, eat at the hotel or go into town. Hotel is quite far from town and aiport (Taxi from airport 33 euro) but is on main tram route, only about 15 min to town and quite regular, and runs up to 2am in week.

We cannot fault them. Our room was a twin, but the two beds were joined together and crammed into an alcove under a sloping roof, a bit of a problem if you wanted the loo at night. The only windows were skylights and they opened near a noisy vent. One of the three light fittings didn't work and there was no light near the bed anyway. The bathroom was fine. The selection at breakfast was extensive although normally the only hot items were boiled and scrambled eggs. You could have anything from soused herrings to chocolate gateau. The evening meals we had on three nights were good, but you do need to book ahead on busy nights. The \"bar\" was just a couple of perches in a corner of the restaurant plus a few seats along the bar, and we didn't notice anybody stay long if they only wanted a drink. The building was once a fire station. It also appears to house a music school, some kind of youth club, and a centre for people with learning difficulties, but these were separated from the hotel. The side street at the hotel was pleasant suburbia but the main road was drab and the tram ride to the city centre (taking 20-25 minutes)could fairly be called uninspiring, although it runs every few minutes all day and evening and, less often, throughout the night. We had good value for money and felt that we were valued guests.

This hotel was a great find. We have to travel on a tight budget and require little from a hotel as we see it as simply a base from which to explore. However it would be unfair to describe this hotel as simply that. Its location is a bit remote but it is the reason this hotel is the price it is. It is, however, very easy to get to being right on the M5 tram route (small tip you buy tickets for the tram once on board; save you wasting time looking for a machine at the stop as we did! and you need change) You need to allow about 15mins to get to Alexanderplatz and from there you can reach all parts of the city. The staff at the hotel are very helpful. The breakfast was, even by European standards, fantastic and well worth paying the extra for as we ate little else all day. The rooms were warm clean and spacious enough. Overall it was a lovely hotel in a very quiet area. We would stay here again. One more tip-we felt leaving our luggage at the hotel would waste too much time on our last day and were told there was a left luggage at the main station at Alexanderplatz. These turned out to be lockers and were all taken. There was nowhere else and my poor boyfriend had to carry a 14k rucsack round all day!Either leave enough time to travel back to the hotel or do a bit more digging to find another left luggage!", "Date": "March 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Holywood Northern Ireland", "Title": "\u201cReally great hotel\u201d", "Author": "kathp1978", "ReviewID": "UR6843595", "Content": "I stayed here with my Mum for 5 nights, to see the Christmas markets.

The hotel staff are friendly and willing to help with any questions you may have. They do all speak English, but try and speak to them in German they do appreciate it. There is a bar and restaurant at the hotel which is excellent, the portions are big and the food is fantastic the fillet steak is to die for. You are on the M5 tram route at the hotel,( you can buy travel passes at reception) walk out of the hotel to the main road and turn right for the tram stop that takes you to Alexanderplatz from there you can get to anywhere in the city on the S-Bahn/U-Bahn, on foot or by tram.

There are separate beds for a double room. There is a shower, toilet and hair dryer in the room but they do not have soap or shampoo, so make sure you bring your own.

It consists of eggs, breads, cured meats, cheeses, cereals and juices (apple, orange rotate but multi-vitamin juice always there \u2013 and recommended). Parking is available if you have a car and is most likely across the hotel. As we did not rent a car, we cannot comment on charges for parking but their website states that parking is free. Some restaurants are within walking distance, as is a Laundromat if needed (be sure to read about use of these machines prior to use as all instructions are in German). There is heat but no AC, so you'll have to keep the window open in the summer. You may also want to bring ear plugs just in case to block out ambient street traffic and tram noises. There is no refrigerator in the room but an alarm clock is present. The neighborhood is in the heart of old East Berlin so make sure that if you are going anywhere to add sufficient travel time to your destination. The hotel staff also sells passes for public transportation and these can be billed to your room, although the staff prefers that you pay cash. Room rates are approx 60 USD as of early OCT 2005 (subject to exchange rates). Staff speaks English and is very helpful. Also, an internet cafe is located in the hotel but from 1200-2000 hours. This was our first trip to Berlin and this hotel was a great place to stay. The breakfast carried us through the day and this hotel is one of the best kept secrets in Berlin. If you are only sleeping at your hotel and need a place to shower, sleep and start your day, this is the best value for the couple on vacation to Berlin. Advice on how to use public transit to the hotel. Depending on which airport you use to arrive in Berlin, take the S-Bahn/U-Bahn system to Alexanderplatz. From there, take the M5 Tram towards Zingsterstrasse and exit at the Freinwalderstrasse stop. Cross the street and walk 300 meters to your right and the hotel will be on your left hand side.
