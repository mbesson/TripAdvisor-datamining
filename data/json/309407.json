The Gardenview hotel is situated in a lovely location beside the botanical gardens and zoo. I found the staff to be friendly and accomodating. Our room was very clean and had a great view. Situated within 2 minutes walking distance to a Victoria Peak tram terminal and within walking distance to local shopping. Taxi's stop and wait for fares outside this hotel day and night and there was always one available when we stepped outside. When not using the Victoria Peak tram, I advise the use of taxi's as the hill is very steep and a bit of an epic climb in the heat.", "Date": "Oct 31, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR246080568", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MOJOAustralia"}, {"Content": "Good views without hotel service The hotel is very clean and new. The rooms are average in size, perhaps even large for HK. The beds have real hard mattresses, one has to get used to them. The bathroom has shower, just big enough with modern appliances. The view from the city side rooms is very good!The place falls down in two aspects: Service: None - no room service, no currency exchange, no help with luggage. No medical assistance. The frontdesk staff speaks limited English. The breakfast room is called Guestroom and we missed it 1st morning, paying in the adjacent restaurant, which we assumed was part of the hotel. Once we had discovered the breakfast room, the breakfast was ok; mixed cooked and continental. Again no service, one has to enter the kitchen for hot water, as the staff would not assist. At 9:30am sharp somebody takes the plate from under your nose - end of breakfast time!Secondly: the location. One needs ataxi to get anywhere. Mid Levels is a nice residential area; with nothing else.The weekday price ($HK80 per night) is fair for the room, not for the service. The weekend price ($HK200 per night) is over the top!", "Date": "Aug 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR735994194", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Ingor"}, {"Content": "Location Location, Location I stayed at this hotel for 6 months... yes 6 months as part of a work project. I had one of the serviced apartments on the top floor which had not been touched since before i was born (and i am 24!).The standard rooms in the hotel are OK. They are small and compact but then most rooms in HK are since space is at a premium. The standard rooms have been updated recently and are quite modern. Despite the sub par serviced apartments the hotel is adequate for its location alone. It is the only hotel in the mid-levels and is within walking distance to Central and Admiralty. You will pay about three times the price of a standard chain hotel and well worth a try if you are not on a corporate account and are looking for a cheapish stay without fearing for your safety or valuables!", "Date": "Aug 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR366261534", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "VincentChase"}, {"Content": "Great deal for the location       Hotel is lower, rounded one overlooking lush zoo foliage", "Date": "May 1, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR555512497", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "LVinWA"}, {"Content": "Basic hotel The hotel was clean but the room was very small, dated interior and slightly worn.

Was this a political gesture? It is not known by taxi drivers by its new name, which is confusing if your flight is late and you try telling a taxi driver at 4am the name. Best to use the address. The rooms are fine though mine lacked the promised views. Well equipped though minibar limited (did not use it). The problem is the restaurant facility. The hotel does not own or manage the ground floor restaurant. For breakfast it uses a YWCA facility on the sixth floor, the ground floor restaurant is closed at this hour. The sixth floor reminds one of a UK comprehensive school cafeteria and is very limited for a three star hotel. The restaurant is linked to a much lower standard dining area with smoking tolerated. Again not suited to a three star hotel.We found the desk staff polite but no more. The information they gave us re changing money was inaccurate and wasted a lot of time trekking all over Central to change dollars. We did not find their attitude helpful to phoning the Airport Express terminal at Central to find out when we could book our luggage in either, they had not time apparently to sort out right then. We never did find out until we got to the Terminal. (We had no problem, booking in at 10.30 for a 21.30 flight to UK. Much the best way).All in all not a good experience. A separate point is that HK Island Mid Levels location is steep. Unless both of you are fit and well do not attempt to walk. No problem for me but my wife found it difficult.", "Date": "Mar 2, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR843746240", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "orangebox"}, {"Content": "great position We (family of 4) stayed in the hotel for 5 nights. Found the staff friendly. The first rooms we were given were smoking - so we asked to be moved - which they did no problem.The position of the hotel was excellent - easy access to the city centre, peak tram etc.The hotel is close to shops, botanical garden, good views of the city from the rooms. The gym looked good (though I didn't try it out) outdoor swimming pool. On the ground floor there is a restaurant and canteen (as it is connected to the YWCA) which has good food for a reasonable price.The only downside was the rooms were small and a bit shabby, but if you are out site seeing all day and only go to the hotel to sleep - then its no problem!Note: taxi drivers know it as the 'YMCA' so if you ask for the gardenview hotel - they don't know what you are talking about!", "Date": "Jan 3, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR185992672", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Loved the Gardenview Int'l hotel I stayed at the Gardenview International hotel Aug.20-30,2004 to meet my fiancee  now we are happily married.And I enjoyed my stayed there.The room is clean,receptionist are polite and the place its very convenient to Central Hongkong...", "Date": "Oct 12, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR436610970", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d309407-r20834517-Garden_View_International_House-Hong_Kong_Hong_Kong_Region.html", "HotelID": "309407", "Price": "$128"}}
