Yet again, we had a very comfortable and pleasant stay; all the comments about the hotel's staff, cleanliness, accessibility, comfort etc. are true. I have to say I think the breakfast is very good also, so maybe those who found it under par stayed on a bad day!

Being Turkish, i have stayed in many hotels in istanbul. I can honestly say that for this price, this location, you can not find a better one than this hotel. Besides, the rooms are spacious + clean + everything is new. Staff very kind and make sure you feel comfortable. The isolation of the rooms are very good for a good night sleep (which you will definitely need in istanbul).

I certainly enjoyed staying here. I will start with the positive points: - rooms : very big, it looks more like a small apartment; it has a small kitchen, a desk, a sofa and it is equiped with everything you might need to cook, to eat or to drink :); the heating is very good during the winter and overall the room looks very elegant. It is the best one we have, when compared to other even 5 star hotels. - staff: all people working at the hotel are very polite and helpful; they welcomed us very well and they were ready to help at any time with everything; - location: good located, at 15 min walk or 3 bus stations from Taksim Square - where you can take the airport bus - and Taksim area, the best one for shopping and night life. For us, the above points were very important and we really enjoyed staying here. There are as well two less pleasant things you need to know : - sleep quality : there were noises all night long, sometimes because of guest coming/leaving, but most of the times because the neighbours from the other building. - breakfast : poor, very less to chose from. But, overall, we enjoyed staying here, it was very nice and if we go back to Istanbul we will chose it again.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dar-es-salaam", "Title": "\u201cFeel at Home while istanbul\u201d", "Author": "Mtenga", "ReviewID": "UR121651604", "Content": "We planned to stay with my wife for 20 days (from 10 to 30 Nov 2011) at istanbul, and residence of our choice through internet searching was Harbiye Residence. Ooh! this residence is perfect 20 days passed like one day. The residence is so clean and nice located at very center of every thing-very near Taskim square where you can get transport to all nice(tourist) places in istanbul. The workers are so nice, charming and friendly to customers they are always there when you need them. They will even spent sometime with you telling you the nice places which you must visit if you ask them. HR's workers please keep this altitude i am sure you will get more customers than you can afford, Mr. Rama , Emre( aka JJ) and your fellows you are great keep it up. Having seen our 20 days passed like one day we add extra 5 days and hence instead of leaving 30th nov 2011 we left on 05 Dec 2011 and still we are missing the place, Hope to visit Istanbul again and stay at HR. I forget to mention about the breakfast- they have a very nice and delicious breakfast(buffet). We would recommend to any tourist who visit istanbul to have a stay at this residence ,He/She will never regret. Give it a try. For HR \"customer satisfication comes first and money later\", We wish HR all the best and tell them they are above all and they should keep on pressing the padel.

Booked on the basis of reviews from this very site, we were expecting it to be adequate at worst, but we were not expecting it to exceed our expectations by as much as it did! A ten to fifteen minute stroll (albeit uphill!) from Taksim Square, the Harbiye Residence is exceptionally clean, very comfortable and, most importantly, nice and QUIET (apart from the early prayer calls from the nearby minaret). Breakfast provided consisted of a good assortment of cheeses, cured meats, salad, fruit, nuts, cereal, choice of bread (brown/white/toasted/simit/croissant . . ), plenty of fruit juice, tea, coffee, milk, eggs and all the condiments you could wish for. The staff were extremely welcoming and accommodating, always greeting us with a smile and happy to assist with any queries we had.

I'm not sure there is much I can add to other reviews. This is a modern hotel; rooms are spacious and fitted with refrigerator and some cooking facilities; everything is very clean; a good \"continental\" breakfast spread is available each morning, with simple cooked dishes such as omelette also available. It is not possible to praise the staff too highly. Everyone is very warm and welcoming, nothing is too much trouble. They are outstanding. The hotel is not located in one of the hotspots for tourist accommodation (that is, Taksim or Sultanahmet) so there are not dozens of restaurants on the same block. However there are a few in the area, and plenty of small grocery shops that are open all hours. The location is about fifty metres down a small steep side street off a main thoroughfare - Cumhuriyet Caddesi - between Taksim and Nisantasi, near the military museum and Macka Parki, and convenient for the Istanbul Conference Centre. It's a short walk to Nisantasi, a fashionable shopping and restaurant district mostly patronised by Istanbul residents, or to the transport and tourist hub of Taksim. Touristic visitors should be aware that the HR is some distance from the main tourist sites of the Topkapi peninsula (Ayasofya, blue mosque, bazaars) - although not much further than hotels in Taksim - and should expect either to spend some time walking or on public transport, or to take the occasional inexpensive taxi ride. If you have business in the area, it's an excellent location. The one small reservation I had was that the bed was rather soft, and having a bad back, I didn't sleep as well as I do on a harder mattress.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kolhapur, India", "Title": "\u201cmuch more value for money you pay\u201d", "Author": "burandeamit", "ReviewID": "UR119901430", "Content": "we stayed at HR for five days in 24 to 28 October 2011. it is centrally placed, convenient, comfortable, neat n clean, hotel with caring staff.
