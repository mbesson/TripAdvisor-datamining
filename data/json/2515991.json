There was a mixup with my reservation but they kindly gave me the older, lower rate. The hotel was built in 1929 and besides the TV and wi-fi, (and microwave and fridge) little seems upgraded. This is kind of cool in a city dripping with history like San Francisco but I might have thought it kind of grotty elsewhere... The bathroom had those tiny hexagon tiles on the floor, which reminded me of my first apartment 40 years ago (as did the quaint wood cabinets and fittings of the kitchenette) but I could not help worrying how clean they could get it, really. Some of the grouting was a bit worrisome too. I asked for a quiet back room and I got 509 which looked into the window of the next door building, which I thought was fine, planning only to sleep here, (and there were good blinds) but my partner did not like it. Pluses: beds comfy, handy fridge and microwave (with a nicely stocked market downstairs). Decent continent breakfast included, not fancy (toast, instant oatmeal, hardboiled egg, juice, coffee/tea, apples, cookies) enough to get you out the door. The elevator is a funny antique that takes some getting used to, but you can pinch your hand in the metal gate. One caution: we found the walk up Jones street from Market 9pm at night full of very scary characters...it is not a good neighborhood.", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "goleta", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Stay -First Time in SF\u201d", "Author": "kiana m", "ReviewID": "UR128257579", "Content": "I searched tons and tons of hotels and read hundreds of reviews to finally find the Hotel Mayflower!

The Mayflower Hotel was the first of our stay at the end of March for 6 nights and we were happily looked after by all staff throughout. The room was comfortable and very spacious, with even a walk-in wardrobe and a kitchenette with fridge, microwave and a small selection of plates, cutlery, mugs and glasses. It was really good to know that we could be reasonably self-sufficient, though the hotel is so well situated that within minutes you can find wonderful restaurants whether you head West along Bush Street or East. Next door, you'll also find the Mayflower deli shop, which sells lots of groceries and has a deli counter too if you wish to make use of the microwave. Union Square is nearby too and barely a 10 minutes walk from the hotel and there you'll be really spoiled for choice. And from the hotel, you'll be also very close to the Cable Cars line on Powell Street so you'll be able to hop on if the cable car isn't too busy for $6 per trip. From Union Square, many of the hopper bus tours set off so watch out for the lines doing the downtown tour, the Golden Gate Park tour and the Golden Gate Bridge tour, all of which are well worth it. Some companies over these together, which you can cover over a period of 48 hours, at a special price. We did this and thought it was worth every penny. About the position of our room (11 I seem to remember, 1st floor and end of the corridor), it really was well situated, with even an avocado tree outside! Shame we couldn't reach the actual fruits because it was loaded! It did not face the main street and I would advise you ask for this because Bush Street can get busy. The bed was very comfortable so we slept well every night. The bathroom too was good, clean, with the basic essentials and a bath tub with a powerful shower head. When it came to breakfast, again I think it was good value for money, though staying there for 7 days, we felt it became a little bit monotonous after a while. Every morning it was either porridge or toast with jam, peanut butter or chocolate spread, or cheese slices and boiled egg, and biscuits / muffins. Still, again it was good for the overall stay and you could always choose to go out instead and sample a special American breakfast at one of the many nearby cafes. Drinks-wise, the coffee and orange juice served for breakfast were delicious. All in all, we were very pleased with it and would recommend it highly for the budget traveller. For us, the key factors for our first week in San Francisco were budget and location, and ideally a welcoming smile when we got there (our first time in the US).

If you are coming from the airport, don't confuse downtown shuttle services for 11 dollars with the hotel courtesy services for free but only for certain hotels (this may be something, which only happens to foreigners). a taxi from the airport will cost you 55 dollars.

It is an older hotel, but we expected that from reading reviews. We found it to be very clean and the staff were very friendly. Our room was plenty big enough, the closets were huge-my mother used hers as her own private dressing room. The beds were super comfortable and I liked the non-institutional looking bedding. The included breakfast was nothing fancy, but perfectly acceptable and the computers were available whenever I wished to check emails. I also really liked the old elevator and lobby area. The only negative had nothing to do with the hotel and it concerned our trip on a shuttle back to the airport. The front desk gave us a coupon (for $5 off I believe), and called a shuttle service for us. It was a very scary ride back to the airport. Unfortunately I can not remember the name of the service.

I stayed in a queen room towards the back of the hotel (the 'quieter' part of the hotel, as it did not face the street). The price was a really good deal for San Francisco and the location (you'll find that out if you do a hotel research in the downtown area). As most reviewers have stated, the room I got was very clean and well taken care of. The bathroom was immaculate and the towels were actually soft! The little 'kitchenette' area was a plus. The mini fridge worked fine. I didn't use either the dishes or microwave available. There was a huge closet which I did utilize and a little seating area which I used for my laptop. The bed and sheets were clean and comfortable. The room did get a little stuffy at times with the windows closed (you can open them) but there is a ceiling fan in the room, and I think a heater but I didn't need to use that. The carpet was also clean, the room was a good size for one person, and it was even painted with scenes on the walls and on the door. It was pretty quiet, I didn't really hear my neighbors and only very occasionally people outside the hallway. The floors creaked and I was worried that people below could hear that, but I haven't read any reviewers complain. I got a kick out of the old fashioned elevators. Also, above the lobby on the first floor there are a few computers with internet access and a printer. I did use the printer to print out my boarding pass. Some amenities that I enjoyed are the free wifi (the access was good in my room), and the breakfast in the mornings, which is okay (toast, cookies, mini scones, oatmeal, applesauce, apples, hard boiled eggs, coffee and oj). The hotel does have free parking, and I was a little disappointed that I couldn't park my car for the one night I had one because they only have twenty spots available (hey have 90 rooms) and you have to reserve it in advance on a first come first served basis which I didn't realize. The staff was very friendly and helpful and I didn't find any problems with them. I liked the location even if it wasn't just a few steps away from most major tourist attractions or transportation. But I think San Francisco is best scene and experienced by foot anyway and I didn't mind the walking (although my feet would argue differently!). There are two little markets close by, one right next door and one just across the street which I found very convenient for buying water and snacks. There's also a small pizza place close by which is okay, and a couple of laundry mats in the near vicinity. Overall, I had a really great experience at the Hotel Mayflower and I would and have recommended it to friends and would definitely stay here again if I'm in SF again.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cHighly recommended!\u201d", "Author": "Akhil S", "ReviewID": "UR118087373", "Content": "This hotel is fantastic, the location is perfect, being about a 10 min walk from downtown, chinatown, cable car meuseum and a 30 min walk from the popular Fishermans wharf area.

There were a couple of PCs available with free internet. Plus, pricing was pretty good. On the downside, we could hear a bit of noise from the window, so try to get one of the top rooms. We had to pick a 'smoker's room' and we could still smell the cigarettes (wich is fine if you're a smoker, although we were not). Also breakfast was crap, so you may avoid it. Overall, I would certainly stay again, as long as they give me a room in the top floors and provided that a non-smoker's room is free.", "Date": "December 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clanfield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cValue for money\u201d", "Author": "Doreen8", "ReviewID": "UR49401187", "Content": "This was a good hotel, fairly central location.

Regarding the bathrooms (and kitchens) - they are old but the owners seem to be retaining a lot of the original feel of the original features. There are original porcelain floor and wall tiles and design details in many instances from many many years ago. When they have had to cut into a wall to modernize, I noticed someone paid a lot of attention to carefully matching modern tiles and grout such that the average person may not notice. In my opinion, this kind of bathroom is more interesting than what you would find in any modern hotel. I like to see the patina of wear and appreciate the fine craftsmanship that set all those little porcelain tiles so many years ago. Cleanliness was not an issue. I found the rooms very clean and of good size. The street side room became quite an issue by the third day as at night the street noise started to bug me.

I was very happy with this hotel. After reading the reviews, my expectation was that the Hotel Mayflower would be an older hotel with the feel of a bed and breakfast. As I entered, I was impressed with the comfortable, friendly and personable assistance and greetings provide as I checked in and throughout my stay. Hester (front desk) is amazing but all the managers made every effort to be as helpful as possible. The room I stayed in, their 'standard', was roomy and felt extremely clean at an unbelievable price for a mid-city hotel. I had a friend visit me during my stay who went so far as to check for dust on top of some of the pipes visible in the hallway-no dust-we were impressed. Hotel Mayflower opened in 1929, but it wears it age well. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the towels clean and more plush than expected even with the raves from tripadvisor reviews. The kitchenette area, also clean and usefully appointed included provided cutlery, plates mugs, and glasses. The tub in my bathroom was deep, and all was extremely clean to the eye and touch. The walk in closet was immense; about 6 feet deep and 4 feet wide-smelling slightly musty but not prohibitively. I was surprised. I loved the features in the room that spoke to the hotel's early days, the old no longer used gaslight features on the wall, the parquet floor in the bathroom, and the arched entry from the bedroom towards the door and bathroom. The sense of a well loved and cared for hotel also is evident in the decor of the lobby and the ceiling of the lobby. Check out the elevator, which is older-style lift, I especially liked how quiet it was, no blaring beeps. Other reviews made comments about things like grout on the tub that had some minor cracking--yes, I saw it too but I have seen less than perfect grout in many of the more modern hotels I have stayed in (Hyatts included) with that problem. The continental breakfast was satisfying. I was able to make toast with a variety of toppings, and either cheese or hard boiled eggs were available for those who want more protein. The coffee was hearty and the orange juice was good (definitely not from concentrate). I especially liked that there was a baked extra, like oatmeal raisin cookies, or muffins. The food is laid out in a room furnished with simpler tables and chairs but there was a plasma television and again, the place felt friendly. The neighborhood was quiet and absolutely no problem, about two blocks from the bustle of Union Square and very close to many forms of public transportation. The room was quiet, I had my windows and fan whirring constantly because I was there during the warmer fall weather and found the arrangement comfortable. The need to open windows might be a concern for those folks who have small energetic children and they should ask questions about window height if you stay during warm weather. Just as a note to those inclined to be surprised by no air conditioning: the lack of air conditioning is common for older hotels in SF. You want air conditioning at these prices, go to a Travellodge, or pay more and go to the more modern and expensive hotels. You lose something though; it is older hotels that give a visitor a sense of place and history. I like that. If I had a laptop the internet access would have been free. I was able to use computers availible to guests. I did not use a car during my stay so I cannot speak to the parking that the Mayflower provides. I wish I had pics of the murals on every floor of the staircase or the elevator. The ones attached a few views of the room, the lobby, and the guest sitting area.

The location is fine, close to Union Square. The price is reasonable but then again the property is very old and it's not sensational value for money, just ok. The staff were all very friendly. Check in was slow but the bill was correct after the car-park charge was added so all went well there. The lobby was homely but i never received any information about the surrounding area or that 'introductory talk' you usually get, however brief. Having returned home i now have come to realise that there was a free breakfast included. I was never told my room included this. Unlike in the British Isles the breakfast is very 'continental' in US hotels. All you get is a bun and a cup of tea so it would hardly have killed them to included the breakfast for us. I thought this was a bit stingy or if it was an oversight it was a very bad one. The room was a bit troublesome. We had a good sized walk in closet and a very useful kitchette which was basic but clean. The room was a good size especially as we only had one double bed in it. Oh yes the bed. Are you extremely skinny? Grand you should be ok fitting two people in it so! It was the tiniest 'queen' i ever did see. Maybe it came from the Victorian Days when everybody was teeny. Two average people would have trouble fitting in it. No real problem, just ask for twin beds or a King. The curtains were the usual rubbish. No problem for me with sunshine however , as I was down a laneway and had a view into somebody else window of another building across . I asked for the quiet side so thats why i got that room so i didn't mind. Free wireless was a good feature if you bring your laptop. Hotels in Vegas wanted to charge this as extra so fair play to the Mayflower, they have it completely free for unlimited time. In fact the cheaper the hotels the more generous they were with wireless. The hotel is old. Very old. The lift is old. The carpark is older. It cannot accommodate big american tanks. They ask you 'is your car big'. Unfortunately our hire car company gave us a big 4x4 that we managed to scratch on the walls of this carpark even though the guy working there tried to help direct us out. And were not talking wing mirrors, were talking the body of the car, thats how tight it is. The wing mirrors have to be folded in.The driver is experienced and had been driving the car for a week. Now seriously i cannot reccommmend anybody with a car book this hotel. It is RIDICULOUS.

We had a wonderful and wouldn't have picked another hotel. A little background: my husband and have lived in big cities including Atlanta, Chicago and San Francisco. My husband lived in the Russian Hill area of San Francisco for over 2 years just a few years ago. Now for the review: the hotel was very clean, including our room. When we checked in we were given a tour by the owner's (Nancy) husband. He showed all us all the different rooms, and gave us a choice of what room we wanted. It is a good idea to do this as all the rooms are bit different and you may find one you like more than another. For example, some rooms have newer refrigerators than others, different cabinetry, etc. They are in the (slow) process of remodeling the wet bar in each room and when they are all done they will look great! Currently, most of them are quite old, but still in good condition. We really enjoyed having a mini fridge and microwave in our room and was one of the many reasons we chose the Mayflower. We also picked a room on a higher floor, as the first and second floors are more open to street noise and are also colder. Since we went in the winter, we wanted to be warmer without using the heat (to avoid stuffiness). We kept the window open most of our stay and the noise was negligible. My husband sleeps with earplugs and is an extremely light sleeper and we both slept well. The bathroom fixtures are new, with old and neat bones still in place. The entire hotel is like this really, with the lovely features that old buildings have still in place, but modernized. We found the staff very helpful and friendly for the most part. Some of the night staff were kind of disinterested, but at that point we were heading to bed and really didn't care. The breakfast that some people raved about was just so-so in our opinion. It's great that they offer it, but we weren't impressed. It's a nice continental breakfast, don't expect more than that. We didn't, and weren't disappointed because of it. Previous reviewers were not kidding about the size of the garage. It is so narrow you have to see it to believe it. Our rental ford focus barely fit, and I mean by mere centimeters. We switched cars mid way through our stay and our Toyota Corolla was a better fit, but not by much. The garage has to be opened manually, and if you come and go frequently, it can be a bit annoying to stop and get out of the car, have someone open the garage and drive it down, but it's not that bad. Especially when you consider the price, the narrowness and slight inconvenience are all worth it. Our room's walk in closet had a funky odor, but I didn't find it obnoxious or offensive. I think it's just from being closed and not often used. Just sort of stale smelling. I hung my clothes in it and they didn't absorb any of the odor. The water pressure in our room was fine, we didn't find it weak at all. The linens were clean and very homey. The neighborhood is just fine. We came and went at all hours of the day and night and encountered no issues whatsoever. The hotel is near the area aslo known as the noberloin or tendernob, a blend of one of the sketchiest areas in SF and one of the ritziest. You turn one corner and you're in sketchville, you turn another and you're surrounded by high end restaurants and hotels. But the Mayflower is closer to the Nob than the Loin. The hotel is locked at night to make sure only guests enter. We walked to Union Square, and Nob Hill and I am in not such great shape, and it was not that bad. The previous poster who complained about the distance and hills - puhlease! If you like driving everywhere, go visit a suburb. We walked up two giant hills to get to Nob Hill and survived. It was fun. The area is good. And for the price, I would say the area is great.

This past October, I traveled with a friend to San Francisco during the Canadian thanksgiving week-end and what coincided in San Francisco as Fleet week. The Blue Angels flew over the city a few times which was quite neat, although the public transit system downtown was overwhelmed, especially the cable car. Fact was, we learned that after booking our plane tickets and we were left hanging to find a decent hotel at a decent price. We're both university students in our early 20s and I'm pretty well traveled. Usually, I tend to select slightly plusher accomodation (thanks to a good job despite the student status), in the likes of Marriott, Hyatt, etc. Due to rates at 300$+ with limited availability, we booked the Mayflower for a night at 125$ for a \"Superior room\", 45$ more than their standard room, but that would apparently afford us a room higher up and with a view. Given how many people mentionned noise problems, we decided to upgrade. Bottom line, I have a good connection and we were lucky to move to the W for the last two nights. I'll break down the review in two sections, positives and negatives. POSITIVE: -True to the reviews here, Nancy, the owner, is a very nice and helpful lady. A younger Spanish speaking woman working that night was also very nice. That can't be said for the rest of the staff we encountered. -Hallway carpets looked brand new and so did he hallways in general. I agree, everything must have been painted quite recently. Room carpets looked maybe a little older but were still very clean. -Old style elevators but remodeled. -Very nice lobby, front desk and charming breakfast room with a very good continental breakfast included in the room rate, comprising breads, cereals, fruits and coffee/tea/juice/milk and finally yoghurt. -Plumbing related bathroom fixtures obviosuly brand new and no hot water problems. -Free WiFi a big plus. -Kitchenette with fridge and microwave helpful for longer stays. -Plenty of toiletries, including soap, shampoo, lotion and mouthwash. NEGATIVE: -The man who checked us in was a little sketchy and caught off guard smoking outside as we were walking in to register. They do not take credit card information at the time of reservation but will require payment at check-in rather than check-out, even when paying by credit card which I found odd. I asked to see the room first. I recommend you do the same. -Some staff members were rude, including the first gentleman who made the reservation for us over the phone. Completely disinterested. -The kitchenette's glassware was quite visibly unclean, the wine glasses in our room all had either lip gloss or fingerprints on them. -We did not think not having Air conditioning was going to be a problem early Oct. in SFO but given our room faced the sun all afternoon, it was stuffy in there. We therefore kept the window open and it was VERY noisy as a result, despite facing the back. The room did not cool down much before around 3 am when a bunch of drunks yelling woke us up.and we decided to close the window. Ceiling fan helped a bit but I get congested when sleeping with that running so shut it off in the middle of the night. -My bedspread and pillowcases had old blood stains on them. -Room cleanliness was so-so with dust clearly visible in corners and our walk-in had a stench which prevented from storing any luggage in there. -Bathroom, other than fixtures, is clean but old and the shower head as a result came right around the level of my forehead. I'm only 5'9. You can imagine my 6'3 friend had a lot of fun washing his hair in the morning. Took forever given the weak pressure. -The alleged view was pretty much non-existent, our room, despite being on the 5th floor, overlooked neighboring buildings that obstructed most of the view. -Mattresses are brand new (according to their tags) but both me and my friend found them uncomfortable due to firmness. This is more subjective though. -I would disagree the location being good or great. The neighborhood was not re-assuring at night. I would not walk there alone and I'm a guy. Not much around and pretty much everything requires a steep walk downhill or uphill, making transit use mandatory. Union Square is a good 10-15 minute walk. Bottom line, the location is O.K. Nothing more. Would I return to the Mayflower? Possibly If nothing else was available. Based on what I experienced, I can understand why people on a budget like it. It's a roof over your head with a breakfast included. I also thought the 45 additional dollars for a higher floor room was a waste of money, given the rooms lower were described on the phone as being virtually identical. The said view was non-existent and the room, just as noisy as that 80$ room probably was. I probably would have felt I got a better bang for my buck with that room type. If looking for a place to sleep that's relatively clean and safely guarded, accessible by public transit to most of SFO's attractions and cheap, the Mayflower will do it.

At the prices offered, this is a really, really good deal - with breakfast (albeit simple) thrown in too. HIghly recommended, no complaints whatsoever. Just read the other reviews. This hotel is ranked in the top 50 out of 240 hotels in SFO, including the high end pricier posher ones.

The staff were all very friendly and when we arrived they gave us a map and told us where we should head to in the city and where the nearest bus/cable stops were - they even gave us a bottle of wine from the nearby Napa Valley to take to our room! The rooms were a good size, the beds were very comfortable and although there wasn't air con there was a large ceiling fan which was more than adequate... our room had a small kitchenette with a fridge and microwave and 2 very large walk in cupboards. Breakfast was basic but more than fine for the rate we paid. Location-wise this hotel is perfect, it is in a safe area and within walking distance to all the attractions in San Francisco. This is an old building but that adds to the charm! The lift in the reception area is particularly dinky!

But it all picked up after that. The staff was very friendly, my room looked like it had been recently painted -- as did the corridors -- which is good in a building as old as this one. (The elevators are the kind that require you to open the door to get out.) My room had a small kitchenette with a tiny fridge, microwave, a sink, counter space, a couple of plates, a couple of bowls, and a fork. (Not sure what you would put in a bowl that you can eat with a fork.) No A.C., but there was a ceiling fan. That was fine. I got a room on the \"quiet\" side -- and it was, even though the Mayflower is in the heart of the city, between Union Square and Nob Hill. For those not real familiar with Nob Hill, if you're going to Grace Cathedral, be warned that the 2 blocks between the Mayflower and the Cathedral are about the steepest blocks you'll ever see. The Powell-Hyde cable car, which is good for getting around, is a quick 3 blocks away. The Mayflower offers a complimentary breakfast of sorts, which seems increasingly common in hotels/motels. Muffins, packaged cheese, coffee, bananas, orange juice, milk, cereal.... Price for 2 nights was $175 total. Absolutely no complaints, and would stay there again.

We chose the Mayflower because the picture of the lobby looked nice, it was cheap, and we had been splurging on pricier rooms for most of our trip. We checked in and went to check out our room - we we're very disappointed with everything beyond the lobby. It's like an old senior apartment building. It smelled like a nursing home and the bed looked 25 years old - with a dip in the middle of the mattress. Oh well, we'd make due I thought. We went back to the car to get our luggage and when we returned, the front door was locked. I rattled the doorknob, my husband pushed on the other side, I was going to ring the buzzer, but looked in and saw someone coming to the door. He peeked out and said \"Did you kick the door? You kicked the door. Find another motel, I don't want you here.\" And then he slammed the door. I thought it was a joke at first, or he was a crazy resident, or even that it was a scam to get our money. Turns out he was legitimately kicking us out for allegedly kicking the door. It was insane! Here we had paid for our room, and we're struggling to the door with all our luggage and IT\"S LOCKED. Do you think we could perhaps be offered some HELP from the staff for goodness sake. NO, we're locked out and then KICKED OUT ! We were dumbfounded and quite angry for being treated so rudely , but agreed we'd never dream of staying there after being treated this way anyways and so we waited for them to refund our credit card and left quietly. We SO wanted to kick the door for real on the way out! This story has a happy ending. We found a MUCH NICER hotel a few blocks away - Hotel Carlton- The staff was kind, the decor was new, everything was clean, even valet parking for only $20 more a night!", "Date": "July 12, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Mayflower", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d501344-Reviews-Hotel_Mayflower-San_Francisco_California.html", "Price": "$100 - $135*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">975 Bush Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Francisco</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">94109</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515991", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/c0/45/f3/hotel-mayflower-thumbnail.jpg"}}
