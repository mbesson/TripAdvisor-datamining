The hotel staff was very friendly. Moreover, the rooms were ok; very clean but for the rest nothing special. I would say more 3* than 4*. The hotel in general and the rooms in particular have quite a retro feeling to them, which is not necessarily bad but I think that the property would benefit from a renovation. Please be aware that this hotel is not located in the center so for this reason not ideal for tourists I would say. On the flip side the fresh air on the hill on which the hotel is located, is a welcome change to the smog and heat of Florence during the summer months.", "Date": "Sep 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR217378146", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "worldtraveler12345"}, {"Content": "A seedy and expensive hotel - Don't book a room       Room", "Date": "Aug 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR586847502", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "XASOSE"}, {"Content": "The WORST stay of my life My friend and I had a horrible experience at this hotel when we accidentally got locked in a stairwell that we thought would lead down to the lobby. After going through the unmarked, unlocked double doors outside of our room, we descended the stairs but soon realized that it lead to another part of the building that was being renovated and was completely abandoned. The doors we had come through had locked behind us, and every door and window leading to the outside world was locked. After 45 extremely stressful minutes and a phone call to Italian police, we finally got out of that place, but were shown no sympathy from the hotel staff. They ignored our request to put a sign on the double doors warning guests not use the stairwell, and they refused to pay our 12 euro cab fare to the city center even though the experience had caused us to miss our tour bus. Please don't even consider staying here.", "Date": "Jul 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR338851281", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "islagirl84"}, {"Content": "nice We stayed for two nights.

While the accommodation is clean, the location is not ideal and the hotel is in need of renovation.LOCATIONThe hotel is on a hillside, about 20 minutes walk from the centre of Florence and has secure parking. Armed with a reasonable map, we had no big problems finding the hotel.GUEST AREAS AND BREAKFASTThough there is marble and wood everywhere you look, the guest areas are in serious need of renovation. The reception is small and lounge areas equipped with worn-out sofas, which appeared to be dirty. The breakfast room could be spectacular, but instead is home to peeling paint and looks out onto an overgrown garden. The breakfast itself is adequate, with fresh bread, but overall was basic by standards of other hotels I have stayed in in Italy. For instance, there was no hot food or fresh fruit. There is a top-floor terrace with great views over the city, but the only bar is on the ground floor, so you have to carry up drinks yourself. When we were there, the bar had run out of beer.ROOMSFor our group, we had booked one single, one double and one triple. All were small, with narrow beds and thin, hard mattresses. Each had an en suite with shower (no bath), though in the triple room the bracket to hold the shower head was broken, so it was not possible to shower without holding up the shower head. The single room was very small, with its small bed against one of the walls. The triple room was actually identical to the double, but with a camp bed placed below (and touching) the two permanent beds - therefore pretty inadequate for three adults. All three rooms had a small TV with a mixture of cable channels, including MTV. All rooms were air conditioned, which worked effectively, especially given it was very hot in Forence in July. SImilarly to the guest areas, the decor in the rooms was tired and in need of an update. However, aside from the odd cobweb in the corners of the ceiling, the rooms were clean and the bed linen freshly laundered.OVERALLUnless you happen to get a fantastic rate, my advice is not to book to stay at this hotel. If considered as a reasonable 1-2 star hotel, then you would have correct expectations. However, the Hotel President, certainly should not be bracketed with some of the grander four star establishments elsewhere in Florence.", "Date": "Aug 6, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR467428791", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "jrucemetcalfe"}, {"Content": "Hotel President is Tatty and miles awy from the sights I was completely unimpressed with the Hotel President. Lastminute stated that Italian 3* Hotels are always betterthan you expectThe hotel is a 25 minute taxi drive from the centre of Florence during the day and about 10 minutes in the middle of the night.Well this was four star, supposedly, was very run down and the taxi driver from the airport to the hotel kept having to ask for directions.The staff were pleasant enough, the beds in the twin rooms were virtually camp beds with narrow, thin matresses, the TV didn't work and the room was tiny and damp.There was no bath and no natural light into the shower room - it was ill equipped and the hotel was empty - I believe this the reason for the appearance on lastminute.The view was of a school playground.I should imagine that in its pomp, it was a stunning hotel - now it's not. We left the hotel after one night and stayed at the Grand Hotel Baglioni, which is more expensive, is a proper four star, very smart and right in the centre of Florence and definitely worth the moneyDespite the staff, the hotel is unkempt, tatty, miles away from the sites, quiet and in need of improvements all round.
