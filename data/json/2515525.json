The next day we moved to a king bed room on the front side facing the highway, which really wasn't a big deal. You could hear the highway noise, but unless an emergency vehicle with sirens blarring went by (which only happened once), we really didn't notice the noise. Yes the location is congested, be easy enough to maneuver. We walked to the trolley station located on the far side of the mall and didn't have any problem - all intersections have crosswalks, area seemed safe enough. The room was clean, maid service was great, (and seemed shocked when we told her she didn't need to clean our room one day), coffee maker in the room and fridge in the king room. I only gave this hotel an average rating because the most annoying thing to us was that they charged you daily to use internet service in your room, or you could sit in the lobby and use the wi-fi for free! Sitting in the lobby didn't bother us, so we did. They also have an office set up with computers and a printer that you can use free of charge, which was helpful the few times we needed to print a document. Overall our stay was nice.

There was so much chlorine in the water that I had to wash my hair twice after swimming to get it out. The lobby area is attractive, and the Christmas tree was tastefully decorated. In terms of value for money, the Hilton does not offer free wi-fi or breakfast, and it charges an outrageous $16 per night for parking despite its suburban location. Do yourself a favor and park on the street for free to keep costs down.

Reservation was made through my company's travel department. Check-in was quick and was given a room on the Executive floor. This hotel does not have an Executive lounge, so was given breakfast coupons as well as appetizer/drinks coupons. The room was a corner room but small. It was cold when I walked into the room at 6:30 in the evening. By 10:00, the thermostat refused to go above 64F even though I had bumped it to 75F!!! Finally called the front desk to find out if I was doing something wrong. They sent an engineer (after two calls) who came in with all his tools, took down the vent cover and spent the next 10-15 minutes fixing whatever was wrong. Thankfully the heater came on and I did not have to change rooms. Next morning there was no hot water in the shower. Considering that I was in town on business, I did not want to waste time. So after a cold shower in December, went down for breakfast. And then I had the worst experience - hair in my bowl of freshly cut strawberries. Over the last six years I have stayed exclusively at Hilton properties all over the world and this has never happened to me. It was absolutely disgusting. I went to the front desk in order to notify someone of all the issues that I was having. The gentleman showed no interest in listening to what I had to say - instead he handed me one of the standard Hilton Compliment cards/form. When I expressed my surprise, he said - \"Compliments or complaints - all in the same form\". Filled it out and dropped it off at the front desk. No one contacted me during the day. Next morning, received another \"we aim to be the best and want to get a 10 on the survey\" form from manager. It specifically said that if I had problems, I should contact him PRIOR to check-out. I wrote my email address on the form along with a brief note stating that I had submitted a complaint form and dropped it off at the desk. Checked out several hours after that and still did not hear back from the manager. The strange thing is that I did not receive any \"survey\" from the property either. Which makes me think that the staff reads the comments but they don't care. Anyways, there are several other Hilton properties in San Diego with better locations and better service. Please read the other reviews on Tripadvisor before making a reservation at this hotel and use this hotel only as a last resort.

What makes this place rough to deal with is NO WINDOWS open, the door is air-tight probably for noise reasons, and their \"heater/AC\" pumps in the whiff of burnt kitchen, cigarettes, and whatever other smells. Your skin wakes up dry, and your throat chapped. You will find yourself heaving for air. I have experienced this slightly at other properties, but this has been the worst air-tight-smothering-heaving-for-air experience ever. Such a shame because San Diego is so wonderful and breezy. I know hotels have liability for kids dangling out the windows, but many properties will at least let a guest open the window 2 or 3 inches. I could only imagine a couple getting busy in the sheets what it would be like without air. What a bad idea whoever designed this! Several times we would have to open up the door and try to get fresh oxygen from the hallway. We are in our late 20's and early 30's mind you, not elderly! Such a shame! SOGGY BOUNCY beds!

I have done this for several years and the Mission Valley Hilton used to be my choice hotel due to its convenient location to Qualcomm Stadium. I must say though, that the hotel has declined significantly over the last year or so. The little amenities they used to offer such as the refreshing fruit-filled water, free parking, kiosks to print boarding passes, and the free seafood appetizers were what made the hotel stand out from the others for me. However, since they have discontinued all of those amenities I find that there is nothing drawing me back to this hotel. The \"superior\" rooms consist of nothing more than a bathroom scale and sometimes a refrigerator (which I find annoying because of the constant humming they emanate). The front desk service is passable at best and I always have to remind the staff of what amenities need to be included for HH Diamond members. I have begun staying at the Doubletree in Mission Valley, which is just as convenient to Qualcomm Stadium, and their staff are amazing. The renovated rooms at the Doubletree are beautiful, and although they also charge for parking you can find ample free street parking surrounding the hotel. Given the choice, I would highly recommend staying at the Doubletree over the Mission Valley Hilton. The service, location, rooms, and amenities far exceed the MVH. I find nothing about the MVH that makes it stand out any longer. If you're looking for an average hotel at an above-average price then you will be fine at this hotel.

The restaurant food was average and service was a bit slow (room service was actually faster) but that didn't bother me because there are lots of great restaurants nearby. The Hilton gift shop was a pleasant surprise. It carried a lot of things I didn't expect and has a friendly staff. The business center was adequate. I was able to print documents, make copies and send a fax. There is also a Kinko's about three miles away (for color copies). There is a daily charge for internet. I did not try the pool or fitness center, so I cannot comment on those amenities. The front desk recommended valet parking. I used my car twice during my stay. The first time, I was in and out without a hitch. The second time they couldn't find my car keys. It took them more than 30 minutes to finally locate my keys, but I did not complain. I didn't use my car again until I checked out. I was due to check out Wednesday morning, but decided to leave late Tuesday night instead. I packed my car and was happy to be returning home. As I began to drive away, I noticed that my seat and steering wheel had been moved - not a big deal. Then I saw that my radio was tuned to Sirius (which I had cancelled). It was dark and I was having trouble seeing. Then I realized my automatic lights had been shut off. There I was driving on Route 15 at night in traffic without lights. Why would someone do that?

I stayed with some friends and attended Comic Con. This hotel was terrific. The service was friendly and prompt. They don't have refrigerators in the room, but for $10 per day, you can rent one. No problem. The only issue I had with the hotel was their internet service. I have 3G, and I turned my WiFi off, so why couldn't I use my internet in the hotel? I was paying for the internet through my server, not the Hilton, so I should have been able to use it no problem. It was a problem. The first few nights I was able to log onto my phone and surf the net, check Facebook, etc. but after that, I kept getting the Hilton homepage where I would have to pay for internet. Why? I turned off my WiFi. I pay for my own internet. It was like they were interfering with my internet so I would have to pay for their WiFi. Other than that, the hotel was great. We booked through the Comic Con hotel reservations, and so we didn't get so lucky with the location. If you are going to Sea World, this is the hotel to get. And the location is perfect for airport transfer. Although we got lost on the way to the airport....shoddy GPS kept leading us to the Area 51 looking section of the airport. Hmmm. But if you are looking for a hotel for next year's Comic Con, or anything else near the convention center or Gaslamp district, this is not your hotel. It was 1/2 hour to 45 minutes to get to the Convention each day. All in all, the hotel was very good.

Self-parking at this hotel is $14 a night. The bathroom was clean and big enough but the toilet was tipped to the side which made everyone feel like they were falling off of it. The bathroom also had a pocket door which was very noisy and hard to open and close. The beds are double beds. The sheets and mattress were fine, but with the beds being so small it was hard to get comfortable. The room had a flat screen tv, but everything else was pretty dated. The room appeared clean enough with the exception of several fairly large red stains on the carpet. I didn't bother to look close enough to try and figure out what it was. As mentioned in other reviews, the walls are extremely thin. We could hear even the slightest sounds coming from the other rooms. We stayed on the side away from the freeway so we didn't hear any freeway noise. The a/c didn't work too well, so the room was pretty warm most of the time. Housekeeping did bring us extra towels quickly when we requested them, but when we came back to the room after they had cleaned, they left the toilet paper roll bar on the sink with no toilet paper anywhere to be found. The first night we all wanted to go to sleep early as we were getting up early the next day. We heard very loud music, but figured it would end soon. It didn't. At 11:00 pm my husband finally went down to the lobby to complain. Turns out that the hotel had rented out a ballroom on the first floor to a very large Salsa party group. We were on the 8th floor and couldn't believe how loud it was. The front desk apologized but told him the party would be going until 1:00 am. When he got back to the room and told me what was going on, I called down to the lobby myself to complain and I was told that the party group rented a room just like we did so they could do what they wished. I was also told that I could check out if it bothered me. With 2 kids at 11:30 at night, that is not an option. Since I had used Priceline the only comp I could get was parking so I asked for that, the employee comped the parking and then hung up on me.

Also, as a Hilton Silver member I was treated to a free appetizer in the restaurant - we ordered the nachos and this turned out to be large enough to a single meal for two to share! (of course, we were visiting from Europe where meals are universally smaller, so perhaps the nachos would function as just an appetiser to a large American). Parking fees are stiff and the Hilton should be ashamed of itself for charging so much but that is the only major negative.

The room looked nice enough at first glance...it had clearly been recently renovated, with the only pre-renovation residue being the aging tile work in the shower. But this Hilton isn't in the same league as its sister hotels downtown and near SeaWorld. For starters, even though our room was on the 12th floor, the roar from the freeway outside was constant and overbearing, even in the middle of the night. Upon closer inspection, the culprit is the windows themselves....I've never seen windows that thin in a hotel or even a private home...they're about half as thick as standard single-pane glass. But noise isn't the only thing that gets in...the drapes do virtually nothing to block light from entering the room (see attached pic), which made falling asleep rather difficult. Light and sound also enters the room thru the thin interior walls (the sounds of showers and sinks upstairs occasionally drowned out the traffic noise) and thru the door to the room itself, which had a gap large enough for a finger. Noise wasn't my only gripe, however...the water pressure in our room was awful, the food at the breakfast buffet was so bad (even for a freebie) we went elsewhere after our first morning, and the 12th floor hallway reeked of cigarette smoke.

Was not informed that the executive lounge is *permanently* shut until arrival (there was NO mention of this on the web site, or I would not have selected this hotel). Received upgrade to exec floor, but, really, big whoop. Gave us coupons for a free appetizer at the sports bar (in lieu of the exec lounge perqs), but I frankly don't equate a sports bar appetizer as quite the same thing... Worse, the executive level rooms had recent water damage visible on the ceiling from the recent rains. When I checked in, I was told that they would block a MANDATORY $50 PER DAY for incidentals from my card -- really, there isn't $50 a day worth of ANYTHING at this hotel. Getting more and more frustrated with \"meh\" service/amenities and lack of real Diamond perqs here, so wanted to call and move to the Doubletree right across the freeway. Cell phone dead, didn't want to incur huge phone charges, so I went downstairs. No phone in lobby, business center or even by the meeting rooms. Asked front desk, and they said if I wanted to call I'd have to go to the CONVENIENCE STORE NEXT DOOR, that was the nearest public phone. That was IT! We moved out an hour after check-in, very unhappy with this property. The funny thing was they tried to explain, \"Well, if it was a local call, we could have let you done it from here.\" Well, yeah, um, I really don't think they would have wanted their other guests to hear what I had to say during that call, frankly... anyway the Doubletree welcomed us with open happy arms WITH a wonderful executive lounge, WITH expanded breakfast buffet and lovely exec lounge evening service (food & drink), WITH a nicely upgraded room, WITH warm cookies, and WITH a quiet elegant bar, outdoor firepit and lovely personnel. THAT is Diamond treatment I'm used to! The only good thing I have to say about the Hilton Mission Valley is that the manager \"Amy\" facilitated the quick resolution of the block off my credit (not debit) card, which was STILL on hold 3 days after I arrived, which I think is ridiculous.

I went back down to the front desk to ask why my room had been changed, not to mention that the agent never informed me of this change when I checked in and proceeded up to the floor I thought I was on.

He stated that my original room was available and gave me new keys to that room. Room - Very average/basic - especially for a room on the executive floor. Very small, old out dated furniture.

Luckily, on this trip I was traveling for leisure. The parking fee is kind of ridiculous as well. I understand that parking is at a premium, but why not just have a reader at the barrier that reads your room key and raises the barrier if you are a guest? Making guests pay outrageous fees for parking is not the way to show that you are looking out for guests and creating a good relationship. I booked through Priceline, so the parking was ok, but if I had to pay full price I wouldn't book. The rooms are ok. In fact they are pretty nice, with nice beds. Our shower also had pressure that changed many times throughout the course of a shower. The temperature seemed to change in response to the pressure changes. The staff at the front desk was EXCELLENT. This is the biggest and best feature of this hotel. In a way this makes almost any negative forgettable. Hotel managers did you read those last three sentences? Please take note, service is the most important part of any hotel (I should know I spend half a year, each year, in a hotel). This hotel doesn't have the best location, but it is bearable. Unless, you really like Denny's, don't expect to walk to eat out many times. This hotel is a solid choice for the price, if you can get a discount. Even at full price, it is competitive in the region. There are many better hotels on the waterfront, but they are very high priced. This is relatively close to most things, is bearable, has a nice look and a good staff. It is a good choice for those with a car, and who want a basic, but nice hotel.", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cHIgh hopes followed by frustration, but a happy ending\u201d", "Author": "hobo6", "ReviewID": "UR22105418", "Content": "My wife and I live only about a mile or two from this hotel. My wife chose this hotel to be the place to stay the night before our wedding, the location to prepare herself for the wedding, and hotel to spend our first married night together. The whole experience did not begin or transpire well until the end. We made the mistake of waiting until two weeks before the wedding to actually view our room. We were very disappointed with the size of the room. Not only would it be cramped for two people, but there was no way she could have her bridal party and hairdresser in the room, much less have space to hang her wedding dress. The only larger room would be the presidential suite or joining rooms. The presidential suite was huge, however it had a queen sized murphy bed. We choose the presidential suite. The staff at the front desk were not sure if we could change our room to the presidential suite since we had reserved the room through Travelocity. As a result we had to call back the next day. The manager said it would be no problem. However, it would cost us an addition $50 a day. We took the new room. My bride to be returned to her room the night before the wedding to find the TV remote not working. Someone came up with new batteries. She always reads in bed before she goes to sleep to relax herself. Before getting into bed she realized the light bulbs above the Murphy Bed were out. Again, someone came to replace the bulbs. Prior to getting into bed she knelt down to pray and was disgusted when she found the sheets to be dirty and look like their were a couple of bugs. This is when I received a frantic call at about 12am the morning before we were to be wed. She said she could not sleep in the room with the bed the way it was and that they were going to move all of her stuff to another presidential suite on another floor. I said that was ridiculous. I suggested the management open the attached room to the presidential suite to us at no extra cost. They obliged. When we returned from our wedding reception we were greeted with a bottle of champaign and chocolate covered strawberries as a gesture of regret by the hotel. I thought it was a nice touch. The following morning we ordered room service. We ordered tea, berries and cream, along with a couple of crossaints. We had to call room service back when we discovered they gave us coffee and forgot the cream to go with the berries. Lastly, we received the bill and were charged for an additional night of parking. When we checked we were not charged for the additional room, for no parking, nor our room service breakfast. Although things did not go according to plan, in the end, as a result of the staff, everything worked out. We had a larger room than we could have imagined and a wonderful wedding. I also want to add that guests of our wedding also stayed at the hotel and had an enjoyable stay.

The indifferent desk clerk did not acknowledge our Hilton Honors membership nor offer any amenities. I don't believe we even got a newspaper! While the room was comfortable, hardly anyone was staying at the hotel yet they apparently crammed us all into one corridor so we heard screaming children all night long. I guess the placement of people is for the convenience of the cleaning staff. Anyhow, bored by the hotel and its lack of charm, we checked out after two days and went to a small, family owned property which we enjoyed much more. Then, to top it all off, the Hilton charged my credit card for the whole proposed stay (7 nights), even though we checked out after 2.

I wanted to be relatively close to El Cajon, where she and her husband live. The Hilton is right off the I-8 Expressway, so that was great. Also, there is a large shopping area directly across the street, which came in handy for various items. There is a bookstore, Gordon Biersch Brewery, liquor store, West Elm, and a Westfield mall (which is actually more like an outdoor flea market, and PACKED with aimless kids). It did have a Target and lots of other places, but looked rather grubby, what I saw of it. The Hilton had a spacious lobby, check-in was a breeze, and the room was spacious and comfortable. I had a panoramic view of the highway and shopping across it. The bed was very comfortable, and the internet worked. The toiletries were Crabtree and Evelyn La Source, and smelled wonderful. The bathroom itself was a little dark, but they did have a lighted makeup mirror, which was a nice touch. For dinner, I tried room service, but wasn't that impressed with my Cuban sandwich. It seemed a little dry. The dessert special was a blueberry bread puddng that was pretty good. I even got a call from the staff asking if I'd enjoyed it and if it was OK, which was new. I'd never had that type of customer service before, and appreciated it. The parking garage is over to one side of the hotel, and was a little small, which made it hard to maneuver larger cars (I had rented a Dodge Avenger). I also found it a little difficult to get in and out of. The stairway was very far to one side, and the ramp going in was quite steep. I try to walk direct routes so as not to get too tired (because my legs can get weak), so it was a little inconvenient. There was a reception of some kind the one evening I came back to the hotel after shopping, and I thought, \"Oh great. I'm going to hear that all night.\" I wasn't as worried about the event itself as the party-goers who might be staying at the hotel being loud and disturbing everyone else, but it turns out there was no need for worry. I didn't hear a thing. The layout of the restaurant/bar was confusing if you're coming in from the back bar part of the hotel near the elevators instead of the front entrance. The restaurant entrance is all the way to the other side from the elevators. I came down for breakfast one morning and was very droopy from staying up and watching a late night movie. The restaurant staff stood and watched me a for a few moments, and I finally figured out how to get over to where the food was. THEN they said something like \"Over here.\" They might want to put up signage in the morning if you go in the wrong door so you don't feel like a fool.

First the positives: - Good size rooms, nicely furnished, great beds. - Good location (just a few miles from all of the major attractions and is right across the street from lots of food and shopping). - Rock bottom price through Priceline bidding process (if I was basing the review on the price I got I would easily give it the top 5 of 5 rating, my 4 of 5 rating is purposely leaving price out as a factor in order to give a fair rating). - Great service... the front desk people were fantastic and they were very receptive to all of my requests and needs (some times when you get a room through Priceline or Hotwire you end up not getting quite the same level of service from the hotel that you would otherwise). Neutral: - Pool and spa were small, but serviceable and had long hours. - Styling in the rooms was a little dated, but nicely maintained with lots of quality touches (I imagine the renovated rooms must be extremely nice). Negatives: - Parking was tight and the parking elevators were out of service. In fairness they did offer valet parking at no additional charge though because of the elevator situation. The $12/night seemed unnecessary for the hotel circle area (I would expect it downtown, but not here). On the other hand after having recently paid: $22 in Arlington VA (outside of Washington DC), $29 in Toronto, $39 in Chicago, and $47 in New York City the $12 here didn't seem quite so bad. - Once an hour or so the A/C unit would make a noticeable \"thumping\" sound. Wasn't so bad that we lost any sleep though.
