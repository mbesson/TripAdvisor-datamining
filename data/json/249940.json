The room looked liked something out of a horror movie, The paint on the walls were pale pink, the carpet was just as dreary and the ceiling had water stains so bad that the kids screamed to be changed to another room. I called the front desk to explain the condition of the room and was told they could move me for one night but I would have to come back to the room the next day. I couldn\u2019t really see the reasoning for that and as I was residing to put up with the hole in the wall I rented for a week, front desk sent maintenance up to survey the room. Once they got a look and smell I was moved to a new room but guess my shock when the new room mirrored the old room. I knew then that this was all the motel had to offer so why complain. I booked this trip as part of my son\u2019s 12th birthday present and I was honestly expecting a nice little room that stood close to the beach at least that\u2019s what the reviews described. I read reviews expecting to get the skinny on a place before I book and for the most part reviews are helpful but I\u2019m finding it truer that places with Inn or Motel have very low quality despite some reviews exclaiming it\u2019s nice for the price. According to the reviews for the Flamingo it\u2019s a nice place for kids, it has an heated indoor pool, and the rooms are suitable for the price however, The design of the place is extremely flawed nothing is connected, the pool is indoor but not heated plus it\u2019s a long walk across a public parking lot to get to it and of course the rooms are disgusting.

The ground around the pool was covered in sand as well as the pool covered with sand on the bottom. The tables had food left over on them and the showers outside were just nasty.

The best recommendation I can give about this property is that the staff is excellent. They are attentive, patient and ever watchful, which was important as I was traveling solo. I felt totally safe and secure, whatever activity I was engaged in. I liked the Samsung flat screen TV, even tho I didn't use it much. Some hotels/motels have cruddy TVs...The Flamingo isn't one of them! I found the room to be very clean except the carpet and I'm just being a realist. I'm visiting at the end of the season, of course the carpets are going to be in bad shape. I'm betting most of the OC hotels are by and large the same way. Some have said that the bathroom was too small but I thought it was just fine. It took a couple of minutes to get hot water...but I got it. The fridge worked well, plenty of drawer space and hangers in the closet. Understand that there was only one of me...I didn't have to share. But this would not have been a problem if I was sharing. The balcony is essential for me, if for nothing else, to hang my beach towel. I had a room in the 1st tower, no ocean view...except when I was on my balcony I did have an ocean view! Yay! Great that there was both an indoor and an outdoor pool. I also appreciated being able to use a changing room after checking out (cause I wasn't finished using the beach yet!). BTW the walk to the beach is a snap. It had a restroom and shower area, only soap available. But I think they would have given a towel had I needed one and anything else as they are so nice. The best feature for me is that this hotel is near the beach & boardwalk but not on the boardwalk. I ate out twice during my stay and can recommend both restaurants. Mother's Cantina on 28th and Philadelphia had great nachos and nice, cold beer. But my favorite was the Satalite Cafe on 24th St and the boardwalk (look for the Howard Johnson's). My waitress was fantastic, the prices very low and they serve the best patty melt I've ever had, for $5.99!

It is was so convenient having the indoor pool directly beneath us and our car was parked nearby. The indoor pool was clean but had a fair amount of sand at the bottom--which we probably contributed to. Just a short walk up the street to the beach. We also loved the location--not directly on the boardwalk but close to it, and also not too far down so we were close to many restaurants and amusements. Jolly Rogers is nearby and some great restaurants. My only complaints are that there was not an outdoor shower directly at Tower II and there was not a free ice machine on our floor, we had to go up to the 3rd floor for ice and you had to pay for it.

The suite had a microwave, smaller fridge, toaster and coffee pot, but bring your own coffee and condiments (I put mine in a ziplock with the measuring cup). We had an ocean view, however the motel is not beach front, so no seeing the sunrise from here. Still....could walk the 100 feet to the beach and see it and also sit on the private balcony and listen & watch the waves crashing in. The motel was quiet through and through.

I asked the Manager to give us a 1/2 hr to an hour to gather our stuff for the move. He told me that we needed to hurry up and get our stuff for the move to another room. After going to the office to complain about the inconvenience, another hotel staff member gave us an additional 10% room discount and some free coupons for breakfast and mini golf. Even though the room appeared to be clean, the sheets and blanket, on one of the beds, were stained with what appeared to be dried blood. In addition, the bathroom needed to be cleaned better (dried toothpaste on the wall and a dirty tile floor). Lastly the safety door latch was not completely screwed into the door and was cracked. I have stayed at the Flamingo, in the past, and never had these problems (about four years ago). I guess their focus on room maintenance and cleaniness has disminished over the years. Most other hotels will provide in room irons and ironing boards. At the Flamingo, you will need to borrow them from the front desk. In addition, they do not provide complimentary shampoo.

The room was small, but just fine for us. It had two double beds, so the girls had one and I had the other. The bathroom was also small, but more importantly, it was very clean. I noticed some people wrote the towels were too small - we had no problem with that. They were regular-size bath towels; same as you get anywhere else. I did have trouble with the temperature fluctuation in the shower, but I figured out that if you turn on cold first, then add just a tiny bit of the hot, it gets to a comfortable temperature with no problems. It was a little noisy at night, but it was beach week for seniors, so we expected some of that. Once I got to sleep, though, it was fine. One of the best amenities was that we were allowed to use the pool and shower room facilities after check-out. That added extra fun and time to our stay. The pool was clean and crystal clear.

While it is not a luxury hotel, it is priced very well for the peak season in OC, is very well located, and is generally a pretty decent place to stay. We had a room in Tower 2. I was hoping to get a full kitchenette, with a cooktop, but we ended up with just a fridge and microwave. For the most part, that was good enough to throw together some cheap lunches and keep our water/juice cold to take to the beach. The room itself was clean and quiet, had most everything we needed, and had a small balcony with an ocean view. I liked that we also had a small sofa and wireless internet. The indoor pool in Tower 2, was a nice place to dip into on our way back from the beach. Overall, we got everything we needed from the hotel-- we weren't pampered, but, seeing as this motel is cheaper than most other beach hotels, we weren't expecting anything luxurious. Ocean City tends to have quite a few fleabag hotel/motels, so going \"on the cheap\" can be fairly unpleasant if you pick the wrong place. It's nice to know that there is a reasonably priced decent place to stay near the beach in OC. The location of this motel is very good. It's a short bus ride to the boardwalk, and the amusement park across the street made my 3-year-old very happy. The beach itself is just a few minutes' walk away and there are some pretty decent restaurants within walking distance.

We paid alittle extra for the ocean view and it was well worth it even though the SeaCove building is right infront of you. The motel is set in pink as its namesake and there are little details of flamingos from the paintings on the walls of a very nice and very clean indoor pool area that I may add has separate mens and womens changing room areas which is a plus if you're not quite checked in and waiting around to get into your room. To the hotel stationary next to a fully operational phone,there are small touches of the pink bird everywhere. The clerks at the desk were short and curt during our stay, but then again, everyone has their 'off' sort of days and all you can do is shrug that sort of thing off. The cleaning staff were absolutely wonderful,they kept the rooms spotless and whenever you needed clean towels they were supplied. The room was a nice sized, the bathroom was leaky and needed updating and the towels were alittle too small. But we were supplied with clean fresh ones when we needed some. So be sure if you're the type whom like big cozy towels, bring your own from home. The refrigerator was well running,the TV worked fine and I really get a kick out of the 'Tourist Station\" the AC had a cool and warm components if it gets alittle chilly in the room at night. I loved the private balconies where you could sit out at night with a nice tasty alcoholic beverage and listen to the waves and watch the sand cleaning machines sweep over the beach. Elevators were a nice addition,they come in handy from dragging heavy luggage up and down floors or you were simply too tired to hike steps from walking the boardwalk all day. The Luggage carts helped too. Outdoor pool was nice and clean lots of chairs and we noticed there was a pool guy constantly checking the ph levels which is a good sign. The beach is a meer few steps away and we could see how full the beach was during the day and the added bonus was watching the dolphins and porpoises frolicking in the waves. If you don't mind walking, the beginning of the boardwalk is only a few blocks up and you can grab a Boardwalk Tram for the rest of the trip up the boardwalk for a few bucks-I think 2.75 during the weekday and 3.00 for the weekend. Lots of places nearby to eat, but look out for Higgins Crabhouse across the street,they're expensive and don't really surpass in the cleanliness factor. The Pirates Den makes great breakfasts.
