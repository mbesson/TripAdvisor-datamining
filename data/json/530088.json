{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Business Hotel ONLY!! We did not enjoy our stay at this hotel. It was the only hotel in Italy that did not over a continental breakfast, and it was not close to any restaurants that you could walk to. We walked to the gas station down the street for our breakfast every morning. The shuttle was more of an inconvienence with one of the drivers as if you are 1 minute late, you will not be on that shuttle. He was rude!! The hotel was ok, but I would never stay there again as it is too far from the town of Florence and the airport is not that far from the middle of town. I do not recommend this to anyone except the business groups who are meeting there.", "Date": "Jun 17, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR881017274", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Great deal, however.... Initially, the front desk was respectful and helpful....but soon their English faded and so did the smiles....rudeness set in, as is normal in Florence....the exception was two of the shuttle drivers...one was Mr. Autista Donato, who was very friendly, pleasant, and helpful, even tho he did not speak a word of English. He was one of the few friendly locals I came in contact with during a week stay in the town. The room was ok, and the shuttle was actually quite cheap when compared with the taxi cabs.", "Date": "Feb 17, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR474920189", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d530088-r3573119-Holiday_Inn_Florence_North-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "530088", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
