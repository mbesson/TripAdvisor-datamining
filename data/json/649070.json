But i wasnt disturbed by any noice from the nightclubs on the ground floor. The staff were not all that cordial. Neither were they well informed about the details of the city.

Venue: Deira Town Hotel, Deira, Dubai, UAE. This hotel has friendly staff, the hotel is comfortable and bedroom was clean however the bathroom was very tired with black mildew around the inside of the shower cubicle which had only one door. There are 2 nightclubs on ground floor which ends at 3am so you need to be on the 4th floor. The staff are helpful as long as you ask the questions, if you don't they will not volunteer the information eg If you require a taxi do not stand at front of hotel expecting one to stop however you can use the hotel telephone in reception to ring for one but it took two days of standing for an hour outside the hotel before i asked the staff what to do. The food in the restaurant is only ok. When organising excursions either book in UK or in local agents do not use hotel travel desk as the price is almost double. I booked through an agent for a desert safari which cost 160 Dhms but had I booked in hotel would have been charged 250. Also i did not know until I arrived that there is a courtesy bus to and from the airport, so had to pay for a taxi from airport at midnight. Would have been easier had the hotel arranged for us to be collected.", "Date": "March 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "singapore", "Title": "\u201cThe hotel that never (lets you ) sleeps.\u201d", "Author": "tok_serampit", "ReviewID": "UR13675045", "Content": "As soon as you step in Deira Town Hotel, you will be amazed by the interior of the lobby and the super helpful service rendered by the driver, bellboy and the philipinos working in the restaurant, in view of the 2 star rating. However, the nightmare began as soon as you start conversing with the receptionist. The are 3 receptionist altogether, 2 in the morning shift 1 in the night shift, all south indian origin. Low and behold prepare youself to talk to a nearly semi-comatose being. They will only appear lively when talking to the same race and language. If you need a favour try the egyptian girl who sit at the opposite counter handling tourist queries. She simply fantastic and has a very service oriented attitude. Now the room, i'm suprise that the hotel is only 8 months as the rooms are falling appart. The card key will hold you outside your room for a tiring ten minutes before it permits you to enter. The handles of the cupboard came out when you want to open it. The carpet room smells so does the shower curtain. The sink leaks and wet your whole bathroom floor, not like it matters as your shower already did its job. But the best part has to be \"lullaby\" by the well-collaborated south asia beats from the 3 night clubs at the lobby level of the hotel all the way till 3 am.

One tip - turn on the hot water in the bathroom as soon as you get there. It's not on automatically. I'd say this is a good hotel for the money, especially if you're sightseeing and not spending much time in your room.

The rooms are large and clean, in my opinion 4-star standard with big beds and good showers. There is also bellboy service which I wouldn't have expected from a budget hotel. The location is within walking distance of the river and souqs, amid Dubai's Indian community.

Great Value!\u201d", "Author": "Fauzia", "ReviewID": "UR7394093", "Content": "Why we chose this hotel? We booked into this hotel after having an extremely bad experience at the Royal Falcon Hotel, just a few minutes drive away from Deira Town Hotel. We looked at many different hotels in the area, ranging from 3-4.5 star properties. We were looking for value, comfort and cleanliness and a room with a great ambience. Believe me, we looked at over 15 hotels in the area and this was the only one that met all of those expectations! For a 3 star hotel, this definately exceeded my expectations. It is more like a 4 star. As an employee of 4-5 star hotels I can tell you that for sure!! Great Value! We went during Dubai's peak season. Room rates were approx 150 AUD at the time for a double room with an extra bed, breakfast for three (basic, but adequate) and airport transfers. Location, Location, Location! Great location, just walking distance to many restaurants (who even deliver to your room at no charge), the Ghurair Mall, Gold Souk, Beach, 10 mins drive from the airport. Fantastic! The Hotel & Room! The hotel was being finished while we were there. But it still had a good ambience. The room was very comfortable. Spacious, clean, good furnishings and a lot of natural light (rare in other hotels in area). Bathroom was spacious with great water pressure. The quality of room service meals is great! Very cheap and delicious for 24 hours. Internet services are available just metres away from the hotel. Staff & Service A bell boy by the name of June was fantastic, as was the duty manager. However, the girls at reception were a little rude, perhaps they could do with a little customer service training. Besides those minor imperfections, staff was fantastic! I will recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone looking for comfort and great value! I can definately guarantee that you will not find a hotel that is any better value than this one, you definately won't regret staying here!!", "Date": "April 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cWouldnt really, sure there is better out there\u201d", "Author": "RareTraveller7", "ReviewID": "UR7338505", "Content": "Unpleasant reception staff, untrustworthy manager, fire alarms going off repeatedly at 2.00 am.
