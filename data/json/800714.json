Please do not make the mistake of booking the desert safari from the hotel as its the most horrible experince you can have. There is no group travel for the desert dafari, and this giuy in the 4x4 just gives you a drive and leaves you the tent. He doesnt even stop in the middle of th desert for taking photos. The tent place was really bad, you need to pay for everything and it does not have a proper feel of a desert place. The costumes are horrible, either torn or in a shabby condition.

Having noticed that people are still complaining about the apartments I feel I owe it to both the hotel and future potential customers to give a review. I arrived at 7 am having travelled overnight I was really tired. The first room I was allocated was a corner room without a fridge and no hob but an extractor fan??? I phoned reception and asked for an apartment as I was at the very least needing a fridge. I was then given a second room which had mould on the ceiling! Yes, I had read a previous review and thought ....some people are fussy. I slept for about 4 hours and it was the smell and congested lungs that woke me. I am a smoker not a health freak by any stretch of imagination. I was then moved to my 3rd and final room. I thought - I guess this is as good as it gets! Popped into the local Spinney Supermarket and armed myself with essential cleaning/scouring products. Scrubbed the shower basin (no bath) and cooking surfaces. Bonus I was travelling alone as there was little in the way of crockery, cutlery. Staff .... pretty disappointing. Asked for a hair dryer from reception first night but waited so long my very long hair had dried when I mentioned to reception on my way out for the night that I hadn't received the hair dryer ??? It is poorly run and wouldn't take a lot to get this place in shape. Probably more staff !!! Location is great if you aren't there for the beach ....plenty shops and night life. I stayed at The Golden Sands Apartments in the street behind on previous trip a month earlier. That was spotless and I never noticed any prostitutes there!

We were given a room at the back, which turned out to be very busy from the car park. We were woken up on both nights by children in the car park. I think they must have been collected by their parents. Theis was at 1.15am and they were under 10 years old. When we were taken to our room I noticed that there was only one pillow each and only one towel between two of us!! I asked the bell boy if he could get some more but they never materialised. In the kitchen was a washing machine, cooker, microwave. But no pans or any way of heating any thing up. There was two cups, two plates, two spoons and that was it. The cupboards were dirty and in a state of bad repair. There was an iron and ironing board. The bed side lights have round pin plugs but the sockets are the three pin British plugs. Eventually Improvised and plugged in the lights neither of these worked. The bathroom was dirty with a badly stained shower tray. Around the door frame was a build up of fluffy black dust. This was also present on the window frame. The ceiling in the bathroom was mouldy. We didn't try the shower on day one as we didn't get to the room until 11.30pm. In the morning we tried to have a shower. The water would not deviate to the shower attachment. I improvised by sitting in the shower tray as we waited for someone to repair it. Eventually someone did come and say it was broken and then left without resolving the issue. My husband 6'3\" had to sit in the shower tray it did makes us giggle. The water went cold so I rang down twice. They were very unhelpful we eventually found out in order to have hot water you have to switch on the heater switch located by the bedroom door. This is fine but only works whilst the key is inserted no good if you have been out all day and need a shower. On our way out I did ask for more towels, for the shower to be mended and also the lights to be fixed. These were addressed. We did have breakfast in the hotel which was fine. The hotel has a roof top swimming pool which is lovey and gives wonderful views of Dubai especially the Burg Khalifa and surrounding area. There is much in the surrounding area and is about 20 min walk to the supermarkets and the Metros. The cabs are so inexpensive that this isn't a problem. Would I stay here again? Maybe yes but I would ask for a room on the front. These have balconies.

Instead it's about a 40 walk away from the main restaurants and Burjuman shopping center - which, in the peak of summer was impossible to do. We'd have to catch a taxi instead which was also abit of a problem in the area as they were hard to find. We discovered if we walked around the corner to the next hotel (about 5 mins away) we'd have better luck at getting one. (Although we did have to wait 20 minutes for a taxi once) Many of the taxi drivers also didn't know where this hotel was located (as apparently it's changed it's name recently) so make sure you take the hotel card with you. In terms of everything else: The service was good, check in/out was fast. The TV had cable and the rooms were cleaned well. It's a good hotel so I'd recommend it based on it's service/rooms but not on it's location. I've given it a 2/5 on the value rating as we had to pay for taxi's to take us to places we thought we could walk to so it went over our budget.", "Date": "March 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cA 3 star hotel with 5 star service.\u201d", "Author": "raymal4u", "ReviewID": "UR56778498", "Content": "We loved this hotel, it was like being at home, the staff were caring and brilliant.

I would advise NOT to hire a car at all as there are lots of hidden charges, even if you have a very minor touch they will try and charge you for the full access, which is far too much, (\u00a3500) so dont hire a car in Dubai at all... we will be using the taxi service in future....", "Date": "February 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cHotel is ideally located in Burdubai\u201d", "Author": "Ramcksrt", "ReviewID": "UR55870580", "Content": "This hotel is ideally located in Burdubai and fairly priced.

Advice to anyone who is getting a soecial of any sort. Get everything in writing if they offer you any specials if in the unlikely scenario you happen to stay there. They will blackmail you by holding your passport jacking up the bill, charging you for time you were not there, refusing to email an invoice so you can review it before paying and if you question any descrepancy and refuse to pay the contested amount they threaten to call the police and refuse to give your passport, no matter how urgently you may need it. If you get reservation through internet deals with any legit hotel booking service, they claim they did not advertize with the service and refuse to honor that price or offerring. Their office computor system is archaic, and you cannot correct a document if you get a working document and need to correct it. Their conciere service will insist on helping you with your luggage and not check the cab for all luggage. We lost our bag with our laptop and all components on a business trip and had to extend our visa because we could not wrap what we were there to do, without a laptop, it is not costing us $1540 plus to replace all missing items including eye glasses, because the staff insisted on helping with luggage did not care to look in the back seat, while we were concentrating on being escorted to the front desk, the cab was allowed to leave with one of our bags. We are checking out and renting a car and going to differrent hotels this time to check them ourselves for a long term stay before we move in again. we are on a budget, otherwise ofcourse there are lots of good hotels in Dubai.

We booked this hotel because it was cheap and we only needed one night before we had reservations at Radisson Blu Media City. The staff at Jormand was not very service minded and came off as \"unpolite\". Two of the people sitting in the reception were sick, and was not acting very hygienic. Then they went on to touching passports, papers etc. without washing their hands that they had used as tissue. We were glad we had antibac at hand! Furthermore, the hotel had a policy of keeping visitors passports until they checked out. We did not like this and had them take a copy of our passports, and then giving it back to us. This was ok by the staff, though they didn't seem very happy for our request. The room we got was spacious, and ok. I would say maybe this was like a 2-star room. At the roof there was a swimming pool and sunbeds. The roof was very dirty and dusty (keep in mind we're in a deseert:), but they could have done a better job keeping the place clean.
