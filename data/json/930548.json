We chosen the apartment based on the previous reviews and we were not disappointed. The lady on the front desk was very helpful and spoke excellent English. We had an apartment on the 7th floor which meant we got a large roof terrace. We didn't spend too much time on the terrace as it was very cold when we were there( down to -5) but it was spacious with a good set of table and chairs. Our apartment was split into 2 rooms (701&702) one had a double bed one two singles. Both had flat screen tv with some English channels. The bathrooms were nice with showers over the bath. They supplied toiletries and towels. The kitchen area was small but more than sufficient. We had booked for 2nights and our flight was in the evening so they offered to hold our bags until we needed them. Later in the day we discovered that our flight had been cancelled and we had been rebooked for the following day. When we got to reception they were able to give us our old rooms back and order us a taxi for 5:30 the following morning.", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, fantastic staff!\u201d", "Author": "Schackaroundtheworld", "ReviewID": "UR124020453", "Content": "We were 4 friends staying for a weekend and found Aramunt via booking.com.

The location was within walking distance of Las Ramblas, but far enough away that it was in a quiet and safe location. The front desk staff was super. The apartment was modern and clean.

The hotel has the reception only open to 7 PM, so arriving late means more complications as you need to collect the keys from another location. The parking nearby is very expensive (\u20ac25 per nigh). The position is central but not necesserality too good, you need to do a fair amount of walking.

We all found it to be of an exceptional standard given what we had paid for it. The room was fully air conditioned. Self catering facilities provided were sufficient for a quick meal. Bathroom facilities were also to a good standard, and were fully cleaned every day to two days during our stay. It might be worth clarifying what is in the room before booking as we had expected four single beds based on the capacity of the room but instead found a double bed and a double fold out sofa bed. Although this wasnt a problem for us, in hindsight it would have been worth knowing. The staff who speak a multitude of languages were really helpful, providing each of us with a map and annotating destinations worth visiting. They also provided useful local information on supermarkets, the metro system and how to avoid tourist traps. The location of the apartments is fairly central to the main tourist destinations, within walking distance of about 15 minutes to las ramblas, some gaudi architecture and also to the metro system. This is somewhere that would be good for more care free individuals, such as a student group, young couples or a small family on a short stay. Overall the combination of service, location and value is very good. I would definately stay here again.", "Date": "July 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent facilities but parking expensive\u201d", "Author": "fct1", "ReviewID": "UR57279356", "Content": "We really enjoyed the place.

I booked the 4 person room. We were 2 adults with 2 school age children. The sofa bed was not able to retract back into the sofa. This left hardly any room to be able to move int he apartment. Plus only the kids could watch TV now while sitting in bed. If an adult tried sitting on the edge of the sofa bed, it sank to the floor. The bathroom was a joke! You had to hit some part of your body with the door to try to get in and out of it. Tip: remove the bidet and make the shower larger. There wasn't even so much as a shelf in the shower so even the soap had to go on the floor. That all said, it was cheap.

Had a small balcony and was facing a courtyard, not street, so noise was not a problem. Bathroom, kitchen looked new and clean, the furniture seems to come from IKEA - basic. Had a dishwasher, which we used, and a washed which we didn't use. TV had just a handful channels in Spanish, not much use to us. WiFi included, but worked just in one part of the room. Front desk seems very helpful, giving advice on attractions, transportation food etc. Even though located in a gay area as already mentioned, the clientele here is just your standard issue tourists in case you were wondering. A safe deposit box was provided, but not bolted down, which made me wonder - what is to stop a burglar from walking away with the whole thing? Still a better option than walking around Barcelona with your money and valuables which is NOT a good idea, but that's another story.", "Date": "June 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cApartment a Great Choice for a Family Group\u201d", "Author": "debbeck", "ReviewID": "UR21659302", "Content": "We traveled as a family of 5. All adults. Hotels in large European cites are expensive and we found that to be true in Barcelona. Most hotel rooms are 1 bed only so as a group of 5, we would have needed 3 rooms. We were able to find an apartment with 3 bedrooms, a large living room, equipped kitchen, and dining table through Aramunt Apartments that was very reasonably priced. The office is a little trick to find but we had researched and knew that the office was located in another building, and on another block from the apartment we were assigned. The office is located on #60 Mutaner Street, 5th floor, door #4 and keys must be picked up at this location. The staff speaks English and are most helpful. They offered to make dinner reservations, call cabs, give directions, and offer advice on sights to see. The apartment where we stayed was on Valencia Street about a block and 1/2 away from the office. The apartment building had no internet connection. If that is something important for your travels, there are other apartment buildings that are equipped with internet so be sure to ask before you complete your reservation. The television had only Spanish speaking stations and only a few channels. The kichen was nicely equipped with all we needed, even a dishwasher and the beds in the bedrooms were comfortable. There is a double bed in 1 room, 2 twin beds in another room and 1 single bed in the 3rd bedroom. The bathroom was large and had plenty of towels and other soaps and shampoos as well as a hair dryer. The neighborhood was nice and we felt very safe. The Metro was not close but accessible within a couple of blocks. There are shops for groceries within walking distance and restaurants also. We loved our time in Barcelona and we recommend having the apartment so that everyone can spend time together but also have their own space. We would definitely use the Aramunt Apartments again.", "Date": "November 8, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Aramunt Apartments", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d930548-Reviews-Aramunt_Apartments-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$137 - $236*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">C/ Muntaner 60</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08011</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "930548", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/4b/fd/4bfd4e4ef8567fa57e1461b19f5e24562large.jpg"}}
