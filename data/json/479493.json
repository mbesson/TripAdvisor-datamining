{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Very good value, nice clean rooms, if you don't mind the walk to get there I booked my rooms for about Y13,500 per night and I think it is a very good deal. First, the location, in Ikebukero East side, is very convenient. We walked one minute to Sunshine Bldg., and every morning and night had convenience stores, ramen, bakeries, donuts, and arcades to keep us fed and entertained at those times. The only problem was walking there from the JR station with our suitcases in the crowded streets...I had to call the hotel from my rented cell phone a few times. Luckily I speak some Japanese or else we would have been in trouble. It is too close for a taxi. Once we got there, we found the rooms were clean and probably recently renovated...I guess this because there was a 15 flat screen TV! And a refrigerator and a minibar, all of which is pretty good for that nightly rate in a prime spot like Ikebukuro.If you've been to Japan and/or Ikebukuro before, or you don't mind a little walking adventure to get there, then this hotel is great. If you are nervous, or don't like a bright neighborhood with lots of young people going to bars or clubs on you walk away from the station, then this isn't the hotel for you.For me, a traveller on a budget, I was completely satisfied with the clean, quiet rooms, kind staff, proximity to entertainment, food, and huge JR station.", "Date": "Jul 5, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR226351840", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "uclarobin"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066460-d479493-r3637376-Ark_Hotel_Tokyo-Toshima_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "479493", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
