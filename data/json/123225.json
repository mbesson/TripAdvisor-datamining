I had read decent reviews and gave it a shoot. Let me preface this by stating I am not a picky person. I was aware that this is a cheap motel and I was expecting that. A decent place to sleep with no frills. When we first arrived the woman and the front was very unfriendly. We were the only guests checking in and I felt very uncomfortable. I used to live in Chicago and felt it was a poor representation of a friendly city. We checked in on a Wednesday when the motel was not filled up yet. We were put in a room directly facing a ally, kitty corner to the street. It was in the F building, I HIGHLY recommend not staying there. LOUD. Everynight it sounds like there is a party in your room just from people outside walking to and from the bars. What was worst though was our door had gaps in in from being so old we could hear all our adjacent neighbors going about their night and day. They sounded like they were inside our room with us. The maids would come early every morning and yell back and forth to each other while they worked in different rooms. If we wanted to sleep past 9am it wasn't going to happen. The plumbing is poor but that wasn't a huge issue for me knowing the hotel is older. Our television constantly went in and out which wasn't fun trying to watch basketball. The bed was uncomfortable and sank in the middle. I woke up one night thinking the bed and suck to the floor. My BIGGEST ISSUE was what the last person who left a review said, lack of AIR CONTIONING. We stayed at this motel 4 nights. The first night was hot so we had our air on. We left the air on the next day while walking around the city and came back to our vents pumping heat into our room. It was a sauna. We went to the front desk and they told us because it was getting chillier in the city that they turned off the air and had turned on the heat. We were told there are NO INDIVIDUAL controls to your air or heat in your room. They make that decision. I would have NEVER booked with this motel if I would have known that. Basically we did not sleep while we stayed there. When I stated my frustrations to the front desk attendant, she looked at me like I was crazy and never once offered an apology. Rudest staff I have ever encountered. A very depressing place. For a person who really cannot afford over $100 a night in this economy if I could do it all over again I would book far ahead of time and save up more. There is only one map of the city and the staff is not there to help you get around. Be prepared to do it on your own. On a positive note we did eat every morning at the Ohio House Diner attached and it was great. They have good french toast and yummy banana pancakes.

We ran into a few ladies just leaving their rooms and they told us to stay because the rooms were good and clean. They even let us in to look and we were happy with them. We stayed for a weekend and were so happy we stayed there. The rooms are not fancy but they were clean and I can't say enough about the location it is close to Michigan Ave only about 5 blocks a quick 5-10 minute walk and one of the train stations is over one street on Grand, very close. Other friends with us had booked on Michigan ave at the Congress and it was way down on S Michigan, a very long walk, and about $100 more. The beds were great and the shower was nice and hot. There is a sports bar across the street and it was a little loud on Friday and Saturday night around 2-3 am although only one friend was awakenend by the noise where the other two of us slept fine and didn't hear a thing. She said it wasn't all that loud and she was able to get right back to sleep. Not a big deal because you are in heart of the city so you hear horns and such anyway. Believe me when you're in the city I don't know why you'd waste lots of money paying for a room that you're only going to be in to change, shower and sleep, there's too much to see and do for hanging in a motel room. Anyway the staff was great. We couldn't ask for anything better, they were very friendly and nice. One night at 12am we couldn't get the cable to work and the older night deskman came up to get it working for us, super nice man. We were really happy with the way you enter your rooms too.

The Motel also has its own small coffee house where we had breakfast on one of our days there. Its was nice, but again very 1960's style which was interesting. Chicago is full of delicious resturants and cafes though - my personal recommendation is a little French style cafe 'Cosi', a block or so back from Michigan Avenue).

A couple of small notes - The rooms are right next to a major street, with an all night mcdonalds next door, and a night club across the road. It didnt really bother us, we had no problems sleeping, but for very light sleepers it may be an issue. People used to large hotels in cities where your room is far from the entrance to the building and any passersby, may not appreciate people being able to walk right by your room on the street.Though with two security locked doors between us and the outside, we never felt unsafe or uneasy at any time. Also, check out the large sports store ( Sports Authority) next door to the motel. With a great bargain basement, and seven stories of sporting goods, my boyfriend was in heaven. I think that people from overseas will especially appreciate the huge store, as I know we dont have anything like it at home! We stayed at this hotel from the 29th June - 7th July 2007, and were able to go to the Taste of Chicago, and experience the 3rd,4th, and 5th of July fireworks. What a great time to visit!

We found it to be of average quality, but in a good location, close to the city centre & transport. It takes about 40 minutes to get from Chicago-Miday Airport to the motel, via the l-train. There is a car park for guests, & the motel is across the road from the largest McDonald's in the USA. There are many restaurants, clubs & bars in the close vicinity, with the Magnificent Mile & other shopping generally about a 15-minute walk away. The room was fairly spacious but had a funny smell. It was in need of rennovation really, but in general it was definitely passable as a central city motel. The shower was pretty good, with plenty of hot water. There was also HBO, I think. Don't stay here if you are looking for hotel-class accommodation - in the end you get what you pay for, but this motel was satisfactory. We stayed in a room close to the road (the motel is near a large intersection) but weren't too bothered by the traffic noise. There is wi-fi at the motel, & the proprieters let us leave our luggage after check out, which was nice - both the gentlemen we met there were really helpful & friendly. The neighbourhood didn't seem the safest, but it wasn't scary either. The only real downside was the delivery trucks that kept parking in the alleyway next to our room in the early hours of each morning, where they would create quite a racket - it might be better to request a room away from the streets/alleyways if you are a light sleeper. There is no breakfast served here & the cafe on the corner is not really worth it (it's small, dingy & greasy - not in a good way), so save your pennies & venture further afield for something a lot nicer. There is a supermarket not too far away as well, if you are on a budget. And Giordano's deep dish pizza (or Pizzeria Uno, & Gino's) are to die for (& not far away) if you're not worried about your waistline! Overall, this hotel is a little shabby around the edges but is certainly up to scratch value-wise.

It has no website and is not featured on Travelocity and the likes (as far as I know). I found it in the Lonely Planet Chicago in the budget section after failing miserably at booking any other place for the Chicago Marathon. Everything was booked 4 months in advanced, except for $400 and up luxury suites. This place still cost $89, which would buy you a decent room on a day other than the day before the Marathon (but I think prices a much lower the rest of the time). Anyway, when it says \"Motel\", it IS a motel. Straight out of the '50s. It is not just retro-themed, it is truly retro, so if you like that sort of thing, go for it. I still am not completely sure what that gadget that reminded of an old record player/radio (it wasn't a record player) in the corner was, but artifacts like that ceased to exist at least 5 years ago. The place was really worn out, but with a remodeled bathroom. The sheets and blankets must have been on those beds for generations. It was clean, although still looked kind of sketchy, the kind of place that would be featured in the noir film. Customer service was excellent! The gentleman who helped us check in, was one of the most pleasant people I've ever met and that is the reason why I didn't hate the motel. You can't hate a place where such wonderful people work.
