{"Reviews": [{"Content": "The worst experience This is the worst experience. Don't do it ! ! !The hotel is in need of major renovations. Our room had mould in the fridge and bathroom. The bathroom smelt like sewerage. The bed linen smelt and the room had a stale cigarette smell. The breakfast was boring and not much selection. Staff not very helpful at all. No pool service as there was not enought people at the pool.When it rained the drain outside our room and along the paths had blocked and we had to walk through water up to our knees. Umbrella in rooms broken and we asked reception for a replacement they said we have no more.We stayed out til as late as possible so we didn't have to go bad to the our rooms. I felt so bad for the children as this was the first time we had taken them to Bali.We had book in for 16 days and left after Day 2. We contacted our travel agent in Sydney as an emergency on Day 1 and they had us out of there on Day 2. Thank goodness.DON'T DO IT - YOU WILL BE VERY SORRY.", "Date": "Aug 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR644335372", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "101holidaylover"}, {"Content": "HORRIBLE STAY My parents, my husband, and I stayed in this hotel for three nights in this hotel in July 2005. We booked two rooms at this hotel. It was awful. We tried to go to different hotel the next day. It is unfortunate that we could not have the chance because of July is the busy season for tourism.We experienced different events everyday that made us dislike this place. First day when we checked in, the rooms were not clean at all. The bathroom looked unclean. The shower was broken and there was mold everywhere. Also, there was a distinct bad smell coming from my parents' bathroom.There were problems with the blankets and the bed sheets also. We felt itchy during the night and we got rashes in our body. We believe that the blankets and the bed sheets were not clean at all.The cleaning service was also very bad. They practically went into your room to tidy up your room but not to clean the room (or even the bathroom). We were surprise when we saw this.The second night we were sleeping, we heard someone was knocking at our door around 2 am. We asked from inside who he is and he said that he is from room service. We were shocked. We had never use the room service. My husband told him to leave and we never heard anything since then. Also that night, my parents could not sleep because the people who stay in the room above them were pretty loud.The next morning, we went to the receptionist to complain and to ask them if we can move to other rooms. They were saying that they were out of room at this moment. We asked her if we could see the hotel manager. She called the hotel manager and he refused to meet us by saying excuses.We were really dissapointed with this place. The service that we received could not be compared with the price that we have paid. We all agree that we would never comeback to this hotel ever again.", "Date": "Aug 29, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR804391568", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "nouv3aux"}, {"Content": "\u93c8\u6fcb\ue5e4\u9287\ue1ba\u511c\u9289\u70bd\u4eb4\u7f07\u5ea1\u61d7\u9287\u693c\u4e9c   showReview(19500961, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR710613635", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "\u9287\u4ff1\u5031\u9287\u00b0\u5011\u9288?> \u9287\u4ff1\u5031\u9287\u00b0\u5011\u9288?</a> </div>"}, {"Content": "\u9288\ue218\u506a\u9287\ue1ba\u511e\u9289\u7b3a\u510a\u9287\u5b28\u501d\u95ac\u64b9\u77fe...   showReview(20348228, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 11, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR660632273", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d557528-r19029618-Sahid_Raya_Bali-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "557528", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
