ROOM: Small single rooms, some with a view to an apartment building wall only 3 metres from the hotel window. Better rooms have a view to the street and a mosque across the street, so that prayer calls wake you up sometimes even before 5am. Bed mattresses are very hard and springs can be felt through the bedsheets. Noisy but efficient AC machine on the wall. No reading lamp provided either for the bed or the desk, even when asked. BATHROOM: All floors are tiled with shiny glazed tiles, even the bathroom floors, so make sure you hold on to something in the bathroom so you won't slip and fall. The rooms are provided with bathroom slippers, but after a shower they are just as slippery as your bare feet (hence the name). Lukewarm water drips from the shower head at an amazing speed of 2 litres per minute. Dangerous-looking bare wire ends hang from the bathroom ceiling. SERVICE: Plain and monotonous toast + omelet breakfasts are served by a nice old man looking like Manuel from Fawlty Towers 30 year later. Rest of the large male staff are much less service-oriented. Rooms are cleaned only if you leave your key when you go out. A rotting banana and other foodstuffs from a previous occupant were waiting in the clothes closet when I checked in. Missing remote control for the TV was never provided. When you ask the receptionists to call a taxi, the bellboy comes and leads you to a busy street corner 100 metres from the door and hails a taxi for you. When I asked for the missing hotel book provided by my tour operator, they just said someone took it and made no effort to ask for a new copy from the tour operator. In other words, truly 'effortless' service throughout.", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDisgraceful service, prostitutes galore in area around hotel, never go there!\u201d", "Author": "Jhuss Posted by an OctopusTravel traveler", "ReviewID": "UR97101944", "Content": "Awful, I should have listened to other reviews.cockroaches in room, dirty rooms, dirty bed sheets, dirty old men at service counter.", "Date": "February 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "lagos", "Title": "\u201cnice experience, if you are on a tight budget\u201d", "Author": "fortunedash", "ReviewID": "UR31973417", "Content": "it was great, although the taxi driver could not find it at first. helpful staff, i had a very nice room and fair breakfast.

I don't know Dubai well so I'm not sure how good it is in terms of location, but it is quite close to the airport (35 dirhams by taxi).

TAKE MY ADVICE. DONT CARE IF IT IS A BUDGET HOTEL, SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY AND STAY SOMEWHERE MORE ACCOMMODATING, CLEAN, SMELL GOOD AND PEOPLE ARE FRIENDLY AND DONT FEEL LIKE THEY ARE DOING YOU A FAVOR AND NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND!!!", "Date": "October 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bahrain", "Title": "\u201cBe careful when choosing this hotel\u201d", "Author": "noside22", "ReviewID": "UR15764011", "Content": "Positives: Near the airport, near the supermarkets, low cost hotel Negatives: This is located in Deira which is a very busy place.

Telephone was not working (at least based on our experience). Don't expect a good breakfast. Place mats on the table are very dirty. Some staff are friendly while others are not. Even though, you have already prepaid your stay through a credit card, the front desk receptionist will ask for your passport as a deposit. Otherwise, he will ask for money equivalent to 1-2 days stay for deposit. Don't give your passport. It is better to give money for your deposit. If you need to take a taxi, leave early in the morning. You can still find taxi in the adjacent major street Naif road during the early morning say between 6:00 to 7:00 am.
