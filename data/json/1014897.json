It's a fair distance from the centre city but there is an easy bus connection. We book a Singapore Package from www.antilogvacations.com , quite known for budget friendly Singapore tours in India.They gave us this hotel matching our price range and I must say it was a decent job.They offered us at the lowest rates and we were happy bout it The interiors of the hotel are not extraordinary but they are not bad either. The carpets and the furniture looked decent. The location is not very central but the connectivity is nice, it\u2019s near an MRT station by walking distance or by taxi. There is petrol station next door so easy to get stuff. The room was clean, with nice, comfortable linen though I feel the size could have been slightly larger. Each room has a refrigerator stocked with drinks and tea & coffee maker. There are other amenities like phone, TV , all what you need genrally. What was not good though was that the housekeeping made a lot of noise while doing their job. And the major drawback is that the AC is centrally controlled and I found at times the room was very cold ( though u can ad just). Even opening up the windows did not help much. I felt like needing a couple of more blankets. There aren't many restaurants in the area. There is a large restaurant in the hotel itself but it focuses on a buffet and one can order from the menu only during certain, fairly limited, hours. Also little options in the breakfast items if you are a vegetarian. But the Price was cheap for the package . Also internet at business center for Sg $4/30 minutes. It was fast. As I said the facilities are there but the working is a little clumsy, I hope they rectify these small problems. Very nice Singapore tour in the end...m all happy with the trip", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saskatchewan", "Title": "\u201cOK\u201d", "Author": "TravelNotTourism", "ReviewID": "UR123387275", "Content": "This is a mid range hotel.

Hotel Windsor is located adjacent to the Al Jumeid Rd in Singapore City. As you enter the hotel, the flooring is carpet and you'll encounter decorative designs on the carpet and lamps hanging from the ceiling. The reception is on the right and to the left is the Windsor cafe` the signature restaurant of this hotel. There is also a seating area for visitors and guests at the lobby. You can smell the freshness in the air as you walk through. After you check in, the room keys are handed over to you. Each room has a refrigerator stocked with drinks and tea & coffee maker. The bed is very comfortable and neat. Let's talk about the room atmosphere. The flooring is made of black tile I guess I'm right. You can get a view of a couple of buildings around your hotel. But the windows are locked and you can't put your head out if you wanted some fresh air to breath. The hotel follows a no smoking policy and the stickers can be seen on room mirror. The television set is hung from the ceiling and looks good in terms of how your room deco is matched. I'm not sure about the wi-fi as I've not tried it. There is a business centre at the hotel with printer and internet facility that comes with a price. Room service is available and laundry, house keeping facility are the common provisions available at the hotel. The housekeeping staff at this hotel are efficient and capable. I had a small talk on the elevator with the house keeping staff and she seemed to be very kind and enquired about my stay. Nice touch there. The Windsor Cafe` which houses the restaurant of this hotel is just ok and pleasant but gets crowded and messy at times. There's a buffet system. The table and chairs are not organised well on the floor. Rest room is good and clean. Overall my stay in this hotel was a pleasant on and I wasn't happy about the shower experience because it was narrow and the water flow was extremely soft which made up for a bad shower experience. Bath fixtures are well kept and overall bathroom is good but very small. The hotel maids are not taught to maintain silence or carry out their work in a discreet manner otherwise when they are clearing the table and taking away used bone china and glasses or tea/ coffe cups, they make one hell of a noise. That's it about this hotel. My over all experience at this hotel suited my needs and was good.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot worth it!!!\u201d", "Author": "Sal_t85", "ReviewID": "UR114483648", "Content": "far from little India.

Everything is only the worst about this place. I am a hotelier myself so things seemed more out of place. Electrical socket was jammed, W/C (Toilet) was choked, no toilet rolls, no shower soap, no staff service. We changed the room from 804 to 904. Even the other room had the same kind of toilet. We went down to use the toilet in the lobby, even that was unclean. Worst pf all, one of the beds had the spring coming out, it was not at all appropriate and fair. But we did not want to take it any more, so spent 2 nights on the same bed. It is like a road side Sarai rather than a hotel. The karaoke on the 3rd floor is so noise, carpets are stained, and the staff there does not even speak/ understand English.

Another drawback is that it is located away from the city centre so you have to make that extra effort to reach certain places. On the positive side, the staff is very pleasant and helpful. A unique experience was that there were no mineral water bottles in the room and on asking we were told that in Singapore everyone drinks tap water.

It reminded me very much of a UK Travelodge style offer, no frills but generally clean and comfortable. I found all the staff to be helpful, even when the coach trips arrived (and there were lots of those) and the place was full. Not the place to stay if you are looking for character and/or somewhere to chill out after a day of sight seeing. Room safes were being fitted as i was there, and my iron and ironing board was efficiently delivered and left for my duration of the stay. I also managed to have an early check in and late check outs to fit around my flights with no hassle whatsover and the loan of the hotel umbrella's was great (still didnt stop the frizz tho!). I only had breakfast in the cafe and stuck to toast, coffee and melon as i still cannot face a full chinese meal for breakfast. I laughed when i read the review below, having stubbed my toes in the bathroom, every single time i went in there.... i didnt learn and it does hurt, so be warned! All areas non smoking, but my room did smell suspiciously of smoke and suprisingly no complimentary water. I was assured the water was safe to drink, by the cafe staff who were genuinely puzzled by my request for a bottled water. The garage next door proved to be useful to buy water and other odds and ends. As for taxi's, i always got the hotel to book them for me, there was a small surcharge, but i was happier with that than flagging one down outside on the busy road.
