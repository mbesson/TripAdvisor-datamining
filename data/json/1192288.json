Exceeded the expectations I had. The room has everything you need and is very quiet. We get a key that enables us to enter and leave at that hour that we want giving us very much freedom to walk around. Most of the stuff I bought at the supermarket and cooked in apartament. No doubt that helps a lot in the budget of the trip. The owners are very concerned about our well being and let us leave the luggage at home even after check-out. Its a very safetly and nice area, walking distance from everthing!! On any visit to amsterdam is where i will stay for sure.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery Disappointing\u201d", "Author": "Jacki66", "ReviewID": "UR105607525", "Content": "Upon arrival at the Canal House we were greeted by a very confused young girl who swiftly made a phone call when we announced we'd like to check-in, our hearts sank, we could sense something wasn't right at all !! The phone was then thrust into my hand as the owner on the phone informed me she did not have a reservation for us, I insisted she must, informing her we had a Confirmation email, the young girl then called us by our names - I queried the Owner, \"If you don't have our booking how does the young girl know who I am?\" the young girl admitted we were in their \"system\". When I explained this to the owner she agreed to come back and meet us. Before the owner \"finally admitted\" she'd failed to open our Booking Confirmation she had also tried to blame the Booking Agent \"Venere\" for her error. Eventually the owner had nowhere left to run and agreed to search for alternative accommodation as her Canal House was fully booked (it was Easter weekend). We spent the next 45 minutes sat outside in a small garden as we listened to the owner stressfully making several phone calls to have us relocated, Venere rules state if the accommodation owner makes a booking mistake then they must find an alternative room and pay any additional costs. A room was eventually found in the Hotel Sander, located within the Museum District and close to Vondel Park so this actually worked in our favour - a much more pleasant location than the Canal House, the owner kindly drove us to our new destination and joined us at Hotel Sander's reception where she \"literally\" paid for her mistake, the Hotel Sander decided to \"make\" from her mistake and charged 460 euros for 2 nights at their terrible hotel (but that's another story, I've reviewed them separately). We were extremely unhappy with the Canal House owners initial attitude as she'd tried so hard to avoid blame which could have left us without a room for the weekend if we hadn't of arrived so well prepared with Confirmation papers, the Owner even eventually admitted I'd sent her an additional email which she'd also ignored in error. If it hadn't of been for Venere's rules that she must find us another hotel of the same standard or above if same standard wasn't available then I'm convinced we'd have had her door slammed in our faces and told to go away. The Owner when faced with admitting entire fault was more than apologetic, did deliver us to our new room and paid, very reluctantly, the extra costs caused by her oversight. She also offered us a free nights stay in the Canal House if we returned to Amsterdam, we thanked her but in honesty we would never return to the Canal House or recommend to others. Our weekend in Amsterdam was a quick city break based on relaxation & soaking up the local culture, our welcome experience was very stressful and the Hotel Sander didn't restore any faith we ever had in the Dutch people. As a regular visitor to Holland this experience has very sadly put me off returning for a while.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dunham, Quebec", "Title": "\u201cAvoid like the plague\u201d", "Author": "Kentana", "ReviewID": "UR86101398", "Content": "Canal House Amsterdam on Brouwersgratt 124, These comments are not to be confused as being applicable to the similarly named: Canal House Hotel, Prinsengracht Canal House, nor Amnesia Canal House in Amsterdam. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always get what you pay for. There are two forms of accommodation at this establishment. This review is of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153studio apartment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. When you arrive at your hotel in Amsterdam after a long journey you are surprised that you are required to pay in full with cash up front for the full cost of your stay even before they give you the key. Despite what you think of what is offered, you have little choice with your luggage on the sidewalk and you are too tired to find another place. Contrary to what is implied by the internet image showing the front windows of the building, your windows will not front onto the canal. The accommodation is at the top of the annex in back of building. The only view is the back of houses and a small unkempt garden. Even if you are in good shape, the stairway to this attic garret accommodation is a challenge. Once there, there are no luggage racks. Although there are attempts at cleanliness, the curtains and carpets are threadbare and stained as are the thin grey towels. The entire musty and moldy \u00e2\u20ac\u0153studio apartment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd needs painting and repair. There is no escape for fire nor are fire extinguishers available in this old 15th century wooden building. It has exposed wood rafters that could be charming but there is mold and evidence of rot with unjointed and stained plasterboard between the rafters. Apart from a single bare bulb in the middle of the studio all other lighting is by lamps connected to extension cords. There was however no sign of bed bugs. The furniture is what you would expect from Sally Anne with couches covered with rumpled, limp and stained sheets. Repairs had been made to the lamp, fan etc with packing tape. Many other minor repairs are needed such as loose lock mechanisms, no sink plug in the studio sink, etc . You would expect in a studio apartment an ability to prepare some simple and rudimentary meals. The inadequate counter space to prepare meals was 22\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdx22\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and half of that is covered by a hot plate and coffee maker. The table to eat a meal is a mere 30\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd square. There is a coffee table in front of a 12\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd TV. This is an old building in a damp city environment but has a leaking roof and much greater dampness than other rooms in this city. 54 Stairs from street level, with the stair to the top floor like a ladder. You need to be in good shape to bring luggage up to the room. There is a large bright airy bathroom, good shower but awkward availability downstairs by difficult ladder like stairs, particularly at night. Although the bathroom is a private facility, the corridor access is open to other rooms. The facilities are grossly inadequate. We loved Amsterdam but our experience was significantly diminished by this accommodation.", "Date": "November 5, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Canal House Amsterdam", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d1192288-Reviews-Canal_House_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$119 - $131*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Brouwersgracht 124</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1013 HA</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1192288", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/cf/22/cf22e23195900b94270adb32daf714ca1large.jpg"}}
