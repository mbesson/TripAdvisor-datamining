The rooms are always clean and ready when we arrive whether it's before check in or late evening. The breakfast is always ready when it is supposed to be and items are fresh and restocked when they become depleted. Close enough to the expressway but not too close that all you hear are the semis rolling by. Good food/restaurants along with fast food close enough via the car. (within a few minutes) Downtown is less than 10 minutes away if you want to go shopping at the mall. No issues at this hotel! Will be staying there next Jan again and maybe in April of 2012 (if we decide to return to Indianapolis). Spacious rooms is a plus at this suite hotel. Some hotels claim they are \"suites\" but you are cramped in. Partial divider between pull out sofa and beds make it nice!
