{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Convenient and inviting From my previous experience, hotels located near train stations in Europe are cheap and conveniently located but tend to be in seedy areas. However the Hotel Adler proved to be a very pleasant surprise.While Niddastrasse crosses the Red Light District, at least the sex clubs are one block away from the hotel entrance. Also, if you walk to the hotel from the Hauptbahnhof (central rail station) via Duesseldorfer Strasse and then take the pedestrian passage to Niddastrasse, you won't be pestered by any sex club doormen.I had booked a room with shared bathroom and shower but after a long trip asked upon check-in to upgrade for a room with private facilities and the price difference wasn't too high (only 12 EUR more per night). The receptionist on duty that evening was very courteous and attentive and spoke good English.My room looked just like on the pictures of the hotel's website. I found the packet of Haribo gummi bears on my pillow to be a very nice touch. I noticed that my room was on the street side and that there were construction vans and machinery right across the street but the windows blocked pretty much all the noise.The breakfast buffet (which was included with the price) was very varied and contained the typical German breakfast fare of rolls, cold cuts, cheese, etc. but also sliced tomatoes and cucumbers, individual jars of yogurt and ready-served glasses of fruit juice. When breakfast was not served, there was a kettle to prepare yourself a cup of instant coffee or tea during front desk hours. There was a computer with free Internet access in the lobby which was quite convenient as I don't have a laptop.The only tiny little irritant was that one of the free maps available at the front desk had lots of advertisements on the back for sex clubs and call girls (but judging from the area where the hotel is, I didn't make a fuss out of it). I didn't use that one, it would have been too embarrassing to unfold in the middle of the street! Ask for the other map: it contains much more acceptable advertising.Overall I enjoyed my stay at the Hotel Adler for its great location and the quality of accomodations you get for the price you pay. I would definitely stay there again or recommend this hotel.", "Date": "May 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR664019703", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "airodyssey"}, {"Content": "Previous storm had bad effects on our stay The location is very good, however its vicinity is full of sex shops, which is a little bit disappointing. Previously there had been a huge storm which apparently ruined the satellite system and also did something to the wifi, but the staff was very helpful and gave us the key to the breakfast room as there was wifi there while it did not work in our room, also they compensated us with some drinks. They were really apologising as the mechanic who turned up on Monday to repair the system could not do it at one go, so while we were there there was no tv or internet in our room.Otherwise everything was okay, rooms clean, breakfast excellent and the receptionist was out of his way to make a good impression... I recommend this hotel to everybody, good value for money and for things you simply cannot buy.", "Date": "Nov 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR451656602", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "szciklon"}, {"Content": "Good Hotel Near Train Station Stayed in a quad room- room had more than enough space as did the bathroom. A quick 5 minute walk from the train station, if you can find it. The street that its on is divided by a row of businesses, a little tricky to find at first. The area its in is not the best and its about a 20 minute walk from the Altstadt. Breakfast was of a typical European hotel type. Would stay here again.", "Date": "Jul 31, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR651412190", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Bballer21"}, {"Content": "Great Value!!! I needed a hotel in Frankfurt for a night at each end of my trip to and from Malta via Frankfurt. I wanted something inexpensive and near the main train station. I found the Hotel Adler on-line and liked what I saw: a single room, inclusive of taxes and breakfast, for 39 Euros a night. It seemed a great value even if the hotel didn't turn out as nice as it appeared on the website. I arrived at the hotel tired after the long flight and just wanted to check in and take a shower and relax. I was told my room would be ready shortly; it was being cleaned. Some time elapsed, but I was relaxing in a comfy chair in the lobby, so wasn't too annoyed. The hotel receptionist kept apologizing for keeping me waiting; apparently it was an issue with a new person cleaning the rooms. Anyway, the wait did turn out longer than they'd said, but I was offered refreshments and decided to use the free internet in the lobby while I waited. To make up for my long wait, they upgraded me to a larger room at no charge, which I thought was very nice. The room had a comfy bed, spotless compact bathroom, TV, minibar (with complimentary mineral water), nice towels (not paper thin as you so often find) and reasonable storage space. The free breakfast includes cold cuts, cheeses, rolls, bread, coffee, juice, cereals, eggs, and fruit....plenty to get your day off to a good start.This hotel definitely exceeded what I thought I'd get for such a modest price; the stafff was friendly and helpful, the free internet was a nice plus, and the location is excellent...just a minute or two to the train station, and there are a number of restaurants nearby. I would definitely stay there again, what great value and service!", "Date": "Jan 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR708338166", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "amethyst23"}, {"Content": "Optimal gelegen    showReview(22626640, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR810997718", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "When in Frankfurt I usually...   showReview(20237641, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR479894646", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Sencillo pero bueno   showReview(16732278, 'full');", "Date": "May 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR191276090", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d498814-r16123456-Hotel_Adler-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "498814", "Price": "$92"}}
