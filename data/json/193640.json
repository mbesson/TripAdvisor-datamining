One downside was the towels were handed to us after we were already in the room - the woman putting the towels out just walked in to my friend's room without even knocking, not aware that we had checked-in! We didn't eat the breakfast as we were quite hungover (eating bread rolls just seemed to be too much effort!), however we did go down for the included orange squash.

An ideal base for a night out but I probably wouldn't recommend for a longer stay as the ensuite being so small would probably get on your nerves after a couple of days! Perfect for gig-goers.

The room and shower-room were indeed small, but the bed I occupied was firm, and I slept well. Whether unusually or not, I had no noise problem at all. I missed the kettle and tea arrangements which are normal now in guest houses and hotels, and wasn't altogether convinced that the drinks machine was a substitute. But the tea was a respectable tea-bag, not powdered stuff, and I had no complaints about the quality of he drink. I suppose the coffee was instant, which is sad. The breakfast was very basic, but I don't normally eat much breakfast. Someone referred to bread slices: this is a libel. The rolls are good Italian-style rolls. My practice was to eat one with the tea and secreted the other in the paper napkin provided to eat later with cheese in Tavistock Square.

The bathroom was cleaned every day, the sheets were clean (not changed, of course). They do not change the towels every day, but I agree with that, plus it's environmentally friendly. I don't change towels in my house every day, but you can have them changed if you want to at an extra cost (1/2 pounds, I think). I slept very well. The room is tiny and so is the bathroom, but I'd rather have that than share one, and considering the price, I would say it's a pretty good bargain. We paid extra to have an English breakfast and to be honest, I could not eat everything as it was too much. But my boyfriend did, so... Continental breakfast consists of two bread rolls (one of them whole wheat, which is great for us ladies), jam and butter, milk and coffee and orange squash (more cordial, but ok). You can have more things at an extra cost. We only went to the hotel to sleep and shower so it was perfect for us. That was the second time in London and the first time I also stayed in Bayswater. It's a lovely area, near Queensway and Bayswater tube station (5 min walk), Hyde Park, Portobello market and lots of restaurants. They also have outlet adaptors and hairdryers on request, which is great. I also needed a fridge to store my insulin, as I'm a diabetic and they provided that as well, no problem. Overall, if you're looking for a budget hotel, but insist on having a good place to rest, cleanliness and location , Lords Hotel is the place to stay.

And when you washed yourself you would obviously get all the \"bathroom\" completely wet! and what to say about the poor quality breakfast? Only two old and gummy rolls, some marmalade or jam and a glass of orange juice. A croissant? \u00c2\u00a3 1.20 ! A glass of coffee or milk? \u00c2\u00a3 1.00..Thieves! And what about security? Fire doors were woody and covered with very inflammable paint...is it safe? Receptonists and waiters never help you, neither if you travel alone and you are bringin a 25 kilos baggage! Stairs are very steep and tight. Be careful not to fall down! Also pay attention to your room telephones, because you couldn't sleep during all the night if there are school classes there for a school trip. The'll make it ring all night long! Something good about Lord's Hotel? the position 200 metres to bayswater tube station , close to hyde park and 4 kilometres to marble Arch. 400 metres to Queensway station.

After reading the reviews here we were a bit worried, but decided to try the hotel anyway. We're glad that we did. Yes, the rooms aren't the prettiest and they do look worn down. Yes, the toilets may be the smallest on the planet. BUT: The price is below average in London, you have your own toilet, the sheets (and the room) are clean, you can lock your window (something that's not possible in many hotels in London that are supposed to be better than this one). On the negative side, the walls are like paper so voices from corridors and other rooms may disturb. The staff was great! Extremely friendly and helpful. I will stay here again and would recommend to budget travellers.

The bath room was so ugly: every where was mould and it smelled very ugly. the bath room is also very very small and when you shower the whole room gets wet... We also got only one towel per person for the whole stay of 4 days. When I asked at the reception for a little towel more, they told us it costs \u00c2\u00a31 for each extra towel and they won't change the towels except for extra money... Afterwards we told them that the bath was very mouldy, but when they came to have a look at the bath, they only laughed and said that it wasn't mould, but it was for certain, you could even smell it. For the breakfast you only get 2 rolls, 2 pieces of butter and 2 of jam. You can also choose between orange juice, coffee and tea. The orange juice is very ugly and the tea is too strong. For other things like croissants, toast, milk, cheese, bacon or cappuccino you have to pay extra. You also have to pay extra \u00c2\u00a33.00 per piece of luggage to deposit it in the luggage room, in the lounge it is for free. For safe deposit boxes you have to pay \u00c2\u00a31.00/day. There is one more little detail: The hotel has 3 different houses which are about one street away from each other.

The breakfast included two pieces of bread, marmelade, butter, tea or coffee, juice. You can have more if you pay a supplement. This breakfast was enough for us, we didn't need to buy extra food.
