First, on the main floor--I would gladly have stayed in this room, but on our second room we were moved to the top floor, which was even nicer. This room had beautiful views of Istanbul's Sultanahmet area and the Bosphorus strait--AND, it was adjacent to the breakfast area. This was a plus, as breakfast was delicious (and included with the price of the room). We loved eating it up on the terrace, outside with more wonderful views of the city. We traveled around Turkey for a week and came back to Istanbul at the end of our trip and had yet another room--not the \"penthouse\" this time but a room on the street side, second floor. This room had the benefit of being extremely cool--we never needed the AC, which is incredible for Istanbul in July. Everyone who worked at the hotel was extremely helpful and kind--a number of the workers speak excellent English (and also correspond over email in English). This isn't necessary for a hotel stay, but it's helpful. The Peninsula Hotel is also close to many of Istanbul's attractions--the Aya Sofia, Blue Mosque, bazaars, archaeology museum, Topkapi Palace, and Galata Tower (Beyoglu area) were all within walking distance for us.

Our room was close to the reception desk and front door but we rarely heard noise. Also, there is free wireless internet in the the room- very convenient! The breakfast consisted of a wonderful spread of assorted vegetables, fruit, jams, olives, cheeses, and bread along with fresh juice and coffee/ tea in the morning. And, I must not forget the homemade yougurt and blackberry preserves. The staff working in the dining area are equally as gracious and friendly. We spent some mornings in the kitchen just talking to the wonderful staff. Not to mention, incredible views of the sea. If you are going to be in Istanbul, you must stay at the Hotel Peninsula! Just one caution....... if you stay at the hotel, make sure you venture out into REAL Istanbul/ Turkey. The hotel is greatly located but it is situated in a very touristy area (Sultanahmet). Everyone in Sultanahment is wonderful but make sure you venture out and discover the city! Then, you can some home to your lovely hotel room! 4 stars for Hotel Peninsula!", "Date": "December 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Worth, Texas", "Title": "\u201cExactly what we needed\u201d", "Author": "julie4", "ReviewID": "UR85451523", "Content": "This hotel is awesome. It has easily the most beautiful view you could possibly ask for on the rooftop. The Hagia Sophia, Hippodrome, and the Blue Mosque are just a few blocks away. There are a bajillion restaurants at your fingertips, literally on the street in front of the hotel. FYI - the restaurants are obviously very touristy, but we found the restaurant that is literally across from the hotel's door to be the yummiest and most reasonably priced of the touristy restaurants. There are also tons of shoppes around. You can hear the ships coming in, and of course the calls to prayer. The rooms are basic but comfortable. I think some of the rooms don't have windows... so I might suggest asking for that at booking if it's important to you. The staff are very wonderful, the front desk guy that seemed to literally be there 24/7 was very, very helpful when we had random questions. The breakfast is free and on the rooftop and super yummy. One day we arrived a bit late and the gentleman made eggs just for the two of us. We used the hotel's driver for airport service and it was reasonably priced. He drove a bit nuts, but I think basically all Turkish drivers think they are Formula 1 racers. It was nice not having to worry about the taxi driver scams. The wifi was a bit spotty - but free, so no complaints here. The value for this hotel is amazing, considering the price people are paying for the same view, location, etc. The Alp Guesthouse and Sebnem (sp?) hotel are literally your neighbors.

The first time we came the staff was super friendly. The second time, not as much, but I shrugged it off. This third time the front end staff was particularly unfriendly and indifferent to my questions. This time we stayed for a whole week so we needed to get to some far out places and I would ask the front end guy that is usually there for help and he would give me a very short answer that I would later find out needed much more explanation, but I would not realize this until the most inopportune time. We had three rooms in the Grand Peninsula, and an un air conditioned room in the Grand Peninsula down the street. It was particularly warm when we were there and I encouraged the person in the Grand Peninsula to ask for a different room as they were having trouble sleeping, they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to do that, so I guess that is their problem. In the Peninsula my mother in law had a single room where the AC broke in the middle of the night with three nights to go. She asked in the morning if they could take a look at it and they did and said they would call a service person out and get it fixed that day.

We asked about it again and were told \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it will be fixed tonight\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We returned that night, nothing was fixed, no explanation. I asked at the front desk and was told \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broke\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which I obviously knew. I asked more questions, and finally he reluctantly turned off the TV he was staring at. He said the repair man came but they would have to replace the whole unit, and went to doing something else. I interrupted and asked, is there another room, he replied \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If I would have known about this earlier I could have found another room, but there are none now\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 what? How was I to know that the AC would not be fixed? I would think a properly run hotel would take care of the situation on their own. My elderly mother in law was in a hot humid room for two nights (I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to have her sleep in it a third night), I felt they should have moved her to a different room. I asked what else they could do and got a shrug. My wife finally convinced them to find a spare bed and move her to our room, which they did, without a refund for the night. Also one night in the stay we came back to our room late and nothing had been cleaned other then the comforter pulled to the top of the bed, including no new towels, which wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t normally be a problem other then it was humid and they were still wet and the shower flooded and the bath mat was completely drenched. We mentioned it to the others and my mother in law noted that her garbage was overflowing but not taken out, and the other couple had their old towels and bath mats removed and replaced with a singular clean towel.

My friends tried to pay with their cards and had trouble getting them to split the bill between their cards (though they did do it) and charging the ride from the airport (we had to let them borrow some of our liras).

Needless to say, within one day we felt like we were at home. We had everything we needed and more. I think the one person who stood out the most was a guy named, Nedjet. He always had a smile on his face, was completely laid back, and willing to do anything to make us feel safe in secure. When we left to catch our flight home, my wife forgot her passport at the hotel. I panicked and called the hotel right after being dropped of by the pickup/drop off service. I reached Nedjet who said in a very calm voice, \"don't worry, stay right where you are, and the driver will be right back to drop off another guest. He will bring the passport with him in less than an hour.\". When I offered him any amount of money out of extreme gratitude he said it was his pleasure and that it wasn't necessary! Sure enough, the driver returned in about 40 minutes with my wife's passport in tow, and we made our flight!! I have read some reviews here, and I respect the various opinions.

The manager could hardly peel his eyes away from the video game he was playing on his computer to answer our request for some hot water for tea, which was an immediate no. We did happen to arrive during the time of renovations which continued well into the late evening hours. Our room was decent enough with very comfortable beds, however there was hardly any room to move if you had any luggage what so ever. Breakfast was a let down considering the praise from Lonely Planet and the jam, yogurt, and non-existent cakes from the partner hotel across the street (with equally cold management) was with out a doubt not from someone's \"mum\", not to mention it came with day old bread if you did not arrive early.

He works during breakfast and was by far the friendliest person we met in all of Turkey, and we met a lot of friendly people!) The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to Aya Sofya, Blue Mosque and Basilica Cistern. The park is about a 20 minute walk away, and Topkapi Palace is about 10 minutes further. The rooms are extremely comfortable with enough space for our bags to be down and us still able to walk around easily. Cons? The first room we were in was on the first floor and so we could hear a lot of the people who would come in late talking. Our second room was on the second floor and did have a weird smell that another reviewer mentioned, almost like a backed up toilet. The smell was only in the bathroom, and we found we could eliminate it by keeping the bathroom door closed. But that was it.

Breakfast was served on the upstairs terrace, (the food was always fresh and plentiful and the staff friendly). From the upper terrace there are panoramic views of the Bosphorus and AyaSophia (but a future roof extension to another Hotel could potentially reduce the view of the Mosque). The staff were friendly and helpful, we were able to use a laptop for free to check emails etc. The rooms were serviced every day. This is a basic, clean, friendly boutique hotel. One problem for light sleepers is the call to prayer at 5am from the nearby minaret (about 20 metres away - with loud speakers), although this can be reduced in volume by closing the door at the end of the corridor (open for ventilation) before going to bed. (Having said that our son and his girlfriend stayed with us and slept through the call.) And any way there's no escaping the call to prayer as several Mosques are always audible from any location you might choose. My only other complaint is the tarriff being quoted in Euros and them using a daily conversion to Liras. We asked before arriving what currency to use and they said they didn't mind, I didn't think to ask for the tariff in Liras. Why would the Lira tarriff change according to the Euro exchange rate in a country that still uses the Lira on a daily basis.", "Date": "August 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "sheffield", "Title": "\u201cRelaxed and friendly attitude, a gret place to stay\u201d", "Author": "photojeni", "ReviewID": "UR37337832", "Content": "Having read the reviews of this place on trip advisor, and in our guide, I decided to pay a little more and book the larger double at this Hotel.

The hotel itself is off a main street filled with many hostels, hotels,bars and restaurants, but we had a room facing the back. I was pleased as I wonder how noisy it might be at the front.

The room was larger than average, hence the extra price, and clean, with air conditioning. The trrace was wonderful, with views over to the Sea of Mamara, and was an excellent venue for breakfast, which was very good. Always plenty of variety, including boiled eggs, cheese, meat, salad, olives, jams (some of which were home made), honey, yoghurt, cake (again home made I think), and bread, with tea, coffee and juice also available.

I loved the fresh yoghurt and fruit jams. We found the staff very friendly and helpful. The only real downside of the hotel for us was noise. We had a room facing the street, and there was music and noise from the nearby cafes until about 2am. Of course this wasn't the hotel's fault, but it did impact adversely on our stay as we were trying to get an early start to see the sites before the heat and the crowds. Because of the noise we had to resort to sleeping with the windows closed and the air conditioning on, which also kept us awake as it blasted cold air directly on to the bed. Also, while the bed was comfortable, I would have preferred the option of a sheet, in addition to the Turkish-style bedcover which was supplied. The location of the hotel is within walking distance to the major sites of Sultanahment - Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Basilica cistern, Grand Bazaar etc. The downside of this is that it is a very touristy area, and we got a bit fed up with being hassled by carpet and restaurant touts every time we left the hotel. We also found we had to go to other parts of town to find places to eat that had authentic Turkish food and didn't overinflate their prices for tourists. I felt Hotel Peninsula offered reasonable value for money, although elsewhere in Turkey we enjoyed a similar standard of accomodation for about half the price.

The location of the hotel is excellent, just a 5 minute walk down & then up hill to Hagia Sofia, but then again, this neighbourhood is hotel central.

You can go their for tea (cay) or dinner as they have a roof top restaurant. The breakfast didn't impress me that much as most of it was gone by 8:00 am and they didn't refill, but from what was left, it did seem to be fresh, especially the bread.

Our rooms are basic but clean. Our beds are all comfortable. The air conditioners work but took us a little bit to figure out how to work them. We had no problem with getting hot water in the shower during our stay. There are noise from the outside, even at night time, if you leave the windows open. We noticed it but were not disturbed by it. Breakfast is served on the terrace. We enjoyed the setting and the views. The top level has 3 hammocks which our kids like and nice view of the Sea of Mamaris, the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia. A typical breakfast is served.

Positives: - Great location, right in the middle of Sultanhamet, but off the main street (so no street noise) - Brilliant roof terrace, with chairs, tables, hammocks and great views of the sea - Nice Turkish breakfast - Very friendly & helpful owners - Reasonably priced hotel pick up Negatives - there's a speaker for the mosque a few metres away from the hotel. This is not unique to this hotel as all of the places in this area of Istanbul are within earshot of mosques. If you aren't used to mosques, bring ear-plugs. - some guests in the lower rooms complained of small rooms & dodgy beds.

After reading reviews, looking at pictures, and going to the hotel's own web page, I decided to try it since the other hotels I have stayed at before were too expensive in the summer. The nightmare of delayed flights, missed connections, and lost luggage were quickly forgotten as I settled into the Peninsula. The owner/manager H\u00c3\u00bcseyin, and all the staff made for a very pleasant stay. It was more like staying at a relative's home than a hotel. The atmosphere very laid back, friendly, charming. The room was larger than in my previous, more expensive hotel. The bed comfortable. Reliable hot water at all hours. Good working A/C. Bathroom also roomier than I have seen in many other hotels. The streets right outside the hotel is full of restaurants/cafes all open late, at least in the summer. At least 3 mini marts within a block or two are an added convenience. Location is perfect, away from the main areas yet an easy quick walk to all the attractions as well as the tram. The rooms have no TV's. The wi-fi internet is free but only available in the hotel lobby which at first I thought it might be a nuisance, but it turned out to be a very enjoyable experience sitting with the staff and other guests while using my laptop. Also, friends, family, staff from hotels across the street come in and out to make you feel part of an extended family. I had to change my booking/times a few times and the owner was very accomodating and always answering e-mails quickly. My airport pickup was timely even though my flight was delayed 5 hours. In summation, a great value for the money. Friendly, caring staff and an owner who appears to care for his business as well as for his guests.

The breakfast was delicious and substantial for all day walking aroud Istanbul. Specially the home made yoghurt with mamelade; its the best I have ever tasted when travelling aroud.

I must say from the beginning that I had a doubt about the booking system since they do not have SSL for credit card, so I didn't want to give my CC information through email, and apart from that I was afraid that they won't keep the booking for me if I didn't give any warranty. But it turned out really good. Huseyn, the guy who takes care of the hotel, was really helpful, although I kept changing the booking plan, they still kept my booking although I didn't give my CC detail. They also arranged the pick up transport with only 15 EUR (for 2 persons). The room with double bed costs 49 EUR/night, and it's already including the breakfast for 2. The room is quiet small, but if you are staying in main area of the city, then you could understand why. The bed is also quiet small, my husband is 185 cm, and he couldn't really fit on the bed. I got the first room at the hotel and it's behind the receptionist. It was quiet noisy during the day, but anyway we didn't stay much at the hotel and preferred to wander around the city, so it didn't bother much. Everything is clean so don't worry about the hygiene. In the morning, the breakfast was served on the roof, so we can enjoy the view of Blue mosque, Aya Sofia and also the sea. Thing that i really appreciate the most is the hospitality of the guys there. Huseyin indeed is very helpful and friendly to all of us who were staying there. It's definitely a great place to stay, value of the money, and you'll have the host that always makes sure you'll get only good memory from staying there.
