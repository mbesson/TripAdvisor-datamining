We did not want to rent a car and preferred walking and taxis to get us around. The Standard is only 7 blocks from The Staples Center, although they are rather long California blocks! Nevertheless, it is a nice walk, and we enjoyed being in that part of town. We felt very safe. We especially recommend a restaurant nearby that has never closed since it opened in 1924: The Pantry. Probably the best breakfast I have ever had. The hotel is a remodeled older building that has been transformed into a chic, niche hotel. The rooms are nice but adventurous. We knew ahead of time from the reviews that the shower was separated from the bed room area by a glass wall, so that was not a surprise. It did provide some opportunities for exhibitionism and laughter though. The bed was rather low as it sat on a platform. I did not mind the low bed, but the protruding platform was an obstacle. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the in-hotel restaurant was quite good. We had breakfast there 3 mornings, and we ate dinner there one night. Good food and reasonable prices. Free wi-fi!

An accident on the highway meant it took over an hour to get from LAX to Downtown... and that was after sleepless 14 hours flight from Sydney, and the marathon just to get through the airport checks. It was POURING with rain when we pulled up. We walked through the rear entrance to reception. The courtyard and foyer were vibrant and hip, yet surprisingly unpretentious. Although it was merely 10am, some 5 hours before regular check-in, we were greeted with a smile. As it was early, and I suspect because I had already booked a higher level room, I was upgraded to the top floor suite. (The rooms are so affordable, that's why the higher room was booked originally.) I will say, I have never seen an elevator with such character. I vaguely remember a bank's insignia somewhere, which would explain it's 'rich' history. Up we hummed to the 12th floor, and entered the room. It was very... designed. Maybe a little over-designed? The bed was on a platform, which looked cool, but was totally impractical. The bathtub was in the centre of the room, that to was impractical, but so very very awesome. It was huge. Easily fit two (...or three!) in there, and having a bath with all the windows open at midnight with jazz playing, one of the highlights. The minibar was stacked with goodies, and at fairly reasonable prices. It had an excellent range, and even included medicinal products. Room service was high quality, reasonably priced, and very prompt. As the room was on the top floor, right under the roof-top bar, yes, it is a little noisy. Only with the window open though, if you had the TV on or were having a conversation, you could hardly notice it when closed. Anyway, the noise stopped between 1-2am... and if you're going to bed before then while on holidays in LA, read the title, you're in the wrong hotel. This is not for peace and quiet. The hotel is in a good location for buzzing around town, the Staples Centre must be seen to be believed, but it's in a poor location for the \"glitz and glamour\" of Hollywood. A taxi is $40 one-way, and that's without traffic. The subway is a couple of bucks, but, a whole lot more confronting. Staff were helpful, I never had any trouble with the roof-top bar, and the stay was all-round fun. Hot Tips: 1 - Don't forget to get your ticket to get to the Rooftop on a Saturday night, so busy! 2 - Make sure to stop off at the Standard Shop... browse the shelves, see if you saw what I saw! hahaha 3 - Dinner out one night?

I'm only going to review the room because that's where I spent most of my time. Our room felt cold, uninviting and modern (in a bad way)--which is the opposite of how you want to feel when you're away from home. I likened it to a college dorm room with random, poor quality Ikea-like furnishings and cheap carpeting. All the furniture was low and seemed kind of ghetto. T.V. is tiny. Mattress was on a built-in platform and was asymmetrically placed, so that one side can use the platform as a semi-bedside table but the other side had nothing. I had to resort to putting my glasses, water, chapstick etc on the ground next to my side of the bed. Sleep quality was very poor--the mattress was soft and sagged towards the middle. There's only one chair in the room (the desk chair), so when my husband was using it, I literally had no where to sit except the bed. I've never stayed in a hotel before where there wasn't an arm chair. The bathroom had small white tiles with dirty gray grout--it felt like a hospital bathroom. The shower was a large stand-up shower (no tub)--which made it feel like a handicapped bathroom There is a clear window on the other side of the shower, so definitely do not share a room with someone who hasn't already seen you nude. We had to close all the curtains while showering because the building across the street would have gotten a direct view into our bathing activities. To top it off, the switch for the bed lights was by the front door, so we had to walk to the bed in the dark. What poor designs....I'll never consider staying here again.

It was a not very comfortable hard resin chair. If anyone came to visit, seating options were limited. However, if you left the shower curtain open, someone could sit on the toilet and still see everything in the room. - The bed was placed on a raised platform on the floor...careful at night or you might trip on the platform as it extends beyond the size of the mattress. - The TV (decent sized flat panel) sat on a cube only about 12 inches off the ground. - The small 1\" x 1\" tiles int he bathroom never felt clean to me...grout jsut didn't look right and was unsettling. - The counter in the bathroom is exceptionally low...very awkward. - The closet was \"concealed\" behind a curtain.

Here are the pros and cons: Pros: Downtown location, clean, the bed was comfortable for me, but it is very soft and is practically on the floor (no box spring). My colleague's back hurt after a couple nights. The rooftop terrace was really nice with a pool, dance floor and beer garden. The view from the terrace was also really nice, but you do need to be 21 to get up there so it's not kid-friendly. Cons: Room: Ultra-modern decor felt like I was back in the 60's-70's in a bad way, felt very cold and not overly functional. We also had a conference on site and the wallpaper in the room was drawings of naked ladies, very strange. The TV was not easy to see from the bed since they were both so low to the ground and at an odd angle. The cold-water knob on the bathroom faucet wouldn't turn easily and except for a pocket door to the toilet, there were only curtains separating the room from the bathroom (not much privacy). The hotel is also on a busy corner right on a bus line so it is extremely noisy during the day. Don't expect to sleep past 6 a.m. as the buses will wake you right up especially if you are a light sleeper. Service: The service was hit or miss.

This might be my own personal experience but $30.00 a day for valet parking is a little high. especially when in the same parking lot they are only charging $15.00. Also the first night there i requested a roll away upon checking in that was $50.00, and i had to request it 3 times. At the bar i ordered my usual captain and coke, except this time it was a 6oz. glass packed full of ice, so i got a shot basically and it was $8.00 and I was told that i couldnt get a double unless i tipped the bar tender and extra amount. (on a side note I feel I am a really fair tipper I usually start at 20% and if you go above and beyond I will certainly compensate you for that.) So this extra grease money to get a double drink which now costs $16.00, that is a little ridiculous. Maybe its because we are in downtown L.A. oh wait except the bar across the street is half the price for twice the drink.

I IMMEDIATELY asked if I could upgrade to a larger room but there was no availability so the first night I sucked it up and stayed in that crappy lil dorm room, with air conditioning that didn't work! I woke up in a pool of sweat... :( thirsty and tired. Back to the roof~ super kewl vibe great service... very surreal sitting up there in this oasis looking out onto all these buildings... but what a different experience! So next day...I managed to upgrade to the HUMONGOUS room and the desk girl ( Jessica) kindly gave me a better rate,, it was room 803 a corner suite wayyyy bigger and a really decent view.. trees included. The shower area and sink is private and completely done in white tile... it's so awesome and clean, and makes you want to redo your bathroom immediately !who needs a shower curtain and rug?

The phone buttons are hilarious as are the garbage can liners and the Mini Bar items. Loved the glass shower. Rooms decor is modern and sleek. The Mini Bar is very well stocked, but appears to not have been changed out in some time. Room Service food was delicious. Incredibly soft beds & pillows and no bed bugs (at least in my room) Everything you could possibly want, a phone call away. 24hrs I asked for a quiet room, and i have to admit, it was quiet. It also faced an alley so there was no view. But it was very quiet. Centrally located Great gift shop Cons: NO soda machines, no fridge in the room, no coffee maker. Nothing but the hotel restaurant (or the minibar) for food or drinks - and it's expensive. $7.50 for morning coffee. But if you don't mind the $$, this may be ok with you. Dont even think about toddling down to the uber hip cafe for coffee in no makeup & sweats. I did that once and it took the servers absolutely for-ev-er to take my order of a coffee, even though there was maybe two other customers and I was standing at the counter. Plumbing problems. First room had a toilet that ran constantly, the engineer they called said it was broken. I asked to be moved as I was going to be there all week, and they did. To a room with a toilet that gurgles and literally sprayed out the top intermittently. I draped a towel over the thing to keep the seat dry. It actually got me once, it was \"bidet-like\"(without going into details) being sprayed unexpectedly with cold toilet water and wholly unpleasant. The floor and seat were constantly wet, and the noise woke me several times during the night. The Mgr. said it was probably because it was the third floor (!?!) where the plumbing intersected. He seemed nonplussed and I wonder if he knew already. Parking. Darn, had to get up a half hour earlier just so the valets would have time to get the car out. They had great attitudes, as long as you tip. There was never any available spaces in the \"cheap\" self parking lot. At 30 a night for what boils down to mandatory valet, it adds up. Bathroom sink was stained and looked like it could use replacing. Missing room amenities. Missing Ice buckets, ashtrays, glasses, washcloths/towels (maids kept taking them and not replacing them), no robe.

The gentleman at the desk said he could not give us the gas card, we would have to wait 15-20 minutes or he could send it to us. We asked if he could just take it off our room.

I got a standard/Medium room which was plenty big enough for myself and the room came with free wi-fi though it was a bit slow as got around 11mbps. The bed was comfortable though only one side had place for clocks. Service was good though did have issue as first room smelled of recent smoking and my keycard kept failing so had to go to front desk multiple times to reswipe. This hotel is for couples and young people as do not bring kids or a friend unless you like the idea of watching your friend shower in the completely open shower(glass with no way to hide view from bed.). Did not check out fitness center. The rooftop is happening with many 20 somethings and the people they attract. I am from New York so prices were reasonable. Being hotel guest gets your priority access though they still require you to get a wristband from bouncer out front. Did not check out 24 hour diner but menu looked nice though a bit overpriced. There is no complementary breakfast as judge many people in hotel do not wake up before 10am anyway. If bring car park at self parking lot with entrance on hope st instead using valet on flower st.

The minuses: $30/day valet parking is ridiculous. The room is trying to be quirky and minimalistic... unfortunately it ends up looking a cheap, not so very well designed and just a bit too try-hard. If you're doing minimalistic, you need to do it right and the furniture and fittings need to be of certain caliber. The lamps over the bed looked like they had come from Home depot. The room just ends up looking more a like a hostel. The stripey mural that was repeating the stripes from the curtains looked like an art school dropout had decided to try and be 'fun' and 'unexpected'. The shower is in full view behind a glass wall.

So firstly, I must say the scene was very touristy (even though we were tourists) we didn't want to feel like we were just as out of place as everyone else. I think the good company really made a difference. If this place opened in SF I think I'd go all the time, because I had a feeling if it had the right crowd it'd be a really great place. That being said, the service and bartenders were very good and we still managed to meet some new and interesting people. All in all, I can say it was a good night. We retired to my room, a suite, the other guys shared a double. I really liked the design and layout, I think though this room was designed for partying and not sleeping. We had a few more drinks and then they were off to their rooms. As I got ready to sleep though all I hear was the deep bass of house music. Very faint, but it was just enough for me not to get sound sleep. The bed itself is really cool looking, but not very comfortable. When I woke up, I was sore and just cranky.

The iron couldn't be used because it had stuff burned onto it. I couldn't even use the MINIATURE (were they trying to be cute? Get a real one!) ironing board because it was broken.

Several of my favorite bars are in the area, and I chose to stay here knowing I would be having a late night nearby. Check in was easy, though I do wish parking pricing was a bit clearer. I tried to self-park as I had done when visiting the hotel in the past. The attendant directed us upstairs to the valet parking offered to hotel guests instead. The way in which he said it made me think that it might be included in the room rate, though I probably should have known better (it was $33 for a little less than 24 hours). I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the room, which did in fact live up to it's \"Huge\" title. It was spotless and had a fully stocked mini-bar, snacks etc. We made good use of the oversized bath tub which amazingly fit us both comfortably, my boyfriend at 6'4\" and myself at 5'10\". The bathtub is open to the room save for a curtain, while the toilet is behind a closed door, so if you are concerned with privacy while showering/bathing, this might not be the best choice for you. Tongue-in-cheek humour abounds, like buttons on the phone for not just the standard \"room service\" or \"front desk\", but also \"motivational speaker\", \"alibi\" and \"fluffer\". Being a guest of the hotel gets you priority access and no cover for the always popping rooftop bar in the hotel, a bonus. Keeping this in mind, our location on the 12th floor also meant we could hear muffled music from upstairs (the bar usually closes around 1:30am). Because we weren't planning to go to bed early, nor are we light sleepers, this was not a problem, but I can see how it might be for some. We grabbed a late night bite at the diner in the lobby before heading out for the night, and though the food was great, the service was very slow and inattentive. Because we arrived later in the evening we called down to the front desk in the morning to see about late check-out, and they happily accommodated us an extra hour so we could make good use of the sun while lounging in the rooftop pool. This is based on availability though, so when the hotel is near capacity it may not be possible. We did have to wait a bit at the rooftop pool while some hotel staff took measurements and talked, I assume for a possible future redesigning. Once they were done we also had to wait for staff to bring up towels in spite of the fact that it was several hours after the pool usually opens. For those who have never visited LA before, don't be deceived into thinking this hotel's \"downtown\" location places you in the heart of everything as it would in New York, Chicago or Toronto. LA is really a massive sprawling suburb with islands of interest scattered all about. Staying at The Standard won't place you next to the beach or the Hollywood strip. It is however really a destination in itself with an amazing lobby lounge, rooftop bar and pool, 24 hour diner and very spacious rooms. The downtown area, although it can seem quiet after office hours, has many fantastic restaurants and bars tucked away and is ideal if you happen to be in town on the second Thursday of the month for the Downtown LA Art Walk when the streets become flooded with people visiting area galleries. The Staples Center and Convention Center are both nearby and the property is also conveniently located near the 110 and 10 freeways, and so relatively easy to get to other parts of the city.

We should have read the reviews first because this place is a) nothing special and b) just not a good hotel. Having read some of the answers provided by management on this Website, I understand that this hotel wants to be just a little bit different from the others. This, I would wager, they have achieved but at what cost? The staff are different from other hotels but only in the sense that they are not customer-service oriented in a sort of Abercrombie & Fitch way, i.e. I was recruited for my good looks but don't know what the word 'denim' means. The man at check-in did not look at us, did not smile, did not say much and actually tossed me a piece of paper to sign without even providing a pen. The rooms are a completely style-over-substance nightmare. If you take the few 'arty' elements out of it, you're left with nothing more than a youth hostel interior and, let's be honest, its design isn't that hot either (but then I suppose I didn't stay in the room with the big black foot in the bathroom). I mean, every hotel has one or two pictures on the wall you know. You can literally count how many drops of water reluctantly make their way out of the shower head, the bed is too low and too soft and just not comfortable in any way, and the television is too low to be seen from the bed (and we didn't have a sofa either). The noise coming from upstairs and the other rooms were just too loud to be acceptable. I understand the idea of having the quirky bar and party-people audience but then do what other hotels do: Soundproof the walls with something other than cling film. I stay at hotels more than four months every year and have seen many rooftop bars. The main thing to address here is that you are not a nightclub; you are a hotel. If you wish to add one, make sure it's not at the expense of the other. By the way, the bar on top is mediocre at best. The staff upstairs seem to have been infected by the same disease as the ones downstairs. If the cocktail you ordered isn't hip enough, they treat you with the same disdain as they would someone who ordered a glass of milk (and I was tempted to check this out). In conclusion, of all the boxes that a hotel should tick, you really don't tick the ones that matter. It's really as simple as that. Is it comfortable? No. Did I sleep particularly well? No. Was it pleasant? No. Was I made to feel welcome? No. Of the things you pretend to be - something beyond the standard - you only rarely come close.

Our room was not ready upon arrival--which happens--but the staff refused to provide any estimate of when it would be ready and was completely unapologetic. Room service, although delicious, brought us something other than what we had ordered. The room design was also inconvenient: two desks in a double room--but only one chair. The sink and bathroom counter are so low to the ground that anyone taller than 3' will have significant difficulty doing any task (i.e. applying makeup) that requires a mirror. The final inexplicable detail that added inconvenience was the bill itemization--which was completely different in our room (via the tv bill access) and at the concierge desk.

I asked that the mini-bar be taken out because I did not want to have to worry about my 13 year old munching on stuff. The clerk told me to not worry as he would simply just not give me the key. However, when I arrived in the room, the fridge was locked but there was still a big box of snacks and such. I was running so late for my engagement that I did not want to bother calling down to desk to request that it be removed. The room was very bare-bones. There was a king bed on a platform on the floor (we wanted two beds but they were sold out), a wall-length table/desk that was attached to the wall under the wall sized window, ONE chair and a tv. There were also two phones; one by the bed and one on the desk, which was nice. I can't recall much more in the room. It was a very large room, or maybe it just seemed that way because of the lack of furniture. There was no dresser with drawers however the closet has some shelves in it that one could put clothes on. However, one side of shelves was taken up by the snack box, a big pile of magazines, and iron, extra pillow/blanket and so on. The A/C did not work well at all so the room was rather warm. Again, we were running late for our engagement and did not even realize it was not working until we got back late and went to bed. Not the time to call maintenance. The thing I hated the most was that anyone using the shower had NO PRIVACY. Right next to the bed was a huge, glass wall that was also the wall for the shower. There was a shower curtain on the other side so if someone was brushing their teeth at the sink or something then they would not see the person showering. However, if another person was anywhere in the room, they totally see the person showering. Luckily I had some packaging tape so we taped up some newspaper on the glass wall to give us some privacy. Otherwise it would have been very awkward for both me and my 13 year old son to be in the room while the other showered. Even if I was on a romantic getaway I would still want a privacy curtain or something for when I showered. At least there was a door to where the toilet was! Another thing was that I was with a convention group and the hotel was booked solid, but not just by our group. Apparently we were supposed to have two entire floors. I was on the floor where we had rented out the \"Blonde Room\" for a party type of gathering. We partied until 5am. However, the hotel booked 2 rooms on the floor to people who were not with our group so they did not like the noise and kept complaining about us. I can understand that but it was the hotels fault for booking anyone else on that floor when we were promised to have the floor to ourselves. So we had to keep it down and keep the doors closed to the room. Again, the AC did not work in there either so it was very hot. We were there during the record-breaking heat wave at the end of September, 2010 so the lack of good A/C in the hotel was a drawback. Now I will have to say that the room was clean but it hardly made up for the bad A/C and lack of privacy in the shower in the room. The Standard is an OK hotel and I hear they have a good nightclub and nice roof-top pool but we did not go to either so I can't say for sure. So, if you are traveling solo or with someone you have an open relationship with, they I'd recommend it.

The lobby was definitely a party scene with a long line outside for the rooftop bar and techno/house music poured through the lobby and restaurant. The room had an institutional feel, like the waiting room of a 1970s doctor's office. It reminded me of the movie \"A Clockwork Orange\" but not in a good way. There was a mattress on the floor with average bedding, a L shaped couch covered in some orange synthetic fabric and the walls were all white with a hideous striped wallpaper print over one wall. The bathroom felt like a high school locker room but with a large foam black foot in the middle and the toliet paper and tissues were poor quality. The first night's stay was tolerable, but the next two nights were hell as the hotel turned into party central and there was a birthday party in the room next to us and the music literally pounded through the walls all night. I had to call security 3 times to quiet them down, but they barely turned the music down. Finally it stopped at 3am, but the walls were very thin and I could hear everything. It was hell and even though the next night I was assured the birthday party guests checked out somone equally obnoxious checked in sunday night who had the same taste in music. The rooms were all sold out and we had no choice but to stay. There ar even more odd things that happened with our room but all I will say is if you are not coming here to party and have any real standards then avoid this hotel.

First of all we could not find this hotel easily since its in an office building that looks like just that-an old, bland office building. After finally finding it, we were told they were farther away from the Staples Center than we thought. Valet is $30.00, plus we would have to take a cab or drive & pay for parking as well unless you take a shuttle, which we never saw. That is downtown LA: Parking costs are HIGH. After spending the day at the Film Fest we went back to The Standard, looked around & then went to our room. We found a ping pong table in the lobby next to the elevators & a lobby that is truly (not made to look it) from the 60-70''s & obviously is in an office building that was never updated. A fuze ball table + firepit are in the frontage area/parking lot. Bright pink modern furnishings light up a nearly totally dark lobby & an empty, but cool looking bar finishes it off. There was some cool stuff there & I had hopes for a nice room to match. There is an escalator that leads up from there, but we never checked it out since young people were sort of running around the area on top. The rooftop pool area sounds like its a happening p,lace, but we were very tired from the Fest. So, we ordered very late night room service which was good & not crazy expensive. One BIG gripe I have is after my husband asked for ice with our meal, so we could have ice water, the person taking orders told him its down the hall & in essence to get it himself with the ice bucket from our room. Before calling him back myself we looked for an ice bucket. Finding none & being outraged that Room Service, at any hotel, would basicly say \"get it yourself\" I called to give the kitchen a piece of my mind. I got a nervous response after saying \"do you mean to tell me you don't have ice in your big kitchen down there??\" that they do but \"do not have ice buckets to bring it in.\" I told him to bring 2 glasses full of ice & hung up. Thats all we wanted & what he should have asked about when it was requested. I guess 20 somethings are willing to put up with allot of BS from hotel staff, but trust me when I say that 40 somethings spending their $$$$ do not & know paying to get food delivered to you whenever, getting a comfortable, clean & hopefully plush feeling & clean feeling atmosphere in which to spend their 24 short hours (its acutually less when you add up the hours you pay for) is what we are paying for and expect. without any excuses. If there are issues in the hotel...take it up with the boss, otherwise I don't want to hear excuses. When you check in, the face that checks you in & welcomes you should reflect joy that you picked his or her employers hotel for your expensive night away from home. We didn't get that & when we don't get that we don't go back & we spread the word...period. What happend to high standards in the U.S.?? The rooms: are sort of Star Trekky. Walls are bright white with a mod vibe. The bed is on a platform & the blanket smelled very, very strongly of smoke. Without it I would have been cold or I would have removed it abonded it to the furthest point away from us. In fact, the whole hotel smells of smoke & after complaining about it the next day were told their clientele is mainly European & they have only partially non-smoking floors, which to me is sort of point less since smoke travels. So, this place is no good for those who want smoke free environments in which to breath in:( No msoking laws don't apply to hotel rooms...I learned something new. There is a 70's feel here, especially in the breakfast room that is BRIGHT yellow & screams WAKE-Up! I expected Doris Day to be sitting around the corner. We were curious about this place because we saw \"Get Him To The Greek\" & it was near our key location. My curiousity is over & I we were happy to leave. In fact, I entertained the idea of leaving & not sleeping there at all, even if we were charged for the night. The smoke smell is gross, the cleaning solution the maids use is really strong & really bad-like oven cleaner that you smell when walking down the halls. They are definaltey not using eco-friendly products here, which I sincerely wish they would change. The street noise of buses goes on all night.

We booked at the Standard because the rooftop bar was appealing. Unfortunately, it rained the whole time so we didn't go, but that obviously isn't the hotel's fault. We had a King room (not sure what that is - I think Large?) and the huge bathtub was amazing. However, the bath area decor doesn't do much for the room. I get that they are going for the \"locker room\" style look, but the tiny tiles did nothing for the illusion of cleanliness of the room. It made it look dirtier than it probably was, and the huge, room-long ledge to put your toiletries on caused me concern, because I simply couldn't imagine that they regularly cleaned all the cracks in between the tiny tiles. I wouldn't put anything there without putting a towel down first. The actual bathroom was very weird. It was a fully tiled \"room\" with a sliding door, with nothing but the toilet and toilet paper inside. It was oddly large, and when you turned the light on, an unflattering and unrelaxing fluorescent light flickered on. I was not happy when this happened at 4 am when I just wanted to use the bathroom quickly. I think some reviews touched upon the noise factor. It's very true - the walls are thin and you will hear everything. We were on the 9th floor and as I was going to sleep I faintly heard the music from the rooftop lounge. Not much, though. However, the group of guys who came back around 2:30 am were a totally different story. We had just gone to bed when they arrived, and for an hour I heard every bit of their conversation, as if they were in the room.

The barber and shop in the lobby are gorgeous and we couldn't walk past without checking them out. On the other hand the basics I expect of a hotel weren't always up to par. The pillows were small and uncomfortable. The toiletries in our rooms were half used and we had to ask several times for new ones. In fact, that was a recurring theme, the staff were most willing to help but the communication between staff was so poor that we almost always had to ask twice. The bathrooms were big but the big glass window between the shower and the rest of the room made me anxious despite the sheer modesty curtain we could pull across it. Some of the staff didn't seem to have a great knowledge of the area but made an attempt to help us anyway. Overall, the theme saved the day. Was it the best hotel service I've ever enjoyed? Of course not. But it was an experience and when you travel, sometimes that makes up for whatever shortcomings a hotel might have. I wouldn't recommend this to my parents because the beds would be too low and they always say that when you've lived retro, it doesn't appeal as much; but to my friends who appreciate commitment to a theme, or who are experimenting with the hipster lifestyle, I would definitely recommend giving it a go.", "Date": "January 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "utah", "Title": "\u201cNot the greatest.\u201d", "Author": "karawebster", "ReviewID": "UR54186346", "Content": "The Standard is a fun and hip hotel.

While this city abounds with boutique hotels, creative concepts and flashy scenes, I love the Standard Downtown Hotel. Here's why: 1. A touch of history, in history-sparse L.A. (the former headquarters of the Standard Oil Company, a corporate titan of days-past that is probably lost on the younger patrons that stay and party at this hotel. The lobby still has the original old clocks with the time in cities around the world.) 2. Location amidst the soaring glass skyscrapers of downtown L.A. is an urban flavor of the city that is often overlooked for the more obvious draws of the touristy Sunset Strip. Dancing on the rooftop to the beats of an edgy top DJ, martini in hand, surrounded by beautiful women of the world... 3. Boutique basics done marvelously well. The Standard pulls together quality standards of the boutique hotel offering, I would almost say \"defining\" what so many other boutique properties in the world aim for, yet remaining on the minimalist side of luxury. Low-slung beds set on a platform instead of bed frame. Mixing bar for your cocktails in room. Plasma tv. Big spacious bathroom with glass-walled walk-in showers built for 2... or 3. Spacious sliding closets. Plush toileteries. Modern lobby with DJ-driven action in the evenings, complete with billiard table, lounging area, restaurant on the terrace outside amidst candlelight and palm trees with smart cocktails and well-constructed food. 4. Price. You can pay a lot more for a boutique hotel in L.A. At the Standard Downtown, at the right price, you get a lot of \"L.A.\" and \"boutique experience\" bang for your buck.

The morning guy even helped me move stuff from my trunk so the luggage could fit. -I took some things from the mini bar but they were never charged...I think thats a pro!

You should take everything I say with a grain of salt given that we stayed here from Sunday through Wednesday and therefore missed most of the alleged weekend pretentiousness/noise and attitude. We had no problem checking in or with any of the other amenities. By amenities, I mean that we ate dinner and breakfast at the restaurant downstairs (food was good, service was fine), went up to the rooftop bar on Tuesday night (no wait because you get a wristband for staying at the hotel), used the gym (small and depressing) and used the valet parking at the hotel every day. Each of these services were provided in a timely and appropriately polite manner. My biggest complaint is that on Sunday, the day of our arrival, the floor that we stayed on was littered with plates and cups from room service earlier in the day and the plates and cups were not removed until around 11 pm that night even though a number of hotel staff (maids included) passed the littered areas. Plates and cups may not sound that gross but there were half eaten omelettes, oatmeal and fruit left on the floor to attract god knows what kinds of pestilence. If this small incident is any indication of how service on the weekends is, I probably would not stay at The Standard. However, our stay for the rest of the weeknights went without incident and, in fact, we made bets about how long it would take before the room service plates on Monday morning would be removed (we left our room at 8:30 am and they were removed by the time we returned at 11 am -- an overall improvement from our experience the previous day). The rooms are decorated and reminiscent of college dorms. The furniture is plastic and the bed is on a platform on the floor.

Upon pulling up to the valet you will be greeted by some of LA's finest people who park cars for a living. They will probably be rude and definitely question if you are meant to be valeting with them. Clearly unless your car is an European import, you may not be welcomed by them, and they certainly will not be welcoming of the $2 tip which these people are totally not worthy of. 2. You will check in, with your confirmation number (as printed on your email) and your reservation will not be in their system. Despite your confirmation email, prepayment, and prepared hard copy - they will somehow be either unable to spell your four letter name, or unable to in fact locate your booking. 3. After a minor delay, potentially 15 minutes, your booking will be located. 4. Proceed to the elevator and proceed to your suite. Upon opening of the elevator doors you will be greeted with the pleasant aroma's of a mixture of dried vomit, and bong smoke. 5. Enjoy your suite, over priced, but expansive none the less. Don't worry about the desperate need of a facelift. This kind of decor is popular amongst the \"wanna be\" community. 6. Please enjoy the breakfast on the ground floor. \"The Restaurant\". The menu options are limited, however within the hour you should see your server, and you may even have a drink. By the 90 minute mark you may have some food. You're not in a rush anyway, and you certainly have nothing better to do - despite the fact you could have flown to Seattle in this time and probably finished your breakfast by then anyways. 7. Interested in some evening activities? Try the roof top bar! If you are lucky enough to be there on a weekend you will probably only have to wait 40 minutes to be told by the bar tender \"don't even talk to me\". You may get a drink, but let's face it, who is thirsty on a Saturday night anyways? 8. Question the length of time in which your service takes and you will need to kindly make yourself available for several profanities which the bar tender will pleasantly throw your way. Who needs to conduct a civil conversation anyway? 9. If your bar tab is over $200 you will be auto charged a gratuity. Try and question this, and the manager \"T\" will kindly inform you of how many years service his bar tenders have put in - and clearly despite your current state of soberness you are clearly wrong - and whatever you say clearly isn't worth listening to anyways. 10. Proceed to document your thoughts on Trip Advisor - on the Standard's free (yet painfully slow) wireless internet service wishing that your holiday could somehow be cut short - and you could return to your pleasant life as far away as possible from these Neanderthals.", "Date": "August 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vail, CO", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel seeks authorization on your form of payment of $150.00 per night of your stay\u201d", "Author": "COskibunny", "ReviewID": "UR35871137", "Content": "The Standard, Downtown LA, had to rate as one the worst hotel experiences I can remember.

If you want a true LA experience (many TV shows and movies have been filmed in this hotel) and are looking for something different and unique, then this hotel is the perfect hotel for you! First off, the Standard is not for everyone. I don't recommend the hotel for elderly couples, families travelling with children of any age or \"conservative\" people. We stayed in the Medium room, which I thought was affordable (at $155/night) given the area. The hotel is decorated in a vintage/retro/modern manner - very cheeky with platform beds and toiletries that look like they were from the 70's. The room was also packed with the most unique and abundant assortment of snacks and goodies from the typical drinks, candies and cookies to a bottle of Mr. Bubbles (though I wasn't sure why since the room didn't have a tub, only a shower?), condoms, candles, maps, umbrella and CD's (just to name a few). The most unique feature of the room was that the shower was made of glass, so you can be seen taking a shower from the bedroom in plain view. It was great for my husband, but I don't know if I would want to stay in the same room with my parents (if you know what I mean...!). The room was clean and intentionally sparesely furnished. For music lovers, don't forget your iPod! Since we stayed there on a weekend, we got free entrance to the Rooftop club on the top. We didn't have a chance to go during our stay since we were there for business reasons, but we've been up there in the past and it's definitely a MUST SEE for visitors and locals. We've eaten at the restaurant in the first floor many times before and the food there is consistently good. I wish they brought back the fish and chips though as the menu had changed slightly since the last time I ate there. For those who are visiting or new to LA, the hotel is located in a somewhat good location as there's a lot of things to visit within walking distance - such as MOCA and the Disney Hall. Little Tokyo, Chinatown, Staples Center, Convention Center and Dodger's Stadium are within a short driving distance. Since it is downtown LA, the night life isn't as obvious, but there are a lot of good restaurants to eat within walking distance and if you have a car (which is always recommended if you visit LA since everything is so spread out), Pasadena would be the closest recommended city in my opinion. Just keep in mind that it's $15 if you park overnight. The only reason why I didn't rate this hotel full stars was because despite the shower being big enough to fit 2 people (or more), the water pressure wasn't very good and the temperature control was sensitive (either too hot or too cold).

By day the hotel functions as a professional business hotel but by night it becomes a hip nightspot with the rooftop pool and bar, surrounded by waterbed pods and lounging sofas, attracting a trendy crowd.

When I finally exited the car to approach him, he was chatting with another hotel staff member about a sport event. When I went to interrupt I was told to hold on a minute. I took the bags out of my car and waited for an ADDITIONAL ten minutes while the chatting continued until he turned and said, just leave it, I'll park it in a while. When I asked if I needed a claim check, he said \"No, just your room number.\" I was uncomfortable with this (and rightly so, I would learn later) especially since when I exited the hotel 30 minutes later my car was still there with the door wide open. That evening I scheduled a wake up call with the front desk for 7:30a, as I had a shoot down the street at 8am. I was dismayed when the call came 25 minutes late. When I asked why it was late, the response I was given was \"Oh, is it, oops...\" I subsequently rushed to get out of the door on time, called the valet to pull the car around and went to check out. When I got to the front desk I returned the keys and gave my information and went to head outside when I realized... I had been checked out of the wrong room and charged incorrectly. When I returned to the desk, the annoyed clerk (like his error was my fault... I gave him my name AND room number) serviced everyone else, then came back to me, taking an additional 20 minutes to correct his errors. Without apology. When I went to valet I noticed my car was not there, even though at this point it was almost a half hour since I called. He informed me that no one told him to bring the car around (although I had called the desk and requested it). Then after 10 minutes of running around he realizes that the valet yesterday never marked my keys and they didn't know which car was mine... Another 15 minute debacle...

The hotel is very hip, with interesting colors, shapes and textures throughout the room. The hotel and its rooms are actually quite different and I applaud the owners for doing something other than the usual cookie cutter approach that is typically seen. Now the downside. The hotel is one big loud party for drunken 20-somethings. The top floors smell of smoke, beer and stale cleaning towels. Lower floors are better and our room on the 8th floor was very clean. Many of our neighbors were kids in their twenties and they were up late partying and were very noisy. I hailed a cab in front of the hotel and as I walked to it, a couple of kids tried to outrun me to the cab. When I told them I had hailed it (and was a half block ahead of them), they called me profanities and threatened to fight me. That gives you some insight as to the mentality (or lack thereof) of the hotel's clientiele. Service was poor. I had to ask for extra towels and a bathrobe 4 times. When calling to ask questions, I was put on hold for very long waits (10+ minutes) and disconnected several times. The bed is a platform bed and you sleep pretty much on the floor. I have a platform and prefer to sleep a bit higher up, but that's a preference thing I suppose. The shower is clear glass on all sides and anyone in the room will watch you shower. My lady friend didn't care for it. It didn't bother me much, but if you're shy, this could be a problem for you, as you will be unquestionably putting on a show for your roommates. Again, it's an interesting hotel. Something different to be sure. But if you're traveling on business, going for a vacation with the family, or easily annoyed by loud, drunken partiers, I'd probably skip it. I don't regret staying at the Downtown L.A.

This was not The Marriott. The service was good, but I'm not a real demanding guy. My laptop broke on the plane and I needed a screwdriver. At midnight i asked the effeminate front desk guy for a screwdriver and he acted like he'd never heard of one before, but he was helpful, and about a half-hour later the maintenance guy knocked on my door with my screwdriver. Asking for off-the-wall stuff in the middle of the night and getting without much effort it is good service if you ask me. The agency that booked my room screwed up and had me check out a day early, but the front desk guy came thorugh again and got me another night. The rooms were sparsely and uniquely decorated, which is the point, but the beds were comfortable and the glass-walled shower was making me wish my wife was traveling with me. :) Wish it had wireless, but the free high-speed wired internet is nice. Didn't have a noise problem until Thursday night when there was a band downstairs, I was 3 floors up and was feeling every bass note. The rooftop bar is the coolest thing aboiut the hotel. The co-ed bathroom where you have to guess which way is the men's side is quite an adventure, and trying to figure out how to work the magic hidden sink is frustrating after a few beers. The view is awesome, and the \"talent\" up there is astounding. It was like a modeling convention. Drinks are expensive and the beer selection isn't great, but it's an experience.

I had heard of the Standard at some point, but didn't know much about the reputation until after I had already booked it. Basically, the best things about the Standard Downtown are the 1st floor restaurant and the rooftop pool & bar. The restaurant food is quite good and the portions are very generous. The menu is not that extensive, but I would say acceptable for a hotel restaurant. The drinks are very good; I highly recommend the mojitos. If you are planning to go to the rooftop after dinner, get some drinks in the restaurant first since they are a lot better. The wait staff is *very* friendly and not at all pretentious (which I noticed was a complaint from some earlier review). The rooftop bar: there is a small dancefloor in the corner, but the DJ is actually next to the bar which is set apart from the dancefloor. There is a nice 360 degree view of downtown LA, but because the hotel isn't the tallest building, the view is just \"above average\" (i.e., not great, not bad). You do get an interesting view of the main LA Public Library which is beautiful. Drinks are average--the quality is hit/miss--depending on how busy they are. Friday and Saturday nights are *extremely* busy. I believe there is a $20 cover for the rooftop bar, but if you are a hotel guest, you & 1 additional person can enter for free. As a hotel guest, going to the roof on Fri/Sat is a bit of a hassle because you need to go down to the parking lot where they distribute the wristbands and show your room card in order to get your wristbands. You have to get a separate band for Friday and Saturday. The good thing is that once the hotel workers see your room card, you do not have to wait in line. They are very good about pulling you to a separate area to give you your bands right away. The rooftop is open 7d/week, and it is definitely not as crowded Sun-Tues, but still fun. There are heating lamps upstairs & an outdoor fireplace so you won't be cold. The pool is heated and probably a lot of fun. There was a private event on the roof which shut down the pool the one day I wanted to go swimming, so check with the front desk before you go there. The rooms are nicely sized. There is a platform bed and a minimalist wall desk along the window side of the room. Most of the rooms have simply a glass wall separating the bathroom from the bedroom. If there is a double bed, there is a retractable showerside curtain along the glass wall for privacy. If you get a single bed, there is no privacy curtain. I had a wheelchair accessible room so there was actually a solid wall with a tall skinny window separating the bathroom from the bedroom. There is no wireless in the rooms, but an ethernet cable is available upon request when you check in. The walls are very thin, so I unfortunately heard quite a bit of amorous noise from the room next door. In terms of nearby dining, Zucca's is good; the Daily Grille across the street has a nice happy hour with drinks & appetizers. There are a lot of small eateries within 1 block, but they typically close fairly early. The Westin Bonaventure is 1 block away and there is a revolving restaurant on the top floor which offers a very mellow setting for dessert (huge portions) and drinks. Overall, it's a convenient hotel--definitely a place to go that's hip and social. I think it's a good place to stay for a meeting since you just have to go upstairs for PM entertainment.

Cheap rates are often to be had on the hotel site ($119 seems to be the best), but beware: that price will likely put you on a lower floor, and both times I've stayed on the 3rd floor, the noise has been astounding. In August of 2006, a party in the next room featured top-of-lungs screaming and banging on the walls at 4am; repeated calls to the front desk were met with indifference and mockery. On the most recent visit, a party a few rooms down featured drunken carousing in the halls until 5am. I understand the Standard is not the Holiday Inn, but it's also not a frat house, and the staff don't seem to care if it becomes one. However, perhaps staying on an upper floor is the answer: when I've either paid for a better room or been upgraded (only once in probably 15 stays!) it has been extremely quiet, even on weekend nights. Maybe they throw all the partiers on the 3rd floor? Next time, I'll try requesting a higher floor. For the price, I still think it's one of the more interesting and practical hotels for the traveler interested in unique experiences and good modern design. Sure, the decor isn't the jaw-dropping surprise it was a few years ago, but the rooms are still very clean, the beds are comfortable, and a glassed-in shower is pretty cool. My experiences with room service and the restaurant have been mostly good (although trying to get breakfast at 6am before an early flight was practically impossible, due to missing wait staff and \"computer problems\"). The food is pretty good. Understand that the weekend bar/rooftop scene is part of LA nightlife and thus pretty pretentious, but you're staying in the hotel and it's free, so why not go enjoy a rooftop cocktail with the trying-to-be-beautiful? Yes, there's wristbands/cards/whatever, but it's not Omaha, and it wouldn't be as fun if it was. Anyway, there's so much more to do in LA you shouldn't be hanging at the hotel on a Saturday night. In general, I still applaud the hotel's existence, as a fine example of creative reuse of its former bank building, and as a pioneer in the reemergence of downtown LA. Plus, focusing on what current, young travellers really want and need (some quality snacks in the minibar, instead of crappy coffee and a dirty coffeemaker, for example) make it much more practical than comparitively priced hotels. So, I guess the biggest concern is the extreme level of noise, and the staff's lack of response to it. It's my hope that the indifference the staff has recently shown is not a sign that the Downtown Standard has started to slip in general. The hotel can still be lively and fun without degenerating to anarchy, and in my opinion, paying $120 for a room should guarantee a basic level of quiet, at least from 1 or 2am to 7 or 8am on weekend nights.

I didn't expect much since I ate most of it. Mabye I expected someting like, \"I'm sorry to hear that sir. I can give you a free desert.\" I would have settled for \"I'm sorry.\". The bill was $400 for 4 people so I think a free desert is pretty reasonable. The waiter said, \"That's too bad.\" Huh? What kind of waiter says that? Anyway, he left and I told my friends that I was going to give the him a chance to save his tip. Finally, when he returned I asked him if he was at all curious what was wrong with my steak or how anyone else's meal was. The waiter immediately copped an atitude with me and said, \"What do you want me to do?!?!? I have other tables and don't have time to deal with you.\" He made me suggest a method of resolution which I finally did after being pushed to the point of anger. The waiter never came back and the manager came out telling me that I ate most of my steak and there's nothing she can do about it. I told her I didn't expect a free steak and informed her of the waiter's attitude. She told me that he said he had done everything he could with you people. That's when I flew off the handle and ended up in a heated argument with the manager. When I asked the waiter to join the conversation he flatly said \"no!\" and walked away. It was unbelievalbe. Anyway, I'm the type of customer that tips 15% if the service is bad and 25% for anything above avereage. I left the waiter $.01. This was, hands down, the worst service I've ever had in my life. The next day we were forced to eat breakfast at the same spot since there was no other place open at the time within walking distance. Our breakfast (bagles and oatmeal) took 30 minutes to arrive and the staff was just as rude as the night before. My point is that if you are over 25 yrs old or so you should not stay here. The place is a flop house and is intended for partying only. The staff acts like they're doing you a favor by giving you an ounce of their attention. I would have gotten better service at a Best Western. I cannot overstate how bad this hotel is. By the end of my 24 hr stay the room, dinner, drinks at the roof baf and breakfast ended up costing me and my girlfriend approx. $700.

Who knows? Face-lifted from the old Superior Oil office building, the hotel is well located for business meetings. The rooms are very large and wonderfully appointed in a minimalist way, if your taste runs in that direction. I stayed for one-night, midweek in early April. No one helps you find your way to the room, which isn't a big deal for me. But upon arriving at my room, I found a used glass sitting by the door. I didn't pick it up nor did I call housekeeping to take it away. Instead, I wanted to see whether the hotel staff would clear it on its own...the glass was still there when I left for dinner, was still there when I returned from dinner, and was still there when I left in the morning. Given the service level at the hotel (there was no one manning the reception desk when I arrived and when checking out, the receptionist was on the phone, focused on an impending photo shoot to be held in one of the rooms), my guess is that the glass is still there. Since I won't be staying at the hotel again, I won't be able to check whether the glass is still there when I return to LA for a business trip at the end of the month. Image is everything at the hotel. It's style over substance, but then again, perhaps, since I'm a \"suit\", I didn't get a level of service that may be reserved for the truly hip.

One problem is if you're hungry, there is no convenience stores in the area and it's a hassle to get in your car and drive anyplace. If you valet your car, you have to wait for him to find it, if you self-park, you're charged a full day rate EVERY time you come and go.

I called to find out what the specific charges were but it was taking a long time and it was only $5 so I gave up. My main problem with this place is the security. The front desk help is nice, as are the waiters, waitresses, and bartenders, but the guys doing security, as well as the young woman who tries to act as the hostess, are the bottom of the barrel as far as customer service is concerned. If you're a hotel guest, you won't have much trouble getting into the upstairs bar, but you'll be treated rudely by the snobby hostess and the hispanic security guard downstairs nonetheless. If you're not a hotel guest, you probably won't get in at all, even if the bar is empty. The security and the hostess feel that a long line will make the bar seem more attractive, and they feel like important people for making $6.75 to stand there.

It took us one hour after checking in to take the decision we would move to a different hotel the very next morning. It does not take much to explain the reason of our decision: the hotel may have been trendy but was providing us with quite an uncomfortable accomodation. The room was minimalist, we knew that, with no frills, essential furniture and amenities, and that was not a big issue indeed. What drove our decision was the bathroom. The bathroom had no bathtub where we could have a bath and relax and it had a huge open window overlooking right the bedroom preventing having any minimum privacy when using it. The other major attraction of this hotel was the rooftop bar. Very nice indeed, but do not expect to have special treatment just because you are guest of the hotel.

I got a grilled cheddar sandwich with bacon and tomato inside with shoestring fries - it was fabulous! Others got a cheeseburger, chicken club sandwich, fish n chips, omelette, and chocolate souffle cake. As you can see, they offer a wide variety of dishes and all of them were quite fulfilling at 2am. My fiance and I got to bed around 4:30am - we ended up taking a bubble bath in our gigantic bathtub. I'm not kidding, it could have easily fit 4 people. Before going to bed, we put our breakfast order on our front door and when it arrived at 10am, we were so glad we ordered it. The fruit plate was fantastic, the chicken apple sausage was mouthwatering, and the eggs and pancakes were perfectly cooked. We were so glad we chose The Standard for our pre-wedding celebration.

Overall, great hotel if you are feeling like a departure from the USUAL beige, boring chain hotel.

Pass through a hip lobby adorned with half-dressed young rock star and bohemian look-alikes, or are they for real?

Stuff the card key in the slot with faint hope of what lies inside but expecting the worst. After some fumbling, a switch that turns on some lights and. . . . Yes, yes, yes! I said aloud. Yes. They get it. Why the jubilation? The place is thoughtfully designed and arranged. From the multiple dataports offering free high speed Internet, high quality CD player/alarm/radio with aux ins and outs, largish TV on a rolling cart, long desk area overlooking the window, and covered wastebasket (I think that's what it is) built into the bathroom counter, to the iron and board, wine glasses, robe, extra pillows, and soap already out and awaiting you in the shower. Rather than the usual tourist pablum they left three glossy trendy magazines that make for good reading. Nowhere outside of Italy have I seen such a good job of turning what is basically a budget hotel in an old building into a showcase of wit and style. The minibar is a sight to behold, and the prices are (for a minibar) reasonable. Not just the usual crackerjacks, red bull, and condoms. . . but thougtful extras: a map, sunblock, scented candle, a loungy CD, and my favorite -- pokeman vitamins! Public areas follow suit. The rooftop lounge / pool / bar is what makes the Standard famous, and true to form it was a zoo. We're talking five security guards, unbearably stylish visitors from Japan, a DJ and elbow-to-elbow crowds dancing, a drunk visitor escorted out the door, all this in the wee hours Monday morning. The room service menu is creative (24 hour a day miso soup), inexpensive, and runs all night long. And some of the design touches are laugh-out-loud funny without losing either elegance or a sort of innocent sincerity. Example? Room numbers outside each door are printed on \"Hello, my name is. . . \" cards. They seal each roll of toilet paper with a sticker showing, well, you have to see it. Why not five stars? This place is clearly not for everyone. Most rooms are small. If you are over forty like me you had better enjoy youth culture. There is almost no reason to stay in downtown LA except for business because it is boring by day and shuts down early. You had better be intimate with your roommate -- the glassed-in shower/toilet has no shield curtain from the main room. And no matter how high oncept it is still an old budget hotel. Fortunately, it is priced to match. It is a good value even at full rack rate. With this much cleverness there are always a few mistakes. There was no radio reception on the mini stereo, and no buzzer option, so it was useless as an alarm clock. The only point of the bubble bath in the minibar is to remind you that your room has no tub. $25 parking is steep in a city like LA with garages to spare.

I was awoken at 3 A.M. by some rowdy people in the room next to me, sounded like about 3 guys laughing and talking pretty loudly in their own room, and it was loud enough through the room walls that even with heavy duty earplugs I couldn't sleep through it., until after knocking on the wall and yelling through it to ask them to keep it quiet, half an hour later they shut up. It seems to me problematic that 3 guys having animated conversation in their next room could wake me up... that is seriously flawed soundproofing.

Underground parking there was only US$8, but there was a sign saying it wasn't for hotel guests!) Nor did finding other unidentified charges on my credit card at a later date (I sent enquiries with no response). And let's not mention the room. It wasn't minimalist, nor stylish, nor Zen. It reminded me of those converted barracks hotels you find in the former Eastern Bloc. Mattress on the floor. A plastic chair. A plastic basin in the bathroom.

Other hotels have done this with much more style - with blinds or similar available so that it's a little more \"sexy peekaboo\" and a little less Eastern Bloc.

When we checked in, a woman next to us was upset about something to do with a noisy neighbour and was asking to see the manager. This encounter put me on the alert for any little flaw at all, yet the hotel exceeded my standards (no pun intended) in almost every way. The staff was generally quite friendly (yes, a few of them think they're too cool to be nice, but that happens anywhere) and service was prompt. Valet parking is expensive but you can go in and out as much as you want and the guys can get your car upstairs in about a minute, which is nice. The beds are unbelievably comfortable, the tiniest details are attended to (even the labels on the telephone are playful), and the housekeeping standards are impressive. The drinks in the bar upstairs are pricey but very good and pack a punch. And the waterbeds are excellent for sleeping off the tequila in the blazing sun. My only concerns about the hotel are that I imagine it can get a bit crazy on weekends - I was there during the week and the rooftop bar had lineups outside on the street - and that the restaurant doesn't have a great selection of food. Otherwise, we were impressed and will be back in the future.", "Date": "August 16, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Standard Downtown LA", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d249696-Reviews-The_Standard_Downtown_LA-Los_Angeles_California.html", "Price": "$177 - $388*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">550 S Flower St</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Los Angeles</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">90071</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "249696", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/59/2d/592d8bcb5db235058d498b2e955f0c473large.jpg"}}
