I read some of the other reviews and agree that this hotel needs some refurbishment. The rooms seem very dark and old. The bathroom is large but in my room but the shower is poorly designed. It was extremely difficult to keep the water from leaking out and spilling all over the bathroom floor. I don't know why the bathroom shower was designed like that. Another complaint that I had was the internet connection was abysmal. They advertise free-Wifi in the lobby but it was so slow it was frustrating. Also, you had to get a new pass every 30 minutes. I don't understand this. It is just a hassle for the customers as well as the workers. The good thing about the hotel is the area. Salamanca is a very safe, clean, and high end area. It reminded me quite a bit of Manhattan. The hotel is tucked away in a quiet street off Calle de Goya so noise is fairly low. I paid about $100/night for the hotel and wouldn't really pay any more than that.

The Tumi backpack contained laptop, cameras, chargers, eyeglasses, drawing pens and pencils, among many other valuables. The worse part is that the hotel claimed NO responsibility, saying that this was a result of carelessness on our behalf.

And when we checked in they claimed to not have available. Needless to say, we immediately proceeded to look for another hotel to stay which offered the handicapped showers. We found the Hotel Felix Melia, right down the street, which offered the appropriate shower, as well as 24hr security in the lobby and the restaurant/bar as well.

Close to Teatriz Restuarant though which is very very swish and superb. Sanvy had tiny cramped rooms and not very good facilities. OK bar, OK reception, no gym. The bath water was also a bit lukewarm and brown when we were there and they seemed to be having problems with air-conditioning. But the thing that really sells Sanvy is its breakfast. Honestly second to none of the 8 or so hotels I have stayed in in Madrid. The restaurant also is superb, very high quality and good size portions compared to say the Bauza, which has a bit over priced food for tiny portions. I would recommend Sanvy for a one off, just to experience the breakfast then stay somewhere more central.", "Date": "November 11, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York NY", "Title": "\u201cExpensive and small\u201d", "Author": "smwe2000", "ReviewID": "UR1442686", "Content": "This hotel is in a very expensive area of Madrid. All of the sites require a taxi to reach them. The rooms are small and the breakfast which is not included is very expensive but lavish. The hotel gives you lots of little perks like poetry books and mints but it doesn't make up for the tiny rooms and paper thin walls.", "Date": "November 9, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cmixed review\u201d", "Author": "KyleWeeks", "ReviewID": "UR1387763", "Content": "I had a very mixed experience with this hotel. On the positive side. - Good location: close to some nice shopping and the subway. - nice rooms - lots of hardwood However, there were also several negatives: - the street outside can be very noisy. One night there was a loud parade, complete with a marching band, that went on until 2AM. - The staff was not very helpful. They had a problem with their credit card machine and insisted that I pay cash. When I told them I did not have that much cash, they asked my top go to an ATM. I asked if I could exchange a traveller's check, then I could pay in cash, but they refused to allow me to cash a traveller's check. The matter was finally resolved after 30 minutes in which they ran through my credit card through on a series of smaller charges, but I almost missed my flight due to the delay. - The staff is unable/unwilling to call a taxi for guests. They make you go to the street to hail your own cab. Do to the problems I had with the staff I would not stay here again.", "Date": "October 14, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "NH Sanvy", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d206970-Reviews-NH_Sanvy-Madrid.html", "Price": "$109 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Goya 3</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28001</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "206970", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/eb/10/eb10c280f9ce3585d02d87c0cfef476a7large.jpg"}}
