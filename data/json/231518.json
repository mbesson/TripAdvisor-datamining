A young lady named Cornelia went above and beyond to make this stay enjoyable. Unfortunately, she could not overcome the small, uncomfortable rooms. I choose this hotel for the price and location. It was very close to the office I was visiting, and the price was right. The rooms were small, the desk was awkward and uncomfortable, and the bed was extremely uncomfortable. I think the floor would have been more comfortable, but there was not enough floor space available. I stayed two nights, and when I returned to my room on the second day, it appeared that housekeeping made the bed. And that's all. The desk had not been wiped down and the floor and bathroom did not appear to be cleaned. The bathroom appeared to an afterthought. It resembled a modularized restroom that one would find on a boat. The size reflected this as well. The restaurant had a decent menu, but was out of several items when I tried to order lunch on my first day. The breakfast selection was rather lean, but considering the price I should not have been surprised. The hotel was hosting at least one group from EF Tours. I believe that they were high school students from Pennsylvania. When I returned one evening hoping to have a beer in the restaurant, the school kids had pretty much taken over the place. I took the beer to my uncomfortable room instead. On my next trip, I will pay more and have a comfortable room and sacrifice the convenience of the location.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "sao paulo", "Title": "\u201cWARNING IBIS MERIDIANA\u201d", "Author": "roberto n Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR127577429", "Content": "unfortunately our experience at the Ibis Barcelona Meridiana was very very bad.

Of course one of us had to sleep on the single bed, but the friend of mine sleeping on the double was comfortable enough. The breakfast for Barcelona s relation was cheap, and very tasty with high standards of quality. What I really loved is that the personal is speaking several foreign languages such as English, German and French, which made our stay very convenient. Next to the hotel, there is a practical shopping center with plenty of Cafes and Restaurants (I loved the American one), metro and another rail station as well, which brought us to the Airport and Montmello.

The room, bar and breakfast could be anywhere on the planet. So what is different about this. Car Parking - it's in the shopping centre next door. It felt safe as there was security on site 24hr. Not that expensive when the hotel discount is taken into account. You would be better dropping luggage off in the street outside the hotel first before parking. This isn't a problem as there is plenty of space and not traffic wardens. We had a satnav (GPS) and used the co-ordinants from google earth to pinpoint where to go. Location - It's about a 10 min walk to the metro. Which links you to the centre of Barcelona. The walk is pleasant and seemed very safe with lots of people around at all times or the day and night. Lots of people jogging, playing football, playing basketball, walking, strolling or just sitting and watching the world. One tip is to but a carnet of ten metro tickets. This can be used by a group and not just by one person and can be used on buses. We felt safe on the metro, although it got very hot towards the end of the day in the stations (the trains have aircon). Shopping - the shopping centre is a bit of disappointment and is not really an outlet centre. The department store next to the hotel, El Cort\u00e9 Ingles, is great. All 7 floors! It even has a food department (supermarket) on the lower ground floor. Great for stocking up with water and picnic stuff. Eating - Only have breakfast at the hotel, which was adequate. The restaurants in the shopping centre are average. Better to go into the city centre to eat. My favourite was the one on the top of the stadium shopping centre at Espanya (there's a metro station there). Great views of the city from the top. Remember they eat later in Spain (9pm+). This hotel is not 4/5 starts, but you know that when you book. The staff, who all speak English, are very helpful. There is free internet in the lobby via a PC, but there is only one PC. Other than that you have to pay (free wifi in McDonalds in the shopping centre). The rooms are on the smallish side but I do not expect to spend much time there other than sleeping.

Sport centers are around, quite neighborhood, old people walking and jogging if you walk to the metro station, which are a very nice location to stay. Actually, when I walked in the early morning, the air was so fresh and gave you a strong energy to start wandering the city. So we do not have any complaints with the location. Basically, we chose this hotel because of its value against the price, which was totally wrong. Yes it's cheap compared to other hotels in Barcelona, but you deserved to get mediocre room. The floor was not properly cleaned when we entered. I spotted some dust and dried leafs around. Don't expect many amenities: there was no trash bin (only a small one in the bathroom), no tissues, not enough eletric plugs for our mobile devices, etc. The bathroom was a cheap plastic shower cabin with several broken tiles. Cooling system, I think, was not an air con but it felt like a fan. Luckily, the temp outside was not yet hot. After one other stay later at Ibis Zurich, we concluded that it was the Ibis standard. You pay cheap to get below average room and service. We would not stay at Ibis again, because with a little bit more money, you can get a decent hotel at its sister, Novotel.", "Date": "August 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cGood and decent\u201d", "Author": "vasudhachara", "ReviewID": "UR37681187", "Content": "We had a family room with a double bed and a child's bed.

So what better way to control your costs than to take the Ibis? Not. The central Ibis in Barcelona was a rather obscene 89\u20ac. So this certainly isn\u2019t for the budget traveler. For this, you get the bog standard Ibis \u2013 although there is the luxury of air-conditioning to deal with the hot Spanish summers. I\u2019m usually tolerant of so called \u201crude\u201d staff \u2013 more often than not, the rudeness is triggered by irate customers who don\u2019t show the slightest of courtesy. But this time, I experienced dismal, APPALLING service. My mate presented his passport, and the receptionist tried to note his date of birth into the computer. Unfortunately, my friend\u2019s passport had an incorrect birth date on the front, so he showed her a different page where the correction was noted. Up to this point, things were ok. But when she took my passport, she said something to the effect of \u201cyour passport is also going to have something wrong \u2013 so better show me the correction page first\u201d. We were polite and courteous all along, so even if this was a genuine question, the sarcasm was completely unprovoked. Even if a receptionist was having a bad day, this is no way to treat a guest. To top it all \u2013 they gave us a \u2018disabled\u2019 room even though there were other rooms available! What surprised me was the attitude showed not just by one reception attendant, but rather everyone. Ibis may claim that their hotel is in the centre of Barcelona, but I\u2019d take it with a pinch of salt. It\u2019s about 10mins walk from the metro station of \u2018Fabra i Puig\u2019. Luckily, the station sits on line L1, which means it is very easy to get to from the bus station Estaci\u00f3 del Nord (10mins), and the real city centre. If you\u2019re inclined to take a city tour while going to the city centre, then just take bus 36 from right outside the hotel for a leisurely hour going through the annals of Barcelona. Useful tip: The hotel has a guide detailing all bus routes operating in the city, including night buses \u2013 and is kept at the Internet Access Terminal. Perfect if you\u2019re not enthused by the idea of a conversation with bus drivers in Catalan! I wouldn\u2019t judge a hotel by my experience with a ridiculous receptionist \u2013 but aside from a park next door, this Ibis has precious little else going for it in other departments either \u2013 it\u2019s neither central, nor cheap, nor next to some facilities, and certainly not exceptional. You can certainly find somewhere better to stay, and use the unbelievably well-thought out TMB network to tour the beautiful city.", "Date": "May 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntington Beach, CA", "Title": "\u201cOne of the worst hotels we've ever stayed in.\"\u201d", "Author": "ahp10", "ReviewID": "UR27719429", "Content": "This Ibis is awful.

The room was very small and the bathroom was the size of a cheap cruise facility. A burnt-out light was never replaced despite several requests. Unfortunately, the hotel is directly above a rock club. As a result loud music reverberated throughout the hotel from 12 am to 6 am! We could not sleep. The whole experience was awful. The hotel is a 20 minute walk to the subway. Then it is a 15 minute ride to the city. There are more reasonable rooms in the city within walking distance of the major sites.
