Its easy to get to we got a train from the airport to shipol i think its called which for 2 of us cost approx 8 euros. we then walked through the train station and followed the boat sign. to get to the botel you need to take the furthest left dock which has NDSM i think its called. you cant go wrong as its the furthest left one. goes on until i think 1am. its one stop and takes approx 10 mins - you will see the botel soon as you get there its on the left. ferrys are every half hour approx so fairy regular. when geting to the botel the reception was very unfriendly. i had to ask about breakfast and there was no simple smile or welcoming really at all. i get its a budget hotel and i didnt expect amazing things but a smile or a proper welcoming i think goes along way. i didnt feel welcomed. we got to our room. it was small but more than fine - exactly what i expected. the bathroom was very squidged but again was what i expected. when the cleaners did my room wasnt impressed they put my clothes from the bed on to the floor in a pile. not very professional and a bit rude could of folded them or put them back on the bed for me. so wasnt really impressed with that. we then tried to use wifi and that was not accessible without a code which we wasnt given on arrival so we had to go back to reception to ask for it which i think they should ask if you need or want it when you arrive. we then went to ask about bike hire which we ended up doing out of easyness but was 15 euros each which was a little pricey but the bikes were fab - great way to get around. was told if the bike got stolen we would not be responsible long as we had a police report but if they key was stolen or lost we would have to pay. the bikes took us a while to realise no demonstration or advise on the locks etc from the reception staff. not as helpful as they could be. when finished with the bikes we took them back but my back light hadnt worked at all and told them when handed the bike back but she made me feel like i had broken it when i hadnt and didnt say thank you for telling her and made me wait for ages while she did something and then said thank you thats all. very strange and not welcoming or polite again. breakfast... breakfast was fine - bacon was mainly all fat but again it was budget so didnt expect much. had your usual, eggs,toast,bacon,sausage,toast,orange juice, rolls,cheese,tea etc... was absolutely fine for basic. the botel does sway so if you have travel sickness this isnt for you, but it doesnt sway bad you can just feel it slightly. adds to the theme of it being a boat. overall it was fine for what we paid - what was expecting just a shame that the reception and interaction with its staff is really letting it down.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, but staff ......\u201d", "Author": "mwm91", "ReviewID": "UR126529784", "Content": "I have just returned from my trip to the Botel, in which I spent 4 nights, after arriving on the boat I saw the massive 175 floating hotel, I was excited for this different experience, after entering the boat I was blanked by the receptionist guy, given no welcome but to fill out a card.

OK it was small, but had an alarm clock and TV - but we were there to explore the city not sit in the room! More than happy with it. The best part however I found was the free ferry from Amsterdam Central, which ran all day and was extremely frequent, even at the weekend. However the bonus point was the night ferry, which you also catch, but this drops you away from the Botel. BUT the Botel has a minibus which will pick you up and take you back you to the door FOR FREE!!! Each time we arrived back (4am and 2.30am) the minibus was there, waiting. It was amazing. Breakfast was good,a helpful yourself affair for a continental breakfast with a good selection of choices. Although busy the staff cleaned the tables quickly so we could sit down.

Next, the \"hotel\" is an old converted ship of some type, without the stabilizers you'd find on a cruise ship, which means whenever another ship goes by, the whole thing rocks and rolls - which can really disrupt your sleep or shower. The actual room is tiny, tiny and dumpy. The thin mattress sits on a wooden frame with sharp edges and corners, so when the ship lurches, you hit that edge hard, and I've got the bruises to prove it. The furniture is old, chipped formnica topped built-ins, like a narrow dressing table which has a small TV bolted to it, so there's not room on it to put your suitcase. The one chair in the room was the bent metal kind my elementary school threw out 30 years ago, and it was filthy. We ended up keeping our suitcases under the beds, which isn't exactly convenient. The guy at the desk when we checked in wasn't there for about 10 minutes, and there was no sign on the desk, just a line of folks waiting for Mr. Surly. Our booking specified free internet, he denied that and tried to charge us 6 Euro/$10 per hour. Later, when we went through the lobby to find dinner, Mr. Surly was standing in the doorway with 2 friends, smoking - right by the \"No Smoking\" sign, of course. You had to walk through a reeking cloud to get out the door. Dinner in that neighborhood? Not a chance, there's no place to go within walking distance, and no info available from the hotel about where to eat short of another long ferry ride back to Amsterdam. There is what seems to be private club, which did not allow outsiders to eat there, near the end of the dock, and then you walk through a strange area of student housing made of shipping containers before getting to a very dark, and rather creepy, neighborhood. Breakfast: the food choices were adequate, but it was hard to find a clean plate or a clean table, and the hot water for tea had a nasty taste of yesterday's coffee.

We had two twin rooms and whilst the accommodation is certainly not luxurious, we thought overall it was pretty good value for money. The rooms are on the smaller side with the bathroom being particularly 'petite' but was fine as long as you are only using the hotel as a base. Would highly recommend earplugs as walls are pretty thin! No hairdryer supplied in the rooms. Breakfast was fine with cereals, toast, eggs, bacon, sausages and tea/coffee which was a surprise as we assumed we would just have a Continental breakfast. No coffee/ tea making facilities in the room which was an issue for the tea addicts in the group. We had a few drinks on the boat in the evening which were reasonably priced but it was difficult to get the attention of and communicate with the barman - struggled to give us correct coinage in change, then when tried to include some coins with a larger note to help this he 'got confused' and had to be prompted to give correct change. Friends staying in the other room requested to be moved as there was no handle on the radiator to control the heating,and room was too cold for them. They were moved to a warmer room within half hour. Reception staff were friendly and helpful. The main issue with the botel is the location. Some (such as us) would view the location as a positive and part of the charm, but if you like to pop back and forward to your hotel throughout the day this would not be the ideal hotel for you. A free ferry runs from central station and are fairly regular, although stop around midnight and replaced by alternate ferry and shuttle bus. The ferry can get busy with bikes and even small engine 'cars' aboard, but there was always enough room to board and only takes about 10mins. Finding the pier initially was not the easiest when we arrived as the only sign we saw was near berth 3 of a completely different canal and we had not realised that we had exited central station by the wrong direction (back entrance to central station across road through repair/building works and its the NDSM berth last ferry dock on left). However we enjoyed the commute to the hotel and the quiet location where the botel was docked. Probably would not recommend this hotel if you want to really party in Amsterdam as the commute would be annoying and impractical.

DO NOT pay for the breakfast its a salad out of a bag thats gone a bit brown, there are plenty of place to eat in the city, the food in the evening is not much better, we were told that the boat done food but both times we have stayed we could only get the kitchen staff to make us ham and cheese toasties, which are very nice but not a meal. what can i can say.... would i recommend?? yes but dont expect too much!", "Date": "March 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cIf you plan on drinking, do not stay here\u201d", "Author": "gosensgo8", "ReviewID": "UR96358329", "Content": "My boyfriend's parent recommended the Botel to us and I have to say we were disappointed. Location: The botel is in a harbour away from the actual city. The only way to access the Botel is by ferry. One positive is the ferries are free but after 1am, they only come every hour. The ferries dock 100 metres from the hotel so in the morning, it's noisy and the swaying is enough to make you sick. Staff: The staff were unfriendly and not accommodating whatsoever. We were interested in seeing real Dutch culture and asked the girl at the front desk for some assistance and she just pointed to the guides on the rack. She spoke perfect English to us the day before but today she was pretending she couldn't understand what were were saying. Rooms: The rooms are super small so if you don't mind being cramped, then it won't be so bad. The bathrooms are super small and when the ferries are coming in, it's hard to keep your balance in the shower. Also, if you plan on drinking....this is NOT the hotel for you.

The rooms were very clean, and although small they were cosy. The telly had plenty of English channels including BBC. Also at the the end of our corridor was a vending machine with beer in it, great for a midnight cap. There was also something very relaxing about sleeping on a floating boat. The bar area was lovely, with a little TV lounge area and a pinball machine, the bar was quite reasonably priced and you could get snacks such as burgers or toasties. The bad points are The location was a bit of a pain, it seems fun at first to get a ferry to your hotel but becomes tedious after a while. The bathroom was very small and cramped, and I didn't rate the shower. The amenities were very basic, basically just one soap dispenser. Apart from these two points everything was OK, and I really enjoyed Amsterdam.

Our windows opened right onto the water facing an old submarine and we could watch the ferry going in and out, rooms are booked by land or water view both sides of Botel look onto water just that the other side has the pier wall but still water view so dont go wasting your money adding water view. Breakfast was good enough, Sausages, Bacon(not so good) boiled eggs, bread rolls, continental cold bar, cereals, toast machine, hot and cold drinks machines, preserves and you could eat as much as you wanted. Bar prices were reasonable compared to Amsterdam City prices, no hot meals on offer only snacks Toasties and Cheeseburgers. Check in was quick and easy, we found the staff to be polite enough............even had a night when we had 1 too many and had a go on reception, all taken in good fun by the staff. There is nothing much around the Botel another boat alongside which did meals but was used for a private function while we were there, also what appeared to be a shipyard factory renovation which was a luxurious bar also serving food, no shops around about so make sure you get provisions while coming through train station if required.

But only this first time was complicated, once you know which ferry it is, the hotel provides you a time table and everything is ok. 2 - Lack of variety on breakfast - There was only one sort of juice (orange), not even a single fruit, and the bread didn't taste very good.

Very easy and convenient. The last ferry back to Botel is at 12am or thereabouts, however you can get a ferry at any hour to a port just across the bay from Centraal station where a shuttle bus will take you back to Botel. I also enjoyed the hotel bar and dining. Breakfast was better than average and served hot food (bacon/sausage) as well as your usual continental stuff. The hotel rooms look a little more like a jail cell than a hotel room. They are small and sterile and the bathrooms are ridiculously small. There are plenty of TV channels including the 'Hustler' channel for all you guys (and girls if you are so inclined). That said, we didn't spend enough time in our room for any of that to worry us.
