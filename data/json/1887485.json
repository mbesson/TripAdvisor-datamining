It looked lovely on Trip Advisor and the few reviews were good. A hotel that was not a budget option, medium priced, quaint, in the old quarter with sea views and attractive rooms. It was in fact a tiny pension with no public rooms. The three bedrooms were tiny, damp, once attractive but now tired decor peeling from the walls, a useless television that couldn't be tuned to anything and sanitary ware that leaked over everthing in the tiny bathroom. The breakfast was little short of a joke - prepared in the entrance lobby (and lobby flatters what was barely the size of a small storm porch) for you to take back to your musty room if you were lucky enough to get the only one with a bit of a sea view or up to the roof terrace which was in deplorable repair with soggy broken furniture to perch on. On the plus side Aziz was charming, the location was perfect for site seeing and the area around the hotel was old and very interesting. We loved our stay but thought The Daisy was very over priced for a pension at the very budget end of budget accomodation. PS never waste money on taxi's in Istanbul, the public transport is excellent - reliable, easy to navigate, fun and cheap as chips!", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery disappointing!\u201d", "Author": "newbie1982", "ReviewID": "UR121419946", "Content": "We booked our trip to Istanbul and Daisy Hotel about 6 months before travelling there in October 2011. We'd read other reviews on this site and were concerned about people arriving and being told that there was no booking for them so emailed a few weeks in advance and were ensured that everything was ok with our booking. On arrival at the hotel we were disappointed with the size of our room, the 'city view' which was just out onto the street and also the fact that that the shower didn't have any enclosure and that the room was very cold with very limited bedding! A couple of days into our stay we were informed that we were going to be moving hotel, although we weren't keen on the Daisy Hotel we were upset to have to spend time packing, moving and unpacking our belongings to move to a different hotel - especially as we'd been assured prior to travelling that our booking was confirmed. The move turned out to be a positive one to a much nicer hotel however it caused disruption to our holiday due to having to pack and return to the hotel half way through the day to move and unpack.

When we arrived there the owner Aziz told us that he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a room like the one I booked even though I had confirm it 5 days prior to our arrival and he gave us one facing the road ,no sea view no balcony only a window. The room was too small, it lacked a shower cabinet (not even a simple curtain) so every time we used it the floor flooded with water. The room smelled very badly, even though we left all the windows open during the morning, only one towel per person. No soap, no toilet paper. The first time I saw the breakfast table I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop laughing so I had to take a picture of it. You had to carry it on the terrace from the stairs without anything to put your dishes on. They washed the dishes in a small WC used as a kitchen!!I I complained to Aziz telling him that he should reduce the amount I had to pay. He told me that he couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do that but due to the inconvenience we would provide us with free airport transfer for our departure.Of course the day we were leaving the shuttle bus never came, Aziz was not there and he did\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t answer his phone so after 45 min of waiting we took a taxi because otherwise we would have missed our flight. He reported us at the booking site as non-shown so as not to be able to write a review and probably he does that all the time because when I contacted the site they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be surprised.

In this way I gave them the time to cash the whole amount of the week from the credit card that I used with the Hotel Booking. When I saw the real poor condition of the structure it was too late. The remaining days were a chain of discomforts: a crowded train line extremely close to the building, a four lane avenue at fifty meters, an indecent bathroom with a flooded floor (anytime you opened the faucet), uncovered electric wires hanging the walls, humidity, noisy and every other kind of disturbance.

The owner immediately showed me the terrace which is even more beautiful. There is a wonderful view on the Marmara Sea and the waterside where you can see people stroll around and enjoy Istanbul's versatility. The sea is even more close. Sometimes I just walked up to the sea to enjoy the fresh air after an exciting day in the city. The room where I stayed was clean, with every comfort and the hotel felt from the first minute like home because the staff was very friendly and helpful when needed.

There were five of us travelling and the sea facing room with the balcony was a treat, so was the room with the street view. It is an excellent location to walk around and explore Sultanahmet. We were worried if the train lines passing close by would be of annoyance but it turned out to be not an issue at all. Since there were not many guests nor many people in the hotel at that time we felt like it was a private residence as we also had a copy of the main door keys to step in and out whenever we felt like. The rooms were clean and spacious the decor was pleasant and not generic, the bathrooms are on the smaller side, but they were clean and sufficient. Even though there wasnt staff around the clock in the hotel we didnt feel any problems with the service. We enjoyed conversations with aziz and others who helped him and picked up tips and suggestions for the next leg of our trip. We were feeling uneasy when we learnt that some of the domestic flights which we were take for the next few destinations had strict baggage allowance. and we requested if aziz could take care of one of our bags very sheepishly, but he was really helpful, and stored the bad away. And after couple of weeks i called him and met him to take the bag and again he was very helpful. We werent sure of how the breakfast works in turkey so initially we were surprised with the basic servings and quantity served for breakfast, but it was rich and sufficient for all of us. I would definitely come back here because it felt like we made a new friend, the service was personalized, the whole place had a unique character unlike a generic chain hotel.

However, when we arrived the owner informed us that he had no rooms (not sure why - his Enligsh was limited and we couldn't communicate well) and that we would stay at a partner hotel of similar quality. The partner hotel, which was about 10 minutes away walking, was not on the water, though it was closer to the Blue Mosque. The partner hotel room was decently nice, but has no bearing on this review. We appreciate that they relocated us efficiently and quickly, but were annoyed that we didn't get the room we had reserved and that there was no mention of this complication via email before we arrived. Another group of people we met that weekend had the exact same problem - they were turned away to a partner hotel. This may have been an isolated two-day incident, I can't say. We had to walk to Daisy Hotel for breakfast the next morning. Not much of a problem, but the buffet breakfast was quite poor compared to others on our trip. Only a small selection of vegetables/fruit and bread with jam. We ate on the terrace on the top floor, which was decently nice with a view of the river.
