The traffic in Montreal can be horrendous at times in the mornings while trying to cross the island with all the bridges etc. I have also sent many clients of mine to this hotel over the years. The rooms are always very clean, comfortable and include amenities like free Wi-fi etc.. The food is moderately priced in the restaurant and the bar and is usually very accommodating. The rates are also very decent, considering that you are almost in Montreal. The hotel is very well situated near the Montreal International airport on Cote De Liesse boulevard. The hotel shuttle service to and from the airport is also very punctual while operating 24 hours a day, every half an hour from the hotel. I have always found the drivers very helpful with pick-ups on the return flights and also with all the luggage handling etc. Park and fly...a great new package for the traveler! The hotel offers special \"park and fly\" rate packages to travelers who book a night at the hotel the opportunity to leave their vehicles in the hotel's long term parking areas for periods of up to 2 weeks. The parking area is very secure with attendants and gates. You can also have an option to park in an inside and heated area. ( $30.00 more ) They even will wash your vehicle for you while you are away. I parked in the secure outside area and with the cost of the room for one night, including 1 week of parking, free shuttles etc. the total cost was $179.00 CDN. Not a bad deal considering what the normal cost of parking a vehicle at the airport for a week would be. If you stay at the new \"Airport Marriot Hotel,\" connected to the airport, the cost will be more than double this total amount. You might want to consider the Quality Hotel instead.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Val d'Or, Canada", "Title": "\u201cDOUBLE CHECK WHAT THEY WILL BILL YOUR CREDIT CARD\u201d", "Author": "Sidneynordsat", "ReviewID": "UR123785559", "Content": "Stayed there one night in Jan 2012 used the fly&park the clerk said it was $136.00 + 4 extra parking days at $9.00 a day when I got my credit card bill in the mail the total cost was $272.57 no need to say that they won't stiff me again I had read a review in the past that they practice this kind of over charge but figured i'll make sure with the clerk and it happened to me SO BEWARE OF THIS HOTEL.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beijing", "Title": "\u201cQuality is not a name for this hotel\u201d", "Author": "BD700", "ReviewID": "UR121981971", "Content": "Stayed here for a week in December 2011.

While I appreciated Air France's help this hotel was very bad. Here is a quick summary of my bad experience: 1) Despite large signs saying \"smoking not permitted\" , my room (and at least ALL rooms in the first floor as other people were complaining too) had a strong smell of cigarette smoke. I am not talking about a slight smell, I am talking about a strong old and cold cigarette smell that can make you feel dizzy if you are not a smoker. 2) Service is BAD: when I went to the front desk to explain the cigarette smell problem, the old men at the front desk denied that it could smell like cigarette (despite the fact that other hotel guests had complained before and after me). Then when I asked to change room, he offered to send someone with a machine that removes bad smell. When the person showed up in my room he actually only had some generic febreze and offered to leave the windows open (it was about 32 degrees F. or 0 degrees Celcius outside). 3) Rooms are dirty: there were bread crumbs on the desk, soap marks in the sink etc. 4) They charged my credit card about $7 for things (not sure what) that I didn't buy. Did they try to take advantage of the fact that I was just a transit traveler who may not bother disputing such charges in a different country? Overall if you are stucked in Montreal Airport for the night, I would highly recommend to go to another hotel. Even if you will have to spend more to go somewhere else is well worth it! Side note: When I asked the old men at the front desk how many starts this hotel has he replied: \"this is a 4 start hotel\".

It is done up in an Asian theme, similar to what I've experienced in say, Vietnam, and I'm not really sure why. It oddly stands out when you enter the lobby and becomes quite apparent in the rooms. Sometimes lobbies can be deceiving - they look really nice and then you get to the rooms and are surprised about how poor they are. This is not the case here. You get a very good idea of what the hotel is like basd on the lobby. It's lit poorly, has a Koi pond (for no reason) and is dated. Check-in like most hotels is done efficiently. The rooms are comfortable enough for a 2 star hotel. There is an unneccesary abundance of pillows on the bed and some Asian artwork on the walls. The rooms also contain a desk and sitting spot which while handy, also makes the room look very cramped. There is a small fridge in the room as well which I always find helpful. Bathrooms are relatively tiny and I find the fake flowers to be gross, rather than appealing as I imagine they would like. Aside from the odd decor, the rooms are obviously dated but functional. I've had problems with the heat/AC before as well and there is the persistent problem of the smell of cigarette smoke filling the room when the heater fan blows. Internet connection is available by hardwire in the room for free (and also in the lobby if you need it). There are two eating establishments in the hotel - a bar and a restaurant. Both serve food that I find largely to be bland and mildly expensive. I haven't really found anything good on the menu yet but some of my co-workers seem to love the pizza. One of the more positive points to this hotel is the outdoor pool, which is wonderful during Montreal's hot summers. However in the winter, this is a huge downside with no pool inside the hotel. There is an indoor hottub though, located beside the fitness equipment. However as such, working out in the 'gym' of this hotel is unpleasant due to the heat and humidity given off by the tub. The worst part of this property is its location. It is by absolutely nothing! I've actually never stayed in a place that is so isolated before. There is a Tim Hortons across the highway, but that requires a walk down two blocks and under a darkly lit underpass. This option is not practical at night or in the winter. There is a Hilton Garden Inn next door that also has a restaurant, though I'm not sure the calibre of food is any better or diverse than the Quality Hotel. Overall there are much worse places you could be staying but this hotel really isn't all that great. it's in the middle of an office park (therefore, nowhere), has an odd theme to it with average rooms and poor food service. Would I stay here if I had the choice? No - but you can sleep comfortably here if you have to spend the night.", "Date": "February 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton", "Title": "\u201cHotel Sucks\u201d", "Author": "Dattio", "ReviewID": "UR35819431", "Content": "No service, Room issues include: worn bedding, hair dryer and power in bathroom not working, toilet screwed up, tap lifts of sink trying to turn on.

Aside from that the rest was fine until we returned from Laservue on the second day and went for our complementary breakfast. When we arrived at the Jardines Le Pavillon we were greeted and seated. At this time I was told that only 1 breakfast was going to be free. When I asked why I was told by (Yaminie)? The waiter that that was the way it was. He also informed us rather rudely that the buffet was not available as it was being moved. This was at 9:30 and the hours listed stated that breakfast was served until 10:30. He definitely had an attitude problem that day.I went to the front desk to check on this and was told by Diana that was right. She stated that if the others were covered she would have given me more cards. The card did not specify how many people were included and at no time was this mentioned when I checked in.
