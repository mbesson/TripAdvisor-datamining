At that price this hotel was a reasonable value considering the various pluses (location and price) and minuses (overall quality of experience). This is definitely not a 'hotel' experience but at the right price it would be a reasonable trade-off if you are prepared and informed. Location: The hotel location is pretty convenient for getting around and it\u2019s close to a red/purple line train station. There are no good restaurants in the immediate area so you need to drive to eateries and entertainment. This is an apartment building converted into hotel rooms. Room and condition: I had a top floor corner king room and the room was reasonably clean and quiet(ish) \u2013 it\u2019s definitely an urban location with the associated noise but that\u2019s the location. The feel/look is modern but the finishes are budget and are showing wear and tear already. They have added hooks and towel ladder in the bathroom so there is now somewhere for towels (but the hook was loose on the wall). I wasn\u2019t impressed with the polyester (60%) / cotton (40%) sheets \u2013 in hot weather who wants to sleep on the equivalent of plastic wrap. There were four light bulbs burnt out in my room at check-in. The general level of service and my not caring much about light levels is why I didn\u2019t report the burnt out bulbs \u2013 all I\u2019d say is that I\u2019m surprised housekeeping never noticed. I did advise the desk at check-out so they could deal with it before the next guest. Service: Front desk is always staffed and staff were friendly however this is definitely not a \u201chotel\u201d experience. The staff were young (and seemed inexperienced) and usually unable to help with questions like \u201cis there a mailbox nearby?\u201d, \u201chow much is the bus?\u201d, or \u201cis the wifi down?\u201d. There is no hotel safe/lock box and nothing in the rooms so if you are an international guest be prepared to drag your passport around LA with you. Complaint: I emailed the hotel multiple times before travelling to find out how they handled late night check-ins \u2013 none of my 4 emails received a response and I was using the email link on the hotel web-site. I finally phoned and was told that it was no problem \u2013 the front desk was always staffed and I could just check-in. Unfortunately what they did not tell me is the \u2018front desk\u2019 is on the second floor of the hotel and that they lock the hotel at night and there is no doorbell/buzzer. I nearly traveled without my cellphone \u2013 thank goodness I had it with me as you have to CALL the hotel to get in so you can check-in. Some more detailed information about late night check in would have been helpful. When I got in the staff member on duty told me I should have beeped my car horn \u2013 at 1:30 am, inches from the hotel where people were sleeping. Not impressed. Misc: Internet/wifi was constantly weak and I kept losing the signal \u2013 there is no good location in the hotel were you will get a stronger signal (I did ask \u2013 repeatedly). Parking \u2013 not enough spaces for the number of rooms so whenever they are full \u2013 like weekends \u2013 you will end up double parked and must leave your keys with the front desk for them to move your car as needed.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cMostly ok\u201d", "Author": "Amtex", "ReviewID": "UR119031519", "Content": "This hotel is ok, room and hotel facilities are basic.

TV worked and had a good selection of channels. AC worked if a bit loud. I knew this was in Korea Town and went in knowing it may be an \"adventure\" after looking at the area on Google street view. This is a very basic hotel, no frills and the neighborhood is urban residential. I would not have my wife or kids stay with me there.

As others have stated, this hotel is in Korea Town, which means lots of good food around the area (if you're into Asian cuisines). The location of the hotel itself is within a residential neighbourhood which, for a big city like LA, seems safe as we walked back at night. It might be a different story if you were walking by yourself. First, I will explain how the rooms are set up so I make a bit of sense. There are rooms which face outwards towards the street. There are also rooms opposite of those which face the inside. There is basically a hole in the middle of the building so the rooms facing inwards get sunlight. We got one of the rooms on the inside so there isn't a view whatsoever. On the bright side, rooms facing inwards are probably less noisy than rooms facing the street. The rooms are clean and basic. The one thing that did bother me was the lack of somewhere to put your towel in the bathroom after you've finished with it. Most hotels have hooks on the back of the door at the bare minimum. Also, a couple decorative pieces such as a photo or something would give the room a better feel. Other than that, the bed is comfortable and there's a TV with many channels. There is only one elevator in the building so it could take some time. Also, it feels a bit unsafe as it's quite old so we just took the stairs most of the time. The parking garage is free which is a nice bonus... but it's very small. You are allowed to double park but you have to leave your keys with the front desk. We got back late one night and there were no more spots. Luckily we found a spot on the street in front of the building so we didn't have to deal with double parking. Service was good, but the cleaners wore street clothes which is a bit odd. Who knows if they actually work there or not? Or maybe I'm just watching too many movies.

I want to start out my review by saying that I travel quite a bit to Los Angeles. I almost always stay at the same 2 properties in West Hollywood. I happened to be joy riding one day and I wound up running into The Shelter Hotel. I have to argue that although the hotel is listed as being in \"Koreatown\" in my opinion it is not in the heart of this section. In fact, it is heading to the West Hollywood border. Nevertheless, I saw the hotel and thought it maybe a condominium. In fact, there were several condominiums and nice homes in the area. The neighborhood is VERY safe. In fact, I am surprised at some of the comments. The hotel is in a very eclectic and nice residential neighborhood. You do see a lot of Korean restaurant and shops. Is this why people say these things? To be honest, I thought I had cancelled my reservation. I called and spoke to Jason the GM and I was stunned to find out, I still had a reservation in the system. Jason, went over and beyond helping me. I felt very comfortable speaking to him. I also enjoyed working with Steve, one of the nicest front desk reps that you ever want to meet. I have to say that the rooms are so spacious, especially for the price. I felt like I was in an apartment. My best friend Tawanna adored the property too. The rooms were gorgeous. Simple, and clean. The bathroom was very nice. I loved the hard wood floors. I am not a fan of carpet (especially since I have bad allergies) so walking into a room with gorgeous dark wood floors, was truly a BONUS! There was not ONE moment that I did not feel safe in this neighborhood. The staff provided one-on-one service, and I realized how important that was to me. I am a big fan of customer service and you cannot always receive that at the larger hotels. It felt awesome not being 'just a number'. One of the other things I loved, was the outer decor of the hotel. I love the brownstone effect and the pink crest logo on the building. It was this that caught my eye, on my joy ride that day. I loved the coziness, warmth and relaxing components that the Shelter Hotel provides. I do not have one bad thing to say about the Shelter Hotel. In fact, I found a place to get my nails done. Went food shopping for a few items. All in the same neighborhood. Now, it may not have anything you can walk to, but I had a rental car, and would rather drive where I need to go. The parking garage was fine. I do not know many places you can go to where parking is complimentary. The parking garage is very secure. There were BMWs, Mercedez Benz's, Infiniti's and many other cars in the garage. Economy, Mid Size and Luxury. SUVs also. There is a gate after a certain time of night that closes so no one can enter the parking garage that should not be there. I only have small recommendations: It would be great to have a cocktail hour offered at the Shelter Hotel. Add a DJ for that daily cocktail hour (offering five or six specialty cocktails) would add to this hip spot! It would also be nice to have a breakfast cafe where guests can pay for french pastries and other hot breakfast foods. I know that the hotel is decorating the rooms more... the rooms look great, but it would be nice to see that same brown background and pink crest logo on a bathroom carpet (smile). Maybe a small spa and a swimming pool (lap pool). I would give the Shelter Hotel a standing ovation! I can tell you that anytime I visit LA, I will not stay anywhere else but @ the Shelter.", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cVery Personal\u201d", "Author": "Edmonds069", "ReviewID": "UR97590752", "Content": "My best friend and I stayed at The Shelter on February 17-February 21, 2011 and I am not too sure where others who have reviewed this hotel has stayed.

None of the rooms appear completed. Neighbour hood is not great in that nothing is in walking distance, bad considering the poor parking conditions. When arrived given a room in which a guest was still checked in, lucky thing they were not in the room when we walked in and found their luggage. The check in is from the incomplete second floor still under renovation, a strange feeling as you go up from the ground floor parking garage to check in in an under construction second floor room off the extremely loud and obnoxious elevator. When we were moved to another room, the room looks incomplete, nice wood floor was not properly cleaned, which was told was consistent with another room when speaking to another guest. As a matter of fact it's a shame that the entire room was so poorly maintained and cleaned, nothing looked dusted. Dust from construction ? I don't know but it's not good. Some of the renovation has potential but right now, it's not worth the slightly lower price. No place in the room to hang any clothes either. And then there is the garage, no where to park on the street and not enough spots to park all the cars, so you have to double park, and leave your keys at the desk and trust the crew to move around cars all morning to get people back out of the garage. Sure it's free parking, a revelation in LA, but now you know why, seems like a huge risk for the hotel to be driving these cars around without any written agreement declaring who is responsible for what. Otherwise, the room was fine. If you are willing it put up with the parking, the oddity of the front desk situation, and the cleaning style of the the rooms, it may be worth the decent rates, they offer at this point for this area.

When i turned up at the hotel at 12pm after arriving from the airport, i was told the rooms were fully booked the day before and that the room was not ready. Well, i guess i wasn't lucky enough to check in at 12pm. Nevertheless I was told to leave my name with the hotel and they will call me back. When i penned my cell phone & my last name \"LEE\" on a make shift rough paper they gave me, the afro hair guy said LEE WHO? He should at least said \"Sir, can you please leave your full name please\". It was rude. When i returned at 230pm, he said, \"I haven't call you yet. Wait till 3pm.\" Which hotel takes 4 hours from the checkout timing of 11am to prepare just a room? I ended up felling asleep for 30mins waiting in my car in the carpark beneath the hotel because i was way too tired. When i went back up to the hotel at 320pm, he was not longer there. The guy at the counter, Steve, was more polite, thanking me for my patience. Had it not been Steve who was more polite, i would have changed hotel. I have been to various part of the country averaging at least 5 different hotels a year and that afro hair guy was probably the most rude ones i've met. A counter staff is the representative of the hotel because that is probably the 1st and the last person one would meet in the hotel. The last time i check the hotel name was Shelter Hotel & not Shelter Motel. It was my 1st ever visit to LA and i chose Shelter hotel because i had an horrible experience with Bed Bugs in Salt Lake City, Utah. I usually preferred new or refurbished hotels. But even though the room was big and i loved the wooden floors which was refreshing and different from most carpetted hotels, the room would really requires a table lamp, a hair dryer, maybe not put the towels beneath the sink, a fridge, a safe, more lighting and maybe a proper closet. The restroom would require a couple more hooks for clothings as well. The free internet was fast. The free underground carpark was small and i was told to park at the handicap slot when i returned late at night which was fine to me. I had to call to open the gate bcos i turn up at 12am plus at night. But it was nice knowing the cars were protected behind locked gates. Lastly, not forgetting the housekeeping left a big bottle of floor cleaner solution on the desk table as a surprise when i came back late at night (I did left a tip on the bed, probably it's not enough?)

We arrived at about 11:00 am on a Thursday morning, and the manager / owner was nice enough to let us check in early. Shelter has a gated parking garage underneath the hotel, which is great. It isn't staffed 24/7, but they'll give you the number for the night guy to call if you get in late, and he'll come down and open the gate for you. That worked out fine. Shelter is VERY conveniently located in the Koreatown section of Los Angeles. The neighborhood is very clean, quiet and safe, and we quickly discovered that the nearby W. 3rd Street will take you virtually anywhere in the city you need to go while avoiding the dreaded freeways--sweet! Our room was on the 3rd floor. The room itself was great. Shelter is NOT the corporate-business travel hotel you're used to. The room is a good size for two, with plenty of room for the king bed, the nightstands, the desk...and that's it. No chair, no dresser, not even any art on the walls. Minimalist, uncluttered. I like it. When you first get to Shelter, you realize right away that they are still doing some clean up work and renovations, as there is the occasional bundle of wires here, a hole in the stairwell where some pipes used to be there. And a lot of construction dust in our room. Now mind you, this is not a huge deal to us--we live with dogs, and are usually covered head-to-toe with dog hair, so a little dust doesn't bother us a bit. But the room was dusty, so dusty we could write our names in the layers on the nightstands. The only other minor gripe I had was with the cleanliness of the bathroom floor. There was a definitive 'muddy footprint trail' between the marble threshold (also muddy) and the bathtub, where you could see that the grout on the rest of the floor was white, but here was dark gray and black. My white socks turned black after one trip to the bathroom. Also, our bedsheets were very clean, but as we were packing on our last day I noticed a stain at the bottom of our comforter. Even though I knew that housekeeping came every day we were there, it just felt a little like they didn't pay attention to detail very well. All of the staff we encountered during our 3-day stay were fantastic: friendly, knowledgable about the area and had great recommendations for us tourists. The lobby had a little plate of donuts and fresh coffee each morning and stacks of local papers, which gave us a lot of great ideas for stuff to do. Oh, free wi-fi too, which is great.

I can be a hotel snob at times......but this hotel meets all my criteria-----great service, clean room (the room was perfect), close to the action.....just a week blocks off of Wilshire......and priced reasonably......especially for the short amount of time I acutually spend IN the hotel. I hope the price point stays the same.....because if so.....this will be my hotel of choice EVERYTIME I come to LA. ......oh--forgot to mention, they are in the process of building a full service restaurant, pool, and a few other additional amenities. So I'm sure the next time I visit LA......I'll have even better things to say about this hotel. Simply.....the very best out there for the price point.

I decided to order pizza. The hotel has no soda machine, no ice, no cold water. The pizza was cold and the soda was warm. Then the beautiful flat screen TV didn't work - so she moved me to another room. The TV worked, but you have to put your hand at a very awkward position to change channels because the Direct TV receiver is glued to the back of the TV. There was no comfortable chair in the room. The only place for towels was on a shelf under the sink. Not a single hook or towel bar to be found anywhere. There was a great view of the dumpsters from both rooms I was in at different ends of the hotel.

The room was very stylish with dark timber floors and furniture and pale coloured walls which gave it a bit of a designer look, but a little impractical as there was virtually no storage space. There was a small open closet with some hangers and a shelf above it but no drawer space at all apart from a very tiny one in the desk which was barely big enough for an ipod let alone any clothing.

The room had a great LCD TV with a good selection of stations, very comfortable king size bed with great linens and nice towels and the bathroom had been renovated nicely. Parking was free when I stayed there but I think is usually $10 per night, but like a lot of motels in Los Angeles there just isn\u2019t enough spaces to cope with the number of guests and the hotel allows cars to be parked behind already parked cars and they keep the keys and move the cars if needed, not an ideal situation if you are in a hurry to leave.

I had been at a conference in LA earlier in the week - and decided to expend my trip by four additional days to catch up with friends and basically hang out. I've stayed at a number of different budget boutique hotel/motels over the past few years - and try to find a decent place that is around 100 per night or less. I booked my room through their website - and got an introductory price of around 70.00 per night, I think because they're still working on renovating parts of the property, like the pool. When I arrived, they graciously allowed me to check in early - as I had just checked out of my conference hotel downtown. The front desk person gave me the scoop on how their FREE parking worked - first come first served - if you block somebody in you have to leave your keys at the front desk - you need to call the front desk to be buzzed in after mid-night. The neighborhood is residential - but not great to walk around at night by yourself. A number of pretty aggressive panhandlers around bumming change when you get closer to the stores and shops in the area - but not near the hotel. (Some of the beautiful churches on Wilshire Blvd are good samaritanas and run food / shower programs for the homeless). That said - there are some great Korean BBQ / Pho places in the 'hood! My room was just like what was pictured on their website (and here on Tripadvisor). Modern, sleek and roomy! The bed was clean and comfy - but my room had some weird staining on the walls underneath the window - as if there had been a leak. Due to this the room smelled a little musty. When I opened the windows I noticed one window had a screen, the other one didn't. I was on the top floor - so I didn't worry about it. The bathroom was modern and sleek as well - but not as clean as I had hoped. When I got the shower curtain wet - it smelled like mildew and had orangey rust/mildew stains on it. A little bleach should take care of that - but something the management should keep an eye out for. The only weird thing was one afternoon I was just kicking it in my room - enjoying their FREE internet (which was great) - and suddenly, with no warning one of the workmen in the hotel opened my door to change the door latch plate on the doorjamb.

Don't stay here with your dogs unless you want the LAPD knocking at your door! I booked a room through Orbitz for a one night stay at the Shelter Hotel in Los Angeles. From the website, it looked like an okay spot for one night, and they take pets, so their website says... Well, after a grueling 3 1/2 hour in Friday traffic in L.A., we were ready to get into our room, and decompress for 10 minutes before we had to get ready to head out for our event. But...not so fast! We were, rudely, informed upon check-in that they had no record of our reservation. I thought that was interesting, since I was holding the confirmation letter from Orbitz in my hand. Well, a quick check-in it was not, but no problem; we worked it out, and the hotel did offer to give us a better rate for our trouble. We proceeded to unload the car, hustle our gear, ourselves, and our dogs up to the room. Well, after a long drive, no doubt everyone needed to relieve themselves, dogs included! We took the dogs out front to pee, and after returning to the room, get a phone call from Rick, at the front desk. He proceeds to inform us that we can't have our dogs there because they are over 20 lbs. If we want to stay, we are going to have to pay another $60! Well, I was shocked, as nowhere in any of the literature about the hotel either on Orbitz, or the Shelter's own website was this indicated. All that it says is that they take pets. I told this to Rick, and he went round and round with me. I asked him to simply show me somewhere that a weight limitation was indicated, and he couldn't do it. He then told us if we didn't pay $50, we had to leave. Well, the first time he said $60. Now which was it, $50 or $60? It was really startng to feel like an arbitrary request, as his amount requested, changed. I refused, until he could present me with facts, which I tell him is a reasonable request. Well, then Rick threatens to call the cops, and hangs-up. Now, mind you, we had nowhere else to go at this juncture, it's now after 8:00 p.m., we have an event to attend, and really, how the hell am I going to find another hotel that \"takes pets\"? I got the phone number of the GM of the hotel, Jason [-], and left him a detailed message hoping to get some kind of assistance with the situation, but to this day have heard nothing from him! We continued getting ready, and 30-40 minutes later, get a knock at the door. It's the LAPD!!!! I am asked out into the hallway, where the police proceed to tell me that they have been requested to remove us from the property! I am really apalled at this point, and state my case. They were very nice, and completely understood my plight. They agreed to mediate the situation, as we had nowhere else to go! So, I am escorted down to the lobby by the LAPD to work something out! Now mind you, kind reader, I am extremely embarassed by this! There are other people in the lobby, and even though I knew that I was in the right, I felt like a real chump! At the desk, Rick was nothing shy of a joke! I asked him, again, to show me something, anything that states that they only take pets that are 20 lbs or less. Again, he can't. I then ask him if they have a scale to weigh pets in on upon arrival, or if he is capable of making a weight judgement by just \"eyeballing\" it. What do you think his reply was? \"Duh...\"! I asked him, again, for the phone number of the GM, and also his first and last name. Rick says, \"I don't know how to say his last name\". I am thinking, \"Wow, what kind of Mickey Mouse operation are they running here?\". Well, I just want to be over this fiasco, and get on with my night, so the police ask me if I will agree to pay the $50 now, and work on getting reimbursed at a later date. They tell Rick, that if I do this, he must let us stay. I, reluctantly, agree (how easy will it be to get my money back at a later date)? So, apparently, we have reached an agreement, albeit I will try to dispute this at a later date. Rick proceeds to write some chicken-scratch, on a blank piece of paper with a photo-copy of my drivers license about a $50 fee for \"not informing the hotel upon check-in that my pets were over 20 lbs________(sign here)\"! At this point, I am laughing! They don't even have a pre-made form for this strictly enforced policy? He didn't even use hotel letter-head! Wow, they are really legit! (Please read with a touch of sarcasm)! Well, at this point, the police escorted me back to my room, and gave me their contact information for use at a later date, should I need their testimony for my dispute. The LAPD were, actually, very courteous and helpful. The Shelter Hotel...a total joke. Because of this fiasco, we were late to our engagement, and caused our hosts to be late as well. I have never been treated so poorly, or had such miserable customer service as at the Shelter Hotel. At this writing the GM, JASON [-], has still not attempted to contact me to apologize for the ill treatment we received there. Way to run damage control, Jason! I did talk to the customer service department at Orbitz. They did some research, and found that the Shelter Hotel, did NOT, in any of their literature, post a weight limitation on pets!

Went to a Lakers game and this was less than a 10 minute drive. Location was great for restaurants and downtown. Wasn't expecting to much but it thoroughly impressed me. When we got there, there was free parking underground and it was gated at night, so that was reassuring. The two downfalls of this hotel is that there isn't much guidance on where to go after you park, as well as the lack of really a professional front desk. Nowhere does it really show you that you need to take the elevator to the second floor to get to the front desk. Once the doors open you're greeted by an open desk with a computer and printer on it with a staff member. Hopefully that's the next thing that's going to be fixed in their renovation, it's not the best first impression. What was nice was the staff, they are very friendly and you can tell the hotel is doing a lot to try and improve the interior. Our room was very nice and upgraded. From nice dark wood floors, to a nice tv with lots of stations to an updated bathroom, this place was very pleasing to the eye. The room was quite large and doesn't have to much within it, so that may something that need to consider upgrading as well. Everything within the room was spotless and clean. The beds felt very comfortable and we were not disturbed all night.

Been hoping for a good hotel to crop up in the Koreatown area and based on prior tripadvisor reviews decided to try Shelter Hotels. The non-lobby with a small shabby desk on the second floor serves as check-in. You then get into the dark small elevator which opens up to scary dark hallways. The rooms are beyond minimalistic- they are a good size but the size only accentuates how barren and cold they feel. The doors and walls are extremely thin, and nothing seems to fit quite well- flimsy construction. No view. this hotel also seems to serve as a short-term rental as there were interesting people shuffling around the hallways with their dogs, etc. on the weekend, a crowd of screaming sorority-type girls kept everyone up at night. there is only one attendant that mans the \"front desk\" and the phone, so if you call him to come upstairs and deal with the heat or housekeeping issue no one else will be there to answer other rooms' calls. When we tried calling down to the front desk it rang and rang with no one picking up.

There are tons of restaurants and shops in walking distance, and Downtown is right around the corner. I've been to L.A. before, and downtown was kind of a dump, but they have really made it a scene, and I had a blast at L.A. Live and the bars down there. I will never stay in Hollywood again. The hotel itself is in a neighborhood that was very safe and quite, with plenty of transportation. When I got to the room, I felt like I should have paid $100 more than I did. I couldn't believe how nice it was. Hardwood floors, flat screen with Direct Tv. The bed was and extremely comfortable pillow top mattress, and the bathroom had brand new everything. All and all a great experience, the staff was extremely helpful and friendly, with plenty of suggestions on what to do on a Tues. I will never stay at any other hotel when I visit L.A.
