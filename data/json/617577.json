Our room was around the corner on a road perpendicular to the hotel's address. The room was nice, the bed comfortable, the bathroom was modern and the shower had hot water (although we did manage to run it out when we first arrived - only one person had managed a short shower). That being said I'd have no problem staying here again if it weren't for the noise. Our room was above a bar and on a Friday night it was open until 4am, it was extremely noisy and there was nothing that could be done. It was pretty impossible to get to sleep and stay asleep with the talking, laughing and shouting going on outside your window -it was although these patrons were in our room. If management want people to be happy and stay longer they need to do something about the soundproofing of these rooms. That being said we had friends who stayed in the building by reception, who enjoyed their room and had no noise to contend with.

Not only are the room totally below even the most basic expectations, but the staff are uninterested and lax. But by far the worst thing about this hotel is that the staff cannot be trusted. We received a brand new credit card prior to leaving Australia and used it only once- at the Hotel Il Papavero when we booked in on the day we arrived. The next time we attempted to use the card it had been cancelled due to fraudulent use. Someone in the 24 hour period between us booking into the hotel had logged up over $3000 worth of internet shopping charges. Also a staff member actually tried to steal 10 euros from us by pretending we had given him a 10 euro note instead of a 20 euro note. UNBELIEVABLE!!

I was stuck with the last night so I dreaded coming back. When we arrived for our last night I complained and we were then put in another location around the corner from there office which was a world of difference. Believe me still not plush (for 80 euros you cannot expect much) but nothing like the first room. Moral of the story - DO NOT let them put you near the train station for YOUR CONVENIENCE as I was told by the individual that spoke English. The breakfasts were at snack bars across the street with a voucher for a roll and coffee. Would I stay here again - probably not.

Checking is was ok, but it seems as though the italians need to brush up on their customer service skills. They can be quite rude as times. We ended up following the receptionist guy in his car so he could take us to the other hotel. The area was quite dodgy, and I would have never walked alone on the streets. Full of asians and africans, beer bottles etc. It was real close to the Termini station about a few minutes away. The rooms were quite big. We had 2 rooms, one with 3 guests and the other room with one. We orginally booked 3 single beds but were given a double bed plus the 2 singles...so that was a bonus. The rooms contained a small bathroom, large window and a fan. In our particular hotel there were only 4 rooms. BE CAREFUL...the same key that is given to you opens the other rooms too!

The walk to Repubblica was about 5 minutes. We felt very safe walking in the neighborhood both day and night. There are different outside door entrances to the different rooms (you are given keys for all doors you must use). The rooms are quiet (no street sounds at night), very clean and the beds comfortable. You notice we say rooms and beds. We left Rome twice for trips to other countries and each time we returned we were given a different room. The staff was exceedingly friendly and helpful. We honestly miss seeing Ica, Georgia and Adriano each day. They gave us great tips for sightseeing and shared our excitement at reconnecting with family. Internet access is available at the reception area, which we all know is quite helpful when traveling for extended periods of time.
