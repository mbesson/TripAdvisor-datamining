We had a backed up sink in our room, and after the third day of requesting that it be fixed, we gave up asking and just lived with it. :( MMiller1000, we also were on the 14th floor with a non-functional ice machine and had no response from staff to our requests to fix it. There was a cheerleader competition at the convention center and many of the cheerleader groups stayed in the Hilton. Hotel security did little or nothing about maintaining control over the loud and noisy groups. I am talking about people RUNNING up and down the hallways and shouting back and forth from room to room at 3AM. We did enjoy the view of Camden Yards from our room. The staff, other than the young woman at the front desk when we checked in late Thursday/early Friday, gave the impression that we were disturbing them whenever we had a question. We had a very early flight on Monday morning and requested a wake-up call for 3AM. That call came in at 3:45. We would have set the alarm clock provided by the hotel, but it did not work. I suppose it could have worked if someone had responded to our requests to get it operating. On the other hand, Tommy, one of the bellmen, went above and beyond to help us make our travel connections. Light bulbs were burned out in the bathroom and in some lamps, but again, nothing was done to replace them. The breakfast in the Executive Lounge was way below the quality we have come to expect from other Hiltons. There was nothing except milk with protein in it, very bad for diabetics. I guess the erratic functioning of our room key to operate the elevator and get us to the Executive Lounge was a blessing in disguise, or a warning. Too bad we did not heed that \"warning\" and go elsewhere for breakfast. The view of Camden Yards from our room was way cool!

It was warm and humid and did not have a pleasant smell. There was no one there to great us or anyone that asked if they could help us.

And it has huge assets. 1) if you are going to a game, Camden Yards is right there. By right there - I mean steps away. I've never seen a hotel so close. When I called, they said 2/10 of a mile. I must have misheard. It's literally - right there. We left our room on the 5th floor and were at our seats in 6 minutes. 2) The light rail is right there - next to the hotel's 2nd building. We took the train to the airport - 31 minutes - $6.40 for 4 of us - $30 less than a cab and most importantly, fun fo the kids. The lobby and rooms are very nice - but why the \"poor\" rating. Well, check in is at 4P - which is late for a hotel. Well I got there at 4:50P, only to be told my room wasn't ready. I was told - they had King rooms but not the two doubles I reserved. Ummmm - check in is 4P. I paid for a room at 4P. I was sent away - my phone # taken - and told I would be called when the room was ready. At 5:32P, I got that call. So what did I do for 42 minutes? I wasn't offered a drink or meal or anything. When I got down there - I expressed my unhappiness. Eventually, I was asked - can I buy you breakfast. Yes, I pushed knowing I'd get something - but it's wrong that my room wasn't ready. Honestly, they should have comped it - because Hilton (at least Hampton) guarantees 100% satisfaction - and they know I can't be satisfied without being in my room. 2nd note - they have a drawer with the hair dryer in it. In that drawer - a pair of women's underwear (think pink was the brand:) Seriously, house keeping doesn't check to see that the hair dryer is there - they'd have seen this. When I told the front desk 20 minutes before we were leaving and I said - just so you know for when you clean tonight - but don't send someone up now - what did they do. Send someone up. My sick wife had to answer the door. So the hotel has some great points - location, location, location - and it's nice. But they are horribly run and don't listen very well.

Pratt St. at Eutaw St. for the Inner Harbor (3-4 blocks west), Convention Center (adjacent), and Camden Yard (adjacent). We got a great deal by booking with Priceline - $70.00/88.10 with taxes - for a room with 2 double beds. The best rate booking through Hilton would have been $159.00, so we felt like we'd hit the jackpot. The hotel lobby and public areas are beautiful. Check-in was quick and courteous. The room was spotlessly clean and well soundproofed from outside noise; comfortable beds, huge flat screen TV, big thick towels. The restaurant - Diamond Tavern - is located in a separate building across a wide sidewalk from the main building - accessible by a skywalk on the second floor if weather is bad. No free breakfast here: continental breakfast was $14.00 for cereals, muffins, juice and coffee. The stone cut oatmeal was very good - hot. Self-parking in the deck was $28.00 a day. The only negative thing to report (and my reason for 4 stars instead of five) was that when we got to our room after checking in, the room key would not work, and we had to go back downstairs to get them reprogrammed. When we got back upstairs, it took several tries (and a few muffled *@%! words) before the key finally worked. Then we could not get in again after dinner and had to get the keys reprogrammed again. A real nuisance! And two glasses of house wine from the hotel bar cost $22.00, so you may want to bring your own, or drink elsewhere. We had a wonderful dinner at Alewife Tavern, which is located about 3 blocks up Eutaw St. A nice short walk. We would certainly stay here again if we could get another good rate through Priceline.

The room was clean with the exception of the lamp which someone neglected to dust. Also, we were missing items from the coffee making kit. A couple of things marred our stay a bit. First,there was a future teachers convention there and several of the students were loud and raucous in the hallways and swimming pool (like a frat party). Also, the bellwoman there told me she would get us a taxi to the cruise port, a mere two miles away and stopped the van of a driver she apparently knew. Not a standard taxi. The fare should just be a few bucks; within minutes I inquired about the price and was told 30.00!!! When asked to be let out, the driver brought the fare down to 20. I sincerely believe the bellwoman/doorwoman KNEW this guy and was trying to get him extra business. I did not like the one bit and feel it reflects badly upon the Hilton.

My husband and I stayed at this hotel last weekend so we can let our clients know about it. We had preferred to stay at the Marriott across the street. The customer service is much nicer and better trained there. When we went to check in and I asked the front desk rep about parking she said, do not worry about it the parking is included in your rate. I asked her if she was sure and she said yes. I thought since the agent I booked the reservation on the phone with knew that we were travel agents, maybe he gave us the deal so I did not question it. The front desk rep told me to go over to valet parking and they would give us a pass to get in and out since they are separate from the hotel. We went to the valet and we told the person at the desk that we have parking included in the hotel. He said that he would need to see some sort of statement stating it before he could give us the pass. He said that twice and then he said, never mind, I will just call the front desk and ask them. He called the front desk and the same front desk rep verified that we had parking included in the rate so we were able to get the parking pass. It had been a long day for my husband and I so we decided to turn in earlier because we had a busy day on Saturday. About an hour after we had retired to our room (approx 9:30am) I received a call from front desk rep who checked us in stating that we did not have parking on our room and that I must come down and pay for the parking. I could not believe they called the room that late. I did not go down to the valet until the morning. Of course when I got there in the morning, there were different people there. So we explained to them what had happened and went ahead and paid for the parking. All of this could have been avoided if the front desk rep was better trained!

A huge plus in my opinion. The front desk staff is courteous, helpful and the wait staff in both the bar and restaurant are friendly as well as helpful and the food is not bad either.

The hotel is located at the edge of Inner Harbor area, however if that is your primary destination there are other nice hotels cheaper and closer to the actual Inner Harbor. But if you are attending a conf. at the CC can not do better. (I probably should not say that b/c next year when I want to make reservation for my conf. the rooms will be booked.) The rooms are standard Hilton rooms, large enough to meet most requirements. Parking is extra and is underground and accessible without going outside. It is not that I am allergic to fresh air or anything but having had the ????pleasure????? in the past of walking thru ice and snow with a cold wind blowing off the harbor to get to my meetings there is a lot to be said for indoor corridors and parking garages accessible by elevator directly into hotel. One of the other well known chain hotels at the other side of CC has an out door walkway to the CC and a garage that requires you to drag your suitcase outside, although the walkway from garage is partially covered but in driving rain you are still wet.

The views, particularly towards the ball park (even off season) are WONDERFUL. - Rooms are comfortable, well appointed, beds are fairly comfortable and things are setup for a decent night of rest. - The Exec lounge is open until 10pm (if I remember) for drinks - even on the weekends - There are ACTUAL HD CHANNELS on the flatscreen TV(s) - and in some suites a media breakout box to connect a laptop. - This is one Hilton where the room service menu and delivery are EXCELLENT. Delivery is in 35 minutes or less - the pasta, the wings, and everything with the word \"Crab\" in it are highly recommended. - The doorman was able to direct me to a restaurant on Pratt Street where I was meeting clients - and even encouraged me to walk rather than spend money on a cab since it was relatively nearby.

The food served at the conference was really bland (actually, I wasn't crazy about the food in Baltimore in general). The VERY young wait staff did their best, but seemed undertrained. They were dropping stuff everywhere and didn't seem to know how to speak to guests. Reception staff did nothing wrong, but neither did they seem engaged. The coffee in the rooms was weak, although I liked the simple machine. There's no where to get good coffee in the building (The Marriott across the street serves Starbucks and there's a full SBs 3 blocks away). Maid service was responsive and English speaking. Free wifi in the public spaces cuts you off after a half hour. Totally annoying. Overall this a good hotel that's worth the money, but is nothing special.

We only had one minor problem...Hurricane Irene. We were supposed to travel to Baltimore via Amtrak on Sunday, Aug. 28. Amtrak cancelled all train service between Stamford, CT. and Baltimore from Saturday until midday Wednesday. I called the hotel several times worried about my non-refundable reservation. Eventually I found a super nice person in Hilton's \"Adv. Purchase Reservations\" who called the hotel and talked with the manager and then informed me they would slide the reservation until we arrived due to the hurricane. They couldn't have been nicer. When we arrived three days late the reservation was waiting for us. I was so pleased. The desk clerk was super, but he was from another hotel and had been brought in to help with the anticipated crowds for the innaugural Balimore Grand Prix that was to be run that weekend. I would agree with sereral other reviews in TA that the majority of the front desk crew was not very helpful and not the \"sharpest knives in the drawer\". The hotel has three types of room reservations: normal rooms, harbor view, ball park view in ascending order of pricing. The hotel is right next to Camden Yards and is ideal if one is planning on attending a baseball game. We chose the harbor view for $229 per night plus tax of $35 per night. This is a bit pricey but the room was very nice. It was large, wonderful bed with good linens and down pillows, a comfortable desk area plus a lounging chair, a large flat panel high definition TV with lots of channels to choose from and a large clean bathroom. One oddity of this hotel is there is no eating facility in the main lobby area or main building. Their dining room or eating facility is in an attached \"meeting room\" facility and is called the Diamond Club. We went there for dinner the first night and the pricing on the menu was \"over the top\". We finally chose hamburgers from their lunch menu ($12) and they were miserably prepared (I will spare you the story). I complained to the manager and he apologized and gave us a comp. breakfast buffet the next morning ($16 per person). The buffet was good but not great. Other reviewers have said go elsewhere and I would agree. Excluding the dining, i would say the hotel was very nice and we will stay there next year when we go back to see our baseball game.

The lot was well-lit, easily accessed and had obvious security patrols. I was a bit concerned about evening parking as there was a baseball game on each of the three nights we stayed there, but this proved not to be a problem (maybe due to the surprisingly low attendance). The only recurring problem was an issue that came about because of the number of teachers attending the math confernce. During breaks and at wrap-up time, the elevators were absolutely swamped and it took forever to move between floors.

Now onto the bad... It states that check-in is at 4:00 but our room wasn't ready until 5:00, which I think is a little late for check-in. They allow pets, which may be nice for some people but the fact that we were placed in a room next to a woman with a yappy dog who barked incesantly for hours was extremely annoying. We called down to the front des who alerted security. They came up and verified that, yes, there was indeed a barking dog next door but didn't do anything about it. Also, this same dog decided to relieve itself in the hallway while we were walking to the elevator with this particular pet owner. In my opinion, I think that there should be a designated floor(s) for people who bring their pets with them to this hotel so its not an inconvenience for those of us who left ours at home.

They recommended the hotel as it is next to the Orioles' ball park and has a good reputation. We liked our room, which looked over the ball field of Camden Yards. We booked the Great Get Away, and used Hilton Honors. While the beds were great, one of the drawbacks, as has been noted, is a lack of King sized beds. Our room had no fridge, which would have been nice during the scorching heat wave. Alas, all hotels make money at the bar. The breakfast restaurant, which was in the Tavern, had good food, reasonably-priced, but we had the package that included a breakfast. However, the management did not anticipate a huge crowd of people coming for the ball games, and since Red Sox fans always go to Baltimore for games, it was amazing that the staff could not cope with all the people who wanted breakfast. We got in just as a crowd was forming and waited 30 minutes for a table. In the entrance to the tavern, there were no roped-off areas for people to queue up for a seating, and since people who had already signed in just milled around that reception area, new guests arriving just stood behind them, thinking it was a line. Other guests, including us, clued them in as to what to do, as the staff did not seem to know new people had arrived and were overwhelmed anyway. Another detractor is the lap pool, which was inundated with children, and frankly, quite \"murky\". I would not be surprised if a health inspector would visit soon. The life guard sat around listening to her ipod and checking her emails while children tried to climb on each others' backs and \"drown\" each other by pushing their heads under water and also losing their balancel with heads nearly hitting the side of the pool. On the plus side, the fitness center was well-equipped, very clean, and had wonderful views. After the ball game, the six main elevators were also queued up and one was very slow and could not handle 15 people in it. So, it was, unfortunately, more than a little chaotic right after a game.

I called ahead and asked if early check in was available, and my request was denied, which i found odd. We arrived around 2:30pm, parked, and went to the inner harbor for lunch. We got back to the hotel around 4:00 to check in. We found a long line of unfortunate people in our situation. There was a fireman's conference, and many of the people in the conference were late checking out. This resulted in many people not being check in to their rooms at 4:00. My girlfriend and I waited 1 hour and 45 minutes for our room to be cleaned and available. The rooms are very comfortable with new amenities. This was the main reason for our return to the hotel. We stayed two nights in 2009 for the Red Sox games and raved to our friends about the Hilton. However, upon arriving to our room, it smelled like cigarette smoke and was obvious to my girlfriend, and the two friends who we attended the game with who came up with us for drinks that it smelled like smoke. There was no time to report the problem since we had limited time before the game started at 7:05 After the game we walked across the street back to our room and reported the problem of the cigarette smoke from the previous guests. Our response from housekeeping was that the hotel was non smoking and an okay. The beds were comfortable. My girlfriend slept well. I would have slept well except for the pillows.... bring your own if you rely on good pillows to sleep well. Things were better the second day (Wednesday) We checked out of the hotel, and the front desk was nice enough to waive our parking fee because of the inconvenient check in, which I was very appreciative that they did that for us. After we left, the Red Sox won and all was right with the world until later when I got home. (aka 20 minutes ago) I checked my bank, and I was charged a 50 dollar fee from the Hilton for a \"discretionary charge\". When I called the Hilton to inquire about the phantom fee, the polite woman on the phone said it would have been for room service or something of that nature. We never ordered room service or anything of the sort. She assured me it would be taken off my account in the next few days as it was a pending charge. *Note to concierge or management, I know you read trip advisor reviews to check for quality control... I would appreciate it if this matter was taken care of immediately. I stayed in room 504 from 7/19-7/20. I travel to Baltimore whenever the Red Sox are in town. If you value your customers, please fix this problem. It is what prompted me to write this review.....

We called multiple times to remedy this and they were not quick with bringing the washcloths to our room and they never came on the first call.

Consierge did not have any tickets (which I thought was unusual), but there were plenty of hawkers on the street right outside the entrance. It is also just a block from all the trendy sports bars adjacent to the ballpark, i.e. Pickles, Score, and Sliders. Sliders is our favorite. Friendly wait staff, good cook, excellent bartenders, and very reasonable prices. We suggest the crab cake sliders, the cheeseburger sliders, and the hot wings. And they have Natty Boh on draft for $2 a glass. Get your food and fill up on beer there before you go to the game and pay double or triple for food and drink. There are also street vendors offering delicious polish sausages with sauteed peppers and onions, hot dogs, hamburgers, water, sodas, peanuts, etc. You can bring anything you want into Camden Yards, except glass bottles and alcohol. I hope they don't change that rule anytime soon. It's one of the few sports stadiums that allow it. The hotel has a very nice bar and cafe that stays open long after the game is over.

Valet parking is available as well as self-park. Bellhops and Valets greet you when you pull in. Depending on how busy they are, check-in could take awhile. I waited roughly 15 minutes...the concierge was out so the front desk was being helpful to a guest and giving her directions and suggestions...I wasn't in that much of a rush, so it didn't bother me. Rooms are good sized, nicely decorated. I used the stairs a lot and noticed a smell of smoke ( I think someone was too lazy to go outside). We had access to the Executive Lounge. My only complaint....we hit some traffic snarls and weren't going to check in until late. I called the hotel to see what time the lounge closed and was told it was open late. I asked if there would be 'snacks, like cheese and crackers, etc' out so we could grab something quick before dinner. I was told they would be out all night. When I got to the lounge, just cookies and soda were available. I guess I was given the wrong information, no big deal. Breakfast in the Lounge was ample, bagels, sweets, yogurt, fresh fruit..and slow toasters, enough to start the day. We did go to the bar and ordered a pizza...it hit the spot, considering we didn't feel like walking too far and it was getting late. They also have 'harbor view' rooms, which I was told you really can't see the harbor, they just face that way.

I stayed at the Hilton Baltimore Inner Hotel in December 2010 for a major conference and was staying here with a large group of colleagues. I had my own room. Hotel is very stark and industrial, which may be just the feel of Baltimore. My room was typical Hilton, but not overly nice given the newness of the hotel. My stay was uneventful until I discovered jewelry missing from my luggage in my hotel room-my engagement ring and anniversary bracelet. I reported the items missing after a thorough search of my room and asking myself if I could be wrong. The hotel clerk was interested, and told me who to contact. I had a VERY definite time frame and location where the items went missing and reported all details to the Head of Safety and Security in charge. I submitted all requested information, written and otherwise, to him, and also filed a police report with Baltimore police. I was told he housekeeper who cleaned my room was \"questioned and said she didn't take it\" and that was it. I got one phone call from the Hotel ownership (a lawyer) who had my information and said that there was nothing more the hotel could do. Their insurance would \"turn it over to my insurance\" and that was that. My insurance paid the claim, and I never got even a written apology. Absurd. All I was told was \"there was a safe in the room--were you aware of it?\" No, I was not , as it was located in the very corner of a closet, and I never thought that someone would access my room, rifle through my belongings, and steal the only real jewelry I had with me during a busy conference for me. I have never had this problem at any other Hilton, and boy, have I learned this the hard way! Whoever did this KNEW WHAT TO LOOK FOR and has probably done this before as they ONLY took the two pieces of real jewelry I had, and left all the costume. I made this statement to security implying a \"ring\" of professional thieves, and they said nothing. Hilton never apologized and essentially blamed me for the incident! They never paid a dime! DO NOT STAY here if you value your belongings and don't want thieves in your suitcase. I will NEVER stay at this Hilton again as they obviously condone theft and consider it \"No big deal.\" I also tell all my fellow road warriors that this hotel employs a professional thief. Have fun during your stay and lock all your belongings up!! Now I am in the process of \"re-building\" my engagement ring, and dealing with the aftermath.

She did say that we should be happy though b/c our room was upgraded\u2014I told her that we had paid in advance for that level room. Then we tried to go upstairs to the room and had to wait for the third elevator, since bell hops cut in front of us with large luggage racks to get their tipping customers in first. I understand they were dealing with a large religious group, a big wedding, and a holiday night all in one. However, we were still surprised that the following morning the hotel\u2019s water pumps shut down. Some of the water that did come through was discolored. We spent a couple hours waiting for the shower to work before finally giving up and checking out. Several calls to the manager that morning were made and he did try to make things better. He comped our parking and offered a lunch voucher at the hotel restaurant (seemed less than desirable given the water trouble). He said our room could have been partially comped but was ineligible b/c we had prepaid. The room itself was very clean and well-appointed, in a nice area of the city near attractions. The view of Camden Yards at sunset was amazing. It was disappointing that the other factors ruined the stay. I\u2019d recommend the hotel if you\u2019re looking for a clean room and not necessarily a top notch experience. At the very least, DO NOT pay extra for concierge level service\u2014the regular customer service needs to be figured out first. The Executive Level just means the elevator has to travel longer to your room. Also, expect to pay for in-room internet--their free internet is 15 minutes in the lobby.", "Date": "January 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cIncredible experience!\u201d", "Author": "taurean2003", "ReviewID": "UR90310954", "Content": "That sums it up!

Camden Yards was right across the street, so if baseball season was on, I would have liked to go check out a game. The price of $200/night is a little steep, but since my company was paying for it, no worries.

If not, I would not have logged on...I still don't see why it would not be complimentary already, most \"smaller chain\" hotels offer it for free...but that's been argued before I guess. If I were paying out of my pocket, I may have to look elsewhere to stay...or at least research more for the best deal. My family stayed with me, not a really child friendly hotel. We did check out the pool, was a little chilly, but the kids enjoyed the swim. It also had a great view of the ball park. Valet workers gave great suggestions as where to eat and gave great directions as far as where we wanted to go. People complained on previous posts about how thin the walls are, but we had no issues with it. Customer service was good, I believe in treating people how you would like to be treated.

The concierge was never at his desk and we had to wait in line to talk to the front desk who gave us incorrect info. But overall, that wasn't that big of a deal.

Lovely big king-sized room. Parking in the hotel was just $26 for the two nights. Walking to the Inner Harbopur was just five minutes and had great restaurants. If there is a real downside to the hotel is that there is no free wi-fi, not even in the room or lobby. Its $6.95 for an hour. And breakfast is too expensive: $18 for eggs, and thats in the restaurant and not room service, so yes, a costly breakfast. We will come back here again this year, a great hotel in a great locale, and even if we can't get the same great price on the room, we loved it. Room 1229 was our room with a perfect ballpark view. A word of warning for parents, and its nothing to do with the hotel: the Aquarium is a great day out with the kids, but the admission is insane. $28 for adults, which is coslty, but kids were $25, and that's any aged kids.

Alas, this gets you little else. Weather was hot as hell, and my back kept going out so walking wasnt in the plans. NUMBER ONE TIP when going to Baltimore: Parking in this city will soak you. After careful research I discovered that it is MOST ECONOMICAL to park in Long term parking at BWI Airport and take the Light Rail into Baltimore which will drop you you right at Camden Yards or the Convention Center at Pratt St. The City controls all the parking so it is high everywhere. $36 per day versus $14.95 for 2 days (at PreFlight) plus $1.90 fare each way on Light Rail. Do the Math. The Hilton overall is clean, staff is efficient: front desk and bellhops were very kind and accomodating. There was NO early check-in. Being baseball season, the hotel books up and, although we are not Orioles or baseball enthusiasts, it would have been nice to get a room with a better view then overlooking Pratt Street. Camden Yards is beautiful and the history of baseball is right there. We did have a view of the Bromo Seltzer Tower and Maryland Medical Center. We had to check our bags and we went to The Aquarium (make a reservation!) as we got into the city around noon. Aquarium was fascinating but not incredible. If you have to wait for entrance to Aquarium, they send you over to Barnes and Noble or ESPN Zone -- more traps. Having never been to Baltimore, we had to cross-check many of the city maps. Getting around safely is essential and thankfully, Baltimore is very accomodating now with the NEW Circulation Bus which is FREE (stops service at 9pm). And using the water taxi at $10/ day is great for getting back from distant piers aorund the harbor (by 11pm). They come every 10-20 minutes. Don't get sucked into the Inner Harbor tourist trap for food and sites. We ate at the Tra Na Nog Irish restuarant at first but it was a big ticket for nothing special. They couldn't even wow-up Fish and Chips or a basic Reuben sandwhich. Pier 6 near the Marriott is cleaner, safer and close to Little Italy. Alas this was furthest from Hilton. We had lunch at Bertha's in Fell's Point. This was a Rachel Ray recommendation. Yea, the mussels were good, but they should try to clean that place once in awhile -- every area was sticky with grime. Know where you are going in this town: turning any corner and you may get assailed by vagrants. We were fore-warned about the Lexington Market. It may have once been fun, but it is surrounded by bad neighborhoods. We did see the Basillica. Very cool if you like churches. Little Italy is a must for the best food in town. We did Mo's Pasta and Seafood. They actually picked us up and brought us back to the hotel. Nice! Food portions were HUGE. Stuffed Salmon and Shellfish Alfredo. The upstairs dining room kind of smells and the waiters dress in street clothes but food was great. No special amenities at hotel: the beds are snuggly but too soft; the LED TV has a remote \"no signal\" problem, but if you just channel up, you can fix that. Coffee machine is a joke and turns off before making a full cup of coffee which tastes like the bleached pod paper. Granite counter in bathroom -- big deal. A jacuzzi tub would have been nice, but we got one of the cheap rooms, seemed like a mile walk from the elevator. We were going to try out Diamonds Tavern for dinner one night, but VP Biden was in town -- there was secret service and cops everywhere plus some VIP event in the banquet hall, thus they closed the crosswalk from within the hotel and blocked the street outside the hotel. Couldnt easily access the place. Game attendees had to walk entirely around the hotel to get to the yards. So we went elsewhere. Besides we heard it was pricey and more foo-foo than food. We ended up splurging at Della Notte, a very upscale Tuscan restuarant. IT was costly, but the service and the food was memorable with great portions. Forget about room service at Hilton: you will pay another half the original cost in tip and fees. The gym is well-appointed except for the rinky-dink pool Not everyone does laps, some poeple like to just float or free-style swim. The gym DOES have a great view of Camden Yards. Some other tips/ reminders about Baltimore: they rate high in food inspection statistically. Park at the airport. Study the maps. There is more than the Inner Harbor.

I was traveling to Baltimore with my wife and two small children, aged 8 and 2, for outpatient surgery the next day. We stayed in Room 919 and slept in separate beds. Around 3 a.m. I felt the itch, turned on the light, investigated for a mosquito or spider and pulled back the pillow. There on one of them was a very small, almost-round, auburn-colored beetle scurrying fast across the white pillow. I flicked it hard a few times with my fingernail and killed it; my blood dripped across the fabric. I photographed it. We called downstairs and at about 3:45 an \u201cengineer\u201d arrived with insecticide and pliers. He promptly identified it as a bed bug and crushed the carcass with his tool. For the next 45 minutes we were interviewed, made to complete a lengthy security form and moved to another room on another floor (Room 1536). Later that morning, I had shoulder surgery. We could not return to New York until the next day. We grew frustrated by the difficulty of being reasonably compensated for the room, inconvenience, discomfort, clothes cleaning and luggage replacement costs. Websites confirmed that it was a bed bug, and we contacted experts who advised us about the costly risks associated with bringing bugs home. Still Hilton management resisted anything but the idea that this was a) not a bed bug, b) an isolated experience or c) something we had somehow brought with us and carefully planted under the pillow on the far side of the room from our belongings. It became a nightmare ordeal. I had an allergic reaction to the bites that grew swollen and inflamed for several days and required antibiotics. Eventually, our lodging expenses were waived, but Hilton declined to cover our lost luggage and cleaning request, $300. Needless to say, given the traumatic experience, the conduct of Hilton staff and management and the attempted intimidation by Hilton\u2019s insurance company, we won\u2019t be back and would never recommend this hotel to others.

I have celiac disease and require gluten and diary free food. Booking through a conference agency, I requested special accommodations which were not communicated to the Hilton. When I ordered breakfast I told the waiter Christopher that I had a food allergy and that I had mentioned it ahead of time. Chris came back and said that the Chef had eggs and fruit for me. Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed, as I travel often and have no other choice but to settle for such a limited menu. I even told Christopher that I could go down the street to Whole Foods and come back with prepared items for breakfast if the chef would allow this. Christopher conveyed my message to the Chef shortly after that Christopher returned and said that the Chef would investigate Whole Foods today and promises that tomorrow I would have some variety to choose from. The Chef introduced himself to me and personally planned the rest of the conventions meals with me, which the staff was well aware of. Much to my surprise, the next morning I had cylindrical cinnamon buns glazed in sugar, brown rice toast and an egg white omelette. It was not only delicious, but also very well presented. In fact, all my meals were healthy, delicious and were well presented. The resident manager introduced himself to me and apologized for the miscommunication as well. He provided me with his card and extended his assistance for the remainder of my stay. He followed through with a number of my meals and made sure that I was completely satisfied and was very visible throughout my stay. I was so pleased with the ease in which my food allergy was handled and with such professionalism. All the waitstaff had been informed and so were the other chefs. I had a consistent and hassle free delivery of my meals throughout the conference. Having had such a carefree business conference, I decided to book a leisure trip at this hotel for a Red Sox Game. This hotel's staff far exceeds any Hilton I have been to. I attend conferences throughout the united states and have been to many, many Hilton's. This one far exceeds the true definition of \"hospitality\". From the staff to the administrative, this hotel is consistent in its service to the customer. Bravo to Jacque D'Rovencourt, the Resident Manager, the Executive Chef Christian Gallice, and the wait staff Christopher! The rooms are spacious, beautiful and new. The decor has a wonderful ocean and exotic wood overtones with lots of natural materials. The fourth floor gym and pool area are new, clean, easy to use. The full wall of the gym room is glass which overlooks Camden Yards. The adjacent deck is a nice relaxing area to take in a game as well. Easy to get to - a 10 minute ride to the airport. This hotel not only has location, location its priority is the customer and is consistent with the delivery of that goal. A home run in my book! Book today!

Some rooms look out over Camden Yards ( as does the Executive lounge on the 18th floor) but I loved our view of the Bromo Seltzer clock tower and everything beyond. We had a living room with a pull out sofa and a bedroom with a king bed, one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Mr. Reggie Cox was so accommodating at check in. I needed to get in to my room early because I was a presenter that day and he made it happen. The front desk also allowed us a late check out. The executive lounge was wonderful- the food was fresh, well presented and replaced often. In addition to a continental breakfast, coffee, water, soda and snacks were available all day and from 5-7 they offered a nice variety of hors d'oeuvres, different each evening. Alianna in the executive lounge was wonderful and welcoming. The service at the hotel was impeccable. Everything we asked for was delivered very quickly- wine glasses, an extra robe etc. We were also given a code for free internet access upon check in which was unexpected and greatly appreciated.

My family decided to join me and take advantage of the snow and sites while in town. The hotel in nicely situated and has super access to the harbor area with the free Charm City Circulator bus stop right in front of the hotel. The bellman was super, friendly and amazingly adept at packing a cart with an excessive amount of our luggage. Our room and hospitality suite overlooked Camden Yards with a private balcony, living room, dining room and separate bedroom with 2 bathrooms. To say the least it was the most perfect arrangement for a family of four. The rooms were spotless, kudos to an attentive housekeeping staff. The pool on the 4th floor is lovely and incredibly well maintained by a friendly and hard working Brazilian young lady serving as a lifeguard. She never let a puddle stand, kept the towels fresh and paid attention to the pool goers and children with a smile. She is not directly affiliated with the Hilton I believe but she represented the franchise well. Our kids loved the free breakfast and happy hour munchies in the Executive Lounge daily. I especially found Eric Miller to be a real asset to the team and he handled a difficult patron extremely well. Who would have thought that a lack of hard boiled eggs would send someone over the edge? The views of the ballpark are lovely and the walk or bus ride into the harbor area is manageable. You have direct connection to the convention center so it would be a great stay for events at that location. We also had a few meals at the Diamond Tavern and found something to suit all our needs from full meals to lighter fare. We were especially impressed with the Director of Food and Beverage, Jonathan, who happened upon us on the escalator and inquired if our youngest daughter liked the menu and what she had eaten. He also pointed out the treasure chest of toys for kids dining at the Tavern that we had missed. Overall I was so truly impressed by the genuine concern for our experience and satisfaction. Same thing with Vonjamis in the morning who made a point to check in with us and say good morning, just a great staff and meals. We stay at many Hilton hotels around the world and I must say this is one that I would certainly visit again if only for the lovely accomodations, beautiful pool and hot tub, fitness facility and friendly people.

If you take the water taxi, get off in the neighborhood of Fell's Point for a pint of Guiness at any of the little taverns! What fun! Fort McHenry should take no more than 1 to 1-1/2 hours to see, then back to the water taxi. There are no restaurants at the Fort, so make sure you eat before you go.

Yes, you can get there through an enclosed walkway, but it didn't feel like part of the hotel. We ate there for breakfast - be prepared for the prices. The breakfast buffet was $19, which I feel is high even for the area. One surprising thing was how quiet this hotel is. At other hotels, you could hear the sirens all night. That didn't happen here. If you want a great hotel convenient to the stadium, this is the place to stay. If you're worried about convenience to the harbor, this one is an easy several block walk, but there are comparables closer to the harbor that I would look at.", "Date": "August 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to experience the Inner Harbor and Camden\u201d", "Author": "fourseasonsOhio", "ReviewID": "UR37949558", "Content": "We went to Baltimore to take on the Orioles baseball game and stayed at the Hilton on West Pratt street overlooking Camden.

Furtheremore, since it is surrounded by restaurants and the baseball museum, there was a real sense of festivity. We received great personal service from the hotel restaurant for our breakfast. Located on the street level, the hotel restaurant was great place to watch the baseball crowds. A short walk along Pratt street takes you to the inner harbor.

My mother invited me to tag along on her conference in Baltimore, and of course I accepted when she told me we'd be staying in the Hilton. The first thing I noticed when I walked into the lobby was the sheer size of the lobby, as well as the ginormous bar that had on all the local sports. First, I'll get the bad stuff out of the way. I'm a Choice Hotel person myself, and at all but one I've stayed at, the computer use was FREE to all guests (the lone exception had no computer center)...the one that also had printers allowed you to print in black and white for FREE, too! Not at the Hilton, though. It's $60/hour even if you just want to play solitaire, and if you want to print something out, that's $1 for a B&W page, and $2 for color. Dubya tee eff! I figured it would be the OTHER way around, but then again, people who stay at the Hilton tend to have quite a bit of money. Another problem was the bed. You'd think at a 3+ star hotel, the beds would be the epitome of comfort, right? Not here! The beds were the most uncomfortable things I have ever slept in. I almost slept on the recliner that was in our room. Another issue is the RIDICULOUS prices! $4 for a TWELVE OUNCE COKE!? The Diamond Tavern is the restaurant across the street from the main hotel, and is part of the Baltimore Hilton, but AVOID IT for EVERYTHING but dessert and the cocktails. The beef sandwich I ordered tasted like straight-up salt, but the white chocolate cheesecake (which was FREE!) was DIVINE. Everything else was EXCELLENT. When my mother seemed to have misplaced every form of ID she had (it was in the back seat of my car the whole time, which I didn't discover until I had gotten home), the clerk at the check-in counter allowed her to check in with her AHA CPR card, informing her \"We won't be responsible for fraudulent charges.\" Once her driver's license had been faxed into the hotel from the office back in Jersey, all was well in the world. The room service is wonderful, coming quickly, and although it's danged expensive, the food was quite delicious. The menu is the same as the restaurant I mentioned, but it's prepared with much greater care. Every room has an HDTV with 100 channels. The Harbor is a couple of blocks away and all the things that go with it. DC is also a short drive and METRO ride away. If you're not from the immediate 500 mile area, Philadelphia and the Jersey Shore are 2 hours or so away. When I was leaving (my mother was staying for her work, and would be coming home with a co-worker), my mother asked me if I had enough decadence for one lifetime. Not even close, I didn't get to try the Godiva chocolate chip pancakes! Yes, you read that right.

The first day wake-up call was also at the wrong time (I know this happens from time to time, but added to everything else, it didn't help). For the price I paid (296/night) I expected more. In all, it was a nice hotel, but next time, I will stay somewhere else.", "Date": "November 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed our stay\u201d", "Author": "missykayePA", "ReviewID": "UR20979619", "Content": "This hotel is new and clean and the beds were very comfortable.

As a result, it was a challenge to get free internet. We had to pay for it and then argue with the staff about why we were supposed to receive free internet. Eventually, however, they did refund the internet charges. So, if you are booking a sight and sound room to get free internet, make sure that you are actually placed in that type of room. The hotel is connected to the convention center, which was very convenient. It's also about a 5-10 minute walk to the Inner Harbor area, where there are shops, restaurants, the National Aquarium, etc. Although the area between the hotel and Inner Harbor is well lit and bustling, be warned that day and night we were approached at nearly every block by homeless people asking for money.

I booked my room at this hotel because I was coming in for a conference and wanted to be near the convention center. I'm also a baseball fan so I wanted the \"view\" of the Ballpark. I stayed 5 nights at a rate of $235 per night for the Executive Floor (plus about $40 PN in fees). Don't know what anyone would do without being on the \"Executive Floor.\" There aren't refrigerators in any of the rooms, so if you want cold water, you have to go the \"lounge\" - which is located on the 18th floor. The lounge is open from 6:30 am - to 11:00pm. The breakfast is available until 11:00am, and then the \"appitizers\" are served from 5:00 - 7:00. in between those hours, you can still access the lounge for cold beverages and cookies. With no refrigerator in the room, worth every penny! It took me 3 days to find my way from the hotel (including what floor to be on), and the convention center. There are NO DIRECTIONS! we were completely lost. There should be something in the elevators that says \"USE L2 for CONVENTION CENTER SKYWALK.\" Staff was very friendly and helpful. The lobby bar was packed every night. Didn't try out the in-house restaurant. No sense in taking (or paying more) for a \"ballpark\" view if you arent on the Executive floors, you can't see in the stadium, all that is in front of you is a steel structure. I was on the 20th floor - (top) and could barely see in. Now, why I would not be back to this hotel. TOO FAR TO WALK!!! OK if you are only going for a day or 2, you wouldn't mind the walk to the Harbor, but 5 days. Never again. First of all, I was bored after 2 days - Went on 2 Stadium tours, Toured the USS Constitution, a submarine, Science Center, Aquarium, even walked 8 blocks in the opposite direction to B&O Railroad museum (that was awesome). We had a car so we drove to \"Bo Brooks\" - used the GPS and still got lost - evidently they built condos around the restaurant, so you have to know where it is! After finally calling them to ask how to get there, the crab cakes were some of the best I have ever eaten. Don't waste your time at Phillips for dinner - too touristy and the CC aren't very good. Though, it was a great place to hang outside and have a drink in the afternoon. Also ate at Fogo de Chao (excellent, but the cuts of beef aren't as good as a good steak house), Cheesecake Factory (Had a 2-hr wait on a Tuesday night), DSX (sports bar on Pratt just across the street from the hotel), DaMimmo's (OMG! - AWESOME! free limo pick-up / drop off service to any of the local hotels) in Little Italy (VERY expensive, though), Shula's Steak House (food was fabulous, but the service was lacking), ESPN Zone (had to watch the Playoffs somewhere!), Hard Rock, and the Capital Grille. If I do go back, which won't be for years, I would definately stay at a more \"central\" location, like the Hyatt Regency, or the Renaissance Hotel, which are actually the same distance to the Convention Center, and you won't have to walk a mile at night.", "Date": "October 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Savannah, GA", "Title": "\u201cNew!\u201d", "Author": "Nature_Traveler", "ReviewID": "UR20647805", "Content": "The Baltimore Hilton is new and sparkling clean.

I couldn't reach the shower head to adjust the flow, and the housekeepers never replaced the \"to go\" cups after the first night. Neither did they replace the coffee for the coffee maker. Yikes. That was hard to deal with when I've become accustomed to having a nice cup of Joe in my room and then taking one with me as I set out for the day. I even called the front desk for more coffee the night before, and they failed to bring it. The concierge was helpful and made great restaurant suggestions. They did mis-schedule the Super Shuttle for me though. That meant I got a wake-up call at 3:45 am saying the Shuttle was waiting for me...the day before I left. Their $19 breakfast buffet was pretty plain. They brought me a coffee carafe but cleared my table when I went to grab another muffin. There went my precious coffee. What's the deal with me and my Hilton coffee? Then the waitress never brought me any more though she knew the busboy had cleared my table. :( I gave their restaurant another try for dinner. The service was slow but courteous. The caesar salad was so salty I'm still retaining water. The sliders were overcooked. I think the restaurant needs some help to reach the level of service I expect from such an expensive place.

As a guest, I was allowed to take my car out to attend a wedding without having to pay the $26 per night garage fee twice. The hotel itself is in a perfect location. It sits directly across the street from the Orioles Camden Yards stadium (one of the few big league parks that hasn't sold its name to a defunct telephone company or a bankrupt bank). It's quite a dramatic site to see when walking out of the lobby. On the other side of the hotel, you get a nice view of the Bromo Seltzer tower (although the city fathers have long since removed the giant Bromo bottle from the top, leaving just a turret). You also see the Marriott all lit up, except the \"M\" in the name is burnt out. The standard room is quite spacious and gives you the option of wireless or DSL internet access. It's tastefully furnished and well-lit. I have a quibble about the lack of bottled water or a mini-bar in the room. Many hotels automatically stock rooms with water and charge if your drink. Here you have to order from room service and pay not just the expected $3 price but a $4 delivery fee. But no real complaints, considering I paid $112 for a room listed as $209. Use Priceline. Also, this hotel was financed with city bonds, so they are required to set aside the majority of the rooms for convention business. So, I assume, if you are there when no convention is scheduled, they have lots of rooms they want to unload. Sitting on Pratt Street, the hotel is a 5-minute drive to Mt. Vernon and an easy shot to anything else you want to see in town. It's also close enough to the University of Maryland grad campus so that you can find a decent, unpretentious & cheap coffee shop, Peace & a Cup of Joe, at 713 W. Pratt St. Some basic wholesome food (sandwiches made to order) and organic fair trade coffee.

You can actually see the interior of the Stadium from your room and with binoculars you might be able to watch the game. 2) The interior of the rooms have a new style desk with a \"sub\" computer desk underneath, to allow easier use of your laptop. I also enjoyed the interior room furnishing which were comfy. 3) The new flat screen TVs offer a wonderful selection of entertainment - more than movies and the usual TV selections. 4) The fitness center is wonderful for on the road fitness. 10 Treadmills, 7 Ellipticals, 3 Bikes, weights and 7 or 8 other pieces of equipment - all to be used while overlooking an enviable great view right into Camden Park and home plate! The center also includes a full sauna, full swimming pool and jacuzzi and an outdoor patio (which also overlooks Camden Park). Tip: Make sure you bring your earplugs to plug into the entertainment center equipment. The staff clearly is well trained and they are working hard to show it!
