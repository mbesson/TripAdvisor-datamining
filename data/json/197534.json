We were told it would be ready around 2:00. It wasn\u2019t. About an hour later, we were finally taken to our room. After that, everything was excellent! We booked a suite and it did not disappoint. The bedroom is wholly separated by two sliding doors and allows for complete privacy from the sitting room. The toilet is separate from the bathroom and is accessible from the hallway to the sitting room or the bathroom. Furnishings were both lovely and comfortable. The king bed was relatively comfortable and had very nice linens and four pillows. There was tea and coffee making facilities and a minibar that was restocked everyday. The suite was on the first floor above the lobby and bar. The whole time we were there we heard no noise from downstairs or from the street below when the windows were closed. There were French doors from the bedroom and from the sitting room which opened onto a huge balcony. It was furnished with enough resin wicker love seats and chairs to seat 6 people. It overlooked Ave de Friedland and the Arc de Triomphe. The first night there we were too tired to go looking for a restaurant so we ate at Bivouac Caf\u00e9 in the hotel. It\u2019s a beautiful space for drinks or dinner. The food, however, did not live up to the atmosphere. Neither of our meals were cooked. My husbands steak was not just rare, but raw in the middle. My salmon was also raw in the middle. None of the sides were hot. We also ordered room service a couple of times and the food was excellent. The portion sizes for breakfast (again, room service) were insane. Two breakfasts were ordered but enough food for 6 people was delivered. We gave it our best try! We were lucky enough with the weather that we were able to sit outside a couple of times and have a drink after a long day of sightseeing. The Bivouac patio has nice comfortable seating and catches the late afternoon sun. The staff was outstanding. They really took pride in their ability to provide us with anything we wanted or needed. I will say that as a Canadian, you really have to get used to the reserved nature of the French. At first it seems like they couldn\u2019t care less about you but at our first request and attempt at speaking very poor French, they couldn\u2019t have been more helpful. Excellent service. Maybe they felt sorry for my inability to pronounce any French word properly. We went to Normandy for 4 days and when we returned, we weren\u2019t able to get the same suite. We were instead given an even bigger suite on the 5th floor. It had a courtyard view which was quite pretty if not as dramatic as the view in the first room. The bed was even more comfortable. The bathroom was even bigger with 2 showers. There was twice as much closet space and shelving. Both rooms were gorgeous and spacious and I really couldn\u2019t fault either. If I were to return to Paris, I would not hesitate to book this hotel again and I would highly recommend it to anyone, especially the suites.

Our room number was 423. The room is much much smaller than shown in picture, with one window facing a courtyard, and opposite is a commercial office building. Barely any light came through. We purchased movies on the TV being 19 euros each, but none of their films were available to our room (funny enough we were charged each time). I contacted reception to see whether they could and \"would\" look into it, but all we got were shrugs. This was on the first night stay and they said nothing could be done. Someone came to our room to check the TV on the forth night (our last night stay), but yet it couldn't be fixed. Disappointing from beginning to end! On the room booking description says air conditioning available, but guess what,.. it doesnt apply in winter! Our room (or more correctly the entire hotel) soared to temperatures over 26-7 degrees celcius. It was stuffy and hot. I asked reception after the first night why our room air-condition set at 20 degrees celcius did not work, and the room was still very hot. She said that when the central airconditioning (set at very warm) is on, every room air-condition unit will be off. I was appalled by this, outside temperatures were around 5 degrees so heating up the hotel lobby and corridors meant setting their system to be very warm. This included all the rooms and corridors in the hotel. Given our tiny room, the room stayed very very warm.The lady staff said the only solution for better sleep was to leave our window open - all day and night. seriously?!?! We slept in sweat in winter!!! If I haven't prepaid my four nights stay at the Hotel Napoleon, I would have left after the first night.

This was especially convenient for me as I was hesitant to use the public transport by myself, and this lication allowed me to catch the hop on hop off bus from the Champs Elysses without first having to take a metro or bus to a central spot. The hotel has an old world charm, with warm and attentive staff. The check-in procedure was a breeze and even the porters were helpful with information regarding the hotel and the room. Concierge services were very efficient and helpful. I stayed in a standard room, which exceeded my expectations. One of the reasons I chose the Napoleon Hotel, apart from its location, was that the decor was authentically French and not the standard vanilla decor across many hotels (see pics and please mind the untidyness!). There was ample closet space including quaint bookshelves (filled with many good reads - a pleasant surprise!!). When you entered the room, there was a tiny \"entrance hall\" - see pic below, with a closet, and door to the bathroom, with a separate door leading to the bedroom. This was a nice touch to add more space to the room and to separate the bathroom from the bedroom. The bathrooms were a pleasure, especially for European standards. One can gauge that they were only just recently refitted, with modern and appealing fittings. A tip is to just tilt the showerhead a tad toward the door to avoid any water on the floor, but really that is a minor tip. A few things to bear in mind is that there is no free wifi, with 24 hour access costing you 20 euro. Also there are no tea/coffee facilities in the room, nor is room service available after midnight, so if you feel for a cup of coffee, you might have to take a short walk to one of the cafe's on the Champs which can be a bit of a schlep.

We loved the hotel and staff. You pay for location and services at this hotel. It is literally a stone's throw from the Arc de Triomphe, which we could see from our room's small balcony over Ave Friedland , and one block over from the hustle and bustle of the Champs Elysees. We stayed in a Junior Suite Avenue room. It was a large, oversized room with a comfortable firm king size bed, side tables, 2 desks, a small round table and plenty of seating, as well as a large armoir for hanging and storing clothes. There was also a flatscreen tv but I don't think we ever turned it on. The bathroom was clean and modern. The shower worked but not the best. The tub was great though as most Europeans take baths. The room was decorated in the usual Empire decor you find around Paris. It had high ceilings, lots of crown molding and air conditioning which worked wonderfully, as it was rather warm the days we were in Paris. The staff is exceptional. There was not a single incident where any staff member was not absolutely pleasant and helpful in every way. They gave us daily updates on the strike situation when we inquired. They happily uncorked bottles of wine we bought while out and about after returning to the hotel. They even told us that rose wine is terrible at room temperature and provided a wine bucket filled with ice water for us. Just great service and with a smile. I'm sure it helped a bit that my partner can speak French fairly well. Even though the staff can speak English it's helpful if some kind of effort on your part is made. But this is true anywhere anyone travels. We got the wireless internet in our room for $20euros/nt. We brought iPhones and, while they worked and got connected, it was sometimes difficult to connect, took some time, or the connection was frequently lost. The laptop seemed to find the weak wireless signal must easier and keep connected. That being said, it worked, we were able to email and post to facebook without a problem and have fun sharing our trip with friends and family back home. :o) Please note that when we booked the trip online, we checked the internet box. When we checked in and the rates all reviewed, we were told that we opted for the daily internet charge which we agreed to. It was explained to us that the bill will likely have multiple charges for connection to the internet, since you are technically charged every time you connect, which you must do daily providing a login and pw. You are told how to log in and works wonderfully. Just don't forget that you will have to do this daily. Your wireless will work, just wait for the login screen which might take a second to open up. Upon checking out we saw all the extra internet charges on our bill, they crossed out the extras and told us they will either not show up on our credit card bill or be a separate credit...........and that is exactly what happened when we saw our statement. Great hotel, great location, and superior customer service is what we found at Hotel Napoleon.

The room was a little warm, even though we had rain and cool weather outdoors, but the windows opened to the courtyard and it was very pleasant. As for the bathroom, it was a good size and very nicely done. The one problem we had was the shower, since there was only a small glass partition, rather than an enclosure, flooded the bath the first morning. After that, we simply had to be more cautious when showering. Again, not a big problem. We had the breakfast buffet included with our room and were very satisfied.

Our room overlooked the \"courtyard\" -- the floor of which was covered in green moss. Our view consisted of a large fabric construction barrier and a large building crane just on the other side of the barrier. The outside wall of the room had obviously been water damaged which resulted in peelng wallpaper, plaster, and water stains. (I have provided pictures of this.) The air conditioning didn't work and the room was quite stuffy. The beds were uncomfortable. The linens were of poor quality -- both bed and bath. The furniture was borken, chipped, and dirty. The hotel employs a \"master switch\" for electricity in the room -- you must leave your room key in the slot for the electricity to work. This was not explained to us -- so we left the spare card in the slot the first time we left the room and it was confiscated. Another downside to this system is that you cannot control the lights in the room independently -- it's either all on or all off. The hotel does not provide free internet service to its guests -- and the cost is ridiculous. And a three minute phone call to the U.S. from our room phone cost almost $15.00. On the plus side -- and in keeping with other reviews -- the hotel is conveniently located within a half block of the Charles de Galle Metro station.

They knew it was our one year wedding anniversary and when we entered our room we were happily surprised with a box of complimentary shortbread cookies and a bottle of water with a note congratulating us on our anniversary. The hotel is in the process of updating some of the rooms, so if you are lucky you may end up with one of these newer rooms. The location was very convient; we were 1 block from the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs-Elysees. We were in room 602, which had a lovely view of the Eiffel Tower. The room was small but as expected in Paris while the bathroom was a decent size. Our room was cleaned daily, and there is also turn down service every night. There is internet connection, but you have to pay for either 8 Euro for 1 hour for the day or 21 Euro for 24 hours. The heating was strong, and at times we had to open our balcony door to cool down the room. The hotel offers breakfast, but at a very high price, so we decided to get breakfast at the many caf\u00e9s along the Champs-Elysees. The hotel staff was very nice and friendly and helped us get situated to Paris. The concierge provided us with a power converter as the one we brought along failed to work. He was also very helpful in providing recommendations for restaurants and ways to get around the city. The shops and restaurants on the Champs are a bit pricey, but it you venture into the side streets off the Champs there are some very good finds in terms of cafes and bistros all at reasonable prices. One last note on the hotel location is that it is one block from the Charles de Gaulle Etoile metro station. The trains serviced at this station are the 1, 2, and 6 lines as well as the RER train. The 1 line goes to either La Defense (business district) or to many stops along the Champs-Elysees and also to the Louvre. You can take the 2 line to Montmartre where you can hike up to Sacre Coeur or stop by the Moulin Rouge (be careful of the street peddlers at the base of Sacre Coeur as they are very pushy and grabby). Lastly the 6 train will drop you off at Trocadero which provides a wonderful approach to the Eiffel Tower (visit here at night to view the tower light up every hour).", "Date": "December 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Woodlands, Texas", "Title": "\u201ca little dissapointed\u201d", "Author": "lindsey381", "ReviewID": "UR22679206", "Content": "We were a bit dissapointed in this hotel.

Having read several reports, I knew roughly what to expect from hotels in that city although it has been our first visit to France. Luckily we have picked the Napoleon for our stay, due to encouraging reports on this site and an interesting offer on the hotel's website. We were very happy with the hotel and here are a few reasons why : 1.Location: Without a doubt the hotel's biggest asset is its location, being a few minutes walk from the Charles de Gaulle-Etoile metro station, the Champs Elysees and the Arc de Triomphe, the hotel is in a safe and elegant part of the city, close to shops and (through the metro) close to all major Paris attractions. If you feel like walking instead you will find that there are wonderful walks down to the Eiffel Tower (should be less than 20mins), through the 16th arrondissement, one of the posh areas in Paris. As a matter of fact, other sites are also within walking distance down the spectacular Champs Elysees (weather and physical condition permitting). Please note that Avenue Friedland can get busy on weekdays and some traffic noise is heard even when windows are closed. For me this was not an issue and I like the idea of being close to the heart of the city. Do not take me wrong, the noise is not loud enough to keep you awake in the night or wake you up early on a busy morning, but it was somehow noticeable when the room was very quiet. This may be a problem for some but it shouldn't be for most people. 2.Room: Well OK, our standard room (4th floor facing Av.Friedland) seemed a little small, although bigger than what I initially expected when reading that this is normally the case in Paris. In any case it was very stylish with books, paintings and very romantic lighting, and it gave us the feeling we're at home rather than in a hotel a few thousand miles from it. The room was practical with decent room for our personal items, a very nice flat sat-TV and (what was more important during our stay) a very effective heating system. It provided all we needed in a very unique package, unlike many hotels that look more or less the same. 3.Bathroom:You cannot expect a big bathroom in a relatively small room right? Nevertheless, although the hotel aims to create a 18th-19th century atmosphere, the bathroom was very modern and adequate in size (which for me is good, since that its a place where advances in technology are more than welcome). We did have a minor problem with the drain when we first arrived but notified the staff and it has been fixed in no time. 4.Service: The feeling that I was at home rather than in a hotel was enhanced by the level of service. You could never see them, or hear them, but the room was always in a perfect condition. Our privacy had always been respected and for me this is one of my main concerns when traveling. Check in/out took less than 5 minutes and although my French is, well ..understandable to say the least, even when I was using English I had no problem with the reception staff. 5.Breakfast: The warm and stylish atmosphere of the Napoleon can also be found in the Cafe Bivouac, which is essentially the place where breakfast is served, but also a nice cafe/bar or restaurant in the evenings. Breakfast is a little pricey yes, and some could argue that there is not a huge variety. I say that for its size the hotel offers a great choice of high quality food served at a very elegant place. I am not a great fan of huge buffets, still I cannot think of anything the average person would desire which was not offered in the Napoleon. Overall, I have no experience from other hotels in Paris, but I have had experience from several hotels around the world. The Napoleon is small, friendly and very stylish. It is ideally located, offers multilingual service, it is clean, quiet and the food (at least the breakfast I tried) is excellent. I cannot think of any reason why I should want to try a different hotel in that city and yes, if I return to Paris, I will try to book in the Napoleon again. I have recommended it to my friends and definitely I do recommend it to any potential visitor of that amazing city.", "Date": "December 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Laguna Beach, CA, USA", "Title": "\u201cEven Napoleon would have liked it...\u201d", "Author": "The-Mystic-Bunnies", "ReviewID": "UR22498358", "Content": "Flew from LA - Paris on Air France. Air France lost 1/3 of our luggage. Wasn't too pleased with the entire Air France experience. That being said, a 50 euro taxi ride (40 minutes) to Napoloen from the airport. The front desk and concierge staff were all very pleasant and helpful. All spoke fluent English; however, we always try to speak the local language, which I think in France, in particular, helps. We met very kind and helpful French people everywhere and only had two what I would call over-the-top-unwarranted 'unfriendly' experiences, one with the ticket lady at the Arc De Triomphe and one with the visitor center guards at the Normandy cemetary (which really, really PMO)...we were the only ones at the cemetary and they treated us like terrorists...way over the top bag searches, rudeness, remove your jackets, etc., etc..these guards are French and paid by the US cemetary services or something. I know security is a concern, but they were extremely rude, one of them in particular. And believe me, it was unprovoked. Oh well, enough of that. The hotel was very charming and clean. We had a Junior suite which was very big for European standards...huge king bed, fold out sofa, desk, coffee table, entry-way and large, two-sink bathroom. There were places where the paint was peeling off around the room; they could make a pass through with a fresh coat of paint and maybe a carpet refresh. So, although nice, don't expect a Four seasons or Ritz experience. But again, don't let this sway your opinion - very nice place. We had a great view of Avenue de Friedland and about 1/2 of the Arc de Triomphe. The kid stayed in her own 'standard' room which was also very nice, with a 'garden view' - not really a garden, though - but more of a courtyard/patio. Breakfast was very nice, and convenient....I would opt for this since there is not much open early in the morning on the Champs de Lysee except a french version of a fast food pastry place, and yes, a McDonalds. As far as the hotel location - only a stone's throw from the Arc. Very quiet in the room with windows closed, which we had closed since it was freezing outside. Heat worked great. Room service very good. Very easy acces to subway/metro. Don't be intimidated by the metro - very easy to get around, and much less expensive than a taxi. For instance, it will cost 1.8 euro to get to Monmarte by metro and about 20 for a taxi (with no traffic). You could walk to the Louvre from the hotel, down the Champ de Lysee, but it will take probably an hour. By metro, only a 10 minute ride. We did a minibus tour through Viator for Normandy, Point du Hoc and Juno beach ( I recommend) as well as a Seine dinner cruise, Louvre tour and bicycle tour of Versailles. We've had really good luck with Viator all over Europe. They can arrange cattle-call tourist tours or private tours, too. On the metro, we visited Monmarte, Notre Dame, Eiffel tower and a few other places. There were no lines to speak of anywhere, since it was so cold and 'the low season'. We prefer this though, since I can't imagine the-packed-like-sardines elevator ride up the eiffel in 100-degree summer heat. Several restaurants up and down the Champs by the hotel, but I'd recommend venturing up and down the side streets to pick your place to eat. As always, I'm sure many of you know - wait until the airport to use your ATM/debit for cash. Don't use those cash-exchange services ('rip-off') If you are asked if you want your credit card charged dollars or euros, pick euros...as this will be much less expensive when your CC company does the conversion. There is no 'Arc De Triomphe' exit on the metro - you get off at the Charles De Gaulle exit for the Napoleon. Buy a metro pass, try the metro and don't be afraid - very easy. Anyway, Napoleon was very nice with a very nice staff....and very fairly priced. You won't be disappointed... Our neighbor recommended the Hotel Regina, which was right next to the Louvre, that looked nice too. Paris is a very, very beautiful city - dare we say the most beautiful we've seen in the world - and you'd need a month to see only part of it. And, finally, God Bless all the US, Canadian and Brit soldiers that are buried around Normandy - 9000 US at the main cemetary, but there is also a Canadian cemetary with 2300 dead not to far from Normandy that we never know about.

We had room service several times, and although the price was high, the quality of the food was by far the best we had the whole trip.

The hotel also sits right on a major subway station, Charles De Gaulle Etoile. From there you can access almost any subway in Paris and get wherever you want to go in only a few stops. I loved this hotel, and I highly recommend it. I could have stayed forever and was sad to have to leave.

You really can't fault the location, a stones throw from the Arc De Triomph, and the hotel is on the road directly behind the Champs Elysee. The view from the balcony of the room - A panoramic View Room, was one of the best in Paris, a view of the Eiffel Tower, which was amazing to see at night when the tower is all lit up. So easy to catch the red open top tourist bus from the top of the Champ Elysee opposite the Arc, and jump on and off to explore Paris. There is also a metro station just over the road from the bus stop so transport is a great plus when staying at this hotel. But you do have more than a couple of Paris's attractions on your doorstep if you stay at this hotel, I would recommend walking down the Champs Elysee and having a wander around first, its not far from the Eiffel Tower, or the Siene. Perfectly do-able after dinner at the Eiffel Tower and a leisurely walk back stopping in a few cafes for a glass of wine or ten! The service in the hotel was of a high standard, and when you walk it it certainly give you the feel of being in Paris. It had all the decor of being in an elegant french hotel - and was exactly that! The room itself was huge, with a massive bed and a sofa, mini bar, desk and flat screen tv. There was a table and chairs on the balcony to admire the view. There was ample wardrobe space and a safe for valuables. The bathroom was large - but a little quirky - the shower didn't reach far enough over the batch to wash with ease - but you can sit on the edge of the batch against the wall and have a rest while you shower! It certainly didn't put me off, it just added to the charm. There was a hairdryer in the bathroom and slippers and robes, all little extra touches to make you feel comfortable, inlcuding the chocolates on your pillow. All aspects of the hotel were spotless, and I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are treating a loved one, or for a really romantic weekend break or as a special birthday present.", "Date": "August 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "vancouver", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "mckees", "ReviewID": "UR19130411", "Content": "2nd time in Paris.

Especially impressed with the price we paid through Expedia, as I have had indifferent experiences in Paris hotels for the same sort of money in the past. I was amused to read other reviewers' comments on this hotel, especially from those who simply equate quality with size ... the rooms are not enormous but by Paris standards they are more than generous, certainly more than big enough for my friend and I to feel comfortable in our twin room. Everything was spotlessly clean, and the beds superbly comfortable. Magazines in English had been left in our room prior to our stay. The desk staff were helpful and spoke good English. The breakfast is expensive, but we were allowed a discount for one breakfast so took breakfast there once, which was excellent .. the other two mornings there was no problem finding a cafe, although if you're doing the same, I'd advise that you avoid the cafe nearly opposite which was expensive for poor-quality pastries, and head on to the Champs Elysees instead. The very best thing about this hotel is its location: two minutes from the metro at the Arc de Triomphe, I have never stayed so centrally in Paris and it was marvellous. My only word of warning: we decided to treat ourselves to a taxi back to Charles de Galle airport and asked the front desk to book it for us, which they happily did. However, I luckily checked with them what the price would be, and was calmly informed \"around 120 euros\"!!!! Needless to say, we cancelled ... a taxi to the airport isn't cheap from central Paris but it shouldn't cost that.

The hotel lobby, hallways and room were beautiful....just what you'd want in Paris. We had a corner room on the 5th floor and could see the top of the Eiffel Tower and the Arc (at an angle) from our room. The room was very spacious and felt like a little apartment because it had a small foyer when you walked in and opened up to a sitting area with a desk near the king sized bed and a large armoire. The room was furnished with old world charm, but the bathroom was moden, spacious with double sink, had a great hair dryer and plenty of room to unpack to make you feel at home. The only complaint would be that the glass shower door wasn't long enough so water sprayed on the floor (seems to be a European thing). We also loved the separate toilet area with it's own sink.

The hotel itself doesn't have that much amenities/entertainment, however we went to paris to enjoy the city and not the hotel. I highly recommend this hotel to every one wanting a relaxed accomodation in paris. The cost is average -French standards.", "Date": "April 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico City", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Napoleon\u201d", "Author": "alejandro0809", "ReviewID": "UR14947399", "Content": "Back home I only want to thank you for the marvelous time we spent in Paris, I want to thank you all kindness you provided to me and my family, thanks to all hotel staff, for the lovely suite provided, decoration, the view to Friedland and the Triumph Arc, we realy enjoyed it specialy after a day walking around this beatiful city, the relaxation of the bath tub, the size of the bathroom!! and the very well lighted, many things in our memories.

I had read several reviews of this hotel before leaving and became concerned and therefore wrote to the hotel The manager wrote back and assured me that the reviews were from disgruntled people who wanted discounts and offered to upgrade me. She was charming but also told me she would be out of town while I stayed there. The room was not an upgrade and at best a very low three star room. It was clean,very clean but the wallpaper was old and coming off the bottom, the bathroom, although redone had a painted plywood ceiling. This was Room 509. That would have been okay for me as I was only staying one night and then meeting friends and moving into a Paris apartment. However, I had a very bad adventure which the Napoleon made worse. Upon arriving, they ushered me to my room immediately (at 9:00 a.m.); this was great. I took a nap and at 1 p.m. I went out to go to Poulaine, my favorite bakery, to buy bread. I had always ridden the metro so had no trouble doing it again. Upon my return, I was about to exit Charles DeGaulle/Etiole metro station but hestitated because I wanted to find the exit closest to the hotel. I sat down, looked at my map, found it and began to exit up the steep escalator. At the top a young man bent over and prevented me from getting off. When I tried to jump over him, the man behind me grabbed me by the back of my coat and slammed me into the subway wall three times, knocked the wind out of me; I fell to the floor where he kicked me, reached into my pockets and stole all my credit cards and money. I yelled \"Policer, policer,\" but no one came and the passersby just looked at me funny and kept walking. I pulled myself together and went to the hotel. I went to the front desk and told them what happened and asked them to call the police. They said the police don't come out for this kind of thing but that I could walk to the polcie station a few blocks away. It was getting dark and I wasn't venturing outside again. Then I explained that they had stolen all my credit cards and money. They jumped into action. They got the copy of my passport and credit card they had taken on check in and immediately charged my room to the credit card. \"Now that we have charged your room, here is a number to call to cancel your card.\" I was little stunned. I stayed at the desk and called Bank of America and Citibank while the various front desk people watched. No one offered me any consolation except for a nice young man who told me he had lived in North Africa and had seen these things happen a number of times there but not in Paris. He said I was lucky the man did not use a knife. My business concluded, I went to my room. The next morning I called and explained that I was having money wired to me on that day but that I didn't have money for breakfast or coffee and could they see fit to send me breakfast or coffee and I promised I would pay for it as soon as Western Union wired me the money (which was supposed to be by 2 p.m. Paris time). NO. I had not eaten since New York where I changed planes and also hadn't had anything to drink. NO. I called theree or four times and finally a bellboy brought me a cup of black coffee and put his finger to his lips as if to say, \"don't tell anyone\". I was outraged by the inhumanity of the entire thing. They were kind enough to accept my new credit card when it arrived on Wednesday and called me at the apartment to pick it up. But, on Sunday, the man behind the desk made me write a letter authorizing them to accept the card. Upon check out they argued with me over 6 euros for phone calls I made to the credit card companies but eventually forgave that. I grabbed a cab to the apartment as I had left 10 euro in the hotel room before being mugged. It was not enough. Luckily, the cab driver was nicer than the people at this hotel and gave me the ride for 10 euro. NEVER STAY HERE IF YOU ARE AMERICAN. I DON'T THINK THE PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE CARE VERY MUCH FOR AMERICANS. OR, THEY ARE ALL JUST VERY COLD. $300? God, no. Not even worth $90. It's a Motel 6 on a bad day.

Location was superb, the staff very friendly, and price a bargain in comparison to its main rivals in the locale. the only down points are (as stated in several reviews) are the rooms are very warm at night with very poor air con. We had to leave our windows open in the day to cool the room down - as the air con did not work properly. Also beware of the rip off brasseries along the champs elyssee, close to the hotel. 50 Euros for a petit de jeneur? Walk a few hundred yards behind the hotel instead (but this really is not the hotels fault - but if they provided a better and cheaper alternative that would be good). All in all we spent 400 Euros for a supior romm for a two person and two night stay - and in retrospect it was worth every penny.
