This place has several things to recommend it. Access: Extremely easy from Ataturk Airport, take the metro to Zeytinburnu and change to the tram (drection Kabatas) getting off at Sultanahment. From Sabiha Gokcen, take the Havas bus to Taksim, then the funicular to Kabatas and from there the tram (Direction Zeytinburnu) and get off at Sultanahmet. The hotel is 3 minutes walk from Sultanahment station. or you could get a taxi, but with public transport this cheap and accessible why bother (unless you have lots of suitcases) Location Perfect, The hotel is super close to all the main sites, Topkapi Hagia Sofia, Yerebatan Cistern, Blue Mosque, Hippodrome, Grand Bazaar but in saying that it is located off the main drag so it is very peaceful at night. The area immediately surrounding the hotel is known for it's booksellers and printing houses. (the first Turkish newspaper was founded just around the corner). Sirkeci Station (train) and Eminonu ferry terminal are just down the hill which gives you access to the Bosphorus, Golden Horn and the Asian side of the city. The main tramline that passes Sultahamet goes to Kabatas is excellent for exploring the Taksim and Istikal Cad area. Take the tram to Kabatas, then the funicular to Taksim, walk the length of Istikal Cad (shops and more shops) then you can either walk down the Karakoy (stopping off to see the Galata tower) or take the funicular to downhill and take the tram back across the Galata bridge to Sultanahmet. Ambience Comfortable and cozy are words that spring to mind Rooms Again comfortable and cozy, but also warm and clean with impeccable bathroom with shower, airconditioning, tv,. Beds are comfortable with a duvet and footblanket. The rooms are cleaned everyday and to a very high standard. Food: Breakfast is generous, plenty of tea and coffee along with all the other things that make a leisurely holiday breakfast, fruit, cereals, charcuterie, hot options. Lunch and dinner are available in the hotel, the menu is small-ish but more than acceptable.

So now it is the Arden City Hotel Anex. Staff did not even apologise for this. Next thing we discovered was that the man who is in charge of the room keys (???) is away, and they canot access some of the rooms, so we have to stay a night in another hotel round the corner. Again, there was no apology, no acknowledgement that this was a pain for us, nothing. Overall the staff were not good. At breakfast, we had to keep asking for things like spoons, bowls, milk, glasses - it was a buffet, but it seemed like nothing had been replenished, so that when we came down late-ish,there were a lot of things missing off it. also the bread etc was gone stale and hard from sitting out all morning. disappointing, beause it looked like a good spread.

Stay away.\u201d", "Author": "Mugrin", "ReviewID": "UR72394943", "Content": "I chose to stay at Le Piano because 1) it was new and looked cute in the pictures, and 2) it had gotten a lot of glowing reviews on TripAdvisor during its short time in operation. I booked the room in complete confidence, and I really wish I had something nice to say, instead of what I'm about to. Let me preface this review by saying that I am a mellow, easygoing person who has traveled to hundreds of hotels all over the world, mostly for business. I'm no stranger to no-frills operations, but even without the horrifying thing that happened to me, this hotel would still have ranked at bottom of all the hotels I've ever stayed at. To wit: I arrived in Istanbul on a hot, muggy day in July, and they put me in a room (number 101) without functioning air conditioning. This, despite the fact that the hotel advertised that each room had individually-controlled AC units. Someone had apparently tried to compensate for this deficiency by putting a small fan next to the bed. Not terribly helpful. To make matters worse, only one of the two windows in the bedroom could be opened all the way. The other could only be opened a crack. The hotel did not supply sheets or blankets, as one might expect with, well, any normal hotel. Instead, the bed was covered with a single thin, scratchy bed spread that was too small to even cover the bed from end to end. The toilet paper holder fell clean out of the wall with the gentlest tug on the roll, and could not be reattached. The lights in the hallway were on power-save mode. They were programmed to turn off within two seconds of any detected movement. This meant that I had to fumble for my key card in the dark, or constantly pace back and forth in the hallway while digging through my purse, to avoid an annoying strobe-like effect. The minibar fridge didn't keep things cold. I don't usually use the minibar for snacking, but I had some medication that needed to be refrigerated, and I do use minibars for that purpose. Destroyed. Half the time, the elevator didn't seem to work. Didn't bother me much, because I was only 2 flights up. Also, there was no phone in the room. ---------------------------------------------- And this is where things really started to go south... Resigning to the fact that I was going to be hot and uncomfortable, I took a quick cold shower, opened the one functioning window, threw the bedspread aside, deadbolted the door and climbed into bed au naturelle, wrapped in a towel. I woke up a little after midnight to find the door hanging open, and a middle-aged, non-english-speaking man wandering around my room (which, as you might remember, had been deadbolted before I went to bed). I was a little disoriented, but it struck me as deeply troubling that a strange man was carrying on in my room while I'm in bed naked. I grabbed the blanket as quickly as I could to cover myself, and as I fumbled around the bed looking for something to bludgeon him with if things turned south, I asked him what the hell he was doing in my room. He said something, but not in any language I could understand. I asked him to get out. He didn't. He wandered around my room for probably less than a minute, but it felt like an eternity. Finally, when it became that he wouldn't respond to a polite request to leave, I screamed at the top of my lungs for him to get the F out of my room. Thank god, he did. I deadbolted the door again, not sure exactly what had happened, and I looked for a phone to call the front desk, but there wasn't one. I put on the clothes I had been wearing earlier that day, and walked to the front desk to ask if they could tell me why a man had shown up in my room in the middle of the night, uninvited. The concierge didn't seem to know what to do, but I just stood there telling him again and again that someone had shown up in my room while I was sleeping, and I really didn't like it. Finally, a bellhop showed up and the concierge said, \"is it this guy?\" I said that it was not. They talked back and forth in Turkish, and the concierge ended up telling me, by way of explanation, that the bellhop had let the strange man into my room because he had forgotten his room key somewhere, and I guess gotten our rooms mixed up since we were on the same floor. Furthermore, according to the concierge, the reason that the strange man didn't leave right away was because he was confused and thought I was his wife. I said I wanted to move to a different room because I was 1) sweltering hot and 2) really scared, but the concierge said there was no need for that, and that he would just reprogram my room lock so that no key but mine could open my door. In other words, the hotel master keys would be disabled. He must have said \"please trust us\" like 20 times. He couldn't seem to understand, why a young single woman, traveling alone, would have such a big problem with what had just happened to me. He kept saying \"just trust us.\" But why? Trust has to be earned. What kind of hotel lets strangers wander into other people's rooms without double checking to see if they really belong there? What kind of hotel has doors that will open from the outside when they've been deadlocked from within? I would have left the hotel right then, but it was nearly one o'clock in the morning, no taxis in the streets, and I had no idea where else to go. So I went upstairs again, but I really can't say I slept for the rest of the night. The next morning, I went downstairs to find a different concierge, who agreed to let me change rooms. I went back to my room to find that my door key didn't work, but one of the maids passing by swiped her master key, which worked just fine. So the concierge from the night before was either a complete incompetent, or he lied to me about reprogramming the lock. Anyway, I changed rooms to one with functioning AC and windows and I stayed at the hotel for the full 3 nights I had prebooked, but I would never stay there again or recommend it to anyone else. This once-in-a-lifetime experience cost me 295 euros (3 nights). You couldn't pay me to stay there again.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milton Keynes", "Title": "\u201cIdeal location\u201d", "Author": "BenMiltonKeynes", "ReviewID": "UR71368686", "Content": "A very nice hotel, new this year.
