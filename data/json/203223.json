Excellent rooms with all amenities - good towels, plenty of toiletries - and wonderful breakfast - sausages, scambled eggs and lovely crispy bacon along with fruit salad, cereals, cold meats and cheeses and a huge variety of breads and cakes. The staff were friendly and helpful and made dinner recommendations etc. There was tea/coffee and orange juice available each afternoon free of charge and many places to eat locally. The area felt very safe for two ladies travelling and everything was in walking distance. We took the metro from Termini to Cavour - one stop, one euro and the hotel it less than two minutes walk from the station. Also took the Alitalia bus from the airport to Termini which worked very well. One tip if visiting the Vatican book it online before you leave to save waiting for hours in the queues but only book the entrance fee not a guided tour. You will be better getting an audioguide when you get there so you can take your time going round, rather than the guided tour. We sped through all the museums we really wanted to look at with a guide speaking in broken english then spent an hour in the Raphael rooms before being chucked out into the sistine chapel. We had to go round again to see what we came for. All of Rome was wonderous and we can't wait to go back.

The most reasonable restaurants are within the hotel area and all offer good Italian food......just keep to the side streets of this area where real Italians live and work and you will not go wrong. Once on the main streets your final food bill can double!! The hotel location is good because there are independent shops and artisans right next door from chocolate producers to wrought iron welders.....there is a real buzz at night where families meet outside. We felt perfectly safe at all times. The hotel staff were helpful and well organized , from the front desk to the smiling breakfast staff. The breakfast was good with lovely creamy scrambled eggs & crispy streaky bacon, fresh fruit , croissants etc........my only problem was with the croissants which were glazed in sugar!!! A minor dislike. I took advantage of the discount offerred directly booking via the hotel website.....an invoice was given as cash was handed over on the day of arrival.

With hotels in Rome you so often do not get what you pay for and I have come away disappointed from stays in supposedly five star accommodation. This little hotel is only a couple of hundred yards from the Cavour metro and five minutes walk to the Colliseum. It is in an area where lots of Romans live and so has very well priced, excellent bars and restaurants around it where you won't be just surrounded by tourists and rip off prices. Try Il Covo just around the corner, Wanted or Osteria al 16 for starters and you won't go far wrong. The hotel is constantly updating the rooms and prides itself on friendly service. Our room this time was on the second floor and was somewhat larger than the room with balcony that we had on the 4th floor last visit. Bathrooms are very well done and bed linen crisp and clean. The rooms are reflected very well on the hotel website and are a true reflection of what you will get-very boutique in style. Breakfast is more than adequate and is included in the rate which is not the norm for hotels in Rome. There is no lunch or evening meals served but all the local bars and restaurants are open all hours and you can fall out the door and find somewhere to eat. Book direct with the hotel website being carefull not to be caught out by what looks like the official website from booking companies. I was almost caught until I noticed it did not say offical hotel website. You can get good deals if you book in advance and agree to pay cash on arrival. If you want a quiet room ask for one at the back of the hotel or in the annexe next door. Annexe rooms are very much cheaper although again I do not know why-they are much bigger than the main hotel rooms and have very large bathrooms and lovely decor too. The annexe is literally two steps from the front door and the entrance stair case is lovely. This is not an area for great views as the Via Leonina is tucked away behind the Via Cavour but this hotel is great in every other way-just walk 50 yards down to the corner where one of the best piazza places in Rome 'Wanted' is and look up and you will see the Colliseum.

It's located right off the Metro, on the Cavour stop. This is quite handy for anyone coming into Rome from the Termini station, as Cavour is the first stop after Termini. The front desk staff were quite helpful in recommending restaurants and tourist places to visit. The hotel is a 5 minute walk to the Colliseum and 15 minutes to Trevi Fountain. You have to surrender your room key when leaving the hotel, so make sure your room has a safe where you can store your passport and any other valuables. I've heard not all rooms are fitted with a safe, so double-check before checking in. The room itself was quite small but since I was traveling alone, it was fine for me. It barely fit a bed and an armoir but at least the bed was a double. A continential breakfast was included and it was a typical European breakfast.

We took a cab to the hotel from the FCO Airport it took about 45 minutes with some traffic on the way for about $40 Euros. Going back the hotel called a cab for us and it was $46 Euro due to more traffic on the way out of town in the morning. The rooms are very small and clean. We had a room on the street but the noise was not an issue. They had 2 locking glass windows that kept the sound well insulated. The breakfast buffet was my wife's favorite during our 2 weeks travels through Croatia and Italy. Maybe that was due to it being our first stop on our trip and she was enjoying the fresh meats and cheeses. I thought they had a few more options than most of the hotels we stayed at but otherwise it was about the norm. I got very good at eating yogurt and granola in the mornings to get me through the day.

Here\u2019s the lowdown. Good: This hotel is in a great location and cool neighborhood for tourists yet isn\u2019t in the middle of a tourist nightmare like the Spanish Steps or Vatican. You\u2019ll see lots of locals in this area. One half block walk to the Cavour Metro station which is very convenient. The Monti neighborhood is full of quaint shops, good restaurants and narrow cobbled streets. The Coliseum and Forum are only a ten minute walk and one block away is one of the best churches in Rome, Santa Maria dei Monti. I was out late several nights and felt it was a safe area unlike the area around Termini. Next door is a good restaurant, an Irish pub is across the street if you long for some English conversation, and the pastry shop nearby sells the most amazing cannoli and pistachio gelato I ever tasted. Hotel main areas look like they do on the website. Breakfast was very good with an assortment of pastries, breads, cereals, eggs, bacon, juices, fresh fruits, meats, salads, and incredible cappuccino. Breakfast was included with my room. Hotel staff were very friendly and spoke English which was helpful. I was given a warm welcome. There is a laptop guests can use for free which was a nice service. An iron is downstairs in the gym. Room / Mixed: I was disappointed with my room. I had booked a single room and it was tiny and not chic like the pictures on the website. It was definitely NOT a four-star room by any American standard. The bed was a European single which is narrower and shorter than an American twin. A tall person (I am 5\u2019, 9\u201d) would have had to roll the bed out from it\u2019s alcove as my fee just touched the wall. The bed was very comfortable however and had nice linens. The drapes were also very nice and the room was spotless. Ceiling was high. The bathroom was very nicely appointed in marble with bidet, sink, toilet and shower. Obese people would have trouble in the bathroom shower as the stall was very small. Europeans are not obese like Americans so some Americans would have issues with this bathroom. My disappointment with my room disappeared when I opened my windows and heard a singer performing for the diners below. It was like something out of the movies. There was a double set of windows which was great for soundproofing. The only place to sit in the room was on the bed or a tiny stool under the mini desk. There was a mini bar which was handy and inexpensive. I did ask some other travelers staying in doubles if their rooms matched the pictures on the website and they said they did. A local man I spoke to said his parents stay there when in Rome and he thought other rooms were very nice. Another issue I had with my room was an intermittent buzzing coming from the electrical outlet that was really annoying when I was trying to sleep. On the flip side, I got a good rate for my room so overall I had mixed feelings about room value. I also stayed at the Hotel Veneto and it was truly fantastic for the same price. My single room there was huge with a king sized bed and looked like something out of a palace but the neighborhood was not as cool. I posted a review of that hotel as well. Bottom line is whether I would recommend Hotel Duca D\u2019Alba or stay there again. I would say yes to both but would upgrade my room next time around. P.S. Make sure you look into the Roma Pass. For three calendar days you get unlimited metro and bus use with a convenient card you swipe at the turnstiles plus three admissions to sites or museums (except Vatican). You also get to jump the line which was awesome at the Coliseum. Price was 28 Euros.

I've stayed at this hotel three times now and have found it to be quite satisfactory. The price is moderate by Rome standards and the rooms are reasonable size and very clean. The staff all speak English fluently and could even understand \"Texan.\" (We're from Houston.) Everyone we had any contact with was very kind and helpful and easy to deal with. I asked for assistance in setting up a day trip to Naples and Pompeii and, on another occasion, I needed some help with arrangements getting to the airport (Fiumicino). Both times the folks I was dealing with were very helpful and really went out of their way to go the extra mile, offered me alternatives, gave good advice, etc. One of the best things about this hotel is the location. It's not far at all from the Colosseum/Forum area and very, very close to the Cavour Metro stop. This makes it very convenient to use this hotel as we did, as a base of operations for touring and sightseeing Rome. Right across the street (Via Leonina) from the hotel is a great little genuine Irish pub called Finnegan's. I highly recommend stopping by there an evening or two for a cold beer. Friendly place. Just down the street is a gelateria with the usual great selection of good Italian ice creams and sorbets. If you sleep through the hotel's morning breakfast (which they were serving until 10 am when we were there) there's a small bar across the street where you can get some fresh-squeezed orange juice, coffee, and a breakfast pastry to start the day. In the evening, you can get a sandwich there or, just a few steps down the street is a pizza by the slice place called Pizza Leonina. A bit further down, on the corner of Leonina and Sepenti, there's a restaurant called \"Wanted\" that's pretty good, not great. But, if you're interested in great Roman pizza, get the front desk staff to give you directions to a pizza place called \"Grazie a Dio e Venerdi\" (Thank God It's Friday!) Pizzeria that's about a 4 minute walk out the front door of Duca d'Alba, at the corner of Via dei Capocci and Via Clementina, a bit up from the Cavour Metro station. If you're coming to the hotel on the Metro from Termini, the main train/subway station, it can be a bit confusing trying to locate the hotel for the first time. At Termini, you catch the Blue Line of the Metro and you go in the \"Laurentina\" direction. You only go one stop from Termini to the \"Cavour\" stop, which is where you get off to go to the Duca d'Alba Hotel. But here's where it can be a bit confusing: When you get off at Cavour, when going in the Laurentina direction, you come up some stairs from the subway stop and you find yourself up on Via Cavour. The hotel cannot be seen, as it is down below on Via Leonina. So, what you do is look for the stairs down to the other side of the Cavour Metro stop. That's the side you would exit if you had been heading in the opposite direction, the \"Rebibia\" direction. You cross Via Cavour and take the stairs down to the right. This puts you at the Via Leonina level and you just put the Rebibia Metro stop at your back and walk about 100 yards to the hotel. I know this sounds confusing but it sounds worse than it is. In summary, when you get off at the Cavour Metro stop, if you've been going in the Laurentina direction, then come up the stairs. The stairs split but it doesn't matter which way you go, left or right, up the stairs. This puts you out on Via Cavour. Look downhill and put the Metro stairs to your back. Off to the right front about 20 yards you'll see the Metro sign near some stairs. Cross Via Cavour and go down those stairs. This puts you at the Metro stop at the bottom of those stairs, which is at the end of Via Leonina. Just walk down Via Leonina about 100 yards and there's the hotel. Breakfast at the hotel was a nice surprise. It's served in a lovely room. They served from 7 am to 10 am when we were there. It included bacon and scrambled eggs, as well as a nice assortment of cereal, juices, breads and pastry, cold meat and cheese, as well as coffee, tea, milk, etc. I highly recommend this place. The price, for Rome, is right; the location is great; the people are very nice and helpful; and, the rooms are very clean and not too small.

Not very spacious, but OK. Mattresses are a bit stiff (this seems to be the story of all of the hotels we've been to in Italy so far). Breakfast - nice and filling. Cereals, fruit, cold cuts, eggs. Espresso and capuchhino too. Internet is wireless and signal was not very strong - two bars at the most. An amplifier could help. But it was free, everywhere else in Italy we're charged for Internet. Lots of stairs, yes. But they do have a small elevator, if you need to move your luggage. Expedia locator said 10-minute walk from Roma Termini rail station. It might be on a nice early morning if you're jogging. Walking with suitcases on Rome's narrow cobblestone sidewalks was quite a challenge. Plus risking breaking the wheels off the suitcases. The hotel is right next to the Cavour Metro Subway station - one quick stop from Roma Termini (which was VERY handy, btw). It would be helpful to post this info with the Hotel Location and Direction instructions. Another quick and cheap improvement suggestion - add a $30 shower curtain. The shower is only half-glass-walled and lots of water spill on the marble.

We had a cute little terrace and a full size tub, which was very exciting since most bathrooms are quite small and usually only have small showers.

Breakfast was the best so far with hot food as well as the regular pastries, etc. They also have a nice sitting area for breakfast. Recommendations: See a futbol game at the Stadio Olimpico. It took us a while to get there but it was a lot of fun! The Stadium is about 6km outside of the city center but the ride home was much easier. They had buses just outside the stadium and it took about 10-15 minutes to get to the hotel. Definitely contact Angel Tours and do the Vatican Tour and the Colosseum and Roman Forum Tour. They were fantastic! The guides on both tours were very entertaining and full of information. The church of Santa Maria degli Angeli was beautiful and worth the visit and you should also make sure to see the Capitoline Museums. Valentinos...a little tratoria near the hotel.

TIP--try and avoid rooms ending '06' as we had an awful view of a 10' x 10' square consisting of 4 concrete walls and windows all around right up to the top of the building about 5 floors high, hardly any sunlight at all, but, this turned out to be a blessing if honest due to the heat! The hotels is a 5-10 minute walk to the Colloseum and Forums, both of which are out of this world, a 15 minute walk to Termini Station (one stop on the underground, 'Cavour' which is a 2 minute walk and \u20ac1 for a 75 minute ticket). It is a15 minute walk to the Trevi Fountain and 20-25 minutes to the Spanish Steps. The rest of the sights can be reached by walking (in COMFY shoes!) but we found the best way to get around was to do the open top bus tour '110' from Termini Station, it cost \u20ac18 for 24 hours and \u20ac24 for 48 hours (the 48 hour ticket includes a trip to the Catacombs off the map). The 48 hour ticket we used all day long and did the tour both during the day and at night, 2 very different experiences. We also used the tickets as general transport too which was a godsend.

The location is great for walking around the city, it's really easy to find your way back after a day out. It's so close to the Colosseo, and the forum is just up the road.

There's meat and cheese of which I didn't partake, but there is a variety of sweet or savoury bakery products, including croissants and chocolate breads, as well as fruit and juice.

It's easy to find from the airport...you can take a taxi for ~45 euros or take the train/metro. There are two options by rail. The first option is to take the Leonardo express from the airport to Termini station, then transfer to the Metro B line to Cavour. The other option is taking the FM1 (aka FR1) train from the airport to Ostiense, then transferring via the underground walkway to the Metro B line at Piramide. Cavour is the third stop from Piramide. We took FM1 because it was half the cost of the Express/Termini option (6.5 euros compared to ~13 euros). We were also traveling during off peak hours and not during tourist season, so the trains were not crowded. Also, if you are heading NE on the Metro B line towards Rebibbia, the Cavour metro stop exits onto Via Leonina, just a very short, direct walk to the hotel. If you are heading S/SW on the Metro B line towards Laurentina, the metro exits onto the East side of Cavour and you will have to walk up and over Cavour to arrive at Via Leonina (Via Leonina sits below the street level of Cavour). The staff at the hotel was very friendly. The breakfast was pretty good (bacon, eggs, bread, coffee) as well. The rooms were small, but normal for Europe.

A location closer to the center of city (e.g., Pantheon, Trevi Fountain) might be better, but we did not find getting around an issue. We did have trouble finding the hotel when we walked back the first night, but the pouring rain and poor tourist maps were contributing factors. Our double room was on Floor 4 (5th floor for N.

The bathroom was particularly small, although it did have a long bathtub (no bidet). The small room did have a small, private, outdoor terrace at the back of the building.

It is a very charming hotel in a historic section of Rome that feels slightly off the beaten path yet is actually very convenient to major tourist attractions like the Colliseum and the Forum (and some lesser known ones). It has expanded over the years but still maintains the same \"small inn\" ambience and style that exemplify Italian elegance. So many hotels today are tending towards the trendy and splashy and they pretend to be luxurious but look closely and you will find everything made of cheap materials and fake stuff so the place ends up feeling like a chain hotel.that could be anywhere in the world. At the Duca D'Alba there is never any doubt that you are in Italy. Like many hotels situated in historic city centers, the rooms are not too large but if you can get by that you will find that what it lacks in space is well made up for in comfort and good taste and friendly staff. You only have to run your hands across the glistening travertine marble that surrounds you from head to toe in the bath to appreciate it.

With the cost of the hotel we were expecting something equivalent to the less expensive, but four-star hotels we'd stayed at in Venice and Florence, esp. based on the reviews here and on Expedia. But when we arrived, we were given a room in the Annex, which is a separate building that also has apartments. The bed sloped so that our heads were lower than our feet, and the shower was so small that the curtain stuck to our bodies when we showered. But the worst part was the ants! They arrived the first night in the bathroom, but the next morning after breakfast (I had already requested another room but the hotel was full), my husband found them in our luggage in our clothes! When I called the reception desk, the first thing he said was, \"What can we do? The hotel is full.\" Not the most helpful service! He finally sent up a bellboy so we could at least take our luggage out of the room to be stored until a room opened up later that afternoon. They did move us to a better room in the main part of the hotel, and the night reception person apologized to us and even provided us with a surprise bottle of wine, but it definitely gave us a bad taste for the Duca d'Alba. As we were checking out, we noticed that they were removing doors from the Annex building, so hopefully they're redoing it, but until then, make sure they don't put you in the Annex! Also, the room we ended up in still was not the nicest room.

Also, the room we stayed in was enclosed within a suite of rooms and since we were the only ones in that suite there were no noise problems. I imagine if there had been other people there it would be a different story (there is a lot of echo in the hallways). After we had come in from a day trip on the first the day, the desk in our room was engulfed with ants. The staff responded quickly and we were moved into an adjacent room within a matter of minutes (luckily we didn't have too much luggage). The next day was pretty much the same ... we came back to our room and found more ants. However, this ant problem wasn't as bad as the first so we stayed in this room.

I found the reviews to be quite accurate. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the rooms were very clean. The bed was little harder than what we are used to but we found the room quite comfortable albeit a little small. That is the standard in Europe and especially in such a excellent location in Ancient Rome. We were only a 2 minute walk from Cavour Meto Station and 1 kilometre from Termini train station. We took the train in from the airport (FCO) and it was very easy and inexpensive. We actually walked from Termini to our hotel,because we knew it was only 1 kilometre,but I wouldn't recommend doing that since we were dragging our luggage on some pretty old streets with a lot of bumps and holes.If we had been walking without luggage it would have been fine. It would have been wiser to take the subway just one stop over to our hotel. The breakfast consisted of scrambled eggs and bacon,croissants,fruit,cereals,coffee and was always very fresh during our stay. I would also recommend that you bring earplugs to sleep because if you get a room on the same side as the Irish pub,you will hear these people until they close the pub at 1:00 a.m. I can't fault the hotel for that,because there is nothing they can do to control the patrons that spill out onto the street. They are almost under your window,since the street(via Leonina )is so narrow.Also scooters pass by till all hours of the night. I think Rome is the other city that doesn't sleep!! The hotel has excellent windows to minimize the noise,but the pub kept me awake every night even with the shutters and windows completely closed..If you book ,ask for a room towards the back of the hotel away from the street and bring some earplugs in case you don't get the back side rooms. Never the less,we did enjoy our stay at the Duca because we were out walking and touring for those three days and spent very little time in the room. The value is fantastic. About $200.00 a night for a clean safe room with breakfast and only a 5 minute walk to the Colisseum and the ruins.

The original reservation was for a room with 4 beds (my husband, daughter, son and myself). When we arrived they told us the room would be too small to accommodate all of us, so they gave us two double rooms on the first floor (really the second). Athough they weren't next to each other, we were able to easily get from one room to the next. Because we were afraid of lost luggage on our way over to Rome (via Heathrow), we purposely split up our clothing in the event a bag might not reach us. So, not being in one room was a bit of an inconvenience, but we managed. The hotel staff was friendly, courteous and helpful. We did all agree that the breakfast served at the hotel was the best we had in Italy. My son, a very picky eater, loved the scrambled eggs, and never left the table hungry. The location of the hotel was great -- a short walk to the Colosseum and the other nearby ancient ruins, and a very nice stroll to the other areas of the city. We took a cab only twice -- once from the airport to the hotel and the other time at night when we were too exhausted to walk back from the river. Other than those two times, we did not rely on any public transportation. The only down side to the stay in Rome was the crowds, which we experienced throughout Italy. We often felt like ants, especially near the touristy areas such as the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps. Stay away from the restaurants on the big piazzas -- overpriced and not very good. There was a restaurant near the hotel, Wanted, that we ate at the first night in Rome that we thought was great. And right around the corner from the hotel is a place to get gelatto.

It wasn't a bad room (the bed was comfortable, and it was pretty clean), but it wasn't a great, or even good room for 170 Euros/night. It was small, and very, very bare bones. I do have to say the washroom was large and nicely re-modelled. The other odd thing was when it came time to pay, we tried to pay by credit card, but the guy at reception told us that the 170/night was a cash deal (though they never told us that), and if we wanted to pay by visa it would cost 195 Euros/night. Not a huge deal, just meant we had to get to a bank machine (and incur charges). The staff were friendly though, and the breakfasts were pretty good.

The room was larger than most European hotel rooms that I've stayed in. Even though I was traveling alone, I got a double room. It consisted of two twin beds pushed together. The airconditioning worked, but I'm not sure that it would be able to keep up if I were there in August. Even though it is on a tiny street, there are several restaurants, bars, and shops in the immediate vacinity. Between the two buildings that make up the hotel, there is an apartment building. When I looked out of the window, I was looking at people's apartments. I don't mean ten or twenty feet away, I mean three or four feet away. You heard people's dogs barking, kitchen noises, and other sounds typical of dense urban living. At night, they faded away pretty well. The bathroom was very large by EU standards, but there was a window in the bathtub/shower. I don't mean a tiny window, I mean a full fledged window (with no curtains or shade to cover it). The glass was semi-frosted. When I looked out, I was looking into an apartment's kitchen.

Hotel Duca d'Alba is in a GREAT location for sight-seeing ---- a 5-min. walk to Collisseum, a 5-min. walk to St. Peter's in Chains & a 5-min. walk to the Roman Forum. I'd say it's a 3-star hotel by US standards. Decent restaurants and local shops within easy walking distance, and the Cavour Metro stop was about 50 yards from the hotel (although because of the \"line\" it was on, we often needed to take the Metro up one stop to Termini Station to switch to the other line which took us to the Vatican, Spanish Steps, Villa Borghese & more... Note: We did a lot of walking and did not rely on the Metro that often. (Advice: Wear comfortable shoes at all times!!!) As for the hotel itself, we arrived on April 15 (Easter Saturday) to find that instead of being put in a quad room, we were being housed in two adjacent double bedrooms in an \"apartment\" attached to the hotel. This was not a problem (except for the tricky old-fashioned keys and a few short flights of dimly lit stairs) and the added bathroom was a plus and the rooms were typical of European hotels (small)! Rooms were sound-proof. The satellite TVs did not work in the apartment rooms --- but that did not bother us as we were not lounging around in the room for hours! The front desk staff --- especially Danilo & Angelo were most friendly and enjoyed sharing their knowledge of Rome with us. Breakfast was great (per European standards).... scrambled eggs & bacon, delicious sweet breads on Easter, croissants, proscuitto, cheese, fresh fruit, muffins, toast, etc. Cappucino & hot chocolate too! The bathrooms were a decent size with large bath towels. Rooms were clean, except for an occasional dust ball here & there. The small lock-box safe worked well to store passports & extra cash. Little foil-wrapped chocolates on the desk were a nice touch! We stayed for two nights, then went off to Florence, and returned to the Duca d'Alba for another three nights. Danilo offered to store some of our luggage while we were gone (very helpful as we were traveling via train). The only glitch in our stay at the Duca d'Alba was that, upon our return from Florence, we were placed in a room in the main hotel which was actually a double (maybe a triple) with two extra beds squeezed in ------- WAY TOO SMALL! There was barely enough room for four of us to stand with our backs against the walls and not enough room for our luggage. When I complained to the front desk clerk (Massimo?), he spoke with the manager/owner who said we could move into two double rooms (on separate floors) at an additional 30EURO per night. I found that to be unacceptable as I could not believe the accommodations we initially booked (and were charged for) would suitably serve four people and told him so. He then consulted the manager/owner again and she said they would waive the additional charge. When we got settled, 2 of us stayed on the 1st floor (room 101) & 2 of us were on the 4th floor. I recommend asking for Room 402 ----- as it has a lovely balcony with table and chairs (no great views in either room). So --- aside from that situation, our stay at this hotel was quite nice. Would we go there again ------ definitely, but I would clearly confirm the room accommodations beforehand. For one or two people ------- this would be a great choice of hotels!

Fresh bread,meat,cheese,wine and snacks. - Wait till Sunday to take pictures of the Colosseum,Forum or Ancient Rome. They blocked off the roads while we were there. No cars. Great shots. - The ride back to the airport was a really nice touch by the Hotel and staff. For the same price as the Fiat ride from the airport, we rode in a new Mercedes Sedan. Unexpected pleasure. - Pizza and ice cream places all around neighborhood. Very nice. Great Gelato(ice cream) on Via Serpenti. Look for the colorful ice cream cone sign. Mango is my favorite. Pizza and a drink for two around 10 Euro. - For Americans and those who don't use the metro, you can walk to almost everything except the Vatican. It is between 6 and 12 Euros one way.

We actually walked to all important tourist attaractions including Vatican which is located on the side of Tiber. There is a subway station Via Cavour only 100 meters away from the hotel and using it you can reach Vatican very rapidly but you have to change a train in Termini. One time subway ticket cost 1 euro and it was valid for 75 minutes. Even if the street in narrow there is pretty busy traffic and noise of motor bikes and other vehicles can be heard in street side rooms. There are very good pizzerias in the same street offering delicious pizza and pasta. I think 5 euros for pizza, 1 euro for bruschetta and 2 euros for 1/2 litres of house red wine are good deals in Rome. If you prefer something else you can find lots of different restaurants close to the hotel e.g. many Indian and Chinese.

Pretty substantial. Staff is extremely nice and all speak English. AC not a powerhouse but definitely helps. Want to bring a couple of other things to attention of those who stay there: 1) If you walk out of the hotel and hang a right, you'll be about 10 steps from a FANTASTIC little locals restaurant called Vecchia Roma. Wonderful bruschetta for 1 Euro, great house wine for 4 Euros a LITER, and fantastic simple pasta dishes for 6 Euros. We loved the waiter, the owner and all the food. We added in a couple of bottles of water and still ate like king/queen for 25 Euros. 2) Take a right out of the hotel, take your first left and then take a right on Via Cavour. There's a little grocery just a block or so down (toward the Colesseum) that has very cheap Cokes, beer, wine, bottled water and such. Well worth the trip vs. buying for 5 times the price across the street. We put them into our mini-bar (speaking of which, the prices for the mini-bar are cheaper than at the shop across the street -- 1.80 beer, for example) 3) English-speakers and ale lovers will also want to go to the Irish Pub right across the narrow street.

Down a street which ostensibly looked a bit shabby, but had interesting little shops and ristorantes we found the Hotel. It is small, yes, but nicely appointed and with courteous front desk staff. If you ask for rooms 401, 402 or 403 (doubles) you get a room with a dear little terrace on which it is pleasant for a pre-dinner drink or writing up your journal in the morning, listening to all the sounds of a Rome street coming to life. You can also listen to the (sometimes tinny) sounds of the street musicians at night playing to the ristorante patrons (but you don't have to pay them!). Anyway, we were also impressed with the very nice breakfast (after having eaten some pretty ordinary ones around Italy). The tariff was 140 euros which we thought was fairly good value in peak season. We would definitely avoid again the area around the Termini stazione - very shabby, dirty and ful of beggars and gypsies, although it's only advantage is the convenience of being near the trains and buses (as my partner hated paying for taxis).", "Date": "July 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!!\u201d", "Author": "smurfie", "ReviewID": "UR3654184", "Content": "We just got back from Rome where we stayed at Duca D'Alba.

The cappuccino was amazing- definitely try it! There is a great Irish Pub right across the street, and lots of well priced, excellent restaurants in the area. The drinks in the mini bar were the same price as the corner store. Room: We had a king-sized bed, and a large wardrobe where we were able to put all our clothing. There was a desk in the room, as well as a safe for our belongings. It was an electronic safe, where you create your own code. No clock radio, but they always delivered the wake up call on time. The bathroom was very modern, with marble and a shower that always gave hot water. The towels are big\u2026much larger that those you get in North American hotels. No face cloths as in most European hotels. The only English station is CNN, which we watched since we were in Rome during the conclave and election of the new Pope. The best part was the beautiful terrace we had, that was quiet and a great place to have an afternoon drink or, to relax in the morning. Staff: Amazing!
