I was happy to register that my hotel was the 5-star IC London Park Lane Hotel. The location is excellent, and Hyde Park Corner tube station (Piccadilly line) is located only a five minute walk away through subways. This mean you easily can reach Heathrow airport without changing means of transport and Green Park, Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square in respectively 1, 2 and 3 stops. At the same time, Green Park and Hyde Park is located only a few steps away, offering recreation and rest from the city larm. In my opinion, this area is the best to stay in when you head to London for a weekend trip as a tourist. The service is excellent, already from the first step into the hotel, when from you meet the porter in the entrance, helping you with for instance your luggage. The check-in was smooth and the concierge was very helpful and professional. The room was up to date and had a convenient size, even if it was a standard room. The bed offered a good night sleep, and turndown service was provided in the evening. All in all, a great hotel, especially if you get a nice deal on the price.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northumberland", "Title": "\u201cExceptional hotel and service.\u201d", "Author": "Scarrface", "ReviewID": "UR126379300", "Content": "This was my second visit to the hotel and it has become one of my favourite hotels.

Many dishes are cooked to order so always piping hot and not dried up like you get in many of the large chain hotels. The breakfasts are expensive - I had porridge which was \u00a38.00 but frankly I didn't mind this as the service was good and the view out of the window across to the park on a sunny Spring day was great.

I was quite hesitant prior to booking, as it is a business hotel. However, as I was to be in London for just 3 nights I decided to book at the IC regardless. Boy! Was I glad! Being an InterContinental Ambassador member, I was offered check-in at a separate desk, by a \"TEAM\" of staff and was automatically given an upgrade to the much more spacious Executive Suite. Extra large parcels that were needed to be packed away in storage, were swiftly moved to their allocated locations. The modern, yet very inviting interiors and decor of the lobby and lounges were the ultimate contrast to the bustle of the city. The hotel is in excellent condition and there are plans for future modernisation of the entrance area. It is apparent that service is the foremost priority at the hotel, with a member of staff at each corner waiting to assist you with your every need. The rooms were gorgeously decorated. The hues of dark blue, greys, metallics and cream created the perfect environment for both business and pleasure-seeking travellers.The rooms are as majority of other London rooms- not very large. That is acceptable, and the IC excels as its configuration of the rooms are sublime. The beds are extremely comfortable, traffic noise (even facing Park Lane) is minimal, the electronic conveniences are all apparent and are of the best quality- this culminates in one of the most enjoyable sleeps I have had in a city hotel. Breakfast buffet, was slightly mediocre. However, the a la carte option was a much better experience. The breakfast rate includes both a la carte as well as buffet. There was Arabian humus and flat bread to one side, and health bran options and muffins on the other. The service at breakfast was utterly impeccable. Theo Randals restaurant in the lobby was good but not devine, on visits to Nobu and Novikov, I was much more delighted. I would recommend that you not confine your meals to the Hotel restauants alone. The Location is phenomenol! A 5 minute walk from Harrods and under 15 to Bond Street. Oxford Street is a stones throw away as well. Just be sure you're comfortable walking. With a cab fare beginning at \u00a32,50 approximately its more effective walking. And the walk is pleasant too! Throughout my stay, I was blown away by one key factor- Service! The receptionist was very helpful in splitting the bills and thoroughly going through all charges himself. Even having him picking up certain charges which were inaccurate that we were not even aware of. I believe that its not a question on how grand the establishment is, but rather how grand the driving force behind it is. I would be back here many times. I have infact booked to be back at the IC on my next trip!", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Como, Italy", "Title": "\u201cWorst Receptionist ever\u201d", "Author": "My-Ooops", "ReviewID": "UR126134078", "Content": "An uniterested recepionist greeted me at this Intercontinental.

The room it self had only been refurbished a month ago and was really well presented. The attention to detail was excellent, from the Elemis toileteries to the Nespresso coffee machine. Only issue was that my complimentary ambassador fruit bowl and water had not arrived and I had to call down for this. However given the fact that I checked in so early it probably was a slight oversight. When it did arrive, the service was fast and the fruit bowl was great - even included a box of expensive cookies. The club lounge is absolutely amazing. The views over Hyde Park Corner magnificent and the quality of the breakfast, canap\u00c3\u00a9s and coffee excellent. From 5:30pm - 7:30pm they have a premium cocktail hour where we drank loads of complimentary champaign and were spoilt for choice.

She gave us a nice Deluxe room overlooking the Arch. The room was spacious for London standards and wow, the bed was extremely comfortable with the crispest linnen and soft pillows. It felt like sleeping in soft clouds! We didn't want to get out of our bed and check out of the hotel at all. We even took off the pillow covers the next day to check which make the pillows are from so we can buy them. There was a powerful rainshower, and nice Elemis amenities in the bathroom. The Bose sound system played the tunes from our Iphones on the background. We had some drinks in the bar on Saturday night and the staff were good in recommending different cocktails and engaging with the guests creating a nice atmosphere. We ended up chatting with different guests staying at the hotel and we all had a good time. We didn't eat in the hotel and ended up eating at a Lebanse restaurant 10 minute walk away called Fakhreldine, very nice.

Also while I didn't enquire extensively, it doesn't seem to have a free wifi service which would be useful and becoming a standard expectation nowadays.

The public areas are smart and understated and we enjoyed a couple of cocktails from the lobby after a day out and about in London. They were nicely made, but it was unfortunate that we had to wait 30 mins for them and when I enquired how much longer, I was told by the very helpful waiter \"sorry, there is no bar tender in the hotel at the moment so it's taking me longer to make them as I don't normally\". As delicious as they were and he did a sterling job, waiting 30 mins for drinks costing \u00c2\u00a335 was not really on at a 5 star hotel. We weren't going to have breakfast at the hotel but as we were offered it at check-in for a reduced rate of \u00c2\u00a320 per person instead of \u00c2\u00a328 we decided to go for it. It was as you might expect a varied affair and very nice indeed, it was a bit of a shame that the tables are close together so the waiters tend to bump the back of your chair by accident, which is a little wearing after about the 5th time. I was however decidedly dissapointed on check-out to find they had quoted the cost minus vat and so the cost was actually \u00c2\u00a348 for teo. I find it very annoying when luxury hotels take what feels like a cheap shot at guests by doing this. It is not standard practice to quote prices exclusive of vat in the UK and the IC really does itself down in the reputation stakes with this. Next time I'm in the area I'll spring for the Dorchester I think. The IC was good, but not quite good enough sadly.", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "northern ireland", "Title": "\u201cVery enjoyable\u201d", "Author": "genevieve_7", "ReviewID": "UR124261298", "Content": "This was booked for a leisure weekend via top secret hotels on last minute.com.

In this case I'll make an exception. The last time in London we stayed at The Ritz, a proper 5* hotel, these guys are so far off the standard they should lose a star at least. We arrived and the front door was opened for us as one would expect, this happened less than 50% of the time we entered and exited-either do it or don't. We checked in and went to our room. There was a small residue of poo in the toilet. The coffee was Nescafe (5*?) and there was no welcome information. The TV was complex and slow to work, the signal was also poor. We got ready to leave but the water in the tiny bathroom was only slightly above luke warm (later we were told of a safety switch but there was no label or marking to show this). We left for a pleasant evening out and returned to the hotel bar. My wife nipped to the loo whilst I was ignored by the hotel waitresses for some time. There were other ladies here who seemed more interested than the staff. Eventually after waiting for 20 minutes for a bottle of bog standard Pinot (for \u00c2\u00a344!) we gave up and left. Everything around was closed so we returned to our room and ordered room service (same bottle \u00c2\u00a340) this arrived quickly and they were polite so we ordered a Pizza. This was inedible. The description made it sound like a really decent choice but it had plastic cheese and no herb or seasoning. We sent it back (they did offer a replacement which we declined) I kept a 3cm piece to show them in the morning, a bit OTT I know but it was that bad. We were woken in the morning with drilling and hammering very loudly on top of our room. I called reception who said yeah we're doing maintenance. I told them to make them stop and 10 minutes of noise later they did, so much for a nice lie in. We complained on leaving and the manager came to see us. His response was apologetic and he got the food and beverage manager. He asked what we had ordered and we said a Margarita pizza, I showed him the slice and asked him if it matched the menu description, he said, so, its just cheese with a bit of tomato paste innit?. I asked him if he knew what the description on his own menu was, he clearly did not and seemed pretty uninterested. Now the manager did the right thing and comped our wine which was acceptable but my favourite bit which made my stay was his response to us questioning the nature of the \"ladies\" frequenting his bar at night. I'm not naive enough to think that some business types are not open in Mayfair at night but this seemed particularly blatant for a (5*) Hotel. His response was that they do not discriminate towards the professions of those who frequent the bar in the evening. I did mention that this was absolute gold for my review.

In planning a day long event for my partner's 60th birthday, Ildi was absolutely invaluable in making arrangements, checking schedules and securing those hard-to-get restaurant reservations, and during the course of many emails her enthusiasm and creative suggestions were key to making the day into a very special event. The hotel is in a terrific location, across the street from Apsley House and the Wellington Arch; and in addition to the Hyde Park tube stop on the Piccadilly line, the roundabout in front of the hotel is served by several bus lines. Strolling out the front door in one direction will take you to Hyde Park and eventually Kensington, while the other direction leads you directly to Mayfair - keep walking and soon you're in Piccadilly Circus. Check in was smooth (in the interest of disclosure I should say I'm a member of the Intercontinental Ambassador Club) and we received an upgrade I wasn't expecting as this stay had been booked part points and part cash. We were given a Studio Suite on the 2nd floor, very spacious with a shower separate from the tub, a heated towel rack and a bidet. Our view was of Apsley House, home of the Duke of Wellington and we could also overlokked Hyde Park and the Lanesborough Hotel. The room was immaculate and crisp and showed signs of recent refurbishment, as does the entire hotel. Bright, light and airy is the effect, and it's very nice to walk into; it feels quite rich without being cluttered or stuffy. The overall feeling you get here is that this is a \"happy house\" to be in; all of the employees we encountered seemed genuinely interested in making our stay pleasant, whether it was Mikael the doorman (who has a great smile and apparently can produce taxis out of thin air -- thank you, Mikael!), the waiters and ma\u00c3\u00aetre d' at the Cookbook Cafe or any of the staff we encountered.

Access to the Club is either included in your room rate or available for purchase (I believe the price is 60GBP) and includes breakfast (continental-style and cooked - I had perfectly soft-boiled eggs every morning), coffee and tea during the day, afternoon tea with sandwiches, pastries and cakes, and early evening cocktails and wine, all complimentary. The staff here, as in the entire hotel, are friendly and welcoming as well as being multi-lingual; you'll hear many languages being spoken here. Special recognition has to go the bartenders at the Arch Bar (yes, it looks out at the Wellington Arch -- how did you know?). Fabio, Stefano, Andre, Ruben and Nicolas are making classic cocktails and recreating historic ones, and if you have an interest in such things you should have a seat at the bar and prepare to be amazed. Fabio is making his own infusions and is working on a degree in alchemy, Ruben shakes one of the world's great Sidecars and you should ask Andre to make you that coffee flavored cocktail he's working on, the one with ground coffee beans floating in it. It doesn't have a name yet, but it's good, very very good! So, yes, I'm effusive; to balance that, I can say that not everything was perfect. We suffered a very minor service glitch when our supply of complimentary bottled water ran dry (it was to be replenished daily, but this wasn't always done) but in the great scheme of things? It was a minor annoyance that didn't impact our stay. The overall impression I left with was that of a energetic, knowledgeable, hard-working and pleasant staff who are working enthusiastically in the hospitality industry. We definitely plan on returning.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo", "Title": "\u201cFancy hotel in convenient location\u201d", "Author": "OsloSina", "ReviewID": "UR121986848", "Content": "Pre-Christmas London-weekend at the Intercontinental in Park Lane. Very nice hotel of course - five stars in London is undoubtedly pretty luxurious. We got a great deal through Hotwire, and that made it a very good deal.

The hotel is very nice and in a fantastic location on Park Lane between Hyde Park and Green Park (both have tube stations within an easy walk of the hotel). The lobby is contemporary and luxurious. Front desk staff are immaculately turned out and extremely professional - only the beautiful people seem to work here! However I did feel that I was being checked in by a Revenue Manager rather than a Receptionist as the emphasis was very much on upselling. Breakfast? No thanks. Dinner? No thanks. Club Lounge access? (\u00c2\u00a3108). No thanks. Just when I thought we'd finished she noticed my Ambassador membership had expired and asked if I'd like to renew for $150. No thanks! I was then handed my room key and bid a polite farewell. Despite being a Priority Club member no room upgrade was offered. I did feel that if I'd answered \"Yes\" to any of the above then I'd probably have been upgraded. A little disappointing as I've already demonstrated my loyalty to IHG Hotels by being a Platinum member. The room on the 8th (top) floor was a little cold when I entered but soon warmed up once the air con was switched on. The room was rather small even by European standards (tiny by US standards). I checked the fire escape plan behind the door and yes this was a standard king room - all the standard rooms are the same size. TIP: If you're expecting a large room then definitely upgrade. Whilst rather compact the room was well furnished with a big comfortable bed, a Bang & Olufsen TV and a Bose CD player with ipod dock. The bathroom was spotless if again rather compact. The over bath shower head was enormous and gave a real monsoon experience. TIP: If you didn't want to get your hair wet there's an adjustable wall mounted shower head that could be separately operated. Top quality Elemis shampoo and bath gel provided along with other Elemis products. We returned later that evening to find that our room had been turned down. The used Elemis products replaced, fresh towels provided and a bottle of complimentary mineral water and fresh fruit had been placed in the room. A small card had been left indicating the following day's weather. A really nice touch. The next morning we skipped breakfast in the hotel - an eyewatering \u00c2\u00a330 each plus \u00c2\u00a35 delivery charge to the room. TIP: We walked across to Hyde Park and sat in the beautiful 1960's pavillion on the edge of the Serpentine where we enjoyed a superb full English Breakfast - cooked to order - for only \u00c2\u00a38.60 The coffee was top quality too. I can't comment on the hotel restaurant - we ate out for both dinner and breakfast. However, the staff we encountered at the Intercontinental were charming, helpful and extremely professional. Housekeeping standards were amongst some of the best I've ever seen and our room (whilst a little small) was very comfortable and immaculately presented. Attention to detail really sets this hotel apart. I would highly recommend the Intercontinental for its location, service and comfort of the rooms. My only slight disappointment (and the reason why I couldn't in all honesty give 5 stars) was the size of their standard rooms and the lack of an upgrade as a Priority Club member.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHip Hotel In The Centre Of London\u201d", "Author": "Hugh C", "ReviewID": "UR121903906", "Content": "Stayed here October 17-20.

The bed itself was comfortable and we had no problems getting to sleep until I was rudely awoken by what I thought was a seal-mating documentary being filmed next-door (or above/below). I quickly realised these mating calls were not seals and I also realised that InterContinental put their beds too close to the wall or do not fix their headboards to the wall securely enough. Thankfully this intrusion of my sleep only lasted a matter of minutes before the excitable seals had either fallen asleep or had been rolled back into the sea.

I don't know why but all the hotels around that time were extremely expensive, and this seemed like a good deal. Most 5 stars were between 500-600 a night. I got a renovated room on the first floor, which was very nice. The room was nicely decorated, and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom, while a bit small was arranged nicely. The staff were very helpful, and the service did feel like a true 5 star. There are two reasons though that I am not giving it full marks. The first is the fact that they didn't award me any points as an ambassador member. They said because I booked it through a travel agent they would award me any points. It wasn't like I was staying for 50 pounds a night, I paid 390 to be exact. The other disappointing thing was the morning breakfast. In my humble opinion, a hotel this large, which they claim is their flagship is impossible to have such a small variety. They only had 2 choices of juices, orange and grapefruit, no pancakes, waffles, french toast, and limited amount of cheeses, and cereals. They also had limited choice of breads, and overall it reminded more of a 3 star breakfast rather than a 5 star. In any case, overall a very good hotel, i would recommend it, but avoid the rate with breakfast as its not worth it.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Antalya", "Title": "\u201cCould have been perfect\u201d", "Author": "perge", "ReviewID": "UR120574973", "Content": "Stayed here for 5 nights. First the overall impressions. Excellent location, good views depending on your room, stylish interiors, contemporary lobby & bar, relatively classic style rooms, small but very good breakfast buffet, excellent breakfast staff, average bar staff, terrible front office staff. Now in detail. We made our booking directly on hotels website couple of weeks before prior to arrival. Arrived quite late, group of 3, one couple and my self as single room. Booked Superior rooms by the way. An Intern (or a new staff) welcomed us, with someone training her. After couple of minutes on deciding where to put us, she prepared our keys. We said we would appreciate nice rooms as we are staying for 5 nights. She said not to worry, we have very good rooms in deed. Then she gave one room on 2nd floor and the other on 6th floor ?? We made one booking with two rooms and got rooms very far from each other. Well this was the least of our issues. We asked if the rooms are same, she said the rooms are exactly the same so we can choose either of them. I took the room on second floor my colleagues took the room on 6th. My room was an accesible room with a french bed which was just bit smaller then a queen size. They got a room with twin bed on a smoking floor. One of my colleagues has an asthma and she had a terrible night. But since we arrived at almost midnight they did not go to reception and complained. Next day we went to ask for another room for them. Very simple request. Double bed on a non smoking floor. The Front Office staff looked at her computer for about 10 minutes and informed us that she doesnt have any, but we can pay 20 sterling extra per day and get a deluxe room with a view. Not happy, but had to accept. Then she confirmed us that my colleagues will get a king size bed and also a room with nice views. They should just go to their room and wait for the belboy to assist with the luggages. They ended up getting a room on the first floor looking at a courtyard?? we thought this was a joke from Front office and called them. The lady said, sorry her friend made a mistake, they dont have any rooms available for that day, but next day they cangive a london deluxe with 60 sterling extra, but as they made a mistake we only need to pay 40 sterling extra per day. May I remind you that this is an Intercontinental not a Holiday inn express and we have already paid over 300 sterling for our rooms. Luckily the guest services manager took charge and gave them a relatively decent room. As for my room. Very very comfortable bed, good B&O tv and Bose sound system. Large bathrooms considering that its an accessible room ( I have seen teh standard bathrooms and they are tiny) but since its designed for guests with wheelchair, very low baisin, funny toilet and very very low tub. Look I dont mind staying in an accessible room, but just advice this upon checkin and at least offer some complimentary water or something. As there is no space in the bathroom I had to put most of my things on the floor and bend down almost on my knees everyday while shaving. One thing I hate about expensive hotels is when they go greedy. Intercontinental gives you coffee and tea facilities in the room but no complimentary water. As the tap water is discusting, you have to use the minibar water everyday which costs 5 sterling. And I consumed about 10 or 12 waters through out my stay, just do the calculations. Plus 15 sterling for internet. So our extras ended up being just as much as the room price. We could have easily stayed at the Four Seasons opposite. Overall a very nice hotel and it could have been a perfect experience. But its these small things and the staff makes the difference. And not the B&O tv ;) oh by the way, a typical Intercontinental, they spend millions on state of the art tv's and sound system in the rooms and as usual they had a cheap polyester shower curtain.

We do have a fairly broad understanding of the language regarding what a 5 star hotel in London should be. We do not always stay in 5 star hotels out of choice but decided to do so this time. I should add we have stayed in this hotel previously with disappointment regarding the discrepancy between room we were given versus the deluxe room we had paid for but because of the location thought we would try again. Unfortunately we booked for 5 nights. When we checked in we were looking forward to our deluxe room with a view of the park. I thought there was a mistake, or they were joking in some odd way when they took us to a room on the 8th floor so very small we could not open our suitcases (2) could not exit the room without bumping into the television, mounted on the wall. They maintained that this was a \"Deluxe room.\" I am a fairly short person, 5 foot 4, and could easily reach my hand to the ceiling, practically palms touching the ceiling. It was impossible to open the closet because the only place to set the suitcases, the only floor space, was in front of them. We were successful in getting a new room the second night. We had heard from another reviewer about an experience here with bedbugs, so were not comfortable resting clothes on the floor. There were no racks. We had asked for hypoallergenic bedding when we booked, due to severe allergies and were assured of hypoallergenic bedding.We called to request this again and they didn't know if they had anything, said they would look. In a couple hours the bedding was changed as we had asked. I added my own personal allergy covers on the pillows but tonight they are missing from the bed, taken off to the laundry I would guess. I would like to comment on the breakfast. The first morning, I ended up going upstairs to my room to get my own teabags because the service was nonexistent. There was no toast - no waiter- and no response to my politely asking for some coffee for my husband.

This Club is included with some of the rooms; with others, it can be obtained through a supplemental payment.

They wanted that the bill was charged to another credit card then they made the reservation with. The receptionist informed them that this is not possible. The friends said that they informed the hotel upfront about this and that they got an email from the hotel. The receptionist said that she could change it, but that she was not willing to. My friends asked what this is because it was promised. Then the receptionist told them that they have to show the email and if they can that she will do this, otherwise she is refusing to do her job. The friends showed the mail and with a very arrogant face the lady changed the creditcard, she was not happy. As the reception promised us an upgrade for the 2nd and 3rd night, we had to pack our luggage and the staff would move everything. This is very good service. So we packed everything in the morning. When we asked for our new room keys the receptionist informed us that they are not giving us the promised upgrade. We said it was promised by one of the receptionists. The manager informed us the hotel was not fully booked but we did not get any upgrades. So the hotel promises things and does not live up to them. They also did not do anything with the anniversary. We were at Alain Ducasse and there we got an anniversary cake during dinner. This is service you expect in good restaurants and in good hotels, but service at Intercontinental is not possible!

Dominic (at the front desk) upgraded our room free of charge upon learning we were there on a birthday trip; we'd also picked up my friend's cousin at the tail-end of a business trip, and were willing to pay for a cot for her to join us, but he waived the charge there as well - so friendly and helpful, and we really felt welcomed and treated well, I can't say enough about the staff. We'd arrived to check-in early, and they easily accepted our bags and let us proceed out on our day, and contacted us when our room was ready. The ONE sour note was the hotel's internet access. We ended up with a very good, slightly more budget-friendly hotel (4*) for the first half of our trip, which provided us with breakfast and speedy 24-hour internet access free of charge - we didn't expect included breakfast at a place like the Intercontinental, but the internet policy at the Intercontinental took us aback - \u00c2\u00a33(~$5CAN) for half an hour, \u00c2\u00a35 (~$8) for an hour, or \u00c2\u00a321 (+$33) for 24 hours. Our assumption is that the hotel caters to many business travelers, who can write off the extra expense, but to us - already splurging on a 5* for a special occasion - even the occasional ponying up for a half hour at a time became prohibitive and curbed us being able to get in touch and make plans with our friends in the area (landline calls also charged, and of course, serious roaming on our cells applied.)

Good amount of wardrobe space and tea and coffee making facilities in room. Location of hotel is excellent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c right by Hyde Park Corner Tube Station. Bar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a wonderful lobby bar selling over 25 kinds of gin \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I feared this could expensive and we tried a couple. The barman also let us try a small shot of a couple of more obscure gins to see if we liked them free of charge. Great service but as you would expect of 5*central London hotel, bar prices were high. Evening turn down service was appreciated. They also left a birthday cake for me which was really exquisite. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the restaurants so cannot comment but the d\u00c3\u00a9cor of them looked great. A perfect stay for a rate which simply was unbelievable.

The staff are very friendly, the rooms are very well appointed, and it has all of the hallmarks of a 5-star hotel that one would expect, but in fairness this should be expected at the rates charged. Being a Royal Ambassador I was fortunate enough to arrange an early check-in, and we were granted access to the Club Lounge whilst our room was being prepared, so we could at least have a coffee. Unfortunately this took longer than expected so I elected to have breakfast and pay the GBP60 charge so we have access for the duration of our one night stay. The Club Lounge is a nice environment, but is let down by slow service and an incompetent chef. I was presented with sour poached eggs - all that I could taste was vinegar, cold bacon, and a shrivelled sausage that must have been cooked the day before. I never did receive my orange juice from one of the waiting staff, who seemed to take my request then go for a break. The afternoon tea experience was admittedly somewhat better than breakfast, but it was all self service buffet style. We did not take advantage of the evening cocktail hour as we were seeing friends, so am unable to offer comment on this. Breakfast the following morning, was a better experience as the cooked English breakfast was perfect, however my wife elected to have the pancakes which were served raw, and to this day we are still waiting for some ketchup! There were a number of families waiting to be seated for breakfast, so be prepared to wait during peak times if you want to dine at the limited number of tables. On check-out the GBP60 charge is in actual fact GBP72 as the VAT element was not quoted, so be sure to factor this into any of the prices quoted by the staff - I found this very misleading to the point of being underhand. I will more likely than not stay at the hotel again despite the Club Lounge experience, but it is very doubtful if I would elect to pay the additional charge for access. Top Tip: Park at the Hilton (W1K 1BE) as there is an hourly rate available (see http://www.ncp.co.uk/car-park.html?cpid=201321&name=Hilton%2520Hotel) otherwise a daily rate of GBP50/day (or part day) applies, when parking at the InterContinental.

Mini Bar was very well stocked with champagne and plenty of spirits and snacks. CLUB LOUNGE: -------------------- Breakfast was extremely good. Full continental buffet and you can also order from an a la Carte menu with lots of options (Full English breakfast / Eggs Benedict / Kippers / Pancakes / Waffles and much more) Afternoon tea was very tasty and plentiful. Finger sandwiches included Smoked Salmon, Cucumber, Egg Mayonnaise & Ham & Mustard. And of course there were scones, jam and cream along with other helpings of cakes and pastries.

My initial stay was for 8 nights but I checked out after only three. The hotel initially blocked 2000 pounds when we checked in and then 1000 pounds every night! I was staying at a standard room and I was shocked. After some negotiation they refused to stop blocking additional amounts and offered to lower the amount to 400 pounds. That was when I decided to check out. When I was revising the bill I found that I was overcharged for many of the services I never used. Everything was not working in the hotel. either out of service or having work done on them. First of all, although online on their website they said they had wireless net in the rooms that fact was false. On top of that, even the net through the ethernet cable internet was not working throughout most of our stay. To make matters worse, I had access to the club lounge and even there I was told that the internet was not working properly due to some work being carried out. The point here is not just the poor service but also the fact that I was not advised of this before hand, nor compensated but charged for using the internet in my room. The elevators made loud noises as they came to stop on the ground floor and on several occasions there were lifts out of order or having work done on them. Tv channels suddenly loose service for long periods of time only bbc cnn and aljazeera were working. The scones and cake on the club level were of poor quality.

The names \"Intercontinental\" and \"Park Lane\" made me expect a really exceptional place, that's why I chose it out of all the other hotels in London. I must admit, when I first arrived at the hotel at the front doors, I honestly thought I was at the wrong entrance (or even the service entrance) as it didn't look anything special like I am used to, staying in many different hotels around the world with my job. Once I had worked out it was the main entrance, the door men were very welcoming. The reception area was very clean and white, but there was nothing special about it. There were no big ceilings or a nice lobby. Just three desks in a row. I was a bit underwhelmed. The room was very nice. The bed was really comfortable and big. Not much of a view. Just looking out to another building across the road. The room was clean and neat, though \"cosy\" in size. It's everything you'd want in a typical hotel room. I'm the sort of person who usually goes straight to the information book to see what this hotel has to offer.... There wasn't one. I looked in every drawer and cupboard with no luck. It wasn't until after about half an hour that I noticed it in the TV menu. It was not very detailed and I'm sure people would struggle using the remote control to get through the menus. I was after an ironing board, which I couldn't find in the room, so once I worked out I had to request one, housekeeping brought one up straight away. At first I was a bit concerned that I wouldnt get my shirt ironed for dinner that night, but crisis was over. The location of the hotel is good. It's not the most central to a business person or tourist, but its definitely not in the middle of nowhere. For the price, you probably could get somewhere equally nice, much more central to the big attractions. I was waken up by someone trying to get into my room at 9am the following morning. It was lucky I had the door locks on, otherwise I still would have been in bed when someone walked in. I assumed it was house keeping, even though I had requested a late check out as I wanted a sleep in. I reported it to reception on check out and they waived a very expensive packet of nuts I had used from the mini bar, which was nice... but in the end didn't get that sleep in I was after. If i was to suggest two things to the management.... one would be to re-introduce a book/folder of hotel information for guests. As modern and high tech as it is going through the menus on the TV, I'm thinking guests could find this complicated at first and there is not as much detail as expected about the hotels services. The second would be to improve the appearance of the main entrance to the hotel. Even a sign above the door saying the name of the hotel would be good. The entrance is not on Park Lane, so a sign or something might be useful. People reading this review may think it's a very fussy review, but please keep in mind that I booked a night in this hotel with very high expectations, especially with my experience with other intercontinental hotels. It was still a very pleasant stay. The staff were very nice, the hotel and rooms were very clean and neat. I would absolutely recommend people stay here and you wont be dissappointed. All I would say is that you don't have extremely high expectations like I did.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Europe", "Title": "\u201c5-Star Service, Small Rooms\u201d", "Author": "unejam", "ReviewID": "UR91441765", "Content": "The location of this hotel is superb. Just a short walk down Picadilly, and you hit a Marks and Spencer, a Starbucks, and a Pret a Manger if you are looking for some cheap eats. A few more minutes and you pass a lot of great shopping including Fortnum and Mason and Jermyn Street and then Picadilly Circus. I am used to traveling in Europe and experiencing small rooms, but this room, although very comfortable, was a bit small for the price. The service and attitude of the employees from the doormen to the restaurant waitresses was fantastic. I did not try Theo Randall, so I can't comment on that. Here are some tips: To get to the nearest Tube Stop (Hyde Park Corner) make a right out of the hotel and another right so you walk around the side of the hotel. You will go into a subway (not a subway train but a British subway which refers to an underground passage) straight through and up to ground level again. Keep walking and then you will go underground in another subway and in this subway follow the signs to the Tube. The breakfast at the hotel restaurant is pretty decent with a good selection of cold and hot items. It's pricey at 28 GBP but if you tell the front desk ahead of time they can add it to your room for 20 GBP. Check to make sure that breakfast isn't included first. Internet access is a whopping 15 GBP for 24 hours but you can go into a Vodafone store and get a USB Mobile Broadband dongle for 20 GBP. This dongle comes with 3 GB of data (more than enough for a few days or even weeks) and lasts 1 month. You can also get similar sticks with a little faster internet speed from Orange or O2, but my research found that Vodafone's was the cheapest. I just got a notice (I'm currently writing from the hotel) that remodeling of the lobby begins tomorrow until the end of January 2011 which moves the restaurant (not Theo Randall) and other lobby amenities to suites upstairs, so you might want to take this into consideration if you plan to stay in January 2011. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay here. Concierge was also very helpful especially as we were here for New Year's Eve and wanted to watch the fireworks but not battle crowds since my wife is pregnant.

I called back. \"Why do you need to speak to the room controller?\" asked an almost hostile voice. I explained. \"Reception can help you with that. Hold on\". I poke to reception. It was 7pm but I was told that the only other room available was a twin on a smoking floor: obviously untrue since guests continued to check in throughout the evening when I passed through reception. Translation: \"we can't be bothered to change the room allocations\". Obviously, the person in the connecting room had a persistent cough and I got very little sleep The fan in the room's heating system was broken (and very noisy) but that was fixed while I was out.

I stayed 4 night end of November (Thanksgiving for those from the States). The room was a \"classic\" room and so a smaller room with a view of the courtyard (no view) but given the general lack of sun the lack of a view wasn't much of an issue. The smaller rooms are a good size room and equal to most studio apartments in London (or so I was told by a local). The location was ideal as the underground was near and the area was nice. If traveling from the States some preparation will make the trip and the stay more pleasant. Acquire the Oyster card in advance for the mass transit as you can take the Underground from the airport . Acquire a convenient map of London in advance or a app on your phone for mapping as the only maps of London are quite large. Ask the mini bar be emptied immediately so you can shop up the street for drinks and snacks. I must admit some issues appeared to be lost in translation between \"5 Star\" and common sense. I found no information on the hotel services in the room so I was a bit lost on how to address common requests. I asked three staff for a razor over a course of 4 hours prior to the delivery of a razor. I asked twice for the mini bar to be emptied. I always used the two towels in the room but never received more than two towels. No lack of staff to turn down the bed each night, though. The breakfast buffet was a wide assortment of foods to accommodate a wide assortment of visitors. Breakfast starts at 6:30 AM and I suspect the quality is highest at 6:30 AM so wake up early. In a 4 night stay breakfast was buffet two mornings and room service two mornings. The quality was equal but the quanity was not equal. The room service pancakes were an al a carte size at best, as an example. So stick with the breakfast buffet or order the continental breakfast and the pancake breakfast. The gym was very nice and located on the second floor. The main entrance was under construciton so no grand entrance during my visit. The hotel bars and restaurants are very popular. The rooms were clean and well appointed. The TV channels were very limited and included endless sports channels. BBC with the same shows repeated time and time again. The doormen were cute and very friendly so a nice entry and exit to the hotel day or night. Internet was 15 pounds so I paid nearly $100 USD for 4 days of Intenet.

As it was my first time in London in quite a long time, I appreciated its location. It was easy to walk to Piccadilly Circus and the tube stop was around the corner. The tube stop, Hyde Park Corner, also goes to the airport. I also felt safe walking in the neighorbood. I walked back once from Marble Arch back down to the Intercon at night and there were plenty of cars and people. The lobby is beautiful and the rooms are nice. I was upgraded to a superior room as I am a Platinum Ambassador. The room was a decent size and the decor was modern and fresh. It had a nice flat screen television. Internet access was available for a fee and so was breakfast so I opted to go out to eat and use the internet at cafes. During the first night, as I was quite exhausted from the overseas flight, I was awakened at 2 or 3 am by what sounded like a jackhammer. Thinking that it was coming from outside, I looked out the window. Not seeing anything, I opened my door to understand that someone was polishing the floor in front of the elevator bank. Although I was at least 6 or 7 rooms down from the elevator bank lobby, the noise was enough that it woke me up! I called downstairs and was told that the night cleaning staff was polishing the floors (who polishes floors at 3am) and that they would ask them to stop. I believe I must have been the only person on the floor because no one else came out of their rooms. After 20 minutes, the polishing/jackhammering was still continuinng so I called down again and was told that it would stop. Again, the elevator lobby is not that big -- how long does it take to polish the floor? I waited another 20 minutes and it didn't stop and at this point, I became very annoyed and called again and it stopped shortly thereafter allowing me to fall asleep around 4 or 5 am. I would have ranked the hotel lower if I had not received exceptional customer service following this incident. I was awakened the next morning (around 9) by one of the managers who apologized for the inconvenience and offered to move me to another room away from the elevator lobby. When I stated that I did not want to pack my belongings or go through the hassle of moving, the manager offered to send someone up to help pack my belongings and move me. When I returned home later that evening, I picked up a key card to my new room and was surprised to see that I had been upgraded to a suite and given club room access. The bedroom was sufficiently removed from the hallway so that I had a excellent night's sleep. My only regret is that I did not have more time to enjoy the suite. I was also credited points for this stay. The end result was that I left the next day refreshed and quite satisfied with the service that I had received. I understand that customer service at hotels can be hit or miss. I appreciated the fact that the management recognized that I had been inconvienced and made it right. Sadly, I know I will not receive such attentiveness every time I travel, but the management's response made my stay enjoyable and I would return to this hotel in the future.", "Date": "October 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cNot as 5-star as it thinks.\u201d", "Author": "brmusicman", "ReviewID": "UR84190059", "Content": "We stayed here in October, 2010 for a couple of nights. Overall, it was fine, but the hotel bills itself as a 5-star place. It did not match the quality of other 5-star (or even other 4-star) hotels that I have stayed in, especially from a service perspective. The stay got off to a bad start. We arrived around 10:30p. Upon arriving, we were not offered assistance with our luggage as we entered the hotel's lobby, nor was the door held for us (I'm fine with that at a Hampton Inn, but this place bills itself as five-star. Walking in the door without being greeted or offered luggage assistance would not happen at, say, the Four Seasons). Our check-in experience was not pleasant. The clerk barely spoke English, and she was only half engaged in our check-in because she kept inserting herself into the check-in happening next to us (where the guest was complaining). This kept up until her colleague working with the other guest silenced her, saying, \"I've got it.\" I am a Platinum member with Priority Club, the loyalty program of InterContinental. As such, I expect that, like other hotel chains, I'll be treated pretty well during my stay in thanks for staying with the chain a lot. This includes my room and reservation preferences being honored. I had requested, using award points, a non-smoking room with one king bed. My room preferences call for high floor, away from elevator. The clerk attempted to check us into a smoking room with two double beds on the first floor -- I can understand that the hotel might not be able to meet the high floor request, but come on: a smoking room with two beds, when the reservation is for a nonsmoking room with one bed? Give me a break -- awful for ANY guest, particularly bad for a guest who's in the top-tier of your loyalty program. When I raised this issue with the clerk, she began this whole line of saying, \"well, you're here on points,\" as if using the points I'm awarded by the hotel chain makes me some kind of second-class citizen. When I pressed for a better room, she began to talk about how full the hotel was, etc., but then when I refused the room I'd been assigned she magically found a king room, non-smoking, on a high floor! (Magic!) I then had to endure a lecture from her about how \"lucky\" I was to get such a nice room. Spare me. Obnoxiously, upon check-in I was also offered the chance to access the hotel's concierge lounge. For 95 British pounds a night! 95! This doesn't really bother me -- I wasn't expecting lounge access because I know InterContinental to be stingy with it, but it's in such contrast to a stay I had at a Hilton property in London only a few days before, where -- despite staying on points (gasp!) -- I was put, with the hotel's compliments, on a concierge floor, given access to an amazing lounge, and my room preferences were met. All without having to ask. Makes clear which loyalty program I should stick with -- Hilton made clear its priority was customer satisfaction, while InterContinental made extremely clear through the check-in process that its priority was revenue. Admittedly, the room to which we were assigned was very nice -- elegant furnishings, high-quality finishes, a fabulous view of Big Ben, the Houses of Parliament, etc. It was tiny, however -- cruise ship size. The bathroom was very nice, with a great rain shower. Linens were also very high quality. After our late arrival and lengthy check-in experience, we ordered room service. It was a rip off, which I've come to expect at hotels like this. I was willing to pay for the convenience after a long day of travel. The food, however, was awful. We both ordered sandwiches that came with French fries, and after waiting the standard half-hour for delivery, we were given ICE COLD French fries. Literally no heat on them at all. The sandwiches were mediocre. This was bitterly disappointing -- like I said, I've come to expect rip-off room service at places like this, but if you're going to charge $25 per sandwich and fries, then serve them hot. Hardly \"5 star.\" The hotel's other facilities were fine. Nice lobby, interesting decor. The fitness center had a good range of equipment, but only two televisions that got about two channels each because of satellite troubles. No natural light in the fitness center, either. Service throughout the stay was hardly five-star. The bellmen at the hotel's main lobby inconsistently opened doors and generally had nothing to say (only one was good about saying \"good afternoon\" or \"enjoy your day\"). Check-out was fine, as was the process of getting a cab. Location is good for many London attractions; the Tube is next door, Hyde Park is across the street, major (expensive!) shopping close by, etc., so no complaints on that front. The neighborhoods surrounding the hotel are ritzy, but lovely, and despite the concentration of wealth in the area you can find a variety of restaurants and cafes. Overall, I would not return to this hotel. The regular room rates are very expensive, and the level of service doesn't justify what they charge. I didn't feel particularly well taken-care of, and I've had far, far better service at many other properties, including in London.", "Date": "October 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chris Sandeman", "Title": "\u201cWhat a shame!

So, the positives: pretty good sized rooms, and (for London) very comfortable (although still a pale shade of the Interconti hotels in NYC). Staff at check-in were friendly, no wit time, and my room was ready even though it was early in the day. The negative: despite being listed as one of the features of the room ( along with TV and walk in shower), the high speed Internet at this hotel is not included in the room rate. Okay, you might say, but here's the kicker...Interconti is the 5 star hotel level for the group....if you stay in their 3 or 4 star hotels, the Internet is free. I found this to be strange...why give away Internet in the low end hotels and charge in the top end? So I went and asked reception. the receptionist asked me to fill in a customer survey, and explained that this is a frequent question, and that many guests complain about this... So I asked to speak with her manager, hoping he could shed some light on the situation....and he did! He told me that guests at the Holiday Inn are more price sensitive, and those that stay at the Interconti are more willing to spend the approx 20EUR for 24 hrs of Internet, without it outing them off their stay. What? I asked, did he mean that because the guests at the Interconti were willing to pay more than the guests at the more budget hotels in the group, that they were being charged more for the same services? He said yes, in his personal opinion! This hotel needs to provide free Internet. Or at least teach their staff not to answer questions with a PR nightmare of an answer.

Arrived one day before our guests and things started as they were to continue. After about 20 mins fumbling with the computer, the receptionist turned to us and said 'I cannot find your reservation, sorry there is nothing I can do'. Not sure what she wanted us to do in response to this news (her attitude seemed to be that it was somehow our fault that the reservations were missing) we insisted she call her manager who sorted out the problem in two minutes (seems there is a glitch in the system which causes some bookings to be allocated to the wrong date). Not a good start but not the worst thing that could happen as we were later to find out. At last shown to our rooms the first thing to hit us on exiting the elevator was the overpowering stench of industrial strength chemicals. We later found out that the carpets had just had their annual cleaning and to mask the smell of the cleaners used, the hotel had installed some industrial-strength chemical air fresheners . End result was air quality somewhere between a badly ventilated dry cleaners and a chemical toilet. Being late we went straight to the rooms. After a couple of hours one of our party was in great distress and nearly in need of hospitalization. We took a poll and decided (at two in the morning) to abandon the booking and try to find another hotel. At this point, the Intercontinental offered us alternative accommodation on another floor which had been cleaned the week before and was less life-threatening. Eventually got to bed at around 3am, several hours after arriving at the hotel. Since they did not have enough rooms at the same grade to accommodate our room change, one of our party was forced to pay an upgrade fee to escape the chemical smell. Given the reason for the move, this seemed uncalled for but at 3am we were not in a mood to argue so paid up. Next morning's meetings did not go well. In addition to the 500 pounds per day room charge (normal for London if expensive), the hotel wanted to charge several hundred pounds extra for a projector (included in the room fee everywhere else). The sales reps' response to our complaint -- yes, you've guessed 'sorry, there is nothing I can do (this is our rate)' Well, at least we were now free to enjoy the hotel's facilities. This 'five star' hotel boasts exactly two cafes and restaurants or rather one of each. The restaurant was always empty and the cafe always full. There was a full 20 minutes queue for breakfast on Saturday. We would have had room service except that the rooms we occupied also had a residual chemical odor. The final straw came when one of our clients reported a theft from his room. With important documents being carried around on expensive computer equipment we felt we could no longer take the risk. We sacrificed the final two days of the prepaid reservation, kissing goodbye to several thousand irreclaimable dollars and decamped to a better venue.", "Date": "August 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stoke on Trent", "Title": "\u201cUpdate - 2 years on!\u201d", "Author": "CazRob", "ReviewID": "UR76360888", "Content": "I last stayed here 2 years ago when I wrote a review (It's still there to read if you are interested!)

A new reservation was made and confirmed via note from their office, but when we arrived at the restaurant they had no record of it. Fortunately there were able to squeeze us in but it was somewhat embarrassing.

Next to a subway station, direct connection to Heathrow airport. Opposite of Hyde park, within reasonable walking distance to Oxford street, Bond Street etc. and close to Buckingham palace. When we checked in our room was clean, but we did not get the keys because a second check had to be done. We stalled our luggage at the reception and they brought it to our room. This was very efficient and helpful. Although we are platinum members of the Intercontinental hotels, we did not get an upgrade to the next level of rooms. We reserved two rooms under our platinum card, and we only got one free upgrade (we had to ask for it). This is not the way you threat your most loyal guests. The room was nice. We had a view to the park, but we also could look into other rooms, this resulted in the fact that we closed the curtains the entire time. You do not want to look in other rooms. Also people who were sitting on the balcony of the hotel next to us could watch into our room. We totally did not like this. The room was small but had everything we needed. They have a B&O television, a Bose sound system etc. You have to shower in the bath, this is something I really hate. The bathroom was tiny, we could not be there together at the same time. What I did not like was that there is no sauna or pool next to the gym. The gym is without instructors. The hotel makes a lot of advertisement for the spa, but there is no normal sauna where you can make use of. After the gym I want to be able to take a shower or to go to the sauna, but this was not possible, unless you shower in your room. Breakfast was good. I did not like the placemats with the prices of the breakfast. This looked very cheap. We had to pay extra for the breakfast. During check out we did not get our breakfast bill, this is directly charged from your credit card, without signing for it, this is not acceptable. We wanted to make use of the business centre. They do know how to charge for everything. You pay for the use of the Internet and also for printing. We stayed in a lot of hotels where printing was a service, but here you have to pay for everything. The Internet in the room is not wireless and costs GBP 15 per 24 hours. There is no free wifi in the bars / hall as most 5-star hotels do have these days. Also as platinum guest you do not get any other benefits. No water in the room, no flowers, no chocolates during turn down service. Nothing. In my opinion 5-star hotels need to provide a bottle of complimentary water for the night, as the price for a night is high in the hotels. But Intercontinental Park Lane does not give you any water. We probably come back, especially for the location. The hall is beautiful, the rooms are cozy, not my taste and are not in the same style as the hall. Checkout was efficient. We asked 3 times if it was possible to get a late check out. This was finally possible for one of the two rooms. However late check out was 4 PM (the same time as late check out for Platinum guests of Intercontinental is), so actually no late check out for us.", "Date": "May 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA/Russia", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Love this Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "mkouzmine", "ReviewID": "UR64350777", "Content": "I stayed in the Intercontinental Park Lane with my mother and two kids.

Sadly it is a negative one, as I felt compelled to share my experience. I am (or was) a loyal Intercontinental traveler and am an Ambassador member. I travel to London on a regular basis and almost always stayed at the Intercontinental Park Lane. I have had mixed experiences in the past and have noticed throughout my stays a steady decline in service levels (particularly from the check in staff). However this trip was a total farce from beginning to end. The check in was muddled and confused and the check in staff were rude, disinterested and seemingly incompetent (they had to check several details that they should have known and different staff gave different information). We were upgraded to an Executive room, but then told we could not enter the lounge (which seemed utterly pointless, as the Executive rooms are exactly the same as the Deluxe rooms that we booked, but with lounge access, so what was the point of the upgrade?), they placed my parents in a disabled room and when they asked to be changed were given a room that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fit the description they had been given (they had had enough of complaining by then and just accepted it!). The final straw came was when we checked out they overcharged our stay and I spent 3 weeks of phone calls and emails to try and rectify the problem (the person who we needed to speak to was never available, apparently). Eventually they agreed to refund via email, without a single apology or recognition of their error and then went on to say my father (a platinum Ambassador member) had been undercharged (which he hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t) and tried to charge him more money! I shan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be staying there again, nor will I be renewing my Ambassador status.

The hotel was in a decent location and it was clean and safe, the bathrooms had a very nice rain shower, and the doormen were really nice . . . but those are the only nice things I have to say about it. The problems started with the booking process. My friend and I booked a two-bed room through American Airlines, and in addition I called the hotel directly two weeks before we were to arrive to confirm that a room with two beds would be available for late check-in. Que arrival: There's an immediate scramble to find us a room. We were told that the request for two rooms wasn't on our reservation and there was only one room left with two beds . . . on the first floor, right next to the gym (highly noisy). I knew that instead of the deluxe room we booked this was going to be Cinderella's room because logic dictates hotels give out their nicer rooms first, but it was 1am at this point and there was nothing to be done so we just went to the room. I felt like I was entering a Holiday Inn. In fact, if memory serves me, some Holiday Inns are nicer than our hotel room was. Picture: two single beds on wheels, four t.v. channels, a broken lamp, old scuffed furniture, and a non-functioning alarm clock. To make a long story short, when we asked nicely if there were any other rooms available since we had paid for a deluxe room and had booked early, we were rejected. It also became apparent that we weren't getting any amenities (unless you count getting your pajamas folded 3 times a day an amenity). The expressionless Germanic desk staff did not budge on anything. Only when they gave me a comment card an hour before check-out and I went to the front desk to ask for a notepad write on (yep, didn't have those, either. Holiday Inns always have notepads) did a manager miraculously appear - apparently the poor kid behind the desk sensed the type of comment I was about to leave. For our troubles, the manager questioned why we didn't say anything before (hello, we tried multiple times!) and then graciously offered to let us check out an hour late. As you might imagine, we said thanks, but no thanks. Bottom line: this particular Intercontinental is not worthy of a 5 star rating. Maybe there were some nice rooms available, but we sure as heck weren't in one and the experience was mediocre at best for the price. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a hardship to stay at the hotel and if it had actually been a Holiday Inn I would not utter a single complaint, but for the amount of money we were paying (Almost $500 a night) it was not acceptable. For the same price I could have been at the Marriott or Four Seasons and had a worthy 5 star experience and probably a bed that didn't roll. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone but a business traveler with low expectations and a company that doesn't mind a load of in-room charges to the corporate AMEX.", "Date": "January 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Costa Mesa, CA", "Title": "\u201cClassy\u201d", "Author": "Lindamwh", "ReviewID": "UR53461771", "Content": "The hotel is in a wonderful location across from Hyde Park and within walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Harrods, West End theater - although there is a tube stop at the corner if you don't care for a long walk.

To be clear with you all, I am writing this review after my third stay at the hotel since refurbishment and have stayed there quite a few times prior to the closure a few years ago... There are no welcoming smiles and no invites to the club lounge, you get exactly what you are entitled to a one level upgrade and there is no discretion at the reception which you could stomach if the rooms and hotel itself were very special, but they just are not... particularly at the rates they charge which are nothing short of an attitude being, \"...well we know these rich cats will pay so lets cream the sods...\" and I for one have started staying elsewhere in London. As a comparisson I stayed in Intercontinetal Miami for three days after this stay and it was night and day, so the problem isn't the IC group it's just this hotel whom in their own minds seem to think they are a little bit special.

The hotel performs quite poorly compared to other IC hotels (I'm a Gold Ambassador member) that I have been to in Asia and even North America. Onto services. The concierge staff is overworked. The front desk staff is adequate, but nothing to write home about. It will surprise no one that room service is overpriced, but nearly $25 a day for Internet service is a bit much. Yes, even by the standards of an Intercontinental. The location is good if you want to be near Green or Hyde Parks, but I would recommend top hotels that are a bit closer to Piccadilly itself. On the bright side, however, Green Park is a major Tube stop, an intersection for three lines. The bottom line is this: there is nothing wrong with the IC London. But there is nothing very special about it either. This is not a five star hotel where people will know your name. Staff members don't really go out of their way to be helpful; even if they had the inclination, they might not have the time. It is simply not worth more than about $250 a day.

We arrived at about 1pm - before check-in time, however our room was ready. The receptionist informed us that we had been upgraded to a room with a view over Hyde Park which we were pleased about. The lobby and downstairs areas in the hotel were lovely, it had a relaxed and welcoming feel. The bar area was smart and the chairs really comfy. Good first impressions. Our room was of average size - not huge but plenty of room for two people to be comfortable in. The bed was large and very comfortable. I noticed that the room and bathroom were exceptionally clean, which is something I really feel is necessary when I am staying somewhere. The decor wasn't to my taste, however there was nothing wrong with it - just a case of personal preference. The bathroom wasn't massive yet of sufficient size and the shower was a rainfall shower - with the big shower heads. Toiletries, dressing gowns and slippers were also provided. Upon returning to the room on the first evening I found a birthday card from the hotel along with a slice of cake (absolutely gorgeous), some comice pears and a box of chocolates - I thought this a really nice touch. The rooms also get turned down each evening which is good. We didn't order room service, however if you wish to then bare in mind it is very expensive! One gripe I had with the hotel (only minor) was that although there seemed to be a lot of staff stood by the doors, they were very rarely opened for us, only a small thing but I would expect a 5* hotel to have someone on the door to welcome guests in. On the Friday night we ate in Theo Randall's restaurant - not cheap but worth it! We opted for the 5 course taster menu, each course being exquisite. I do need to make particular mention to the Amalfi lemon tart - the best I have ever had! The sommilier seemed to have a good knowledge of the wines and all the waitering staff were friendly. The restaurant had a relaxed feel which was lovely - you didn't feel the need to have a really hushed conversation - there was a good buzz about the place. One lady - perhaps the maitre d (?) - went out of her way to be helpful - we couldn't manage our cheese course so she arranged for it to be taken up to our room. She was very down to earth and made you feel really welcome in the restaurant. Overall I would recommend the Intercontinental as there is nothing at all wrong with it. I probably wouldn't stay here again if visiting London as I like to try new places but that is no bad reflection on the Intercon. Although it is a good hotel, I wouldn't say that it was extra special - it didn't 100% match up to other 5 * hotels I have stayed in. I have also stayed at the Marriott on Park Lane and I did prefer this. I would say if you were just looking for a base to do some sighseeing / visit London then it's perfectly fine - however it is a big hotel so for a special occasion I would probably recommend a smaller, more personal hotel.

Good Location, Quiet Rooms, Pleasant Staff\u201d", "Author": "LittleCupcakes", "ReviewID": "UR28645996", "Content": "I wanted to rate this hotel as \"4.5\" here on TripAdvisor, but that's not an option. A perfect rating is also out of the question, so a \"4\" it is, with regret. I'd like to single out for special praise the pleasant and helpful attitude of the entire staff. They would collectively rate as one of the best I've encountered. This hotel is classified as a five-star property, and this review takes that fact into account. My feeling is that this is not quite a \"classic\" five-star in quality; it's no George V, Berkeley, or Four Seasons. Luckily, I paid four-star prices. Good: Location, room quality, bathroom, staff interaction, quiet room Not so good: Insulting costs for incidentals (wi-fi, minibar, phone), service hiccups, wi-fi access I had a room on the eighth floor in April 2009 (over Easter), booked through the opaque provider Hotwire, and I paid an average of USD $175 per night, inclusive. A month or two before check-in, I sent a personal letter to the manager indicating my several special requests. I was shocked to discover that each of my requests were accomodated (non-smoking, high floor, early check-in) even though I had booked through Hotwire (Hotwire/Priceline guests often receive less-desirable rooms in hotels). I was also upgraded to a deluxe room, though I did not request or expect it. The interactions (though not necessarily the results) with the staff were always pleasant and earnest, and I did not detect a hint of condescension even though I'm kind of a scruffy traveler. In fact, the desk staff who checked me in could not have treated me better. During the stay, service (though I did not need much attention) was somewhat lacking, and while that might be excusable in a lesser property, five-star hotels must be held to a higher standard. Even getting an ice bucket to the room promptly proved a challenge. However, these incidents were minor. On the flipside, management provided a complimentary plate of Easter sweets and (separately) a bottle of water. The room itself was rather nice (again, in context of a five-star property), well-appointed, but not fussy or over the top. Rather small for a five-star, the room was still large enough to feel less than cramped. There was enough storage space for my two bags, but there wasn't room for much else in the wardrobe (the only storage provided). As one would expect of a five-star, the room was quite clean. When the balcony door was closed, the room was very quiet, and I was never disturbed by outside noise (exterior, hallways, neighbors, etc). The hotel is in a decent location, and the Hyde Park Corner tube station is close by (although a flight of stairs down and up is involved to reach the station). However, there are not many dining/drinking options in the immediate neighborhood. If easy access to restaurants and pubs is important, then this hotel may not be a perfect choice. A brisk 20 minute walk will get one to Piccadilly, or Westminster, or other famous places in London. Hyde Park (itself) is next door, Buckingham Palace is a short walk away, and Harrod's about 15 minutes by foot or moments via tube. Across the road from Harrod's proper (on Brompton) there is a grocery store for those who like (as I do) to pick up some water, bread, drinks, or whatever to keep in the room. All the usual five-star amenities are present, including Frette linen, robes, slippers, a Bose radio, and a handily wall-mounted Bang & Olufson television. My room had a large balcony (I love balconies!), and from what I could see from the exterior, there are not many rooms with balconies. The programming is international, and in many languages. ESPN (american sport channel) is available, and the first time I have seen that in my international travels. The British TV channels are there, along with SKY news, CNN, and a few other English-language stations. Several electrical outlets are provided, and in various voltages and configurations (USA, Great Britain, and mainland Europe). The minibar is well-stocked; the pricing is shockingly high. It is an automatic device, so the guest is UNABLE to remove the items (to store their own purchases, for example) without being charged for them. Be careful not to accidentally remove an item. Don't use the in-room phone either. The charges are, like most incidentals in this hotel, insulting. The bathroom, though small, is well-fitted; the bathtub has the traditional hand-held showerhead and the always-appreciated \"rainfall\" showerhead as well. The water is quite hot, and the pressure is fine. Internet access, however, is a serious issue, and poorly handled at this property. There is no wi-fi available in rooms; wi-fi is only in the public areas. Worse, the charges for internet and wi-fi are OUTRAGEOUSLY and shamefully high. The charge is \u00c2\u00a35 (about USD $8 as of my stay) for ONE hour's worth of access, or \u00c2\u00a315 (USD $23) for 24 hours worth. The charge is the same for both wired in-room and wi-fi internet service. The public areas are very nice, and I enjoyed the (again, expensive) lounge. It is a comfortable, welcoming place. They also had the best macadamia nuts I have ever tasted (served with your drink).

This was part of a surprise, special New Year's trip to London for my girlfriend. I made the hotel aware of this via the booking form. The hotel, located at Hyde Park Corner, has recently undergone a major refurbishment and while the exterior is unlikely to ever to live up to some of the older, grander London hotels, I found the interior to be superb - contemporary luxury, without being too fussy or trying too hard. The doormen were welcoming and friendly; Jana on the check-in desk was helpful, efficient and friendly. My girlfriend and I felt immediately warmly welcomed and as if we personally mattered. We were given an upgraded room on the 8th floor, with views, which was in excellent condition. It was not a huge room, but I felt for London was probably good and it suited our needs perfectly. The club lounge facilities were also highlighted to us and we paid an additional amount to enjoy these as part of the hotel's New Year's package. These facilities are also available at other times too for an additional charge or are included with certain rooms. A special treat, in the form of a tasty dessert for two, was also delivered to our room gratis while we were out, which was another lovely touch. The breakfast the next morning was delicious and was taken in Theo Randall's restaurant. If there was to be any room for improvement, it would probably be around ensuring that breakfast items were always available, or at the very least with only very minor delays, and some items (glasses, plates, eggs, bread) were perhaps a little slow to be replensished at times. However, the staff did always appear to be pleasant and to be doing their best to resolve any issues as quickly as they could. On the plus side, this meant that the food always tasted fresh as it was never left standing for too long. All in all we had a fabulous stay and would very much enjoy a return visit I am sure.

Previous posts also gave me the impression we would be in safe hands. My only concern was the size and location of room that would be provided as we were using points, this was London after all. My worries were unfounded as our room was on a higher floor, with partial views of Parliament and Westminster Abbey and large. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in many hotels in London, some where you literally had to open the wardrobe door to turn over in bed at night, but this was spacious by any standard. A king size bed, lots of pillows and cushions, a sofa seating area with flat screen TV and Bose sound system clock, and even a fair size bathroom. After we had checked in the receptionist offered some advice regarding transportation to the station for our trip on the Orient Express the following morning. If nothing else it created the impression that they were aware of our itinerary and that we were not just another couple of guests. In my mind it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s usually the simple things that are appreciated more. A long day spent walking around London encouraged us to indulge in a couple of nightcaps in the hotel lounge. Typically expensive, but this was part of a weekend where we were prepared to spoil ourselves and remind ourselves why we work hard for a living. Although it was quite busy the bar waitress was attentive and our service was courteous, not surly in any way. The prices however were expensive, \u00c2\u00a310 for a 175ml glass of wine and \u00c2\u00a311.50 for a spirit, ouch, but again it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t our intention to count pennies on this trip.

Yes, if your pockets are deep enough. Would I stay there again? Probably not, for no other reason than the Holiday Inn, Mayfair is more reasonable in terms of cost, comfort and location.

The planning involved with this 4 day weekend consisted of months of planning and arranging and all with the fantastic help of Alixandra from the Hotels Concierge division. She had no idea when we were going or even where we were going. She only knew that I loved her and was someday going to ask her to spend the rest of her life with me. I took her right from her work; bags already packed in the car and passports in hand. We flew into Heathrow in London dropped off our luggage for trip to the hotel, and then we picked up our next flight which she knew nothing of to Paris for the day. I asked my beautiful phenomenal girlfriend to marry me on the Eiffel Tower after touring the finest of areas and hot spots of Paris that were all recommended by Alixandra and the other staff that she consulted with. We then took first class tickets on the Chunnel train back to London and both of us wanted to get to the Hotel, but little did we know what we were going to experience! Roses throughout the rooms and on the master bed in the shape of a large red heart, and champagne on ice had all been prearranged and were done magnificently. On top of this Alixandra had arranged for 2 large bars of dark chocolate, fresh cheeses, biscuits and strawberries. Alixandra also arranged for us to be upgraded to a single bedroom suite that cannot even be described. The workmanship and the detail to cleanliness cannot be compared. There were no details missed in this room or the hotel. They also arranged for us to have VIP passes to the 7th floor private members club where we enjoyed a spectacular selection of foods throughout the day and service that could not be challenged. The Suite was one we will never ever ever forget. The mirrors in the bathrooms were even heated so they wouldn't fog up if you were to enjoy the rain shower or the oversized bathtub. The daily paper being delivered in its own little satchel was as nice a touch as obtaining the daily weather reports and other fresh extras every day. The amenities were more then even I could have dreamed of giving my dream girl. The Bose stereo system and the B&O flat screen TV's were a great closing touch to a superior quality room. The view from our suite on the 7th floor was breathtaking of the park, Big Ben and the London Eye. The fresh slippers each day and oversized robes cannot easily be forgotten nor could the high quality toiletries that were automatically replenished each day. We would have stayed for weeks if we could! When we travel we always try to stay in the finest of locations within our budget and we strive to always get the best of service that we can but this was and might never be matched again. Alixandra arranged for everything perfectly and she left no small detail unturned. The staff throughout the Hotel cannot be compared to any other location that we have ever attended. The maids, doormen, servers, front desk were all so friendly and you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop thanking them enough, This was a life changing holiday extended weekend full of love and romance and this was more then any couple could ever expect or even deserve. I want to thank Alixandra, the Hotel and all of their terrific staff for making this a weekend one that we will hold to our hearts for the rest of our lives together. We were stretched to go their financially with flights and all but it was worth every pence and they will see us back again. (That is a promise!!!)

I'll start by saying the Intercontinental set of hotels are simply great. I have been staying with them and am an Ambassador level guest so I clearly put my money where my review is. The London Intercon is in a fun area of the city and offers a great morning walk to the office or city for work. If you're heading to Big Ben area you can walk right down the main causeway and past the Palace which kicks the day off in a wonderful way. It also is positioned well for a great walk after a long day and a few pints with you \"mates\". The hotel physically is well appointed and the staff very friendly. On my stay there were complimentary tickets to the Royal Galleries (although I did not have time to use them). So, all the basics are covered and covered well. My disappointment was with the room choice. I guess I was expecting that being Platinum and Amabassador with the Intercon for so many years I would not be put in a small room on a lower floor without access to the standard business lounge. It is probably an oversight by the booking or front desk people but it's one that is costly. For those staying 50+ nights a year with a hotel chain you expect / grow accustomed to the hotel being your home away from home. This is the major failure of this transaction. My second point of contention, which I will admit is minor but none the less annoying, is the flat rate at which points are accrued for staying at the Intercon. For some reason it has been determined that regardless of how much (and it is a lot) you spend on a stay (for a day or in my case 5 days) you simply get 2000 points. To put that in perspective - you need 25k to stay at a basic Holiday Inn property. So, my gripe is that in exchange for $2200+ for a few nights I got a bill slipped under my door. The other HI properties would have graciously deposited 22,000 points and then bonused it up another 11,000. This would have allowed a frequent traveler like me to either extend a vacation another day, have the in-laws stay comfortably \"over there\", etc. So, If you're not a point person or a frequent stayer - go here and enjoy. If you're a marketing person from Intercontinental surfing the web trying to figure out \"the voice of the customer\" read this review again and then match the dates and story with the emails I sent to the Customer Service team.

Picadilly Circus is a 30 minute walk and the closest convenient store about 15 minutes. Essentially most tourist sites requires a change on the tube so that was a bit annoying as well. I did ask some locals and it seems everything requires a connection.

Please don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let this initial part of the hotel put you off, after all it is only an entrance and without knocking half of the building down and starting again it would be very hard to make any major change here. The Priority Club check-in desk is to the left of the reception desks. The reception is immediately in front of you as you enter, to your right is the Theo Randlle Italian Restaurant which has received excellent reviews but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use on this occasion. To your left is the concierge and guest relations desks and in the far left is the main bar and another brassiere style restaurant. We approached reception and were immediately welcomed by a member of staff. Prior to our arrival at the hotel we were emailed a questionnaire asking all about our trip, any extras that we may require, magazines, butler, flowers, restaurant reservations etc. This I thought was very good. The member of staff informed us that we had been upgraded from the 1 Bedroom Suite that we had booked to a 1 Bedroom Luxury Suite. We were given our key cards, a quick explanation that we could use the Club Intercontinental Lounge on the 7th floor and shown to the lifts. We weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accompanied to our suite and no assistance was given with luggage however we did only have two small overnight bags so it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really needed. We arrived at our suite (room 410) on the 4th floor, the electronic key card to open the door worked first time (quite a challenge for some hotels I assure you!). On entering the suite there is a small hallway with a guest bathroom (toilet and vanity washbasin together with a large bottle of Elemis Hand wash and Elemis Moisturiser), small round table with a box of tissues. Opposite the guest bathroom is a full length mirror and an area for baggage, etc. Further into the suite is a dining table for four persons, on the table was a welcome card from the hotel manager, a box of Duchy of Cornwall biscuits, a small bowl of fruit and a 750ml bottle of English still water. Next to the dining table was a desk with the normal internet connections, multi line phone etc; in the drawer was a WIFI repeater to ensure a good internet connection. The dining area leads onto the main part of the living room consisting of a nice comfy sofa, two arm chairs and a floor lamp together with a coffee table and two side tables. These are positioned around a very nice wood panelled wall unit with a built in 32\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bang & Olufsen LCD TV, a separate Bose Wave Sound System and Bang & Olufsen DVD Player. The TV has various languages; English, Czech, Danish, German, Russian, Estonian, Spanish, French, Greek, Italian, Dutch, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Finish, Swedish and Turkish. The TV has the following channels: BBC1, BBC2, ITV1, Channel 4, Channel 5, Sky News, CNN, BBC News Channel, BBC World, Bloomberg, CNBC, Al Jazeera International (English language), Sky Sports 1, Sky Sports 2, Sky Sports 3, Sky Sports News, Eurosport, Al Jazeera Sports 1 (Arabic), Al Jazeera Sports 2 (Arabic), Dubai Sports (Arabic), Quatar TV (Arabic), Saudi 1 (Arabic), Saudi 2 (Arabic), Dubai TV (Arabic), Abu Dhabi TV (Arabic), Al Arabiya (Arabic), Al Jazeera (Arabic), MBC, MBC 2, TV 5 (French), Das Erste, ARD (German), LBC (Arabic), Rotana Musica (Arabic), CBBC, C Beebies, Rai Uno (Italian), TVE International (Spanish), RTP International (Portuguese), ERT Sat (Greek), RTR Planeta (Russian), TRT International (Turkish), JSTV (Japanese), CCTV 9 (Chinese), PCNE (Japanese). Internet can also be accessed through the TV using the wireless keyboard at a charge of \u00c2\u00a327 for a 24 period for unlimited use of Movies on demand, Music on demand (separate to the Bose Wave sound system which is free) and internet through the TV. The coffee table in front of the sofa had the selection of magazines we had requested on the pre stay questionnaire plus a couple of extra ones, all current issues. The view from the living room window was amazing; we looked directly down onto Wellington Arch, The New Zealand War Memorial and Hyde Park Corner. The living room has a nice thick double door (walnut wood) leading through to the bedroom. The bedroom has a large King Sized bed, attractively decorated with many large pillows. The sheets were of excellent quality, the bed had down comforters and were very comfortable. The bedroom also had its own Bang & Olufsen LCD TV again built into a wooded wall unit. There was a large mirror hidden behind a little door in the wall unit and this could also be utilised as a dressing table. Next to the bed was a second Bose Wave Sound System which also acted as the bedside alarm clock and radio. The bedroom lighting was very good, two bedside lamps, over head reading lights and even a little night light next to the bathroom door built into the floor (can be turned off). The bedroom had the same view as the living room. There was also a good sized wardrobe, build in drawers, ironing board, a proper hairdryer, laptop safe, valet box with shoe shine bag (leave outside for complimentary shoe shine), laundry bag and shoe horn. There was another small area for luggage to be left. The bedroom leads onto the bathroom area. The bathroom had a large bath with a good ergonomic design which supported you whilst bathing, the bath had a build in handheld shower head should you wish to wash your hair whilst in the bath. There was a double vanity unit, a separate shower cubicle with rain head shower, a toilet and bidet. There were copious amounts of Elemis Toiletries, body wash, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and soap. These were all in 100ml bottles and we had 3 of each type. There was a good amount of towels, large bath sheets, floor mats and two large robes. Once we had unpacked we headed up to the Club Lounge on the 7th Floor. Club Lounge access is free for all guests residing in a suite. For non suite guests there is an additional charge which is listed on their website. The lounge has its own reception desk leading into a hallway with male and female toilets (again Elemis Toiletries) and a separate shower room for those arriving early when the room isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready. As you turn left you enter the main part of the Club Lounge, the ceiling rises and you are greeted with an excellent view of Wellington Arch and Hyde Park Corner from the large floor to ceiling windows that run the entire length of the room. There are different seating areas including sofas, more formal dining tables and individual stools against a runner like in a coffee shop. The Lounge has three computers (two windows laptops and one apple notebook) with complimentary internet access. There are two large plasma screen TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s with sofas facing them at opposite ends of the lounge, these were showing Sky News on our arrival but they could be changed if you ask the staff. At the far end of the lounge is a library area with a good selection of magazines and travel books together with national and international newspapers. In the centre of the lounge is a raised area with the complimentary buffet. Coffee and Tea (loose leaf and many varieties) are available all day either by self service or by asking a member of staff. There are also fridges with very nice fresh fruit juice, water and other soft drinks. You could ask for other drinks from the staff. A selection of nibbles, crisps, nuts and rice crackers were always available. There was also a selection of small cakes and biscuits available next to the coffee. A lunch a selection of sandwiches with various different fillings are put out and regularly replenished together with a good selection of cakes. At 1500hrs afternoon tea is served with a help yourself selection of sandwiches, cakes, tea cakes, scones, James and cream. Tea and coffee can be made by a member of staff if asked. All were very nice and you could help yourself to Complimentary champagne. At 1800hrs an evening selection of nibbles, olives, crisps together with a full bar (help yourself again!) and hot canap\u00c3\u00a9s such as tempura prawns, chicken satay and even club sandwiches were served, together with a selection of cheeses with biscuits and cakes. There was enough to fill you up if you weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t particularly hungry. After afternoon tea we went back to our suite to find a member of staff had delivered two glasses of ice cold champagne, a bowel of fresh strawberries and a lovely chocolate birthday cake for my partner. There was another bowel of fruit and more water together with a small birthday card from the hotel staff. We only had one very small problem with the room and that was the overnight pack supplied in the bathroom with razor and toothbrush inside had been opened by the previous guest and then placed back on the shelf. Personally I blame the previous occupant for putting it back on the shelf and not disposing of it. We mentioned it to the Club Lounge host and asked dif we could have a new one. When we returned that evening not only was the overnight kit replaced but there was a written apology from the Housekeeping Manager and a box and very nice chocolate truffles. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect this at all and it was a very nice gesture. I just hope the member of staff didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get into trouble. We had an excellent night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep, no noise at all despite being at Hyde Park Corner. Breakfast the next morning was served in the Club Lounge. A nice selection of fresh fruit and fresh pastries was served together with the normal continental selection of meats and a good cheese selection. You could also order hot food with the lounge host, my partner tells me the poached eggs were the best he has ever had served with bacon and tomatoes and a round of toast. There are no breakfast menus around, so ask for any cooked selection. The lounge staff were very friendly and helpful, we were allowed a late checkout at 4pm and we were then offered the use of the Club Lounge for as long as we needed as our train was departing late. Overall an excellent hotel, good position, good service and good value for money compared to other London hotels.

When we first walked in, the decor and atmosphere were lovely and tranquil but there didn't appear to be a specific reception desk so there was some initial confusion because the gentleman/doorman who greeted us didn't seem to know what we were talking about. Nevertheless, we got over this initial hiccup and we shown to the Palm Court, which is just a wonderful example of Art Deco with a fantastic high, arched glass ceiling and other features. We were shown to our seats, right next to the harpest, and sank into huge, soft sofas amid dimmed lights and an airy atmosphere. The service was impeccable; attentive without hassling us, friendly without being overbearing and we felt like queens. We opted for the Art Deco Afternoon Tea, which included a glass of champagne. The whole experience of afternoon tea here was wonderful with a list of different teas as long as your arm, dainty finger sandwiches, a variety of scones and preserves and patisserie that are almost too pretty to eat. At approximately \u00c2\u00a345 per head, you might think that it's not worth it for afternoon tea but we were given second helpings of sandwiches and stayed for about fours hours!

It was an added encouragement that at the time I worked for the company so got a hefty discount - which I know I was really lucky to get - but even so, I think I would have paid full price for how great it was! Location: right on Hyde Park corner. Overlooking both parks. On the road that leads to Piccadilly Circus, but due to the triple strength windows, you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even hear a car horn. Great for getting to the West End and for the shops or Kensington. With my BF being a Geordie, he had never been to London, so this hotel was great for showing him all sides of it. Hotel: Was very luxurious in the foyer area and the doormen, everyday, were so polite and was rushing to help you whether you were dripping in Armani or not. They offered us umbrellas in the Awful (!) weather that we experienced there too. I think we were upgraded on check in but if we was we wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t told, it is only my assumption. The room was spotless! Absolutely perfect. Massive TV and HUGE bed! Bathroom was amazingly clean with a bath and power shower. Some nice touches in the room that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get everywhere, bathrobes, toiletries, tissues. There was also a really comfy lazy chair and desk Housekeeping was very polite. All the staff seemed smiley and friends - if any department was the least friendly, it was reception! This was a surprise! On my boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actual birthday, we returned to our room to find a chocolate cake with a happy birthday message on there, especially from the hotel. Concierge looked after us really well. Any question- they had the answer - very professional. They even organised us on the guest list for a club, and next morning when they saw us, asked how it was! Was really lovely they remembered us! Price for alcohol and mini bar was sky high, but then it is 5*, it is London, but even in my estimation, \u00c2\u00a320.00 for two shots of Vodka and 1 can of coke is steep! Out of it all, the only thing I disliked was most the other guests staying there. For instance, we left on the day that there was a huge parade for St Patricks Day and one guy, who thought just cause he was wearing shorts and sunglasses (in the awful pouring rain might I add!), could shout to high heaven at all the staff he could see that it was going to take him an hour longer to get to the airport for his flight due to the parade, and that they should have made more effort to make him aware! If you can stomach people like that, who look at anybody in last season\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fashion with their noses turned up, then please go to the Interconty. My boyfriend and I had the most wonderful weekend, despite the rain, and it was made even more special by the way we were treated and looked after by the fabulous staff there.

The location near Hyde Park suited our travel plans, especially as it bucketed down with rain most of the time we were there, so the closeness to the tube was helpful. I'd booked online with Octopus Travel and became concerned at check-in (at around 5.30) as it was looking like they had no rooms. I mentioned we were going to see a show, and the receptionist said 'So you'll need somewhere to get changed then - I'll talk to our room allocator (not her words, but I can't remember the term she used!) to see if we can find you a room'. A room was eventually forthcoming, which was fine - clean, tidy and with all the amenities we expected, however we were near the lift lobby, and one of the lifts was squeaking, creaking and groaning all night when in use - when the hotel were advised of this on check-out, they simply said 'Thank you so much for letting us know' - not even an apology! Breakfast was included in our rate, and the food was very good, almost everything you could think of was available - but the service left much to be desired. We had to ask for tea, coffee and toast on several occasions, and no dishes were cleared from the table despite them piling up on one side, so much so that the waiter bringing milk (which hadn't been brought with the tea) struggled to find space for it, yet still ignored the pile of dishes! Overall a nice hotel, but the service needs improving....", "Date": "December 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hertfordshire, UK", "Title": "\u201cLondon Luxury\u201d", "Author": "Tamk20", "ReviewID": "UR11912926", "Content": "This hotel situated right by Hyde Park is a great place to stay (especially this time of year with Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park!!) The location is great and the hotel itself is well...what you would expect for a five star! Some may say rooms are small. I beg to differ, they were actually a great size, as this is London and space it at a prime. I was more than satisfied by the space.The Staff were not snooty as they are in most hotel of this calibre and they were ready to help with absolutely anything at all. The breakfast is AMAZING!!!!! Go for the Full shebang and get the full English which included continental. It gets delivered to your room on a table (pulls out to full size!!!) with Italian Linen and enough food to keep you going for a long While!!!!! And so prompt I ordered for 9 and at 9 they knocked on the door! Impressed!Bathroom was good with Elemis products, smallish but as I said...Its London. Lovely massive tub!

Its location is key, and the recent refurb was well done. We used Kayak and had a great rate for the area (but certainly not cheap), and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d definitely stay there again. A pleasant surprise was Theo Randall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant downstairs. We hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planned on dining there and were lucky to find a seat on a nearly fully booked Saturday night, but were very happy with our meal. The meal was pricey (160 quid\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 about $360 US), but it showed up a celebrity chef\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Knightsbridge restaurant. While this may have been a few menu choices, I was impressed overall. A negative to the hotel was the incredible price of room service and anything above an beyond our discounted room rate. While I know this is Mayfair, I had cheaper drinks at Nobu (9 drinks for 85 quid) on Berkeley Street than I did in our own room. We only ordered room service once because the prices were just too much to justify for the luxury of staying in. Pros: Location, Theo Randall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Service was impeccable. Negative: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mayfair, but wow\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 $35 US for a small Pizza?", "Date": "December 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Haywards Heath, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood location and very stylish...\u201d", "Author": "Xoan", "ReviewID": "UR10815258", "Content": "This hotel is very stylish and eveything looks brand spanking new following the recent renovation. It's a shame this hotel is in such a monstrosity of a building -- other ***** hotels definetely have a more romantic feell to them as you walk into the lobby. Quality of service was excellent. The hotel is located in a pretty good position with Picadilly, Mayfair and Oxford Street all within walking distance. It's just a shame about all the homeless people in the Hyde Park corner subway which you should probably avoid at night, if only for the smell (I suppose it helps you to keep it real as you're walking back to your luxury room). TIPS: 1) Instead of going to the bar in this hotel go to the top floor bar at the Park Lane hilton next door for what is one of the best views in London and very good cocktails too. 2) Request a exterior room-- we were stuck with a room on the inside of the building and had non-existent views other than the activities of other guests!", "Date": "November 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLoved the hotel!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR7926133", "Content": "Had I known how great this hotel was beforehand, I would have stayed here my entire stay in London instead of changing hotels.
