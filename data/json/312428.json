Differently, the bathroom was spacious and recently renovated. Second, if you like a comfortable bed do not stay there: the mattress of my bed was so hard that had I slept on the floor it would have been the same.

It's a nice neighborhood with upscale shopping and some decent restaurants. Located an easy walk to retiro park, but you will need to metro or cab to any other tourist sites.

The lounge did not have an externally facing window, so I doubt it could ever be sold as a full-price suite! Breakfast was very good, but traditional spanish - so lots of fruit and cold meats, but the cooked breakfast did not look great.

No muesli, cornflakes etc etc. I was there for a business meeting and the buffet lunch was really excellent. Much better than anything you get in typical UK hotels! The barman was surly, bordering on rude and clearly needs to find himself another job.

There were very few other diners perhaps because it was a Sunday night but would definitely recommend the restaurant. They don't serve food until 9pm.

Not only is there no iron in your room, but the hotel does not have one at all, making business appropriate dressing difficult. Also, the hallways are not carpeted and are therefore quite loud. Since tourists keep late hours in Madrid, it is again not ideal for business travel. Finally, I was very disappointed in the room cleaning as dirty items such as drinking glasses were never replaced. In fact, it looked like items such as stationery and menus had been there as long as the hotel as they were quite yellow.
