I've stayed at the YWCA in the \"hotel\" rooms with private bath on the seventh floor, and with student groups on the sixth floor. Payment is usually due at check-in. On the sixth floor, there is a large, clean shared kitchen area with multiple tables, a small internet room, and lots of reasonably-priced parking lots nearby. There can be a bit of noise late from other hotel guests at night, due to the group-rooms nature of the Auberge de jeunesse, but the walls and windows are well-insulated from the street and clubs nearby. There is a cafe on the first floor of the YWCA (open mornings).", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel in a central location\u201d", "Author": "Malcolm_111", "ReviewID": "UR121812768", "Content": "The hotel is very good considering its priced and advertised as a hostel-clean and comfortable beds in relatively large rooms, serviced daily with cable television as well. Showers and toilets are shared but clean, was very quiet when I visited (Dec 2011). There is no breakfast included though there is a restaurant attached (Cafe Imagination), I only had breakfast there once, found their portions to be a bit small, it may be best to go to one of the food courts in the underground city where I found you get better value. Very close to the main shopping district on Ste-Catherine Street with access from there to the Underground City at Centre Eaton. The nearest metro station to the hotel is Lucien L'Allier on the Orange Line...its about a 3 minute walk away from the hotel. Free wifi is also a plus.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cA Decent Place To Stay\u201d", "Author": "Big80s", "ReviewID": "UR120681441", "Content": "I stayed here for 2 nights in November 2011.

Parking is not included, but there are 2 parking lots on Crescent Street that charge $20/day (this is typical for anywhere in Montreal). The location is great -- just 1 block from St. Catherine St., and an easy walk. I also found the front desk staff to be very friendly and helpful.

We stayed in a room with a double bed and washroom facilities in the room, which was perfect for our needs. The other two times that I have been here, I stayed in a room with 2 double beds and a washroom. If you are looking for a place to sleep at night that is clean and safe then this hotel has it. The rooms are pretty small, which didn't bother us because we were out the whole day and didn't spend much time in the hotel. There is a small flat screen tv (no DVD player), a dresser, mini fridge, and coffee maker (no coffee provided). The bathroom was clean and pretty spacious - much bigger than other hotel bathrooms that I've stayed in. The reception staff is also kind and helpful. The only con I would say about this hotel is that there is no parking available. You have to park across the street at the Bell Centre or beside the hotel on Crescent street (which wasn't too inconvenient except for our deficiency in communicating with the French parking operators). Also, don't eat at the hotel restaurant. The food is not good. Other than that, the next time I visit Montreal, I will definitely stay here again. I've stayed in 2 other hotels in the city and the rooms are almost comparable but with a pretty big price difference. If you don't need much space and don't plan on spending a lot of time in the hotel room, then I would recommend this hotel.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Experience\u201d", "Author": "BBiermans", "ReviewID": "UR46570591", "Content": "Clean and Cheap!!

(They run a hostel too). It's got a great location for visiting Downtown Montreal, and even Vieux Montreal, if you don't mind the walk (almost 30 min, but lots of sights). You can walk to a variety of different restaurants at night. The rooms are clean and basic, and service is good. There is a restaurant in the lobby (breakfast is not included). The rates are fantastic for a big city--and the proceeds support YWCA programs, so that is a nice bonus. It's a quiet hotel and they have lots of tourist information and can help with anything you ask. The restaurant for breakfast is okay. Oh, if you stay out past 11, they lock the doors and you have to ring a bell to get in, FYI. Great stay on a budget, in the heart of the city.", "Date": "August 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood value\u201d", "Author": "jjt79", "ReviewID": "UR20424487", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel in Montreal for one night. We had one of the cheap rooms with shared bathroom. The room was clean with a TV and air conditioning. It was comfortable but not attractive. We were happy with the room for the price. The one real problem is with the bathroom and shower facilities. There's no problem with this as far as the ladies are concerned, but for men things are much more grim. The men's bathroom is dark and dirty, and you should be prepared to wait for your turn almost every time you visit. The shower room is a little better, but it too gets messy quickly. Here's my top tip: if you get fed up with waiting for the bathroom (and, eventually, you will), there's another one on the ground floor. It's the only additional one I could find. Or even better: pay a little more and go for a room with a private bathroom! Or even better than that: forget about staying in a hotel and book into one of the many good B&Bs in Montreal for the same price!", "Date": "September 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "BC", "Title": "\u201cExceeds my expectation\u201d", "Author": "Duncow", "ReviewID": "UR7573443", "Content": "I stayed a couple of days in Hilton, Quebec City for business prior to traveling to Montreal.
