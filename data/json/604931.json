Buy tickets from the concierge. Despite what you may think from the map, the train station is not within walking distance (defined as less than 1.5 miles), because you can't cross the tracks.

There were however a lot things that I did not like. The bed was really hard, luckily I had a double bed for myself, so I put the 2 mattresses on top of each other. Part of the staff was really friendly, but part was not.I had called to the hotel before how I could reach them, they told me to take a cab. When I came to the hotel I saw they also had a shuttle service, they had not told me about this... On the last night of my stay I came home late and my room had not been cleaned. I went down to reception, they said that I must have done something wrong (hanging the no disturb sign on my door). I told them I had not and that surprisingly I had 2 signs, hanging both on the inside and outside of my door. Something I could not have done. They stuck to the fact that I made a mistake, I did not get an apology and after much ado the only thing they offered was to clean my room, but than I had to wait before being able to sleep. Bad service! Luckily there also were some nice people at reception that should be mentioned. At check in they were really helpful and friendly! The breakfast was good, with croissants and everything. The dinner in the hotel however is an insult to Italian cuisine, my lasagna was microwaved. As more people have indicated the hotel is far out of the centre. You can take the hotel shuttle of 12 euro per ride (thus 24 for a return ride and only on set times), taking a cab will not be cheaper. The bus that goes past the hotel goes every 45 minutes (the hotel does not know the times). The train is doable and only 1 euro per ride, but to get there you have to walk on a road without sidewalk, where the cars drive really fast and where it is not safe in the evenings (I tried, it was really scary!). Thus if you look for a hotel for a city trip I do not recommend this. I had a business trip so I only went into the city twice. As a business hotel this is basic but fine.

The location is the biggest downer. You really need a car. Getting to the local train can be treacherous. There's no sidewalk. I didn't try it. However, I did the 10-15 minute walk to my conference at the Marriott up the hill. I as well as other conference attendees staying at the Ibis were startled by a few wild dogs you would pass on the walk to the Marriott. This was unnerving, but no incidents were reported. At first I was scared and later I just felt sorry for these abandoned dogs. Some folks would take a cab, but I continued to do the walk anyway. I was always cautious and very alert.

However, it is not really near the airport. It is 1km from the train station at Muratella which served every 15mins by trains from the airport (journey time 10 mins). If you come from Rome centre the trains are from Ostiense (not Termini) so from Termini you have to change at Ostiense - but the fare is only .90c! The road from Muratella station to the hotel is busy and has no footpath - a 15min walk that is not recommended - especially at night. There is a bus (No23 I think) but you need to have bought a Rome bus ticket in advance - you cannot pay on the bus. If you call the hotel they will send a taxi for you - but this could take some time as taxis will not want such a short trip. So, how else can reach the hotel? There is a shuttle from the airport (12\u20ac) which has an infrequent time table - for example between 8am and 11am there are 4 shuttles from the airport and only 2 shuttles to the airport. A taxi from the airport is probably the best option but agree a fare before departing - it should be around 25-30\u20ac - try not to get ripped off - only 50% of Rome taxi drivers are honest (statistic based on 10 years experience). As for the hotel, its a standard Ibis, quite clean and the usual good Accor service. Restaurant is nothing special - it closes at 10.30pm but get there before 10pm if you want to have the full menu choice. Rooms are clean and very quiet and the parking looks safe (big gates).

The road has very little or no room at all for pedestrians (it wasn't meant to be a road to walk along) and it's full of dirt.
