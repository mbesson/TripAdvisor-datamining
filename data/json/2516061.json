I wish they would assign parking spaces so you could rest easy knowing there will a slot open late at night if you drive around. We chose this Hotel because of price, free parking, and it's close to the Metro Subway station. It's only a half block or a few minutes walk away to the corner. (Hollywood and Western) The Metro takes you directly to the Hollywood Blvd, Highland area, and Universal Studios where you can take a free Tram to Universal saving on Parking fees. Also on the corner are a Ross, Ralphs grocery store, A Walgreens and some fast food options. At first glance it might look like a sketchy neighborhood. but it really isn't bad at all.

This is the place for you. But if customer service and cleanliness are important, then DO NOT stay here. We stayed one night here before moving on to a much better place at The Orlando in West Hollywwod. Best decision we ever made. Sometimes, you get what you pay for. Here are the problems that we had with this place: 1. We found strands of long hair and stains on the bed sheet when we pulled back the linens to check for bedbugs. There were also strands of hair within some of the folded towels. 2. They use copious amounts of air freshener to give the illusion that everything is clean and fresh. If you are sensitive to scents, this will be a problem. 3. When I asked for a hairdryer for the room (which is supposed to be part of the amenities), the individual at the front desk insisted that there was one even though I kept telling him that there wasn't one. Finally, he said that he would get me one as I wanted to wash my hair and go to bed as it was beyond midnight. He didn't show up for the longest time, and when I called to inquire, he was rude and said that he had already told me that he would get me one. They must be rolling in business if they think that it's ok to talk to a customer that way and think that it is acceptable. Finally, a hairdryer arrives, but then he insisted on coming into my room to \"check\" that it worked. Creepy. 4. They demand that you give them your driver's license at check in and they make a photocopy of it. I wasn't thrilled about this as I had already had my identity stolen once and credit cards and cell phones accounts opened in my name. It was a pain to sort it all out. At check out, I asked for the photocopy back and was told that I wasn't allowed to have it. I then asked that I be allowed to at least black out my DOB and was told that I wasn't allowed, either. \"Tito\"-if that is his real name, was absolutely rude and a complete liar. I explained my concerns to him, and not only was he totally dismissive, he lied and claimed that all hotels photocopy their customer's licenses and keep them all on file. He couldn't tell me what their rationale is for keeping these photocopies, and he couldn't tell me how they dispose of them. He kept insisting that no one else has problems with this, and to prove the point, he showed me other people's photocopied licenses. Great job keeping people's information secure, Tito!

The breakfast is not a continental breakfast, its just a take-out buffet, with two coffee makers, some donuts and a little fridge with one gallon bottle of juice and another of milk. There is no room to stand there, neither any chairs, just one that is fitted to be used with the computer. Wi fi works fine, slow but steady. The walls are thin, so you can hear other guests. The area is almost ok, but I advise you that by night it is not the best place to hang around. Too many homeless and addicts. There was a quite angry russian couple that realized there that the hotel had no cribs at all. So if you are going with your baby, take that in account. The bathroom had a dirty door that was never cleaned, there is a chest of drawers with all of them broken. The soap and paper is really cheap, and almost useless. When we arrived at the hotel it was 1.49, just 10 minutes away from our check in time. We waited for our room for a while, and at 2.20 I went to see what was delaying us. The housekeepers where having lunch at one of the tables near the pool. The rooms where open, with carts in the outside, but we had to wait until 2.45 to get the room. I think they could improve a little about the lunch time issue. Pros: Somewhat cheap. Close to Ralphs, Walgreens, gas. Free parking. Wi-fi.

They did have a PC with internet and a printer for a charge though for maps and things. Wasn't the hotel that bothered me so much though, it was the area at night. I was aware there were prostitutes staying in my hotel because of the late night noises. There were homeless people near by with shopping carts (they were harmless but it wasnt the nicest thing to have to look at, makes you feel bad if you cant afford to give them food) and on our first night we were off to the local supermarket and we got stopped around 3 times by people asking us for food. We were 18 at the time and kinda terrified. On our first day we also seen two arrests and the local cab driver even asked us why we would choose this area to stay in. One night we were followed to the local Denny's by a car (beware females who dress nicely, in LA people tend to shout out their cars at you alot in the not so nice areas) so we didn't feel safe. Saying that, nowhere seems safe in Hollywood.

We woke up during this on the first night and thought we were in the middle of an earthquake!! There wasn't enough pillows in the room so we went downstairs and asked the (different this time) receptionist for some more. He started quizzing us about how many pillows we had! He then said he couldn't help us as the housekeeping had gone home. We told him that it wasn't our problem and that we needed another pillow. He said that guests take the pillows home with them which is why there was a shortage!!! He eventually got us another pillow after we went downstairs and asked him again. I also wanted to use the phone and was told that I had to pay a $10 deposit even though they had my card details. He then said that if I called outside the immediate area, they would count that as an international call, ith a $5 minimum charge so I said not to bother!!! The pool area was nice and clean although there were only four sunloungers. Everyday, the owners/cleaners, who have an apartment next to the pool, would use two of the sun loungers to dry their washing on which was annoying. The washing would be on them all day.

(There were only 2 pillows per double bed, so we didn't have any extra.) The complimentary breakfast of milk, orange juice, coffee, donuts and frosted flakes was a simple and informal, but nice way to start the day. The pool area is very nice and clean and surrounded by beautiful rose bushes. The free WiFi was nice too, although the connection was rather flaky. If we moved locations in the room, the connection would be lost. The hotel is in a seedier area of Hollywood, as others have mentioned, but we felt safe the entire time we were there.

Not a bad base of operations, but I wouldn't call it a \"nice\" place to stay. Acceptable enough, for $68 a night, king bed. The price is hard to beat. We had two rooms. There were no problems with our friend's room, but our \"non-smoking\" room smelled of smoke and strong cleaner/chemical smell. The rooms seemed pretty clean but after settling in we noticed a big patch of mold behind the bathroom door, between the door frame & tub. Gross! Also several guests had small children who were running around yelling at the crack of dawn, which didn't jibe with our previous late-nite tour of classic Hollywood dive bars... The location is ok, about a mile from Hollywood & Vine, another half mile or so to Grumman's Chinese Theatre. A pretty long walk, but if you like to walk, its kinda cool to tramp up and down the \"Walk of Fame\". A cab ride each way will cost about $6-9 w/tip. The immediate neighborhood is a bit rough, you are in the east part of Hollywood, in Thai Town/Little Armenia. There was an Armenian (mob-related?) murder in the area the night we stayed there. Not recommended to single women, unless you are street smart. However, the place itself seems safe. You could bring a family here. I wasn't too concerned to leave my laptop in the room. Free WiFi was a plus, too. And, some good low-budget restaurants in the area- Thai, Mexican. This place was described as \"charmingly seedy\" on Yelp, and that's not far off the mark. They make an effort to keep the place nice. it's not bad, but if you're used to the Hilton or Marriott, you won't be happy here. Not sure how they got such a high rating on Tripadvisor. I wouldn't object to staying here again, but I'd check into other options first - someplace a bit closer to the main part of hollywood, or maybe just a little nicer. TIPS- go up to Grifith Obsevatory. An icon! It's close by, awesome veiw of the city, Hollywood sign, etc. And all free, except for the main planetarium theater, which we skipped, but is supposed to be well worth it.

Bathroom and main room are a little dingy and dusty, so if you're expecting super clean don't come here. Windows don't open so if you're caustrophobic and like to sleep with a window open at night, forget it. The blinds are also a litte gappy so light does come in at night. Room is a bit dark and gloomy due to poor lighting lamps. Fridge is noisy and had to be turned off at night. Other than these disadvantages, unless I found a better deal for the price I would stay here again. The staff aren't overly friendly although the older dude did make a bit of an effort. The free donuts, coffee, cereal and juice for breakfast is awesome. It's very informal but it's nice to come down in the morning for a quick start up before leaving for the day. Free computer/internet use is also cool. The location is great - if you're the person who enjoys walking everywhere, think otherwise because it's about 30mins away to the Kodak Theatre, but the good thing is that the subway is about 2 mins walk away from the hotel.

Room 307 was in the adjacent building next to the lobby, and I did think it a bit weird when we were pulling our luggage through that building when we saw people sleeping in the downstairs rooms with the doors open. I believe this hotel also had people living there full time. Room 307 was clean and comfortable, but there was a huge light outside of the room and our room was illuminated all night long. I asked to be switched the next day and we were given room 205 at the top of the stairs overlooking the little pool. Room 205 was huge and had a big vanity (something everyone needs traveling with 2 teenage girls). Hotel was a little Diamond in the Rough. Nice hotel, but the surrounding area was a gritty, working class LA neighborhood. I never felt unsafe, but I do not think I would walk around at night by myself. The hotel owner was always helpful and I enjoyed talking to him. What I liked: 1. Hotel was clean and safe, big rooms for not that much money. 2. Continental Breakfast each morning 3. Computer for hotel guests. 4. Subway 1 block to the left so you can go to the Hollywood walk of fame and gawk. 5. Wahlgreens and CVS 1 block to the right if you need any personal items. 6. Parking is FREE! 7. Pool if you want to relax. All in all, my experience at this little hotel was fine and for the money, you can not beat it. Hotel owner was trying very hard to make it a comfortable place. Little things around the hotel need to be fixed, but they are trying.

We also caught a cab to the Viper Room and Rainbow Bar and it cost about $20 one way. I caught a bus to the Getty one day which is relatively easy to do (2 connections - 40 minutes) and my wife caught a bus to the Market. My wife did the dearly departed tour and highly recommends it. The area is fine although it is a big city and like ALL big cities, I would not recommend walking too far at night time if you dont know the area, we found it fine although can't say we walked too much at night time because we were tired from day time activities.

All the trip advisor reports on LA say you need a car to get about, but we opted to make use of public transport (the underground system and buses) which we found excellent value and operated a frequent service. A day ticket is the best value. It takes about 30 mins to walk to the Hollywood sights (Hollywood&Highland Centre, Chinese Theatre) from Hollywood City Inn but quicker to get the underground which goes from just up the street from the Inn, 200 metres away. Eating out in the evenings within walking distance from the Inn was a mini-problem.

We got the bus to Santa Monica Beach (excellent breakfast at Jinky's cafe), hired bikes and rode from Santa Monica to Venice Beach, which was great fun. Also took the underground to Long Beach and to Downtown (El Pueblo worth a look, also Grand Central Market and the Walt Disney Concert Hall) The Farmers Market and The Grove great for shopping. Hollywood City Inn was a good base in a city where everything is so vast and spread out that it would be hard to pick one best location.

We were moved to the main building (as before we had a room in a stand-alone building). Here the room was even nicer and during the rest of our stay - in total 5 days - there were no more roaches. There was a pool, however it was a bit dirty and no one was using it - probably in the mid of September season was already closed. But overall, it was OK. Breakfast (fresh donuts, coffee, milk) was fine and enough to start a day - there is plenty of places around in Hollywood to eat whatever you want. We had complimentary wireless internet connection and a parking spot. Be aware that the parking was usually full, however we never had to park outside. A big plus is a proximity to subway station ( less than 5min walking) as well as to Hollywood center (less than 5min driving, 20min walking). All in all, the time there was OK. We mainly slept there only. If you are looking for nice shiny 3* hotel with full breakfast this is certainly not the one, but it is good value for money and it's clean and nice enough.

Hollywood City Inn has a very nice swimming pool and is fantastic for having breakfast next to it. Location wise, very convenient, only 1 block away from Hollywood Western station.

Hotel room is very clean, there's airconditioning, TV, fridge & hair dryer in the room. Free wireless internet in the room as well as lobby, speed was good. The best part is the free breakfast, we loved our donuts, juice & cereal. There's coffee as well. We visited Universal Studio, only 3 stations away, very close. Remember to use the left exit of the station for shuttle bus (you need to cross the road as well), we went out the wrong exit, took us a while to find the shuttle to universal studio. We had 2 day pass for the price of 1 deal, only got 2 rides, but all the shows are fantastic, you'll need 2 days to finish all the shows if you don't wanna rush it. No need to buy the all you can eat pass, as the meal size is pretty big. We had burger for the first day & chinese for the second day's lunch. Hollywood itself was not very impressive, not much to do, recommend to book a movie star tour with starline, the old tour guide was very funny. Hotel staff was very helpful when we check-in, we got a map & direction. The guy on the night shift was very helpful too and booked shuttle bus for us when we left. We got ripped off by the taxi driver from airport to the hotel, cost us $79, if you book shuttle bus, will only cost $16 per person. Security wise, we didn't go out after 7pm since we don't have a car. Hotel security is pretty good, 2 locks on the door, bars on windows, very bright outdoor light, we feel quite safe staying there. In the station, there are some suspicious people hanging around, but we only catch train during the day, and to popular areas (hollywood highland & universal city), so didn't have any problems.

If you leave them alone they will leave you alone....... Sub-Way just a few hundred metres away taking you to Universal Studios (3 stops) Walk of fame (2 stops) , and at $5 for a day pass is considerably cheaper than paying a company to take you. Room had fridge / Air Condition , but no Kettle etc. As this room was only a place to sleep we were more than happy with our accomodation. We didnt find the owners friendly and it appeared our questions were a chore to them (Even at check-in) As we were there 4 days we only encountered them a few times so this didnt cause much aggro. For the price Yes stay there , and use money you save on yourself in LA. Our savings went towards \"front of the Queue pass\" at universal (something I recommend...but thats another story) Pool was clean and spent some hours in it. Recommend the diner (turn left at subway , 100 yards) for your breakfasts. Caters for the locals and not ramped up prices. For Dinner at Sizzlers just another 300 yards further down the road in Thai town. 25 walk (uphill) to griffiths observatory. Downsides : On check out I asked to leave my bags in storage and women wanted to charge me $20 for 3 bags. After questioning this it immediately dropped to $15. Not sure why the charges as the bags dont eat anything. Thats anyother minor issue if you like inhouse breakfasts - This is only only donuts , and Coffee if you could ever find the pot with coffee in it.

When we got there we were given a room in their 2nd newer building which is a little further from the office. They immediately change our room upon our request. The breakfast was cereal, coffee and pastries. The Metro is only 1 block north. That would probably be a great way to travel as long as you arrived back before dark-I wouldn't want to walk even that 1 block after dark. We went to see \"Wicked\" and arrived back at 11:30.

Perhaps they have some way of parking your car off site for you if this happens-it doesn't seem there are enough parking spaces if they are booked to capacity. The best things about this motel are the price, cleanliness, staff, beautiful roses around the pool and accessabilty of areas of interest and easy highway access. Early morning walks: both days I grabbed a Starbucks cappucino and went for a walk. I went south toward Sunset Blvd. I went about 0.5 miles. The further I went, the seedier it got with homeless and tagging etc. However, I went North on Western Ave and found the beautiful neighborhood of Los Feliz and enjoyed looking at the homes and gardens. As I further ventured north I found Griffith Park and walked in there. It was beautiful. It was hard to believe that in less than a mile you go from a seedy run down area to a beautiful neighborhood and park setting. So all in all, for the price, I probably would stay there again.

This is my first time using Hotels.com, and I feel a little ripped-off. I know this was not a 5-star hotel, and we weren't looking for frills, but you should STILL get what you are paying for, based on advertising. I don't know what your system is for CHECKING or VERIFYING the accuracy of what is being advertised, but here are some suggestions for the Hollywood City Inn. Iron/Ironing board - not in every room as listed. Have to ask, and expect to wait. Ironing board is a small TABLE-TOP version. Great if you are ironing doll clothes. Couldn't find an iron immediately. Had to search several storage areas. Continental Breakfast does NOT include cereal. It doesn't really include BREAKFAST! They should just list: Coffee, donuts, and juice - MAYBE. Milk - if we feel like it today. Donuts and milk, if we have some left-over from yesterday, because we won't get more. We MIGHT have milk if we have some left over from the day before, but otherwise, tough luck. Same thing with the oily, sometimes day-old donuts. They didn't even have enough \"food\" to accommodate all their guests!!! If I see \"continental breakfast\" and make a decision to stay at a hotel BECAUSE of that - shouldn't I receive it??? Continental \"breakfast\" was disappointing. The images they put on the internet are FANTASTIC! They did a good job of promoting themselves. Unfortunately, people actually COME there, and see the T.R.U.T.H. They should really make the pictures more accurate. They really need to make the pictures \"actual size\" and not make the lobby, pool area, and rooms look larger than they are. Pool and pool area is very nice. Clean at all times. We had to ask for the clock radio, which they probably just pulled from ANOTHER room, and will just float it around, until they REALLY need to buy a couple more. They also need to use BLEACH when they wash the towels and bedding. The towels had been washed, but several had ugly stains that had never washed out. USE BLEACH FOR GOODNESS SAKES! THE TOWELS ARE WHITE!!!! We DID have a refrigerator in the room (didn't get super cold, but was usable). We DID have a working microwave in the room. We DID have a hair dryer, but never used it, so we don't know if it worked. The only thing that saves them is their location. The hotel is located a half a block from the subway, and on several bus routes. Just up the street are the hollywood hills and we saw a few movie stars around. 5 minutes by car is the \"movie star\" Scientology building, which anyone can visit. If you don't mind walking, you can walk 2 blocks north, and you are on Hollywood blvd. We took a leisurely morning walk on Hollywood Blvd, all the way to HIghland. To the south is Sunset. In both directions, you are surrounded by stores, which makes the location convenient.

So by the time we got there it was one in the morning. We called our roommates, but they had had a long day and did not wake up when we called, so my sister went to the front desk and asked the attendant for a key (we had proper documents and they were notified that we were coming) and he wouldn't give her a key because he said that he only has one key for every room. So, we just had to fend for ourselves. So by that time I had taken all of our luggage out and was waiting by the door to get in, but when my sister came out, she said he wouldn't give us a key so we just waited by the car and the door trying to wait for someone to come out of the doors to let us in. So we were just standing out there (two girls) in this part of town which looked dangerous with suspicious people walking around looking at us ( I wouldn't recommend walking in this area at night). We tried pulling on one of the doors of the entrance to the rooms, but it was locked. Then my sister went to the other entrance door and luckily it was opened and she went in and opened the other door where I was standing and we were able to get into the hallway were the rooms were located. So, we knocked on the door and our roommates were able to hear us and let us in, but they were half sleep. We were doing things the whole day and we were all extremely tired, so my sister and I went to sleep around 2am and were extremely tired. But by 3:30am, we heard a knock at our door. At first I thought it was next door or I had imagined it because we were all \"knocked out\" sleep. But the knocking kept occurring and I rose up and one of the other girls with us got out of bed and opened the door and immediately closed and locked it because she thought it was either me or my sister, but quickly realized that we were already there. Then this man started whispering \"let me in\", \"open the door\", and started making rhythmical knocks at the door. So my roommate yelled at him from behind the door to leave and he has the wrong room. Then it stopped and we all went back to sleep nervously. Then about 10 mins later, the knocking came back and he tried to open the door because I saw the door knob being turned and we all were very scared by now, so we called the front desk and the told the attendant what was happening and he said that he will take care of it. So we laid down again but the strange man kept talking and knocking at the door trying to open it for about 5+ minutes. We were so scared we didn't know what to do, but keep telling him to go away. But we were so tired we could think clearly like call the police. We weren't going to open the door and confront him so he could come inside our room, we didn't know if he was alone or not and it was just us girls; so we called the front desk again and my sister said \"please help us, the man is still at the door and is trying to come in!\" The attendant sounded annoyed and told her \"weren't you expecting him\" and of course she yelled \"of course not!! Why would we call you to help us, if we knew him!\", so the attendant said \"okay, I will take care of him, but don't call back. \" We were very annoyed by this and then my other roommate went to the door and said, \"if you don't leave, we will call the police!\" Then he stopped whispering and said \"Oh, sorry I thought this was Mike\" or something of that nature, but I am sure he had heard us clearly the first couple of times and then he left. But we were so scared, we didn't open the door to look if he was gone. That morning, we were still frighten to open the door to leave.

Sure, we didn't pay a fortune, and I WAS expecting a budget hotel, but I did expect a little better than what we got. Yes, it is generally clean, and has a nice pool - but that's about the best I can say about it. Parking can be a problem, and our rental car was damaged in the car park on two separate occasions (thank goodness we had complete insurance cover). The bed was appallingly hard and uncomfortable, there were cigarette burn holes in the bedspread (didn't bother me, but my wife wasn't impressed - especially in a non-smoking room!), and the two paper-thin pillows they gave us (for a king bed!) were woefully insufficient - and asking at the office only got us one more pillow, and even then under protest. My wife was sick when we arrived, and spent the whole first day in bed, so our room wasn't serviced - but we went out the next day and put the \"please service room\" sign out. When we returned that night, our room still had not been serviced. When I went to the office to complain and ask for clean towels, the manager tried to argue with me that we couldn't expect our room to be serviced if we had the Do Not Disturb sign out! When I protested that we hadn't, he argued that he could see the sign still out on our door (we'd put it out when we returned that night!) I certainly didn't appreciate that kind of argumentativeness from a hotel manager. Isn't the customer always supposed to be right? To top things off, we had the misfortune to be staying at the end of spring break, and for the first few days the hotel was populated by teenagers who appeared to be drunk most of the time, swimming fully clothed in the pool, and generally making a racket. On the second night, they all decided to have a party in the room next to ours, and were playing guitar and carrying on loudly until the early hours of the morning. My wife wasn't able to sleep, and tried to call the office to complain at 1 a.m., but got no response. It wasn't until almost 3 a.m. that she was able to raise someone in the office and have them shut the party down. We're not party-poopers by any means, but being unable to get a response from the office for two hours was totally unacceptable. We'd made an online booking for a week - when we discovered how hard the bed was, we wanted to check out right away, but a prominently displayed sign in the office had warned that there would be no refunds for early checkout. I'm not surprised they have that sign up - I expect they get the same reaction from a lot of people. Yes, I knew we weren't going to get the Ritz for the price we paid, and I suppose overall the price we paid was fair for what we got, but next time, I'll definitely be spending the extra few dollars to get somewhere more bearable.....and there were a great many other options in the area, so there's no need to put up with this place. If you're prepared for a no-frills hotel, then I'd suggest booking for only one night at first, until you see just what you're getting for your money. I reckon you could do a lot better.....", "Date": "April 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sweden", "Title": "\u201ccontinental breakfast??????\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3329077", "Content": "This hotel are not made for children,,it\u00b4s only coffee to drink for breakfast!!!!", "Date": "April 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cTotally Misrepresented\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2961863", "Content": "Ok so the pictures on the website show this cute quaint little hotel with nice soft beds and flowing curtains. That is the BIGGEST MISRESPRESENTATION IMAGINABLE. The hotel is generally clean (which is why I was able to deal with it for three nights). However, it doesn't have enough parking, the beds are slightly better than sleeping on the floor, and I think that the last time the place was updated was in the 80's. They didn't even have extra pillows. If you are looking for a super cheap place near Hollywood to crash for a night this is the place.
