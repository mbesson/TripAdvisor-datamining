Booked this hotel from the great reviews on tripadvisor and was not disappointed! We stayed in room 301, a double/twin attic room. On arrival the receptionist asked if we would like the beds separated as they'd made it up as a double (I hadn't specified in the booking a twin or double) so I was pleased with their hospitality. Room was beautiful and clean and the view was amazing. It was nice chilling on the roof top terrace watching the world go by. Really easy to get to, San Zaccaria vaporetto stop, 3 mins walk to San Marco piazza. Many places to eat nearby. If you're travelling on a budget, we bought a 3 day Actv plus return airport transfer bus online (3 days unlimited travel on vaporettos and return on the airport bus no 5. If you book at least a week in advance, you pay less). Breakfast, like everyone else has said, is in another building round the corner. It's basic but filling, eggs are hard boiled but there are bread rolls, croissants, soft and hard cheeses, 2 cold meats, yogurts, jams, cereal etc and fresh tea/coffee is brought to your table. Some people have complained about the noise. Yes, the bells from San Zacharia are loud but enchanting. We were on the top floor so any noise we heard was from guests going up to the terrace, the door was next to ours. Coming from London, I actually found it quiet and at night, I actually opened the Lagoon facing window to hear the water and life! I would definitely stay here again.

I enjoyed relaxing there with a beer and some snacks. It was chilly during winter though. But we could watch boats and gondolas gliding pass us on the Grand Canal. It was awesome. The breakfast at the annex was very good. We had a hearty Italian breakfast every morning. Coffee was great, nice croissants, lots of jam, cheese, nutella, fruits and yogurt. More than enough to start the day. We had a wonderful time in Venice and being there during winter makes it even more special.

It really is very close to St Mark's Square, yet it doesn't cost a fortune. Don't expect five star luxury or services, but you will receive a friendly welcome and good service from the front desk. Our room was on the top floor of the main hotel (the one that opens up onto the Riva degli Schiavoni). It was the smallest of all the rooms on that floor, and its balcony faced onto the hotel courtyard rather than the Riva, but that was all I expected. I had booked the hotel on a tight budget, and received a very good deal for the room. Despite being the smallest room, it was certainly big enough for the two of us. The bed was comfortable (could have done with another pillow though). The bathroom had no bath - but the shower cubicle was spacious and the water was hot. As usual with Italian hotels, there was a bidet in the bathroom; I've never yet used one, so can't comment on its effectiveness :-) We had a built-in wardrobe in our room, but no other storage at all. Not to worry, we were able to hang our clothes up to de-crease - and the rest of the clothes we left in our main suitcase, perched on the supplied suitcase stand. Perfetto! The room came with a safe for our valuables. The room also had a balcony, which would have been lovely in the summer - for sitting out and sipping some wine, I guess. But this was January, and very cold, so the balcony was pretty pointless. Breakfast was taken in a different building, just around the corner. It was adequate, and quite tasty. Bread and croissants were always fresh, the cold meats were okay (salami and ham), and there were cereals and cold hard-boiled eggs available too. Coffee or tea was offered on entry - and they didn't skimp on quantity in that respect. If you have ever stayed in a hotel in Germany or Holland, you will recognise the style of the breakfast. Personally, I would have liked some hot food, but as it turned out, it wasn't required. My only gripe was the presence of what I can only assume was a night-light high up on one of the walls. It was permanently on, giving out a bright green light through the night. I could find no way to turn it off, so I stuck a plaster over it, to reduce the glare. Please be aware, I am unusual in that I need a pitch black room to sleep in - probably because I have always lived in the country where pitch black nights are the norm - and I may be over-sensitive to such night-lights. But my first night in the hotel was very difficult for me until I found the sticking plaster solution. I would heartily recommend this hotel to anybody, whether on a budget or not.

For the rest of the issues, the hotel reply was a nice, but not very helpful, apology. Our room, even in January, had a mosquito problem (with windows closed the whole time, so they must be hibernating inside the room somewhere). My parents' room did not have a mosquito problem.

Good linens and towels, excellent heating (including a heated towel rail in the bathroom), excellent, free wi-fi and very tasty continental breakfast (also included in my tariff) of cereals, yoghurts, meats, cheeses, breads and pastries, as well as coffee made to order by a delightfully cheerful lady, made Paganelli an outstanding choice on a tight budget. My room was located on the ground floor of the hotel's annexe, which is just down a side street, facing the lovely San Zaccaria church. I think this was the only ground floor room, and its proximity to the street was the sole down side of my stay. Even though there is relatively little passing foot traffic, it was very, VERY noisy - every step and every word of every conversation was clearly audible, even with windows and curtains closed. In warmer weather, with windows open, it would be even worse. I would happily stay at the Paganelli again, but I would avoid Room 125 like the plague for this reason. I expect rooms on other floors are a good deal quieter and more private. Overall: I was stunned by how cheap the room rate was, and terribly impressed by the hotel and its staff as a whole.

There are many nice coffee bars around with a proper breakfast for resonable prices. The conclusion is, try to get a room in the main building and be carefull with cheap deals via wholesaler homepages...this may have an effect on the room size and quality. The location can not be better but the service and the breakfast can. Dear hotellier get some motivated and service orientated employees or maybe just pay the one's you have better...with those room rates there should be a propper share for the staff.

We got back to the hotel at 16.00 and he confirmed we were correct and that our cases had been packed and a new room at another hotel had been found at no extra cost to us. No charge was to be made for our stay the previous night. The clothes we had unpacked were not in our cases and I had to return to the room to collect from the chest of drawers. The bed linen had been sealed in refuse sacks, the room door was sealed with tape. Clearly the hotel was taking the matter seriously. We moved to our new hotel 400m away and continued to enjoy our visit. Now home and writing this review, my skin is covered in a severe rash. An allergic reaction to the uninvited guests feasting on me and a sad end to what should have been a great trip. Marco did all he could in the circumstances which we appreciated. However, hotels of any quality do need to ensure this sort of situation does not arise and housekeeping staff must be vigilant at all times. Would we return? Yes we would. Would we recommend to others? Maybe but we'd suggest they inspect the room before taking occupancy. Overall opinion?

The hotel does have a fantastic position overlooking the Grand Canal and it rather plays on this fact. We chose a room with a view, and the view was incredible, but we really did pay for it, lagoon view costs extra and most of the rooms don't have it. Our room was well appointed but for a superior deluxe was small - just enough room to walk past the end of the bed. A colleague of mine who stayed here also had a superior deluxe room which was much larger (enough to fit an additional open double sofa bed so as to accommodate 4 people so I fear we may have been diddled there). It is always worth mentioning that it was clean, no bad smells, fresh linen etc and all amenities in the room that we tried worked fine. The air con worked but it was badly placed - above our heads in bed so we would get very cold, it wasn't the quietest most modern machine either. There is no restaurant and breakfast is served in a nearby hotel under the same ownership. The breakfast food is nice enough but not so good that you'd fear oversleeping and missing it. There is a roof terrace which offers the same great views and for most guests their only look at the view. We wanted to go up at night and managed to get the key of the night manager to do so, breaking the house rules I think. We were assessed I guess and deemed to not be a likely disturbance. Being up there late at night was really nice, but there is only room of one table to have a clear view, the rest would look at the first table. I would advise buying some Prosecco from a supermarket (inland from the grand canal for a major reduction in cost) earlier in the day and putting it in your room fridge and then go up and enjoy the night view like we did. The service good if a little formal, the chap behind the desk was very kind to us, carefully looking after our expensive hand painted Venetian marks while we were out exploring the Veneto between our two stays. He was also very helpful and informative regarding any question we fired at him, including airport transfers. The hotel is in a good location very close to St Marks but after seeing the price and reading all the good reviews I was underwhelmed. It felt that the management were milking their location for all it is worth. The night of the Redentore festival we were invited to attend a cocktail party on the terrace for a 30euro charge pp, we accepted. This was really quite disappointing, the terrace is normally free to be on and the one time that it would be used to its full effect they charged us 60 Euro extra for the privilege of a few glasses of Prosecco. Total profiteering. While I was looking out at the fireworks and all the boats bobbing in the lagoon I could only think that I wanted to be in one of those boats... The fireworks were so good you would have been able to see them almost anywhere in the city and you don't need to be on this terrace. In summary if you want a lagoon view then this hotel could be what you are after, if however you would be content with a quiet inner canal view or no view at all (after all this is a city to be explored not stuck in a hotel room) then I think you would find better rooms and services for less cash.", "Date": "August 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, small but tidy room, below average breakfast\u201d", "Author": "marknmeils", "ReviewID": "UR76316777", "Content": "We stayed for 3 nights and were very happy with the Hotel Paganelli.

The cruise embarked from Venice so we decided to spend a couple days in Venice beforehand. When researching for hotels, we found that there were plenty to choose from. We wanted a place that was affordable and in a convenient location. My sister, who had been to Venice with her husband before, recommended Hotel Paganelli. After checking out their website, we decided to book Hotel Paganelli because it was in our price range, the rooms looked clean and nice, and because of the location of the hotel. The hotel was only a short walk from St. Mark's and right in front of a water bus stop (which comes in handy when you arrive and leave from the airport). We got in around 5pm and the front desk guy immediately knew who we were since we were the last people checking in. He took us to our room and explained everything from how to operate the lights, leaving your key when you leave, and getting breakfast in the morning. Our room was right off the courtyard in the main building. Overall, the room was small, but was clean and had modern furnishings. It had a flat screen tv and a safe for us to store our valuables in when we left the room. Throughout our stay, the staff was very friendly and helpful.

A guy next door assured us that there is supposed to be someone on duty 24 hours a day. After a few minutes of knocking on the glass, the front desk guy gets up from the couch he had been sleeping on and opens the door for us. For a minute there, my husband and I thought we were going to have to sleep on a bench in St. Mark's square! I though the breakfast was perfectly fine, but that's probably because I don't really eat a lot for breakfast in general.

However, when we came back at night with our luggage, we were shocked that we were given an old room, half the size of the one shown to us. We immediately told the staff at the front desk who was very rude and dismissive. He even said if we didn't like the room we could leave (money, of course,will not be returned) and if they were to find any takers for the room they would email us to return the money!!! At 7pm on a Sunday evening in Venice they of course knew we weren't going anywhere. After a gruelling and extremely frustrating hour, we had no option but to take that room. There were other better rooms available, by their own admission, but they just refused to let us take them unless we paid extra for them. The only saving grace was that we were leaving the next morning at 6! The one and only good thing about this hotel is it's location and that is what they seem to be so arrogant about. It was a nasty end to a beautiful vacation in Venice.

Standard rooms are in another building- about 45 seconds away in the first alley - not on the Grand Canal. This is where breakfast is served. Breakfast is ok. Rooms: Since ours was a superior room, we were on the Grand Canal location. Rooms are not very large but they are very well appointed. The air conditioning was good. We were in room number 211 which even has a small sit out area. No view of the Grand Canal though. This is a small hotel and therefore only some rooms overlook the Grand Canal.

The Hotel room is tiny - in line with most Venice Hotels i assume, but the rooms are neat and nicely done. The Continental breakfast is ok- nothing to write home about. The staff, sadly, leaves a lot to be desired. My wife and I checked-in in the aft'noon, eagerly looking forward to Venice as we have heard so many wonderful things about this beautiful city. The front office manager was not the most friendly chap- no smiles and no conversations. Anyway, we discovered that night that the Hotel had no air-conditioning and called the front office to check. The room gets pretty stuffy (even with the windows open); and to make matters worse, there's a clock tower very close by- so expect to hear the chimes till you can keep you eyes open. We were told that the Govt of Venice does not allow air-conditioning in May (??) and we shd check with the Manager next morning. We were a little surprised to hear something like this, but it was pretty late in the night so we just decided to talk to the manager the next day. We decided to google air-con rules in Venice the next eve and were shocked to find out that there are no 'Govt rules' regarding the same. We were disappointed that we were lied to about something like this rather than finding a solution to the problem. We called the Frnt Office again and asked them if they can provide a fan. They had no fans. They then said the air-con is centrally controlled and apparently, some people wanted to turn the heating on,(which again we doubted) so they had to keep the air-con shut. The guy at the Frnt office during the night shift was extremely rude and almost asked us to get lost, which completely upset us. We had no intimation from the hotel pre-booking that they keep the air-con shut ( we booked our room thru a third-party). There was no mention of the same on their website either. Unfortunately, the incident left us with a sour taste while leaving Venice. The manager of the hotel apologised for his staff's behavior while maintaining his stand that it was not the Hotel's fault; but, really, that guy shd have shown more maturity rather than just reacting like a child and resorting to lies.

Of course, please do not expect it to be the Ritz Carlton or Bangkok's Oriental Hotel because I only paid 90 GBP per room per night for a TRIPLE room located in the most expensive area in Venice. i.e St Marks Square. So for the money paid, this place far exceed expectations. First of all, the hotel's location is to die for. I am travelling with elderly parents who needed walking sticks and thus accessibility is my main concern. We were grinning with delight when we alighted from the vaparetto (waterbus) because the hotel was so near! I think if I throw a stone hard enough from the vaparetto stop, it will hit the hotel. There are different numbers for vaparettos running different routes. The stop just in front of the hotel caters to No. 2, 5, 41, 42, 52 and N. The more popular No. 1 vaparetto's stop is slightly away, but just another extra 1 minute walk (even for my parents) across a small bridge. St Marks Square is a three minutes walk from the hotel which made sightseeing so convenient. For other places, we just hopped onto the vaparettos. On top of that, the 24-hour hotel reception staff are really friendly and professional. We met 3 different guys during our stay and all of them are great! They know their guests' room numbers and we did not even once need to tell them our room number when we collect our keys. They are very helpful and will give you a free Venice map. Our triple room was clean and huge. The room is separated into two sections. The bathroom and wardrobe near the entrance; and the beds in another section further in. The room is not facing the Grand Canal though and I was aware of this when I booked the room. The staff even gave us the room nearest the lift so that my parents need not walk much. There was no problem with noise as the lift was near our bathroom and the beds were in another part of the room separated by a door. Bathroom is clean and the bathtub is larger then most hotels. Breakfast comes free and it is adequate though with bread and croissants, hard boiled eggs, some fruits, cereal and some cold cut meat. The waitress will then get your order for coffee or tea. Do not expect a cooked English breakfast or similar fare though. However, this is not a setback because I do not really rate hotels by their breakfast. To me, location, staff and cleanliness are more important factors. The most memorable experience of the stay is walking out of the hotel everyday and face to face with gondolas bobbling in the water .

I for one plan on returning each year as long as I am able to travel.", "Date": "June 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201clocation, location,location\u201d", "Author": "atabh", "ReviewID": "UR16947458", "Content": "Located just 2 minuutes walking distance from st. marks square hotel is ideally located to explore venice. rates are reasonable. breakfast is decent.

The breakfasts were good, typical European fare, but nicely laid out and my husband says they made the best coffee of our entire trip (he tends to rate places by the coffee alone!)

The room and bath were small (but that is the norm in Italy, it seems) but very clean with antique furnishings. The breakfasts were very good, contintental style with meats, cheeses, hard boiled eggs, pastries etc. The coffee was wonderful - you could order whatever you wanted and they prepared it for you - lattes, cappucino etc. The front desk service was great. You have to turn in your key whenever you leave the hotel however the staff remembered my room number each time I returned to the hotel and handed me my key without asking for my room number. There is free internet in the lobby which was handy. Please note there is no elevator at this hotel.
