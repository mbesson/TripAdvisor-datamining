The experience was great. The resturant owner Ceaser was very polite and pleasing. he is looking after everything. His family is running this hotel. I stayed in this hotel during the period of heavy rush in Venice. The room is not very spacious , but clean. The bath room is so big, almost same as the room. The area is very quiet and natural. A river is flowing just opposite to this hotel. The hotel owner has even offered me free drinks in the evening. His behaviour so pleasing. I Iike him. The breakfast is also good with personal attention of the owner and his brother(I think). This hotel is around 30 KMS far from Venice (Marco Polo airport) But it is easy to reach the hotel by bus. But you should catch 2 bus. Airport to Venice central and Venice central to Dolo. It is near to the Dolo busstop. The same side of the busstop and just 20 meters forward from buststop. This hotel is cheap also compared to other hotels in Venice. I will stay here again if I visit Venice in future", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Albergo alla Campana", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d653687-Reviews-Albergo_alla_Campana-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$55 - $112*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Mazzini, 78</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Dolo</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30031</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "653687", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/a9/6a/a96a8380debb4ab573f5bda08a1bf56c6large.jpg"}}
