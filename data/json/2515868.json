Pro: very convenient to Epcot - you can enter the park (with ticket of course) via a short boat ride that docks between the Great Britain and France exhibits. Fantastic to enjoy the restaurants, shows, fireworks at night. Also easy boat ride to Hollywood Studios. I would highly recommend this hotel during October when Epcot celebrates the Wine and Food Festival. The pool has a wonderful slide which I (never to old) enjoyed immensely. As always you can expect great service from the Disney cast. Cons: lengthy walk from car to room, and u have to cross the lobby. Not convenient when u come back carrying groceries.

We had a two bedroom villa with a full kitchen that overlooked the Luna pool and waterslide. The beds were wonderful, the common area was nice and spacious (my oldest son slept on the pullout). Also in this location we were not very far at all from the front desk or elevators. We put in an order with garden grocer.com in advance so our groceries were waiting at reception (and had been kept cold) when we arrived. This was hugely convenient! We ate breakfasts in the room most days which got us moving in the mornings. The villa also comes with coffee and a coffemaker (also helpful!). The staff at the Villas, especially the housekeeping staff, were wonderful and friendly. The Boardwalk was gorgeous. The lobby was beautiful with high ceilings and lovely wood floors. The front lawn facing the water was also beautiful. The villas are located really convenient to Epcot (about a 10 minute walk or a 20 minute wait and water taxi trip). Hollywood Studios is also about 15-20 minutes' walk from the Villas along a lovely waterside path but it also has a water taxi that boards right outside the hotel itself. The resort buses come roughly every half an hour or so to take you to the further flung parks. BV is first to be picked up for Magic Kingdom, which is nice as they can get crowded at certain points of the day. Room service was passable, but the Flying Fish is just 3 minutes away so I'd recommend that trip instead. The Luna pool was fun, the kids absolutely loved it. The boardwalk comes alive at night with performers and we rented a bicycle big enough for the whole family one of the evenings and had a great time!

Without a doubt, the best accommodations in all WDW. The style, amenities and proximity to Epcot and Hollywood Studios cannot be beat. This is part of the DVC (Disney's timeshare program), but they do book it like hotel rooms if there is availability. It is a hard reservation to get, but we bought someone's points on the secondary market and it was very easy for them to book it for us. Warning-only buy points from reputable sources. These belonged to a good friend of ours. We have stayed at many of the Disney resorts, and I was extremely pleased with the quality of the rooms and the amenities. The hotel does not have its own restaurant, but all of the places located on the Boardwalk are available and at your disposal. The hotel is quite large, and if you're not on the ground floor or near the elevator, you will have to walk quite a bit, but the halls are well lit and generally quiet. My experience is that this is a perfect place to stay, especially if you have children that are older (ours are 12 and 16). The Disney \"theming\" is at a minimum, and they don't beat you over the head to buy a DVC membership (probably a by-product of this being a DVC resort), so if you want a lot of Mickey Mouse theming, this would not be a great location. Speaking of location, enough cannot be said about its proximity to Epcot and Hollywood Studios. You can easily walk to Epcot in 10 minutes, and Hollywood Studios in 15. Not being a slave to the Disney transportation system, and not having to park a car and use the tram, was a real bonus. It was very nice to walk back and forth from Epcot whenever we felt like it. You can stay off-site and get similar floor plans. Embassy Suites, Homewood Suites and Residence Inn comes to mind. But if you want big rooms with lots of amenities, on-site at Disney so you can spend more time doing things and less time going back and forth, and are willing to pay the premium for location, this is the best resort on site.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lithia, Florida", "Title": "\u201cPoor response to electrical outage\u201d", "Author": "2Meow", "ReviewID": "UR128486848", "Content": "Stay: 4/13-15/2012 On our second day I plugged the hair dryer into the bathroom outlet and there was a poof and the electricity in the whole bathroom area went out. I immediately called the maintenance department and I was told they would send someone to my room. After a half hour of no response I called maintenance again and was again told someone would come. On our way to dinner around 7:00 pm I stopped by the front desk to tell them what had happened so far (no response) and requested the problem be fixed by our return. I was told by the desk person she would report the incident to her supervisor who would have more power to get the problem resolved. We returned from dinner between 11:30 pm and 12 am. The electrical problem had not been fixed yet but it was evident to me that someone had been in our room because lights were on that I know I had turned off. I called the front desk and again told them what had happened thus far. I was told I would have to come back to the front desk personally. When I asked why I had to \"hike\" back to the front desk (it was not close) I was told that was what I had to do. Upon arriving at the Front Desk I asked for the hotel manager. Two managers came out to talk with me. The housekeeping manager & another one (who was NOT the on-duty hotel manager). Again I went through what had happened. I acknowledged that it was a large hotel & it might take time to get a problem resolved but I was NOT happy with the \"Disney service\" in that NO ONE ever got back to me, no note, no message on my phone... nothing. They apologized and offered to change my room since they could not fix the problem because they could not get in to the room next to mine (there was a Do Not Disturb sign on the door). Again, I asked why no one had ever gotten back to me & why I had to hike to the Front Desk to learn this? No good answer, again just more apologizing. I said I would take another room. They said they would call about a new key. I requested a late check out since I now had to pack all my belongings and more myself. They agreed to a 1:00 pm check out. I returned to my room and with my husband we packed our belongings. They called while we were doing this to say they had a room just down the hall and would we like to come get the key or have it brought to us. I said they could make the hike this time to our room this time. We moved to the other room & never heard from them again. This certainly was not an example of Disney Magic. As members of DVC and frequent guests at DVC properties usually our stays are very pleasant. Unfortunately, when things go wrong, which is the true test of a good hotel, the Boardwalk Villas staff falls short on service. It was not so much the inconvenience of the problem with the room so much as the face that I was treated like this was no big deal and why was I complaining. The fact that they had the audacity to ask me to come to the manager rather than send the manager to me really made me realize that the customer was not important to them. As a DVC member I will certainly try to avoid the Boardwalk Villas.

It also came with a stackable washer/dryer which was helpful and we used it daily. It had 2 vanity areas, one huge tub and a walk-in shower. There was a king size bed in one room, and a couch bed where we put the kids. The room comes with a pack n play but we requested a full size crib and got one.

The decor and flooring of the room isn't really my taste and could use some updating, but the lobby and hotel itself are lovely. Disney puts its money in the entrances and pool area. We loved having breakfast at the Boardwalk daily and used the pool, which was a hit with our kids. I would absolutely come back and recommend to anyone. It's a 5 minute walk to Epcot or you can take the ferry. You can take the ferry to Hollywood Studios too. It's a 20 min busride to Magic Kingdom, which is fine, but make sure you get on the right bus.

On the Boardwalk you find a variety of restaurants, shops and activities. One of my main complaints about Walt Disney World is the sheer size of the place. This makes transportation around the various parks and attractions an important consideration. The Epcot resorts (including the Boardwalk, Beach Club, Yacht Club, Swan and Dolphin) all share a great central location. Epcot was a short walk, Hollywood a short boat ride and it was only a quick bus trip to most everywhere else with the exception of the Magic Kingdom which was best reached by catching the Monorail from Epcot (on the opposite side of the park). Service at the hotel was as excellent. Help was there whenever you needed it without being under foot. To be fair however, our trip went so smoothly we never really put them to the test. If I was disappointed with any aspect of our stay it was the food. We had hoped that with all of the choices around the resort we could find something better than mass produced theme park dining.

As the Magic Express bus drives you up to the property the Boardwalk opens up before you. They did a wonderful job of creating the feel of a turn-of-the-century Atlantic City or Coney Island. The entrance and lobby are gorgeous - be sure to look up when you enter the hotel lobby and check out the amazing carousel-themed lighting fixture. We were all incredibly pleased with our room. Having a kitchen and washer and dryer was a great benefit. We have stayed at the budget Disney properties in the past and weren't used to having these amenities.

We loved all of the evening entertainment on the Boardwalk, as well as having the option of having a quiet pool in addition to the main pool. But our favorite feature was how quickly we could walk to Epcot from the Boardwalk. As other reviews stated, Epcot is about a 5 minute walk away, and Hollywood Studios is about a 10-15 minute walk. You can also hop on a boat to get to either park, which will take more time but comes in handy for tired feet.

The Villa's provide a great \"home away from home\" with a full kitchen (1BR), King bed, family room and balcony. The Boardwalk view rooms offer a great view of the Boardwalk, the Beach Club and the \"high\" fireworks at Epcot. There are several rooms with mostly enclosed balconies which we try to stay away from because they make the rooms dark (less sunlight coming in) and you have to stand to watch anything from the balcony. The restaurants and shops on the Boardwalk are good and between the Boardwalk area, the Yacht and Beach Club and the Swan and Dolphin, you have plenty of places to eat within easy walking distance. The Clown pool was a big hit with our kids with their waterslide and the carousel pool bar is a favorite for the adults! Try the Captains Mai Tai! It is so tasty! :)All in all, due to location, room size and quality and convenient walk or boat ride to Epcot which is highly desired during the Flower and Garden festival in the spring and the Food and Wine festival in the fall, this is one of our favorite resorts anywhere!", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cEither this....or that....\u201d", "Author": "GC967", "ReviewID": "UR125610681", "Content": "We checked into two rooms, had asked for connecting due to the fact that my grandson is in a wheelchair and on oxygen at night and it makes it much easier for him to go from room to room.

When we check in our rooms were side by side, not connecting. Couldn't do anything for me, so sorry. We went to my daughter's villa first, it was fine. My husband and I walked into our room and the odor of mildew was overwhelming, it was late, we were tired, we went to bed. Next morning I left the maid a note about the odor and we left. Got back to the rooms at 6 and my daughters room was fine, the maid had missed ours, hadn't even been in the door. Called and had clean towels brought to us for the next morning and we went left to go swimming. Next day left another note, when we came back the maind had been there and the dishwasher was running, it ran for another hour before I finally turned it off and called maintenance to report it. My husband got in the shower and cold water was pouring out of the light above him, the clothes in the dryer had to be put through 4 times to get dry, called maintenance again and was told they would be fixed. My duaghter's room was fine, I am so glad that the children were not in our room and we had a wonderful time despite all of this. When my husband was agin doused with cold water during his shower he went to the desk and complained. They were not very helpful, he finally spoke to a manager and they gave him a $200 credit. For what we were paying for the room I don't really think that was enought but \"it is what it is\". So, beware, your room can be perfectly fine....or not. Please know that we have been to Disney and stayed on the property over a dozen times and we will be returning. The property is getting a little old and it was our first times at the Boardwalk, we love the Beach Club and it actually has a better pool for older children, Boardwalk pool is clown theamed and a bit young for us but both are very nice. The grandchildren are at an age that they love Epcot the most and this is a perfect location. When younger we always stayed at the Contemporary Resort and have stayed at Port Orleans and the Wilderness Lodge also but find the constant busses difficult. Had our room not had so many glitches we wouldn't have had a problem with staying here, just be aware that while most of the rooms are fine there are some that are feeling their age and you may be getting one of them.

A great time to visit WDW, it's the off-season and crowds were low. Weather was intermittent, with some days on the 70's and others in the 50's. Dress in layers. The Boardwalk was not our first choice, so I was a little hesitant, but it turned out great. We rented a one-bedroom villa. My wife and I stayed in the king bedroom and our two daughters (age 5 and 8) shared the pull-out sofa in the living room. The room was clean and in good condition. The bathroom was large, with toilet, sink, and shower and there's a separate room w/ whirlpool tub, sink and closet. The kitchen is compact, but had a full-size fridge, stove, microwave and dishwasher. There's a washer/dryer in the room. Because we were not timeshare owners, you get daily maid service. All utensils were provided, plus dishwasher soap, dish soap, and laundry detergent. There's also a safe in the room (free). Didn't use wifi. We used Garden Grocer to deliver groceries for breakfast, and the delivery was waiting for us when we arrived. The room has a small balcony and overlooked the pool area. Even though the pool is open at night, we didn't have any noise issues - probably due to the cold weather. On those days when it was warm enough we used the pool. My kids loved it; just the right size for them. There's both a regular pool and a kiddie pool, plus a large slide. If you are looking for more, stay at another resort or hit the water parks. There's also a snack bar and family restroom. Towels were plentiful. The decor of the resort is lovely, I felt like I was walking onto the set of \"Boardwalk Empire\". We ate at two of the restaurants, Big River Grill and Kouzzina. Both had good food, prices were typical for Disney. Tip: Don't sit outside at Big River - lots of seagulls who don't have any fear of tourists. The location was the best part - it's part of the \"Epcot Resorts\" - you can walk to Epcot (a bit long for little kids) and Hollywood Studios (even longer), but the best way to both is by boat. A very quick and leisurely trip. You arrive at the back entrance of Epcot, close to the World Showcase, which is perfect for dinner. Transport to Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom is by bus - about 30 and 45 minutes, respectively. Not as nice, but it gets you there. If you are worried about staying at a timeshare, don't. There's no high-pressure sales. In fact, except for the timeshare sales desk in the lobby, you wouldn't know you were in the timeshare section. Disney has a good reputation for being very low-key about timeshare sales.

Our room and bed were very comfortable and spacious and I loved the decor. The Christmas decorations were beautiful (except for Stitch) and my favorite of all of the resorts. The location was close enough to World Showcase so you could almost consider it part of your resort if you have a park hopper or annual pass. The staff and service outstanding. This resort is lovely for couples, as it can be very romantic walking the Boardwalk at night. The path to Hollywood Studios is beautiful. The problems were the hot tub was never above lukewarm nor was the pool heated. The room also had a few minor problems, especially with the door knobs. The boat service is extremely slow. After visiting Universal - I don't understand why Disney can't invest in some new technology like they have for parking the boats - it would cut the time it takes them now in half. This area really needs a restaurant re-do many of the least popular restaurants are all right here on the Boardwalk but at least you have Epcot right around the corner :) There is a pizza window with okay pizza and the bakery has a few croissants but other than that there is no counter service restaurant.", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Albany, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cLocation, location, location!!

Check in was easy and fast (used disney's online check-in a few days in advance). We stayed in a studio at saratoga springs, so the room here was pretty much a duplicate. Couch, table, bed, small kitchen area, bathroom, but let's be honest; you're not in the room much at disney except to sleep. Room was decent, nothing spectacular so we changed and walked to hollywood studios.. Approx 15 min walk to the front gate; walked back then headed to epcot.. 5 min walk!!! 5 min from the boardwalk area to the side entrance to the epcot in between the UK and France. First time for us being at Disney with all of the Christmas decorations up... Giant gingerbread house inside the lobby, as well as a large tree by the fireplace. The boardwalk area was fun and always entertaining.. I used the gym just about every day while my daughter/wife napped and it was well equipped and clean. I coach CrossFit and they had plenty to do and make up my own workouts. My wife was 29 weeks pregnant and got a massage at the health club... she said it was decent but nothing spectacular. There is a side room off the workout area they do massages in, and could hear the gym area while trying to relax during t\u00e5he massage. Didn't use the pool but sat at the pool bar for drinks.. Had seasonal beer on tap. Tried the beer sampler at the brewery, which was great. The only places we ate at the boardwalk were the ESPN zone which was good and our last night we got room service; the food was fantastic. The negatives - I know my title states location... but having a 2 and a half year old daughter, we like taking her to the magic kingdom more than the other parks. That was one drawback, it was a 30 minute bus ride to the magic kingdom. To and From.. Most days, we would just start at the epcot spend a few hours there then monorail it over to the MK, then take the bus ride home. Same thing with the Animal kingdom.. the boardwalk would be the last stop on the loop (swan/dolphin/yacht club/beach club then boardwalk. Another negative was the bed... must be a disney thing since the past 3 trips we've been on, the beds sink in the middle. (Polynesian, saratoga, now boardwalk) So a recap.. awesome location since 2 parks are within walking distance... the other 2 parks are a 30 min bus ride.. awesome hotel with a lot of amenities.

We could see the high fireworks from our balcony. We were a 10 min walk to Epcot and maybe a 12 min walk to Hollywood studios. This was the perfect location since most of our time was spent at the food and wine festival in Epcot. One con for us was it was not easy to refill your refillable mug since their is no quick service location in the resort. You have to bring your mug to the pool bar or various locations on the boardwalk or a lounge in the resort. However, they cannot fill your mug for sanitary reasons so they fill a paper cup and you can pour it into your mug. Location can also be a key element. Our room was super convenient to everything but if you are at the far end of one of the halls, it can be a walk. There are no restaurants in the resort but many right down on the boardwalk itself. The resort is beautiful and the quiet pools are soooo quiet. Our room was very quiet but if you have a room right on the boardwalk, I imagine it could be noisy at times. We did not use the bus transportation because we had a rental car but we did use the boat a few times. The boats are very convenient if you are not in a hurry as both the boats and busses make several stops. We beat the boat to Hollywood studios a couple times walking. However, when you're feet are tired they are a welcome convenience. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I did not have one serious complaint.

My son was already on a roll, as he was given the first time at disney badge, and a happy birthday badge.

I was not sure of the free wifi in the rooms, as i had tried to look up the possibility, before our arrival, but there again !!! complimentary wifi was on the house, for our entire stay. nearly everything was perfect...I suppose a very rare piece of luck for sure, And the memories, surely unforgettable, will stay for a long long time to come. AND before we realized, the end of our stay was near. Indeed, we were a little heart broken that everything good has to end sometime. Infact the standard of hospitality and the guest relationship was so high, that i am sure, it would be difficult for us, to find the same level of disney hospitality, ever again in any non disney vacations in the future.

Trust me, as someone who happily pays a lot of money to even get to Florida from the UK and for luxury hotels, this is one of the best places i have stayed. The staff were extremely helpful and polite at all times. The rooms were large and spacious enough for 2 adults and 2 teenagers without falling over each other, with large enough kitchenette area and fridge, even though we only had a studio on this occassion. The whole resort is beautifully presented and decorated and you really feel as if you have stepped back into the 1930's era as the atmosphere is so real. One of the highlights for me was each morning waking up to have the view of the Epcot ball and to sit on our balcony with a cup of tea and listen to the old style music being softly played around the boardwalk. Wonderful. The pool was also brilliant, particularly for young children. As ours are now teenagers we preferred to use the 2 quieter pools which were large and more peaceful. The boat service to Epcot and Studios was regular and never too crowded. However, Epcot is within 5 mins walking and this involves a lovely stroll around the lake. The only negative that i could say is that i don't think there are enough laundry facilities and people being people can be very inconsiderate when using these, i.e as soon as you turn your back, chucking your clothes out of machines and putting theirs in!! This practice caused a few heated words in the laundry room. This isn't an issue for people staying in the 1 bedroom apartments as they have their own washer/dryer and i wouldn't allow it to stop me from returning.

Of course, we checked all the bedding and furniture for bedbugs (there were none). We did not make any special room requests in advance and had booked a standard room, but we received a room on the 5th (top) floor with a view of the quiet pool, river, and Hollywood Studios!

They have a ping pong table there, as well as foosball, a television, tons of board games, a free Ms. PacMan/Galaga game and movies you can rent (there are DVD players in the rooms). If you have some leisure time, I suggest you check out Community Hall and the other activities at the resort (pool games, crafts, nightly campfires, and movies by the pool). The washer/dryer in the room came in quite handy. We only used the whirlpool tub once. Being on the Boardwalk was awesome. There is plenty to do.

First positive: Villa, huge and spacious, coffee and all the kitchen amenitites were provided. You cannot beat the proximitely to the Boardwalk, just such a great place to hang in the morning and the evenings, close to the restaurants, we love the Flying Fish and Koussina. There were always different street entertainers which makes the Boardwalk experience quite unique. The pool was also very nice with the Clown slide. The negatives: No housekeeping, so when we called for extra towels, shampoo and soap since we had 5 people in the rooms for 7 nights they said they would do so complementary but we would need to pay next time. Really not a big deal but at the Beach club we had housekeeping replenish towels, shampoo daily, take out trash and clean once a week.

The kitchen is equipped with a dishwasher, stove and full size fridge. We really loved that we could have food delivered from Garden Grocer's before we even arrived and they held it at the Bell's desk. I would definitely recommend using them if you plan to stay for a while and want to say some money. Although the kitchen was fully equipped it was definitely only big enough for 1 person at a time. Once again, expected for an older resort. The grounds were very nice though with 2 pools - one more suited for kids with the slide and then a more private, \"adult-like\" pool which was nice for us since we weren't traveling with kids.

Stayed with the boyfriend so it was just the two of us. I have stayed @ AKL and French Quarter in the past and I liked this resort the best bc of its LOCATION!!! You can walk to Epcot in <5min and outwalk the boat to HWS. We are New Yorkers so we don\u2019t have time to wait and Boardwalk hotel really is in the center of it all. We had a studio back water view of the dolphin and swan hotels and could hear the ferry boats little horn but it was a nice touch. It didnt interupt our sleep. I think we were the only ones staying in our wing of the villas bc it was dead quiet until the last night we were there when we could hear kids thru the connecting door. But this is expected its Disney. Thankfully that was the night before we were checking out. I understand why people complain about the walk from the one bank of elevators quite a walk after walking all day but worth it. The room was nice had everything we needed coffee makes, fridge, microwave, a couch, flatscreen TV. Our balcony was odd there was only one chair and the door took up so much space to open that you have to maneuver around it so we didn\u2019t relax out there. Nice to have that divide between the toilet and sink area. Im girlie takes awhile to get ready. Bed was comfy and couch was good. Ordered room service for bfast one morning bfast potatoes were delish and service wonderful. I see why people don\u2019t like that there isn\u2019t a quick service style cafeteria right in the lobby or same building but you are going outside to the park anyway. We didn\u2019t have a problem grabbing something quick to eat or just having coffee in the room and then run to the parks. I guess that sort of cafeteria setting would ruin the DELUXE aspect. Didn\u2019t have food in any of the boardwalk restaurants but highly recommend beaches and cream (Beach Club hotel about 10min walk)! Awesome French dip, chili, onion rings! ICE CREAMMMM Look for the hidden mickey in the onion rings hehe Known for their ice cream we saw a group get a kitchen sink looked like an ice cream lover kids dream The bus to magic kingdom and AK came right when we walked up to the bus stop or we waited less than 15min for one. At night even when leaving for extra magic hours there was ALWAYS a bus to our hotel. Stops sometimes at Swan and Dolphin but what does that take like +5min!? no complaints with disneys transit system they have their ish together The ferry boat when leaving the parks if you can catch them without a monster line I recommend. So nice and romantic to ride back and take in the scenery Had a drink in the Bellevue lounge one day before heading to park for fireworks take your drink out onto the deck! wish i was there right now Bought sweets in the Candy Shop on the boardwalk for family back home but the parks have more of a variety buy in there Went to jellyrolls one night and that was the place to be. Boozed until 2am that was there closing time. $5 for a beer pretty good for Disney prices. Stroll around the boardwalk they have fun entertainment at night we saw a funny magician Didn\u2019t use our pool it looked nice with the clown coaster but the one over @ Beach and Yacht club looks way better. They have a lazy river. Going to swim there next time. Take the MAGIC EXPRESS and do the luggage to room service wish every destination was that organized. Take advantage of these things. Idk why you would want to wait for your luggage! Use the EXTRA MAGIC HOURS helllooo that\u2019s why you spend so much to stay on the Disney property. I think like 75% of these people have no clue about them. Disney is the best money you can spend on a vacay IMO every minute of it was magical lol Compared to others ive stayed at stay here for the location and scenery !!! Room very nice !!!

We have stayed at the Boardwalk VIllas two times in the past four years. Each time we stayed in a preferred view one bedroom villa. Each time we rented points from a DVC member, which is a very economical way to save money versus going through Disney Direct. Anyways, I wont go into FULL details, but I will say this hotel is where we first fell in love with Disney. IT is an unbelivable value to have a kitchen and that much space for the kids plus a washer dryer. Usually people travel to Disney for more than just a few nights, so these extra convienences are really worth it JIMO. The one drawback to the room itself is that it can sometimes be a long walk from the room to the elevator. This is a notorious drawback to this particular hotel. The location - however - cannot be beat. You are a short walk to Epcot and a boat ride to Hollywood Studios. The buses take you everywhere else. However, a drawback is they share the buses and boats with other hotels so it is more than a 5 minute ride (probably 20-30 total). There are plenty of restuarants on the boardwalk - both Disney- Flyisng FIsh, Cape May, Spoodles (which has been recently replaced) and non disney - ESPN, etc The best part of the hotel is the boardwalk area itself, which has nightly free entertainment. There are performers, magicians, jugglers pianos, surrey bikes, all of which engage children and adults alike.

After dinner, we typically walk along the Boardwalk to watch the buskers and then wander over to Epcot to watch the fireworks.", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "CHICAGO", "Title": "\u201cworst disney hotel experience\u201d", "Author": "BUSTER71195", "ReviewID": "UR101689006", "Content": "We travel to Disney once per year and usually stay on Disney property.

Check in and check out were extremely smooth, and the Disney's Magical Express service, which takes care of your luggage and transport to and from the airport, is phenomenal. We stayed in a studio villa. Our room was immaculate, the bed was comfortable, and we had a bit more space to spread out than you would get in a regular hotel room. There was a mini-kitchen with a sink, refrigerator, microwave, and toaster, and the hotel provided plates, cups, etc. We didn't use it much, but I can see how it would be a great money saver if you want to pick up some cereal or cold cuts for sandwiches and eat in the room instead of at the parks. Since the BoardWalk is walking distance from 2 Disney parks (about 10 minutes from Hollywood Studios and literally next door to Epcot), it's totally possible to eat in your room. Hollywood Studios and Epcot are also accessible by boat, and you can take the bus to Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom. I've heard a few bad reviews of the bus system, but we really didn't have a problem with it. One of my favorite things about this hotel is that there's tons of stuff to do even if you're not in the parks. The boardwalk itself has a few restaurants (including Cat Cora's Kouzzina- which was fabulous), a candy shop that serves ice cream, a bakery (delicious sandwiches and pastries), an arcade, and a few stores, one of which sold grocery items. There were a bunch of performers throughout the day, such as clowns, magicians, etc., and the Beach Club resort (less than 5 minutes away across the lake) had outdoor movie screenings every night. The pool also has a water slide which looked like fun. All of these things are great if you want some rest from walking around the parks but still want your kids to have something to do. I would most definitely stay here again, as the room itself was great, there's tons to do, and the location can't be beat.", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Vacation Club amenities - Home away from home!\u201d", "Author": "baddogsboy", "ReviewID": "UR99649375", "Content": "The Boardwalk Villas are just wonderful. We arrived on the 18th and left on the 27th of January. The service was impeccable, except for when we arrived. We had a cast member that was obviously not happy to do his job. But the rest of the stay was just amazing. We had an awesome view of the pool. I rented a 2 bedroom villa so my partner and my parents were there with me. It had all the amenities of a home. So we rented a car, went to Whole Foods and bought everything we needed for breakfast and for munchies. It was really nice to be together in the morning and make our breakfast, just the way we like it. It made the connections with the family just that extra special! We found everything really clean, and the mousekeeping forgot to replenish on the dishwashing detergent for the dishwasher one day. I called and within 8 minutes they were there! As you may know, you can walk to EPCOT (5 minutes) or to Hollywood Studios (15 minutes), or you can take the friendship boat. When we took the boat from the Studios, we stopped at the Swan & Dolphin, it was much quicker to then walk than than to stay in the boat, as the boat also goes to the Beach & Yacht Club before the Boardwalk. All and all I would recommend this resort big time. The convenience of being right next to those parks, the beauty of the Boardwalk and the amenities makes it a winner in my heart. Just a small drawback: the corridors. They are endless! Be prepared after a big day of walking to walk another 4-5 minutes just to get to your room from the elevator.

There are many many stairwells located throughout the resort. My only complaint (and I am a very light sleeper) was the noise from the Boardwalk.

We met the Executive Chef who provided my five year old son a personalized tour of the kitchen, gave him an autographed chef's hat and took a nice picture together. Had to mention that because Chef Keating is a perfect Disney fit! Parks were busy but expectedly so. The only downside we encountered were the Disney Transports, We sat at the bus stop way more than we wanted to! Thirty five to forty minutes for MK! We ended up using a taxi twice rather than wait for the Downtown Disney Bus! PLUS, the same bus that serviced Boardwalk also traveled to Swan, Dolphin, Beach and Yacht Resorts! FIVE resorts before it went to the park! Ridiculous! One night, when we were returning from DD, the bus driver, named after change and it wasn't nickel or dime or quarter refused to open up the back bus door to let me out. Normally, I wouldn't think too much of it but I had my large Graco stroller folded up and the bus was packed. People were standing in the aisle and it was a mess. Well, I attempted to navigate the aisle but bonked two people. It's obvious that Disney is aware of the bus issue as I noticed a Disney Cast Member who appeared to be tracking the bus arrivals. Funny thing though, even with the cast member present doing his thing, the bus issue didnt change for my 11 day stay! Thank god you can walk to EPCOT and Hollywood Studios.

As soon as we opened the room door, we were greeted by a disgusting musty smell. It was almost like someone smoked in the room prior to us and then never put the air on. YUCK! We put the fan/air on, but the smell stayed. The decor was quite strange - nothing matched. I just thought it was weird since every DVC resort that we have stayed at is themed quite well. The couch was like a rock, literally! We had just came from a stay at AKL and the couch was so comfortable - it was a very \"homey\" place. You could not even sit on the couch to watch TV. Even though the room seemed to have new rugs and a new TV, it was still very old looking. There was still hair in our tub from the last guests - ewww! Also, when we checked in our room wasn't ready. No problem, we went to the parks and they said that they'd send a text when it was. At 5 PM we didn't receive any texts - the desk said that they didn't know what happened. As DVC members, they usually leave a message on your phone the first night to welcome you and give you a number to call if you need anything. For the 1st time as DVC members, this did not happen. Again, not a huge deal at all, but it made me realize how just how much of a special touch it is. We had a studio and our fridge leaked inside all night. All you heard was drip, drip, drip, drip while you were trying to sleep. We didn't have a need to use the fridge, but it was kind of annoying. The pool was very old and not very clean compared to all of the other resorts I stayed at. I truly felt like was at a crappy motel at Wildwood, NJ.

I have bed bugs all over my arm and neck from my stay there.. if you have the time and want to know the truth read my story: Naturally, after a long trip I was so excited to get to our Disney Resort. However I was sorely disappointed. We arrived at the front entrance and was told by the Bell boy that we either had to pay 12 dollars to have our car valet parked or park it ourselves a good half a mile or so from the entrance. We didn't want to pay, so we started to take the luggage out of the car. We went to grab one of the luggage carts and the bell boy stopped us and asked if he could help. We said no, and he then continued to tell us that it was Disney policy that we weren't allowed to use the luggage carts. With no other choice, we allowed him to unpack our car. Which he then gave us a ticket and said our luggage would be up shortly. Checking in was just as confusing as parking. We did the online check in, so we walked up to the appropriate desk to check in. The receptionist didn't say anything to us and just handed us our keys. I had to ask her for a map of the hotel, which she then handed us a DVC member folder and told me all the info was in there. Finding our room was a nightmare. There was only one elevator (according to the hotel map) and the elevator was extremely far away from our room. Hallways later, we found our room and THAT was an even BIGGER nightmare. It was the nastiest room I have ever seen. The bathroom looked like a public restroom at a gas station... dirty, grimy, hair all over the place. It looked like all the cleaning lady did was fold the toilet paper into a nice little triangle... but forgot to actually clean the urine off the toilet seat. Disgusted, I called the front desk to request for another room. They acted like I was really inconveniencing them. The male receptionist made a sarcastic comment about how there must be a dead person in our room if it's that dirty. We finally received another room, which was even further away from the elevator than the last one. Not to mention, the bell boy had already dropped off our luggage at the old room and they don't offer luggage help if you\u2019re leaving your room. So we had to drag our luggage all the way to the new room without a cart. Unfortunately, the new room was just as bad... if not worse. I had to clean the toilet off with a disinfecting wipe..I couldn't take a shower without the bath filling all the way up. THEN the worst part ever! I pulled the sheets back when I went to bed and I pulled out a very long brown hair ... I have short hair. The manager was unavailable to talk, they wouldn't switch my room again.. I ended up leaving a day early. And to make matters worse, I have bed bug bites all over my arm and neck.

The add room was off of the main living room with its own bath & kitchen area, but not a full kitchen. Even though we were pool side on 5th floor, it was very quiet & never heard any noise. I fully recommend this property to anyone. It has something to offer to just about anyone. Does not have a bar or restaurant, but has a full kitchen which all dishes are washed daily & cleaning service daily should you request it. We had a better time at Boardwalk Villas than we would have staying at The Swann or Douphin hotels. I would love to own a unit.

My husband ran the Disney Marathon on the 10th, so we were there in the frigid week before. I know that many of the things we loved about the hotel probably would be problems had we gone during a warmer/busier time. So take it for what it's worth. We never had any noise from the pool, even though we faced the pool, but it was 35 degrees. I can imagine that if it had been warmer, noise during naptime (and bedtime) would have been annoying at best. If we stay here again, we will most likely request a room that does not face the pool or the Boardwalk, for noise sake. Also, because there were hardly any crowds, the buses and boats would get us to the parks in 20-25 minutes, unlike the hour that others complained about. Still, I have no idea why anyone would take a boat to Epcot when it is only an 8-10 minute walk. If a six-month pregnant lady, pushing a preschooler in a stroller in near-freezing temperatures can do it, so can you. Hollywood Studios was a bit farther of a walk--probably 15-20 minutes. Not bad if conditions are right, but it was so cold and I was feeling the pregnancy, so we took the boat. The buses to MK and AK ran on time and never took more than 18 to 25 minutes to get us from our hotel to the front gates. We had read the reviews about the long walk to the elevator, so we requested a room by the elevator. When we arrived at 3:30 for our 4:00 check-in, we had to wait until about 4:20 before a room was ready. Then we saw where the room was and it was not at all near the elevators. So they moved us (quickly) to a room that was supposedly closer. In actuality, it wasn't all that close. But when you're at Disney, all you do is walk, so it wasn't too bad. But definitely try to get as close to the elevator as you can, as there is only one in the entire villa. Twice for quick-service meals (we did the dining plan and HIGHLY recommend it), we drove to the All-Star Music resort and ate in their food court. It was a short drive and a wonderful place to eat. I only wish they had some sort of food court near the Boardwalk Villas. It was hard to find food (especially on the dining plan) that was quick and easy if we retired early to our room. We got a one-bedroom suite so that we could put our son to bed in the king bed and close the door, while we stayed in the living room, planning for the next day. Then when we went to bed, we'd simply move him to the pull-out queen sleeper sofa and go to bed in the king. The best part, though, of the one-bedroom suite was the washer/dryer. There was also a full kitchen w/a full-size fridge, oven/stove, and microwave. And because these are time-share rooms (even though we are not DVC members), they are stocked w/dishes, silverware, paper towels, dish detergent, etc. Really all we needed. As far as housekeeping, we could have gotten our rooms cleaned/beds made, etc, every day, but we chose to only do it a few times because we didn't really feel that it was needed. Two out of the three times that we purposefully left the privacy notice up (so as to not receive housekeeping), we received a phone call just being sure we didn't need anything. When our rooms were cleaned, they were cleaned very well. The staff even arranged my son's Disney stuffed animals on his bed. :) The concierge service was available 24-hours a day to answer our questions about how to get to certain places, etc., though they didn't always give the same information, especially about marathon transportation. One thing that was kind of annoying was that in order to use a luggage cart, you had to utilize their bellhop services. I suppose this makes sense and is probably standard in higher-class hotels, but we are too cheap to pay someone to carry our bags, so we had to do it all ourselves. All three trips. But that is just a preference on our part. I know many people have no problem tipping bellhops to help them, but we're perfectly capable of doing it ourselves. It just would have been nice to have a luggage cart to use. Even in a very low-traffic time (10 pm), they would not allow us to use one to load our car. Also, I think it is cheap and irritating that there is no free high-speed internet service, and that (non-wifi) internet is $9.95 a day. We did find an unsecured network in our room the first four days and that was great, but then it disappeared. Overall, we had a very pleasant stay. I will never come to Disney and stay outside the parks. The convenience, the resort transportation, and the dining plan are all worth the extra money. While the MK is our favorite park, the resorts that are within walking distance of that park are considerably more expensive, so this was a great location.", "Date": "January 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cVery Over Rated\u201d", "Author": "singlemom53", "ReviewID": "UR52408627", "Content": "Stayed the last week of 2009 in a Studio.

I have stayed on Disney property at 13 different venues for a total of 268 nights since 1997 so I know what to expect from the Disney Experience.

Bus service shared with Swan/Dolphin which is a non-Disney property and Yacht/Beach Club making a trip to anywhere almost an hour especially when Swan/Dolphin resort has a single bus lane. Buses in line have to wait for the first one to load and unload and can be lengthy with wheelchair loads. Boat transportation is also shared with the non-Disney Swan/Dolphin, boats often fill up there and Disney Resort guests are left waiting. Just 3 small drawers available in the lower portion of the TV stand so be prepared to live out of a suit case. Wall safe is half the size of the ones at Value Resort Pop Century. The table is small, does not match chairs or other furniture, cannot fit a pizza box and two people at the table all at the same time.

Even the handicapped parking is far from the front entrance. Upon arrival, I pulled up to the valet area where I was ignored so I asked if I could leave my car there until I checked in.

I asked if I could upgrade to a room with a kitchenette because I hadn't realized until the night before my arrival, that the room I booked onilne only had a microwave and small refrigerator. I was unable to change my reservation online at that point. He told me that they did have a 1 bedroom villa with kitchenette available and after much fuss on the phone to see what the extra fee would be to upgrade, he told me it would be an extra $115 per night. In the few seconds that I was contemplating this, he received a phone call, and then told me he was sorry but he told me the wrong price and that it would be $238 per night to upgrade because they couldn't give me the FL resident discount rate at the hotel.

I started to get annoyed at this point and in the few seconds that I was contemplating what to do, another Cast Member came out from behind a closed door, looked at me and said \"I'm really sorry but we just sold the only 1 bedroom that was available while you were deciding what to do. NOW I was angry. I said \"this is ridiculous, what is going on here? For medical reasons, I need the kitchenette to prepare my own food, I've been here less than an hour and I'm already very aggravated, perhaps I shouldn't stay here at all.\" A manager that was nearby heard the conversation and whispered something to the Cast Member that came out to tell me the bad news. SUDDENLY....a one bedroom villa with kitchen became available and at the Florida resident discount rate. How about that!!?? Unfortunately this wasn't the end of my misery. I check in and return to the valet area to see about having my luggage taken to my room. A Cast member at the valet booth tells me to \"talk to that guy over there\" so I do and he walks over to my car with me when I realize I don't have my keys. I go back to the valet booth and they don't know where my keys are. They find them but by then the bellman that was going to help me had walked away from my car. Someone directs me to the bell stand just inside the entrance and I get help with my luggage. I tell the bellman that I'm going to park my car and meet him at my room. This hotel is so large and built in such an odd way that it's difficult to navigate. Raymond gave me the wrong directions on how to get to my room and I quickly became very lost and unable to figure out how to get to where I was supposed to be so I called the front desk from my cell phone. Two cast members came to assist me and they said \"this happens all the time here.\" Hmmmm.....if it happens all the time, don't you think they should do something about that?! Finally both my luggage and I are in the room. I'm exhausted, it took over an hour to complete check in, park my car and find my room. The room is beautiful and very spacious but that's all it is. There is advertising everywhere you look to join the Disney Vacation Club, including on the TV. And I do mean everywhere! The kitchen table had large stickers all over it with these ads and you see them throughout the hotel. I had difficulty finding a TV channel that was NOT advertising something Disney. I went out for a while and when I returned to my room and attempted to use my laptop, I found a sign on the kitchen table that said to look for an ethernet cable in the closet (there was no cable) and that there was a $10 per 24 hours fee to use the service. I was enraged. This was the most expensive hotel I've ever stayed at and they were going to charge me to use the Internet? No they weren't as far as I was concerned. I called the front desk, reported that there was no ethernet cable and that I wished to have the fee for the Internet waived. I was told they \"COULDN'T\" do that so I asked to be connected to someone who could. I was told that the manager would call me back. About a half hour later, the manager called. He asked me: 1. \"Why do you think the Internet should be free?\" 2. After explaining that I've stayed at many lesser priced hotels that all had free Internet, usually WiFi, he said \"Well if you stay at a Motel 6, they give you free Internet to get you to stay there.\" I've never stayed at a Motel 6 that was his assumption. After arguing with him for a while and telling him that if he doesn't wave what would amount to $30 for Internet use during my stay, I was checking out immediately and never coming back. His reply was \"well, I hate to put you out at 11:30 at night, is there anything else I can do for you? I replied \"yes, you can let me use the Internet without charging me. His response was \"I'm not WILLING to do that.\" I quickly found a very lovely Holiday Inn Express on Palm Pkwy. in Lake Buena Vista for $85 per night offering free WiFi, free breakfast, very lovely, clean rooms and helpful management. A few days later while investigating who at Disney I can report my horrible experience to, I found that the Boardwalk Hotel has free WiFi in the lobby and they have a business center.

We booked a standard studio room. When we arrived it was raining so we just did the valet parking. Check in was fast and our room was ready. We were on a high floor facing the Luna Park Pool. The pool was open to midnight, so it was a bit noisy until midnight. We also had a view of Hollywood Studios. Our room was in the building with the Boardwalk Villas side and the walk from the elevator was long. The room itself was nice. It could sleep two adults and two small children. The only problem is that we had a connecting door to the one-bedroom condo (I think) and when they came in at 2 a.m. they woke us the first night. They supply paper plates and bowls along with plastic silverware. Small refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker dish towel and dish soap. We were only eating breakfast in the room and going out to dinner so we did not need to cook. Nice big vanity area, bathroom was kind of on the small side. Little foyer in the entrance (which was great for leaving your keys and such), closet next to the vanity, long but narrow. The room is starting to show its age a little, but that is okay because we like the convenience of staying at one of the Disney Resorts. No DVD player in the studios and the TV was old. Bed was comfortable and so was the sofa to sit and read on or watch TV. Cute little balcony, we watched the people below while were enjoying a couple of glasses of wine. There was a list of prices for extra things and I was a little confused about it, maybe it was for people that are DVC owners or people staying longer, but there were some extra charges such as extra cleaning, towels and such. We had our room cleaned during our stay and new towels (which we did not ask for) and no extra charge. Internet is extra for non DVC members (which we are not). Now to the resort! We took the shuttle boat over to Hollywood Studios and enjoyed the ride (we have stayed at the Dolphin and Swan and love the boat ride to Epcot and HS). Transportation to the other parks was by bus, which we did not do so I can not comment on them. We ate at Spoodles and Flying Fish Caf\u00e9; I highly recommend both of them (make sure to make your reservations). There is a small general store on the boardwalk where you can purchase things for the villa. We stopped into the Belle Vue Lounge for drinks before dinner one night, cute little bar. Since we were staying at the Boardwalk Villas for the first time, we decided to go spend the night at Jellyrolls and Atlantic Dance. Jellyrolls have a cover, but Atlantic Dance is free. We had a blast at both places. As for the pool, we never got to use it because by the time we got back from HS it was raining, but it looks like fun. There is a quiet pool around the corner from the activity center. Next time we are going to rent bikes. We just really enjoyed the old Atlantic City feeling of the boardwalk with games, yummy desserts and nightly entertainment. Don\u2019t forget that the ESPN zone is there for watching your sports (we did that during the playoffs in January, but get there early for football games so you can get a table around the bar area). We also did the character breakfast dining at the Cape May which was great.

We got to see the fireworks from Epcot every night and enjoyed a few chill out and watch the world go by seesions on the beach on the opposite side of the lake. My kids particularly enjoyed the nightly entertainment on the Boardwalk, which encouraged them to go out on an evening rather than staying in the pool which they loved!

First use of Disney Vacation Club, so unknown hotel cost, but we compared price value versus point usage and this was the second-best value (best value was full). We stayed on the main floor but never heard any foot traffic and had balcony view of the pool; Studio sized room. We were very busy with the parks and didn't spend all that much time with the room. The room seemed a little bit old fashioned but the only problem that we noticed was that the main sink didn't drain very fast. The shower, bathroom, hair dryer, fridge, alarm clock and TV worked fine. The room was decently lit, and was clean. They had a small grocery store on site so we didn't have to worry about getting non-restaurant type food. The resort buses were timely (we had heard of problems on web sites but didn't see any) to the parks. It got too cold for use to use the pool. Note the pool opens at 10:00 am and check out is 11:00 am with no extensions. We went to Spoodles (on site restaurant) for dinner one night and breakfast one morning and it was enjoyable. All of the staff were very very pleasant. The only staff shortage that we noticed was when we were the first one in line for the concierge desk one morning and a long line started behind us, and we only saw one person to help all of these people. The hotel is nice in that it is in walking distance (5 minutes) to the back entrance to Epcot and we were able to make use of a morning magic hour and an evening of magic hours. We also walked across to the Yacht and Beach Club for breakfast with Goofy, Donald and Minnie (we had to book this many weeks in advance though) one morning (also a 5 minute walk). Regarding the Disney World park itself: I cannot imagine anybody staying here without planning on going to one of the Disney World Parks and not take advantage of their (especially morning) magic hours; this place as well as the other Disney hotels aren't good stand-alone places due to the overall cost of things here (which are high). We were very surprised how busy it was at Disney World this late Feb weekend; apparently it was an ESPN weekend but compared to other weekends at this time of year (when we have been here) it was very busy.

The rack rate for our room was approximately $600 per night, though we actually paid less by using points rented from a DVC member. At those prices, we expected the room to be spacious, clean, and comfortable, the amenities to be plenty, and the service to be top-notch. Unfortunately, only some of these expectations were met. First the positive: The property itself was quite nice, with the boardwalk being even more entertaining that we expected. The location was ideal, a very short walk from Epcot, and a short boat ride from Hollywood Studios. Boats seemed to be available quite frequently, and we never waited more than 5 minutes for a vessel to arrive. The room was spacious and quite comfortable, and the amenities provided in the room were as advertised. Now the not so positive: Overall, the service at the hotel was awful, and it was't until we decided to stop relying on hotel staff for any support that we began to truly enjoy our visit. Some examples: upon arrival, we pulled into the valet area to unload luggage and check-in. Though there were several bellmen available, none seemed interested in providing any assistance, despite our numerous attempts to request some help. After approximately 10 minutes, one finally offered to assist, but only after we had fully unloaded our belongings onto the curb. Check-in was quick and easy, but when we arrived in our room (at approximately 4:30 PM, well after the designated check-in time), we discovered that it had not been cleaned. The prior guests' food, soiled linens, and other trash littered the room. We immediately contacted the front desk to inform them of the problem. Astonishingly, the response was that no other rooms were available, and that housekeeping would get to it when they could. After approximately 30 minutes, someone from housekeeping arrived, armed only with a document noting that the problem was not the fault of the housekeeping staff, but of a front-desk error. That person then left without cleaning the room. A few minutes later, a bellman arrived with our bags, and thankfully he too was appalled by the condition of the room, unloaded our bags into a closet so that they would be out of the way, and immediately contacted housekeeping to rectify the problem. Approximately one hour after being notified of the problem, housekeeping staff finally arrived to clean the room. Later that same evening, we asked the concierge for directions to the nearest grocery store. The concierge was initially unable to provide any directions at all. A second staff member attempted to provide directions downloaded from Google, and handed me a printout directing me to a grocery store more than 20 miles away in downtown Orlando. Ultimately, another guest was kind enough to provide directions to a grocery store only 3 miles from the hotel. But hotel staff never did provide any helpful assistance. Upon returning from the grocery store, we again pulled into the valet area to unload groceries, seeking assistance from the bell staff. Unfortunately, we we unable to locate anyone to help. After parking in the guest lot and carrying the groceries into the hotel, we noted that no fewer than 4 bellmen were socializing near the fireplace, with none outside to provide assistance to guests. At that point, we made the decision not to rely on hotel staff for anything further. And the remainder of the trip was quite enjoyable.

The Boardwalk is just a short stroll from these parks, or there is a boat and of course, the bus. We also like the entertainment on the Boardwalk at night. We are not early-to-bedders, so we enjoy doing something after catching the fireworks shows or Fantasmic, etc. The Boardwalk always has something going on - a magician, jugglers, a man playing the piano - not to mention the bicycle rentals or carnival type games. It is always nice to grab an ice cream cone and sit and people watch. There are several restaurants on the Boardwalk. We have tried Spoodles (even the pizza window is great) and the ESPN Zone. The candy shoppe is great for the kids and the bakery has quick breakfast items. We have heard that the toehr restaurants are great. We stayed in a 1 bedroom villa. It was spacious and clean.

Service at the check-in desk and bell services was outstanding. I would highly recommend requesting a room on the upper floors as close as possible to the elevators to reduce noise and walking. Those hallways are long! Our room was very nice and clean. We had a studio with a queen bed and a pullout sofa, which was fine for out two young kids. Being able to walk or take a boat to Epcot and Hollywood Studios was a huge plus and basically our main reason for choosing the Boardwalk. The boat ride is nice and relaxing vs. taking a bus. One downside I should mention was that after staying at the Pop Century, which had a food court, we found the food selections at the Boardwalk to be inconvenient and overpriced. I didn't think this would be such an issue, but it was. In hindsight, I wished we would have stayed at the Beach Club Villas across the lake for this reason alone as it has a food court.

The view of the pool was nice, and sitting on the balcony was peaceful, but I would suggest a view of the boardwalk instead. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Service was excellent. On the downside, self-parking is quite a ways from the hotel. They should provide close temp parking for checkin. We got lost trying to find our way back to the lobby (the hotel winds all directions and hallways are long and not very well marked). There are very good restaurants on the boardwalk, but none exist inside the actual hotel, although you can get room service or fix your own food in your kitchen. My only complaint was that the Disney customer service line balked at giving us the hotel lobby phone number; it would be wise to get it when you check in. My most positive comment on this hotel is location. There is a riverboat to Hollywood Studios (or a long walk), a bus to Disneyworld, the monorail between parks, and the boardwalk, outside, so we never had to drive anywhere. (although they need to post a schedule of how often and how late these transports run.) Overall, we had a great stay and will stay here again if we come back.", "Date": "September 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milford", "Title": "\u201cBoardwalk Villa Great for Families\u201d", "Author": "colfax74", "ReviewID": "UR20319574", "Content": "I just got back from staying 7 nights at the Boardwalk Villa. I was there with my wife and two sons, 3 years old and 10 months. My parents also came. Basically it was two joining rooms. 1 room was larger than the other. The larger room had a whirlpool, washer dryer, king size bed, full kitchen and livingroom with a pullout sofa bed. The other room had a queen bed, with a sofa bed and a small refrigerator and an area to wash dishes. A huge savings was to have food delivered to the hotel prior to our arrival. We did not do any cooking, however just to have snacks for the kids, muffins, donuts, PBJ, yogurt, cheerios, etc.. was great. Since we had to play things by ear due to naps it was great to have nosh in the room. Plus we also ordered bottled water, canned soda, milk, etc.. We also packed snacks, PBJ in a backpack for the parks. You will really be suprised how much $ you can save on just eating out once per day vs. three times. My wife and I ended up under budget on our stay because of this. They delivered the food to the hotel prior to me checking in. I placed the order online about 4 days prior to leaving for Disney. They recommend you do it ASAP. I ordered from gardengrocer.com. Bell services received the food and kept it in a refigerator until we checked in, that was a GREAT service. To know we had a stocked kitchen when checking in was awesome. We were able to check in early too which was nice. The check-in was painless, your room key also held your entry to the parks. You can also charge things using your room key if you set that up at check in with a credit card. The pool at the Boardwalk was okay. My 3 year old could not go on the slide as the slide warns that its for advanced swimmers. The Yacht Club looked like it had a nicer pool. The leaping horse libations /cabana located next to the pool was nice. For under $5 you can get a PBJ sandwich, carrots, and apple sauce. The location of the hotel was great. 7 min walk to Epcot or 1 stop on the ferry. Disney's Hollywood Studios (formerly MGM) is about a 20 min ferry ride. Animal Kingdom, Magic Kingdom and Downtown Disney all about 20-25 min bus ride. Bus pick up is in front of the hotel. Walking path to Epcot and/or Hollywood Studios is in the back of the hotel off the boardwalk. The boardwalk itself was very nice. There were a lot of street performers at night, and it was really lit up a night, very festive. I ate at ESPN CLUB which had the most moderately priced menu. Average entree was anywhere $13-$16. Also ate at the Big River which was a little more expensive than ESPN. Food was okay, nice beer selection as it makes all its own beer. Spoodles and Flying Fish Cafe required reservations. However after 9pm you might be able to get in. Flying Fish had a very expensive menu. Jelly Rolls which is a dueling piano bar has a $10 cover and has drinks only. The dance hall which is a music club has no cover but I did not go there. If your planning to eat anywhere at Epcot or if you plan any character meals make your reservations ASAP. I called the dining hotline and just about . every restaurant and character dinner was booked. I was able to get on a waiting list for Germany. One of the best services that the Boardwalk offers is the airline/luggage check in. That was fantastic. We didn't have to worry about bags or anything. The magical express bus picked us up, we went right to security once at Orlando airport. The staff were frendly, the rooms were spacious, clean, and the staff were very friendly and accomodating.", "Date": "September 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place To Stay\u201d", "Author": "AldoPignotti", "ReviewID": "UR19962006", "Content": "We're in the Disney Vacation Club and have stayed at the Boardwalk eight times now.

I can't think of anything negative to say about the villas. We were on the 4th floor facing the \"quiet pool\" which was very nice. The pool on the other side has a 200 foot waterslide where you come out of the clown's mouth and is a big hit with the kids as well as adults. Our room was a little far from the elevator but not too bad the elevators always ran smooth and usually never a long wait. The rooms were the cleanest I have ever stayed in. We had a washer/dryer, kitchen which furnished all appliances and dishes, utensils, dishsoap, papertowels. The beds were awesome - the kids loved the fold out sleeper in the living area. If you stay 7 or less nights you get maid service on the 3rd day of your stay but that only consist of trash removal, clean towels, and replenishing soap, coffee etc... You can always ask for more towels or whatever you need and they gladly give them to you. Also you can request your room to have a full cleaning but they charge for it. Staff was always friendly and ready to assist you with your needs. They have a community center for the kids next to the quiet pool which is a big hit especially on rainy days. The boardwalk always has a lot going on - a lot of fun. The ESPN restaurant was great - compares with cost of an Applebee's or Fridays. Going to Disney we knew it wouldn't be cheap and it wasn't. Some value places we found to eat were right on the boardwalk with the little stands set up. Chicken fingers and chicken sandwich meals were $7.00 and the kids loved it. Also if you go to the General Store things are a lot higher than a Krogers - we bought our pop, juice, and beer at a gas station in walking distance called Hess and they have the same prices as we pay at home. Also another plus was you could take your own drinks down to the pool area. The parks are nice but expect the long lines and hot humid days during summer. The fast pass is great -you put your ticket in a machine and it tells you when to come back without having to wait in the long line, but you can't use it again until you ride that ride.

The only thing I can say that is a negative is that the rooms need to be updated. We had a one bedroom suite for the first couple of nights as that was the only room available (even though we booked 5 months in advance). The bathroom was not as nice as I had hoped. The tile in the shower was actually kindof gross. I just didn't feel that the rooms were really clean and wouldn't walk around barefoot. The utensils in the kitchen were not thoroughly cleaned - there was food stuck to the forks. Good thing I bought plastic utensils for our trip. After the first two nights we checked into a studio. It seemed cleaner but the toilet was wobbly, wallpaper was coming off and the light in the bathroom was very dim. I had stayed at the Contemporary back in April for a girls' weekend and actually felt it was very clean compared to the BWV. I don't think I would stay at the BWVs again until they update. However, when my husband and I stayed at the Boardwalk Inn we really liked it and felt that it was clean. But that could be because at the Inn there is housekeeping on a daily basis where the Villas see many families with little kids and only get maid service on the 4th and 8th day of their stay.

It has a \"roller coaster\" like slide where you slide out a clown's mouth. It is fast and fun for kids and adults alike. 3) The rooms are in pretty good shape. You can tell that they are a little worn. It would be nice if Disney replaced the carpets and put flat screens in the room. 4) We used Disney transportation including the Magical Express (to and from the airport) and were very impressed! I am not sure why anyone would want to rent a car or pay $100+ tip for a town car service when Disney's Magical Express is free. You are paying more than enough for a Disney Vacation. When Disney provides a complimentary service I think you should take advantage of it. 5) My family and I were on the Basic Disney Dining Plan and we enjoyed it very much. After totaling up the cost of what we would have paid (if we were not on the Disney Dining Plan) we saved more than $400 for the week. It is a good value even though the tip is not included in the plan as it was in 2007. The Basic Plan is more than enough food.

This would not have been our first choice otherwise. This review is intended for those seeking to compare a Boardwalk Villa studio to other properties, either on or off WDW grounds. Studios do not have full kitchens (but do have a kitchenette), DVD players (I'd missed that detail, so I'd brought DVD's for my son but had nothing to watch them on), nor washer/dryers (although there is a free laundry room on the first floor, which I'd discovered on our last day - you only pay for the detergent). I believe all the above are included in 1-bedroom and larger units (we wanted a 1-bedroom, but none were available). Our room overlooked the Luna Pool. At first I thought this would be too noisy, but it turned out okay. It's only noisy during the day when you're up anyway. It's quiet at night when nobody's in the pool. We were able to see the fireworks our first night. This was our first time staying on a Disney property, so I cannot compare it to other DVC resorts. My first impression upon arrival was how lovely the resort is. The lobby area is nice, and the whole boardwalk area has a great vibe. However, when I entered the room, all I could think about was how dated and worn it was. Although the paint seemed fairly fresh, and the carpet was newly cleaned, the drapes and old-fashioned bedspread (germ factory) need updating. The bathroom is poorly lit, and has that irritating fan that goes on automatically when the light is turned on (so you can't leave the light on all night as a nightlight due to the noise). The person who cleaned our room never wiped down the bathroom sink properly as the faucet had toothpaste spray from the last guest (I had to wipe it down), and the little whiskers my husband shook out of his razor from his morning shave remained there the duration of our stay. That left me to wonder what else in the room hadn't been cleaned. As we are not DVC members, our room was \"cleaned\" each day, with fresh towels, bed made, and coffee and cups replaced. We called engineering about two maintenance problems (broken cabinet door, plugged up bathroom sink), which were both fixed in a timely manner. What I liked: -Location. Easy walk to Epcot. We also walked to Hollywood Studios, which was very pleasant. We took the boat back from Hollywood Studios, which made several stops first (Swan, Dolphin, Yacht and Beach Clubs), so keep that in mind if you're in a hurry. Boardwalk is great. -Pool. Theme parks? What theme parks? My son was content to go down that spiral slide all day long. -Towels. Nice and fluffy, unlike the worn sheets. -Fold out couch. Actually more comfortable than the bed. Amazing. -The convenience of staying on-site, such as the Extra Magic Hours and the free parking (we drove to Animal Kingdom). -Disney-style service and friendliness (other than our housekeeper who couldn't clean a sink). What I didn't like: -The aforementioned datedness of decor. -The aforementioned iffiness on the cleanliness. -The morning bus to the Magic Kingdom made several stops before getting there, and was standing room only. When you're trying to take advantage of Morning Extra Magic Hours, maybe they could run the shuttles more efficiently. -Not sure if it's worth it. We paid rack rate which is a LOT. Maybe it's worth it if you're on points, or if it's not high season. The rooms at the Boardwalk are \"just okay\". If you're not paying much, the location might make them worth it.

For 5 fabulous nights we stayed in a 1-bedroom standard view suite. We overlooked the front entrance (opposite side of the boardwalk) but heard very little noise. We were ~5 rooms away from the fastest elevators - longest wait was 15 seconds - no kidding! Other reviews I read described the floral decor as dated and although it was not my taste it wasn't annoying. The kitchen was equipped with everything - stove, microwave, fridge with freezer, dishwasher, toaster and the all imporant coffee maker. Dishes, mugs, silverware is also included right down to dish soap and fresh sponge. But remember to bring basket type (not cone) filters unless you want to use a paper towel. We had groceries delivered from Garden Grocer (excellent selection and service!) which made for easy breakfasts in the room. There is also a loud washer and dryer in the room. The pull-out sofa was cleverly designed with the attached cushions stashed under the very comfy queen-sized bed - no complaints from our well-rested kids. A TV with DVD/VCR player, table, breakfast nook, 4 dining chairs & 1 reading chair completed the room. The master bedroom had a wonderful king-sized bed, reading chair and TV in armoire/dresser combo. Each room had its own balcony with 2 chairs and table. The bathroom was split into 2 spaces with a sink in each. The master bath had a wirlpool tub while the other had a steam shower and toilet. We had plenty of fluffy towels (the good ones!) and did not mind that we only had towel and trash service on the 4th day of our stay. The lobby is decorated beautifuly with lots of whimsical touches. A large round banquette topped with a carousel and the flying horses chandelier were my favorites. Check-in was quick with no wait. The staff could not have been nicer - especially bell services. Every area was clean and sparkling - kudos to housekeeping. The pool was being renovated and we had the option of using the Beach/Yatch clubs' pool but it was too cold for swimming during our stay. Activities on the boardwalk are numerous and we were disappointed we did not have more time to enjoy them - especially the night-time street performers who drew large crowds despite cool weather. We did rent a surrey bike and had a blast pedaling our kids around. The ESPN club was packed on Sunday and looked like a great place to watch a game. Our son loved the arcade attached to the club as well as the arcade next to the fantastic gym - muscles and bustles. Don't miss out on the fantastic bakery - worth the extra time on the stairmaster! I am still savoring their cheesecake brownie - beyond delicious. The shops were nice with very pleasant clerks. We wished we had time to try the Big River Grill & Brew Works. The BoardWalk is located between Epcot and Disney Hollywood Studios (still MGM to me!) Both are an easy 10-15 minute walk - note there is no bus service from the BoardWalk to these parks. There is a boat that runs between the parks but it also stops at the Swan and Beach/Yatch Clubs. So unless the boat is at the dock it is usually faster to walk to and from MGM (or get off at the Swan and walk over the bridge which joins the Swan & Dolphin to the boardwalk area.) The boat goes directly to & from BoardWalk and Epcot but again it is faster to walk unless the boat is at the dock. The buses from Downtown Disney, Animal and Magic Kingdoms also make numerous stops and we found it faster to get off at the Swan (usually the 1st stop) and then walk over the bridge. Despite the chilly nights January is a wonderful time to visit WDW - low crowds meant very few lines and easy navigation through the parks. We found the Unofficial Guide to be a great resource and their crowd level calendar ([-]) was right on.

I highly recommend the Epcot area for a stay and the Boardwalk villas are fabulous.

We stayed at the BoardWalk Villas from December 5th - 11th. The weather was fantastic with sunny skies and temps ranging in the mid-70's to low 80's for our entire stay! We really enjoyed our 1 bedroom villa (#5026) and highly recommend the villas if your budget can allow it. Our room was a corner unit at the end of the hall overlooking the pool and canal to MGM. I read a lot of reviews about the elevator being far away, and if you consider a 3-4 minute walk to the elevator \"far\" then yes it's far. We were at the corner of this property and never felt that the walk to the elevator was daunting. We used the stairs a lot just for the convenience factor but I understand that if you have a stroller this is not an option. Here are some specific observations: *The Magical Express bus service from and to the airport was great! *Room was clean and the daily maid service was nice. You don't get daily service if you're a vacation club member. *Having the extra bedroom was great as it allowed our four year old to sleep in comfort without us having to worry about waking him up. Whirlpool tub as well as the washer and dryer were also nice options. *The pool was fun, though my son spent most of his time in the smaller kiddie pool. He was intimidated by the clown slide, but not because of the clown but rather the height and speed. Pool was heated though the heater was down one day we swam. *Internet access is $9.95 per 24 hours of service. They did supply an ethernet cable in the room if needed. *Holiday decorations were up and everything looked very festive. *Staff was overall very friendly. I will tell you that if you stay anywhere for a week you're bound to run into an employee that isn't having a good day. Don't let this ruin your stay, just move on. During our stay I saw several instances throughout Disney where families were up in arms about very trivial things. It seems like a waste of time and energy to me. *Walk to Epcot was about 10 minutes or less. If the boat isn't sitting at the dock, it's much quicker to just walk. If you're planning on taking the monorail at the front of Epcot, you're going to be looking at a 20-30 minute walk from the Boardwalk to the loading point. *Boat ride to MGM is about 15-20 minutes from the Villas once you get on the boat. You can also walk to MGM if you like, which may be quicker than waiting for a boat. I was told there was no bus service to MGM from the Boardwalk. *Bus service between WDW theme parks was overall very nice and seem to run about every 20-30 minutes. Keep in mind that if there is a wheelchair or scooters on the bus that it does take time to off load and load these so this can increase wait times. Be patient and if you REALLY need to be somewhere on time, don't push your luck and go early. *I read a post that you can get \"protective\" rubber sheets or padded sheets from housekeeping at all WDW Resorts to protect the mattress from potential bedwetters. All I can say is that the Boardwalk Villas didn't have this and it would be wise to call ahead to your resort to confirm this if you think you'll need it. I asked the maid for this and she came up with a nice solution and provided me with what looked like the inner liner of a shower curtain. While my son is 99% potty trained, we felt it best to do what we could to protect the pullout mattress. Being at Disney we knew he would be extra tired and this can certainly be a contributor for bedwetting accidents. *If you're a family with young children and plan to spend most of your time at Magic Kingdom, you may want to stay somewhere closer. Location can't be beat if you're going to spend a lot of time at Epcot and MGM. *We ordered groceries online from GardenGrocer that were delivered to our hotel and left with the Bell Hop. Highly recommend this if you need to order a larger quantity of food. The grocery store on the boardwalk does have a few items but the selection is limited and it is pricey. *Entertainment on the boardwalk is fun, though we were pretty beat at the end of the day so we didn't see too much. *We ate at the Boma restaurant at Animal Kingdom Lodge one night and since there was no direct bus back to the Boardwalk Villas we took a van taxi. For 4 adults and 3 children in our group, it was only $13. We thought it was money well spent as the kids were getting tired. The other option was to take a bus back to one of the theme parks (Animal Kingdom) and then catch another bus back to the Villas, which could take some time. *We were on the Disney Dining Plan and we thought it was well worth it! Be aware you do get a lot of food and finicky eaters will be harder to please. Overall, we had an excellent trip and can't wait to return, though we'll probably try another resort to mix things up. I highly recommend going during the non-peak periods as the it was crowded enough as it was. Also, be sure to go when the parks first open as the first 3 hours had very minimal waiting times for rides. Also utilize the Fastpass system and this will keep you on schedule to see what you want.", "Date": "December 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cNot impressed\u201d", "Author": "Housefrau1", "ReviewID": "UR11130213", "Content": "This was our first stay at the Boardwalk Villas.

Villas are awesome.\u201d", "Author": "DallasTraveler06", "ReviewID": "UR10176458", "Content": "This was our second stay at the Boardwalk, the first visit being on the Inn side, rather than the Villas which we selected this time. We stayed in a 1-bedroom villa, so we had a separate master bedroom, with a king-size bed, large soaking tub and separate sink area, which joined with the common bathroom (shower, toilet, sink). Then there was separate living area (couch and TV), eating area with table and chairs, and a generously sized kitchen. Though we have stayed at many Disney hotels and have come to Disney World at least 15 times, this was our first stay in accommodations which have a kitchen and living area. I must say it was really great. This trip was rather short for us, so we didn't have the chance to make much use of the kitchen (which was well stocked with nice dishes, glasses and silverware), but we could see how it could really increase your comfort level while at Disney World, especially for longer stays. There is so much to see and do while at the theme parks and other attractions, that it is really nice to be able to retreat into your room, have snacks available there, and know that when you wake up in the morning, you can make coffee, toast, or whatever you might like, and not have to drag yourselves out to a restaurant for breakfast or to get a cold drink. Disney World tends to tire you out severely (or that is our experience because we go and go) and it is really great to have a \"room\" that is more of a home base than just a bed and a bathroom. Of course, it does come with a price - we paid $540 per night (including tax) for the one-bedroom villa. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept on and it was very appreciated. The large counter space in the master portion of the shared bath was really nice. This accommodation is set up so that you can truly unpack (large closet, bathroom drawers, kitchen cabinets) and feel like it's your little home for while you are there. I will say that perhaps the maintenance/upkeep seems a little more lax on the Villas (timeshare) side than on the Inn side. We experienced moldy areas in the shower, loose doorknobs, drawers with missing drawer pulls, etc..If you remain aware of how much you're paying per night, this can actually start to be irritating, but it's important to remember that a large part of the amount you are paying each night is to be so close to Epcot and MGM - plus you have the draw of the Boardwalk. In our opinion, the Boardwalk is the best place to stay on the whole Disney property (all 47 square miles). I think next time, we will stay longer, and pay the additional amount per night for a preferred view IF that means that your room opens up to the Boardwalk - that would be really nice. We ate at 3 restaurants on the Boardwalk this trip: The Big River Grille, the ESPN restaurant and Spoodles. Our meal at the Big River Grille was only average at best, and we quickly racked up a $100 bill. The food was disappointing, certainly, but it was nice to sit outside on the Boardwalk. The ESPN restaurant was far less expensive - I believe our bill was under $30, but we only had nachos, iced tea and a chicken sandwich. I would only eat here again, though, if there were no other options, as it didn't stand out. We do love Spoodles, though, and breakfast there is always a hit. They have great coffee, good food, decent prices, and the atmosphere is a wonderful mix of Mediterranean decor. Finally the Boardwalk does have a cute little bar not far off from the lobby, which we have enjoyed before because it was quiet and relaxing, but we found that on a Saturday night after the fireworks, it was crowded and understaffed. They do stock a nice selection of liquors which cannot go unmentioned. We definitely recommend the Boardwalk Villas to anyone who is able to pay the high rates - if you are able to manage it, it will be worth it.", "Date": "October 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philly suburbs", "Title": "\u201cWould stay here again and again!\u201d", "Author": "TwinMomPA", "ReviewID": "UR8693870", "Content": "The Boardwalk is such a lovely place, and you can't beat the convenience.

We were within walking distance to Epcot, which worked out very nicely for us, since we were on the Disney Dining Plan. We did not think it was too noisy at all. Our room was right above a restaurant and it really wasn't that bad. We traveled with our 2 1/2 year old and he never woke up from it. Our son slept in the pullout and it worked out perfectly.

We would do the park hard all morning, return back to our hotel for the nap and then head back out. One of my sons favorite things about the boardwalk is the nightly entertainment, or as he called them \"the silly men\". they are just people who are walking around the boardwalk and juggling, doing magic tricks or a combination of both. He was mesmerized by them! Our rooms were clean and very nice. The decor isn't my taste, but it was clean and nice and that is all that matters to me. Since this is part of the Disney Vacation Club, there is no housekeeping, they do take out the trash and gave us new towels once while we were there . The pool was nice, but it was not something my son got into. He was too small to use the water slide, and frankly the giant clown is kinda freaky. The pool at Saratoga Springs is our favorite! The elevators are far away and it was a bit of a hike to get to them. The first day it seems the longest, but after that, you get kinda used to it.

One of the best things about the Boardwalk is it's location...just a short walk to Epcot and a boat ride to MGM...this makes a big difference when trying to plan your strategy to see all the parks. The other thing we like so much are all the restaurants and stores beneath your \"apartment\". We have so many good memories of our stay there...just a note though...if you are looking for peace and quiet....I would recommend the Key West resort at WDW.

Everything was spotless and in perfect working order. The Disney \"magic\" was every where. Pool was fun and exciting, yet very comfortable. Our room was at the VERY end of the hall, right next to Jellyrolls. This was no problem for us. There was no late-night noise as the bar closed. The nearby stairs made it a breeze to exit the building for the BW or MGM. The kids became evening regulars at the Community Hall. They played a few games briefly then checked out a free DVD for the night. If I was forced to give one negative about the resort, I'd say it's the absence of waiters/waitresses at the pool. It would have been nice to have someone bring us our drinks. But, no biggie.

We then probed further becuase we wanted two rooms, be it a one bedroom suite or two separate rooms as we have a 2 1/2 year old and a 1 year old. So we were convinced by reservation agents after looking at the kids suite at the Loews that we needed to book a villa at Disney. There are only three resorts that have villas, the Beach Club, Saratoga Springs and the Broadwalk Inn. A Villa consists of one master bed room with a living room and kitchen that has a sofa bed. Which was prefect for what we needed. Based on that we booked a Villa at The BroadWalk. Our first night my 21/2 year old touched a wood blind which fell on him and cut his hand. We called the manager which offered to call his engineer and we asked for bandaids. Bandaids never came, the enigineer went back and brought them. Our room was dirty when we first checked in. Bed was uncomfortable. Housekeeping decided not to show up on the 3rd day. The manager said it was because we booked a time share room, which no one had explained we would be treated different and no one explained that it was time share.

We voiced our complaints and within two days the water was warm and we all enjoyed the pool. The staff was always friendly and accommodating. I recommend a room facing the main pool with the slide. The boardwalk rooms could invade your privacy. A successful trip depends on your ability to get a room near the elevators.

The boardwalk was a lot of fun-especially with the entertainment and the surrey bike rentals. Spoodles restaraunt was outstanding with great service and food and the Bakery was pretty good for pastries in the morning.

It was great to take a walk on the Boardwalk when the kids got rammy and also there are a couple of nightclubs on the Boardwalk if you want to grab a drink. We were fortunate to have my in-laws with us so my husband and I went to ESPN Sports restaurant one night. We had twp adjoining rooms. I guess you would call them a 1 bedroom (1 bedroom, full kitchen, living room) and a studio (queen size bed, fold out sofa, and kitchenette that included microwave and fridge). They were great. We were able to have dinner 2 nights at the villa and for very little cost. We also had breakfast most mornings. We arranged for our car service to stop at Publix before we arrived so we bought basic groceries and whatever we had left we told the housekeeping staf that they could help themselves and they were appreciative considering we left a lot of unopened things.
