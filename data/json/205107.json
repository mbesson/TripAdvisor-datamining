Also each window opened to the courtyard. We had three nights in a wonderful apartment and saved money. So again Thank you Francesco and Hotel Oxford.

I have to say that On arrival all worries disappeared instantly. Yes the hotel is \"vintage\" in style - but it is one of the friendliest and clean hotels i have ever stayed in. We heard some people moaning about room size and location with-in the hotel but our room was fab and overlooked the street out side. some reviews moan about the street noise but as this is a hotel in a city im not quite sure what people should expect!!?! it didnt bother us at all. This hotel building is over 100 yrs old so it has some odd shaped rooms, corridors etc but i personally think this adds to the charm. All the staff speak very good English and are very helpful when it comes to booking taxis and tables at resurants. We even found a spar shop about 5 mins walk up the street so save your self some money and buy bottles of water and snacks there. out and about water/little bottles of coke cost around 2.50 Euros each!! but only 70 cents in the spar shop. The hotels location is great for getting all over rome, we pretty much walked everywhere. we used the metro with no problems! Get a Roma Pass at the airport when you land, especially if you plan to use the metro as it is free with a roma pass! plus you get to que jump at some of the major attractions with 2 free entries and discounts on others....

La Pentolaccia on via Flavia, La Fontana on via Liguria and Brancaleone on via Sicilia. If there was a downside, it was with Appian line tours. We used them on 3 occasions and were picked up at the hotel and returned, but on the last trip we were picked up from the hotel but dropped at the piazza Berberini on the way back. Not a huge problem but we had been to the Vatican for 4 hours and an uphill walk without a map was too challenging and we had to take a taxi, adding to the expense of the day (60 euros each) It is easy to get lost, even after 3 days of familiarity. Moral of the story is to take a map wherever you go and ask if you will be returned to your hotel. It is worth having the guided tour-we saved hours of queuing at the Colosseum and Vatican.There were lots of people everywhere and I wouldn't recommend a trip in the summer months!

Fine if you know and can pace your self . The Rome tour bus stop is about 600 meteres awaynot the 200 that the hotel will tell you. Again that's fine if you know.

The street is pleasant and pretty safe, so you can walk there in the evening. There are pizzerias, restourants, shops and more nearby. The hotel has an elevator to first and second floor.

The room was very clean, little space (I took a single room), big bed, everything in the room is old, but good. Good, pretty new bathroom, all things in it worked properly, hot water (really hot water). Very quiet. Good breakfast. Pretty helpful staf. I stayed in the hotel 17-21/10/11 - the weather was changing to cold. You have the air condition in the room, but it works for cool only. On the reception they said me, that they may change it to heat in november only. I thought, that it is joke, checked with some people who live in Rome for many years. That's true. So be aware. But I have to say, that it wasn't cold in the room, maybe the walls are thick enough, or something else. Also, when you make an order check the hotel's site, the price in it is a little bit lower then through the agents. One more thing, when I was ordering, there were special gift, for ordering 3 nights and more - a free dinner. The way, it was written, I thought, that I'll get dinner every evening, during the check in, they said me, that it means 1 dinner only.

I keep reading about the friendly staff, but in all fairness, we didn't really have to ever deal with the staff so I can't really comment. They didn't seem THAT friendly when we did deal with them though. The breakfast was ok, never stopped B&B before so got nothing to compare it to. There could have been a better selection of food though. And if you wanted anything cooked, you would have to pay extra. The only thing that got this hotel an \"average\" review was the location. For my first time in Rome, I was really happy with how close it was to everything. It was no longer than 15 minutes walk from Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps. This made exploring really easy. We were close to many restaurants and bars so we got out of the hotel as much as we could. When we left, they charged us an accomodation tax. This isn't unique to this hotel, but we wasn't aware of it and we had to use our last few Euro's to pay. Bit annoyed that our travel agent hadn't made us aware of this or included it in our price. Overall, I would stay there again if the price was right. But it would be my last choice.", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDisappionted\u201d", "Author": "Happinesss", "ReviewID": "UR117725917", "Content": "We thought this was suppose to be a four star hotel but in fact it was more like a 2 star.

The bathroom was clean enough and the shower powerful, however the cubicle arrangement was novel (a square shower tray with one sliding glass door and slither of shower curtain). This was a problem because the shower curtain blocked the plughole, leading to the shower tray overfilling and flooding the bathroom! Water then cascaded out down the step, under the odd sliding door arrangement in place and onto the carpet outside!

There is a large supermarket about 5 mins walk but nothing much available on it's doorstep other than a few restaurants and a sandwich bar. Checking in - Staff were very attentive and helpful. On arrival the receptionist checked us in swiftly, gave us a map and talked us through all the main attractions and how to get there. He also gave us tips on where to eat, such as the Trastevere area which turned out to be a great recommendation! One note of caution, the map was at times very misinforming. We found some of the roads were incorrectly labeled which resulted in us frequently straying off track! Strangely enough the map seems to be handed out widely throughout Rome! We instead reverted to our Time Out guide book maps. Hotel and room - the hotel itself is definitely not a flashy four star. More like a top end three star. The decor is very cosy and comfortable throughout the hotel, at sometimes dated. Our room was a very good size for a standard room. Very spacious, clean with a large bed! The ensuite was fairly small but modern and clean. The rooms were cleaned daily and towels changed. The satellite TV has a good variety of channels covering many languages. Sleeping was not an issue, very quiet. However, a note of caution for less mobile travelers, the lift is absolutely tiny and it appears some of the floors are only accessible by stairs, very narrow and steep stairs, however staff did happily take our luggage up to our rooms for us. Breakfast in the mornings was average. Not hot food but good selection of cereal, breads, pastries, drinks and few cold meats and cheeses.

And the kind of upmarket (but not scary) department store Rinacentere (sp?) is just a 5 minute walk. It was a little bit disappointing not to be in the thick of it ie Trevi Fountain ect, but on the other hand it was peacful. Also, it was no more than 10 to 15 Euro to get back to the Oxford Hotel from any of the tourist points in Rome. Also, the best breakfast of any 3 star I stayed in (I 'did' Rome, Venice and Florence) - lots of fresh food, variety, and best of all, you could boil your own eggs. So much better than all that congealed scrambled egg that everywhere else offers. Highly recommended for english speaking families, especially if you are driving (as there is a garage not far away).

The bus to the train station is only one block away and costs one Euro so don't get taxis as they are too pricey.

Diet coke is 0.70 Euro, water 0.45 Euro!There is a safe and fridge in the room so we stocked up on drinks for each day. The open air bus is a fantastic way to see all the sights as you can hop on and off all day long and headphones are given to you to listen to the history of each building or obolisk you pass. The price online for the bus is the same in UK as in Rome. The staff are really lovely and went out of their way to look after us. No amount of questions were too many and I am baffled on the comments about poor cleanliness as our room was always spotless. The cleaner was lovely. The buffet is substantially Continental even though it states FULL on the BA website. BA's error not the hotel's. You only need one bottle of water in Rome as there are fresh drinking fountains absolutely everywhere to keep topping up at all sights, parks and most main streets. Catch the Leonardo Express from FCO airport to Rome Station at 15Euro per adult, children are free. No need for expensive transfers. Take good shoes as the cobbles are too much for sandals and flip flops. We bought cheap Primark converse and chucked them at the end of our really enjoyable week at the Oxford.

The bathroom only had a shower and not a bath (smallest shower in the world!) The queen size bed was along one wall with a mirrored wall on the opposite side, with the TV on the same side as the bed!? Difficult to watch any TV (good job we didn't want to). However after realising how small this room was we noticed a tray with a half drunken cup of coffee with a couple of croissants and 3 packets of light bulbs! We complained about this straight away and the Manager waived the fee for our late snack in the bar. I should have asked to change the room but it was late and we both very tired. - I was also a bit disappointed with the Breakfast. I booked because it said Full breakfast was included, however it doesn't include HOT items, this you have to 4EUR extra. They bring out your Tea or Coffee and then you can help yourself to cereals, croissants, pastry, bread rolls and you can help yourself to orange juice. Okay onto the positives, location wise it's a 10 min to Via Veneto which has plenty of restaurants which can be pricey, further down towards Barberini there are some shops and more in the side streets which are well worth a look. We had dinner one of the evenings at the hotel and it was absolutely delicious and very good value! We had Antipasti to start, I had sliced Steak with some parmesan while my wife had Mozzarella and parma ham. Both were excellent. The main meal we both had pasta (I think cannelloni) and that was excellent as well. With both anti pasti, main meals and two drinks the bill was 34EUR, excellent value! The other positive was the waiter at the bar, very good and spoke good English and gave us very good service each evening we were there. Overall I probably wouldn't stay here again simply because of the price. My tip is if you get room 124 or any other room that seems ridiculously small then ask for another room, the pictures show larger standard rooms so ask for one of them!

The hotel itself is relatively small, but plenty big enough, if you know what I mean. The rooms are average sized and very clean and comfortable. The bathrooms were well equipped, and again kept very clean every day, and the shower was invigoratingly powerful if you wanted it to be! The double bed was of a good large size and comfortable and the room generally had nice ambience. The only downside was, at least in our first floor room, the traffic noise at night/early morning was audible from buses etc. Although not a busy or noisy area and not really noticeable in the day, in the dead of night when you're trying to sleep I was awakended by passing large traffic occassionally. A set of 4 euro ear plugs put paid to this though and we slept soundly after this. Maybe I'm just a light sleeper. The hotel food was excellent, and the restaurant was far better value than any nearby restaurants, particularly wine, which was half the price. We had a couple of evening meals there and these were lovely, excellent value for money and standard. A beer is 3.50 euros and wine 12 euros a bottle. Pasta dishes were around 8 euros typical. Breakfast was typical choice, nice selection of cereals, croissants, rolls, ham and cheeses and fruit. Choice of coffee or teas. Certainly good enough for us. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The hotel is run by the same small group of hard working people every day. The barman was friendly and the atmosphere was that of a family environment. The bar was a nice place to relax in the evenings after dinner with a wide selection of drinks, nice ambience, and like I said, good value for money. Location You need to turn right out of the hotel to walk towards central Rome and its atttractions. On our first exploration to get our bearings we mistakenly turned left and walked for ages without finding anything nice or significant! Via Veneto is 5 minutes walk and this has some nice pavement restaurants and a Hard rock cafe. We eat in Il Peperone twice and Ciao Bella, which is at the bottome of Via Veneto. Both were nice meals, but the drinks were very pricey, particulay compared to the hotel bar. 25 euros typical for a bottle wine, and 8 euros for a small beer. Needless to say we drank water in the restaurants and saved our alcohol for the hotel bar! No meal cost more than 40 euros for the two of us, that was generally two courses. To reach the main attractions of Rome you need to turn right out the hotel, and walk along Via Boncompagni which becomes Via Ludovisi (after crossing Via Veneto). A left at the end of the road followed by the next right will bring you to the top of the Spanish Steps. This all takes about 15 minutes. This is the fastest and shortest route to the rest of the main attractions, the Pantheon and Trevi fountain are within 10 minutes from here. We walked to the Coliseum from the Hotel in around 40 minutes (along Via XX Settembre), and walked to the Vatican from the hotel in under an hour, which we did twice. The walking made the holiday because it was a great way to see the city, and there is so much to see as you go. I guess to start with I thought we were further away than I was expecting, but this ended up a blessing. If you want to be right on the doorstep of everything though then you may find it a little far out due to the 15 minutes to reach the Spanish steps. Warning - Taxis. The hotel is only a 15-20 minute walk from Termini train station, whilst carrying a case. This didn't stop the taxi costing 30 euros when we arrived, and this was apparently on the meter! My guess is he took us the long way, but if you're game, the hotel is easily walkable from Termini, and we walked on our return journey in 20 mins - well worth saving 30 euros. I might have got unlucky with the driver though, but it's impossible to agree a price up front as they say its on the meter - which was meant to be reassuring! Rome itself was brilliant, the attractions were all they were cracked up to be and more. Inside the Vatican was probably the highlight, particulary going up to the top of St Peters Basilca, incredible views, plus while your there you can see inside the top of the cupola. If you can, walk everywhere, far cheaper and you get to see and experience so much more. All in all a great break in a great hotel.

Also although there is a good selection of Restaurants in the area they are expensive, you can find better food more cheaply in more centrally located areas. On the positive side: The staff are very helpful and friendly and the facilities excellent, the room despite being small was very comfortable, good bed, shower and a television + internet all provided (although you have to pay for internet use).

Plenty of storage space for clothes, good sized wardrobe, and the room was of good size. Bathroom lovely again. BUT there are no irons- and you are not allowed them due to fire regulations, so make sure to do all your ironing at home. The staff were pleasant. The hotel has a very cosy, beautiful snack bar downstairs which is open until 11.30pm, where you can buy drinks, hot drinks, sandwiches and dessert (mainly ice cream and tiramasu in italy!). The barman was very friendly and smiley. There is a restraunt also- very good food at reasonable prices, and the lemon sorbet is delicious- you must try it, it comes in an actual frozen lemon! As is the vegetable soup. However when we ate there at 7pm on night the soup was delicious, then we came back 2 nights later (mainly for the soup!) 20 mins before the restaurant closed (9.20pm) and it was completely tasteless, like water, so maybe they were getting ready to close, all the soup had finished and the chef just made that up qucikly. Also our second course was quite cold too. So my advice would be to go early rather than late!! Location- The hotel is within I'd say an 8 min walk to Barberini square, where all the main restraunts are, buses, tubes etc. Then from there another 15min walk to Trevi fountain, Spanish steps etc. However we did get a bus to the Colleseo and Vatican, which took about 10mins from Barbarini. So the hotel is not right in the center, but you can certainly walk to anywhere you want or just jump on a bus (to be honest we never bought a ticket, although everyone did, as we couldnt find where to buy them from) the metro is 1 euro per single journey. The area around the hotel is really nice, beautiful buildings surround it and me and my boyfriend often took a nice relaxing walk late at night around the hotel and we always felt safe. Money- If you think Rome is cheap, think again! :) Prices for food, clothes, jewellery,cosmetics etc were the same as London prices or higher. But there are lots of very good quality silk tie and shirt shops that are very good value for money and have tons of choice. Also some shops we went into obviously saw us as the guilable tourists we were and over-charged us (we bought 2 bottles of barcadi breezer, 1 bottle of beer and a sandwich and were charged 24 euros!!) It wasnt till we left we realised but i guess u learn! So Id advice going to normal supermarkets/food shops rather than the small ones that dont use tills. The T.V in the room has many channels but all but 2 are in italian, the other 2 are CNN and a sports channel. It would have been nice to have a few more english channels. We found ourselves getting in late and wanting to cuddle up with a bottle of wine and a bit of tv late at night but all there was to watch was the skiing! (but u can get a 10 euro film- lots of choices, but we didnt really wanna do that every night) Overall a lovely pleasant, eegant hotel- will come back as soon as i can! p.s there is no room service but for 3 euro they will bring you breakfast to your room in the morning- very basic but nice I would definitely return here again anytime!", "Date": "January 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Port Huron, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cHotel Oxford - A welcome return\u201d", "Author": "Angspar", "ReviewID": "UR6348748", "Content": "This was our second visit to the Oxford and as per usual it did not disappoint! My family stayed at the Oxford November 2004. When we decided to return to Rome there was no question we would return to the Oxford. This time we decided to take on of the apartments located nearby at 77 Via Flavia. For our group of five the apartment couldn't have been better. Two bedroom, two bath, a very comfortable pull out couch as well as a well appointed kitchenette and a dining/living room, made this apartment the perfect home base for us. It was nice to see familiar faces upon our return to the Oxford. Stephano at the front desk is charming, friendly and well organized. He made us feel like visiting family instead of returning guests. What sets the Oxford apart is the wonderful bar. As bars go it's pretty typical, but the bartenders are not. Everytime we have visited the bar it is full of people like ourselves who were made to feel like they were the only patrons. It has the feeling of \"Cheers\" with a more contiental flair. The Oxford is located just off the Via Veneto near many restaraunts and local shops (don't miss the little Sauce shop located next to the charming La Lampada ristorante. The 'sauce guy' is very cute and knowledgeable about olive oil, pesto etc. And when you go La Lampada, Salvatore will make your visit special).

The hotel is a 10 minute walk from the Termini central station, a 25 minute walk from the Colosseum, and St Peters can be reached after about 10 minutes walking an a 10 minute metro ride. As Rome is such an expensive city in terms of accommodation, it is hard to use the term 'good value' when referring to the hotels on offer. However, the Hotel Oxford is one of the cheaper 3* hotels that I found, and yet in terms of the location, fittings, bathroom, cleanliness and ambiance, you would rate the hotel as one of the best in the 3* category. The highlight is the central location, which feels very safe, just off the Via Veneto, and near useful transport links. The downside is the breakfast - chaotic and limited. For me an additional minus point was that despite having booked a double room, and then emailing the hotel to confirm we would have a double room as confirmation, we were offered a twin room upon arrival. When I queried this, I was told that it was my fault as although they had promised a double room to me, they understand the word 'double' to mean twin!
