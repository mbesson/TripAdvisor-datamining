Hotel could do with some brightening up and fishtanks in the reception not to everyones taste. Could do with taking down the Christmas decorations (this is May not December!). If just a bit more effort was made this hotel could be really really good, as it was it was adequate, linen clean, fluffy towels changed everyday and free internet access are real plus points. Bathrooms clean but small with very tricky/large step into shower/bath which was rather precarious trying to get out when it was wet. Breakfast OK but nothing special, cereal, yoghourt and cheese and bread but don't expect a fry up! However on no account eat here in the evening - very poor. Staff friendly but refused to negotiate on reducing price of a pre-booked group meal which was very disappointing. Overall, for the price we paid as a group, very good value, with easy access to tram system taking you to the Sultanahmet area for the Blue Mosque, Topkali and Aya Sofia (there is a brilliant cafe nearby - cafe Locum - which can be highly recommended. Fitness suite, suana and swimming pool not open when we went (May 2011) so check first if this is important to you. Istanbul is a great city to visit!", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for Large Groups!\u201d", "Author": "LondonButtons", "ReviewID": "UR29032674", "Content": "I am a university student, and as part of one of my Modules, we got to Visit Istanbul. This was the hotel we stayed in, after reading the reveiws, i was bit wary of it. But in all fairness, it wasn't that bad at all. It was a bit of a gem stuck in an old shanty town. Alright so, the website lies a bit, the bar isn't open 24hours (they kick you out at about 11:45pm) and the restaurant for dinner is a bit dead, in fact i never say anyone eat there for dinner. The breakfasts are basic, and would avoid the fruit juices as it is made with their water (high in chlorine). The rooms were bright and airy, i didnt have a fantastic view, but some sides of the hotel got the view out onto the streets which was much more romantic. The cleaners were great and always cheerful! 1 MAJOR downside to the hotel was our first night... three girls in our group got into a bit of trouble. When they got to their room to unpack, someone knocked on their door trying to sell Pistachio Nuts, then asked if they were Turkish or Russian and without warning got a bit too touchy with one of the girls. The young man was reported and nothing else of the sort happened again throughout our 5 day trip. Aside from that, as i said the hotel is basic, but it gives you everything you need, with helpful staff who try their hardest with their english and to teach you a bit of turkish! Whilst we stayed there, 3 other large touring groups arrived. It is very accomodating to large groups, even providing tour guides, would recommend Yasar, who can talk for Turkey, but knows his stuff! When looking for restaruants, if you head up the hill towards from the hotel and round one of the side corners, there are some lovely little bistros! Some of the kebab stores are actually very nice restaurants, i had one of the best meals i've ever had in one. I couldnt possibly tell yuo what it was as the english translation was hideous reading 'Shrimps and Mushroom with lamp up cheese' ha! Well whatever it was, it was delicious! The Bars are scarce, the hotel bar is good but expensive 5TL for a can of lager (roughly \u00c2\u00a32.50), your best bet would be to get a cab or tram to Taksim which is like an equivalent to Oxford Street but smaller! =] Overall, was a fantastic trip! Bit places to visit were, Taksim, Hippodrome, Sehzade Mosque, The Spice Market (WOW!) and the Gelata Tower where you will get the most magnificent views. Also, if you fancy something different, pop on a ferry to Anatolia, where the views are wonderful and the food magnificent. I hope you all enjoy your stays! P.S. Superior rooms are very accomodating! Our lecturers had them and loved them! And check out the roof terrace at night... it's lovely!", "Date": "April 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, UK", "Title": "\u201cGood location, but that's about it\u201d", "Author": "nomoresorry", "ReviewID": "UR17185562", "Content": "I stayed in the Hotel Eyfel as part of a tour around Turkey, and it was by far the worst hotel we encountered, despite visiting some locations which were fairly off the beaten track, during the low season. The rooms are tired, to say the least, and there were frequent power shortages. Be warned: this hotel appears to double up as a brothel, as one might expect with such low rates; there were prostitutes soliciting in the lobby and bar in the evening. The staff and management turn a blind eye to this, and subsequently I felt uneasy walking from my room to other parts of the hotel at night, as there were so many shady-looking characters loitering in the corridors and on the stairs. It felt like the stereotypical 'seedy hotel' of Hollywood films. The restaurant wasn't terrible. The food was pretty grim, but not utterly inedible - you definitely get what you pay for. Breakfast was probably the best meal of the day. For all the bad points, it IS very cheap and the location in the central Laleli district is handy when visiting Istanbul's tourist areas - it is about a 10 minute walk or a shorter tram ride from Sultanahmet and the Grand Bazaar.", "Date": "June 24, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Eyfel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d502352-Reviews-Hotel_Eyfel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$66 - $431*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Kurultay sok.
