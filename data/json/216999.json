I have always found it clean and well managed. The rooms I've occupied were immaculate, and the furnishings and carpet in both the rooms and public areas appeared to be new. There were never any problems getting them to accept the internet rate at which I generally book. It is true that the property is not convenient to public transportation, which could be an issue for some but was not for me. There is a McDonald's on one side of the parking lot and an IHOP on the other, which is very convenient. I don't think that they even advertise that they provide breakfast, although there is coffee available and sometimes fruit.

This place felt every bit as budget as the price suggests. It's shabby and run-down and desperetely in need of renovation, the beds were uncomfortable, and ventilation in the rooms was basically zip. We were quoted one price but charged another upon check-out. Oh, and did I mention that their \"breakfast\" package consisted of awful coffee and a basket of apples? You get what you pay for. Even if you go in with the mindset that you're only going to be sleeping there so you don't especially need your digs to be posh, there's nothing comforting about coming back to an ancient, rock-hard bed and a subpar air conditioner. Another minus is that it's so far from the subway, and who needs that in a town like Boston? As for plusses... uh, the room was actually really big.

I was very happy with my staying there and really enjoyed it. The motel is very clean, quiet although my room was from the side of the road, but it was really nice. People on the reception are very helpful and there is a security man, staying there every night and that gives you the feeling of secure. There is not a breakfast at the hotel but this is not a problem at all because just next to the hotel there are two fast food restaurants (Mcdonalds and Ihop). About 2km from the hotel there are 2 shopping malls and you can go on foot only takes 20 minutes.
