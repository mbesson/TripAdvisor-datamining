Our second week we spent at the Monte Carlo in Las Vegas which was a 4 star hotel and though the Holiday Inn's room may not be quite as big or \"pretty\" we felt the Holiday Inn's value outshone Monte Carlo. We had Wi-Fi in the room - which is helpful when you are not travelling with laptops but only smart phones (Monte Carlo offered high speed internet by way of plugging in a cord - not helpful when you have a phone and not a laptop with you). We always had replenished toiletries and more than enough fresh towels. Room and bathroom was very clean and beds comfortable. Holiday Inn offered coffee facilities in rooms and had good TV channels. Holiday Inn offered a laundry room where guests could do their own laundry at no major cost - a few quarters and it was all done. Furthermore, they have an in-house restaurant and shuttle bus which took guests to \"hot spots\" (Seaworld, etc) within 3 miles from hotel free of charge. Two computers with internet access were stationed in their waiting area near check-in and was free of charge. My husband needed emergency dentist services and upon request the hotel staff assisted in finding a local dentist and made the necessary telephone calls on his behalf. The only tiny negative experience we had was when we checked in: the person on duty could not find our our booking but we showed our voucher, she made a telephone call and then found us a room. As for location. This hotel is not close to the harbour area but well situated for getting to the Gaslamp Quarter and less than 10mins walk to the local shopping mall, Horton Plaza. We managed to walk from San Diego Zoo back to the hotel via Balboa Park. It was a beautiful day and we enjoyed the sightseeing on our way back to the hotel. It took about 15-20min walk from the hotel to the harbour area but that was probably because we were sightseeing on our way and therefore in no rush.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lexington, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cHighly Recommend\u201d", "Author": "Hinky12", "ReviewID": "UR126302698", "Content": "If I return to San Diego, I would definitely stay in the Holiday Inn Express Downtown again. The employees go the extra 10 miles to make your stay in San Diego pleasurable. Midge is the very visible customer relations agent who not only welcomes you at breakfast and in the lobby, but gets to know the guests and does what she can to ensure the comfort of all the guests. We heard another guest say that Midge brought a cupcake with a birthday candle to their room when she heard there was a birthday to be celebrated there. The front desk receptionists always, (and I really do mean always) had a smile on their faces. They all serve as concierge as well front desk receptionists. No one that I talked to ever had to wait, and the receptionists called cabs, the zoo, restaurants, the bus and trolley line, and museums to help with travel arrangements for us. (Special thanks to Zulya and Martha.) There is a free shuttle (actually the hotel has two) and these will take you to the airport, cruise port, the Amtrak station, the zoo, or Balboa Park anytime you schedule them ahead, and on the spur of the moment if they are free. There are warm, freshly baked cookies in the lobby to welcome guests every evening. There is free wine and beer for two happy hours every afternoon. Every morning they provide a free hot breakfast with pancakes, biscuits and gravy, bananas, cereal, warm cinnamon rolls, pastries, coffee, all kinds of juices, eggs, and bacon or sausage. If you can't take time for breakfast, they give you a \"to-go\" bag with water, fruit, cookie, and granola bar. The hotel is three blocks away from a San Diego trolley stop. The hotel is an older building, but it is very clean, and the rooms are large. It looked to me like the carpet in the halls was new. I am sure the carpet in our room was new. Most rooms have a private balcony. Our room had a refrigerator, and we didn't even ask, so I assume they are standard. Wi-Fi was free, and worked great! We walked outside late at night (between 11 PM and midnight), and were not afraid in the least (we being two single women). The reasons I didn't give this hotel 5 stars is because it is an older hotel, the bathroom was small, the only sink was in the bathroom, and there is no room service or restaurant in the hotel.

This property was undergoing a renovation while we were there so it should be completed very soon. The staff were extremely friendly and took a deep interest in all their guests. They offer a very nice Manager's reception Monday thru Thursday in the main lounge area. What a pleasant time to spend with the other guests. The hotel manager made several appearances as well, inquiring about her guests stay and making sure everything was to their liking. The hot, complimentary breakfast was also better than most Holiday Inn Express locations I have stayed with. The eating area was large and had plenty of windows that looked out onto the skyline. This property also offered a reliable, complimentary shuttle that would take you to the airport or several other nearby attractions. We found this hotel to be a very good bargain compared to the other properties we considered for our stay. There are plenty of restaurants and grocery stores located in close walking distance from the hotel. We had a mini-refrigerator in our room so we could by some beer and wine locally. The only negative issue we had was with the free internet. I had a good 4 bar signal but the service was very difficult to log onto requiring multiple attempts and once connected it was so slow it was really unusable. I fortunately had my aircard along so we just used that instead. The manager did ask us if we had any problems with our stay during one of the happy hour receptions. We mentioned the slow internet service. She asked if we were on the third floor, which we were, and she said they were aware of the problem and were working on a solution. I noticed one reviewer mentioned the homeless people in the area. This property borders the Gas Lamp district and the entire area has a high population of homeless people.

I found an online rate through AAA for about $99 and then called the front desk to see if they'd match it; they looked it up and did so. The walk-in rate was much higher. I was very happy with the cleanliness and the staff of the hotel. Our main activities for the week were in Balboa park so the location was a big plus. I especially liked the free internet-use computers, internet access in my room, and the breakfast. The breakfast included things like cereal, muffins, microwaved scrambled eggs and something I'd never seen before, an automatic pancake-making machine. The breakfast room, however, was a bit smallish - less than 50 - compared to the number of guests. In general, I've rarely encountered a hotel situation where I just HAD to spend over $100 on a hotel to be happy. If I pay over $100, it's because I think I'm going to get something extraordinary. I don't see any evidence that downtown San Diego is any exception. If I go back to downtown SD and can't get Holiday Inn Express for under $100, I'll probably pick someplace cheaper; there are just so many hotels. So I'm glad I had a discount and was happy for the price. That being said, I was irked (although not surprised) to pay $18 to park in their underground parking garage. It irks me because I don't believe they incur anything like $18 in cost for me to park there overnight - maybe $1.80. In my view they are taking advantage of people who wouldn't know where else to park and they amp-this-up by giving you a somber warning at checkout that it's risky to park overnight in downtown open lots, which might be somewhat true. The only reason I tolerated it at all was because it didn't look like the parking garage could hold enough cars for every guest to park there - if parking had been free, I probably wouldn't have gotten a space. I don't mind paying for scarce resources; it's simple supply and demand. But the parking was 50% vacant, which tells me the management team needs to lower the parking price. $9 parking would have made this place \"Excellent\" for a $99/night price.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Clemente, CA", "Title": "\u201cOk, if you're in a bind\u201d", "Author": "Mvated", "ReviewID": "UR122249431", "Content": "Paid in full for room and checked in after midnight with a front desk agent that said \"I was just in the process of cancelling your reservation for good tonight\".

Also there is a stand with free coffee and lemonade. After 8pm free fresh baked cookies too! A free shuttle also takes guests to the airport and local attractions. There is also a swimming pool which we didnt get a chance to use and its close to 2 cafes and a take away pizza place. A short walk takes you down to a trolley terminal and the Gaslamp district and Horeton Mall.

Location - Centrally located reasonable walking distance to Gaslamp Quarter, Balboa Park, and the Harbor (no more than 15-20 minutes in any of those directions). Even seeing sporadic, harmless homeless, walks day and night felt perfectly safe. 2. Rooms were fine, except for those on first floor right over the entrance/parking lot (I think it was 125/127), where shining headlights and all-night conversations disturbed sleep. But they moved us after one night, so no complaints. The real gem is their free shuttle service, to & from the airport, the zoo (hence all Balboa Park attractions), and the harbor (officially the cruise terminal, but all harbor cruises are right there). This \"gift\" eliminates the need for car rental, as long as your destinations are within walking/trolley/bus range, or you don't mind the occasional taxi ride. Also saves the hassle of SD's notorious parking shortage, especially near sites. If free, the shuttle driver will pretty much take you anywhere within reasonable distance, just don't forget to tip (still less than a cab). 3. Breakfast was very good. Assorted egg creations each day, cool pancake machines that look like photocopiers, and an abundance of breads, pastries, fruits, yogurts, dry cereals, and cinnamon buns (yum), and of course, juices & hot beverages. Do breakfast right, and you can probably skip lunch. 4. Service - Front desk staff delightful, attentive, and profoundly helpful in every way.

The hotel is obviously old and has been remodeled. The room is rather modest in size, with 2 double beds a small table and 2 chairs another chair and a bureau that contained the TV and a mini-refrigerator along with 3 drawers. The closet was open style behind the entry door to the room. There is an iron and ironing board provided in the room and hairdryer in the bathroom. There is also a small coffee maker. We were on the 3rd floor and had sliding glass doors that led out to a balcony with a plastic chair and a view of downtown/waterfront, all-be-it a mostly obstructed view of the waterfront. The bathroom was a very tight squeeze. 2 People do not fit in here, one barely fits in the room. The toilet looks like one from the old school days. Enough said the bathroom was SMALL, but the linens were nice. Housekeeping does a great job. Our biggest issue was noise levels were REALLY bad in the rooms especially on the weekend. It appears to be a popular hotel for families/soccer teams/college kids, all of whom were noisy into the wee am hours and sometimes even drunk and shouting in the hallways at 2:30AM, hotels are for sleeping and rest not partying and personally I think \"guests\" such as these should be asked to leave the hotel. This was the biggest problem on weekends, weekdays were fine, mostly business travelers, quiet rooms and hallways. Weeknights there is a wine/snack hosting in the lobby for about 2 hours, that is a nice touch for business travelers. Breakfast is below the lobby on level M1 and consists of a typical hotel breakfast, eggs (scrambled some days, microwave omelets others), bagels and muffins, toast, juices, coffee, cereals, and some days pancakes. Basic but sufficient. We had lunch at the new orleans style restaurant down below one afternoon and it was very good. Many thanks to Midge, who makes you feel as if you are right at a friends house. She and the staff helped make this trip enjoyable. The hotel is only 3 blocks (about a 5 minute) walk from the Orange Line which can take you down to the convention center or the waterfront just a few stops away. It is also only about 5 blocks from the Mall downtown. San Diego is an easy city to get around in and the location of this hotel is good for the price you pay.

They had used the same hotel before due to its proximity to our intended location. They told me in advance that it was nothing to write the parents about, but perfectly adequate for a few days' stay. We are both members of IHC's loyalty program and thus have seen a number of Holiday Inn properties and knew what to expect. I arrived on their complimentary shuttle from the airport and was given access to my room despite it being a few hours prior to the normal 3pm check-in. LAYOUT Doing some homework I discovered this property has a storied past. It was built as an annex to the historic 1920s El Cortez Hotel, and at one time the world's first moving sidewalk connected the two properties on a span over 7th Avenue. This hotel is perched on the side of a steep hill, so that the entrance on one side is about five stories higher than on the other. A parking deck, two restaurants, conference rooms, offices, stores and a church fill the space under the hotel. Parking is included for guests, but drive carefully in the garage because the columns are very close together and battle-scarred from people scraping them. A glass elevator on the low side connects the lobby level to the street. The lobby faces San Diego Bay although the view is punctuated by tall buildings closer to the water. This can be enjoyed both from the lobby lounge where IHC members are treated to happy hour during the week, and an adjacent terrace, partially covered, with tables for guests to relax, eat or smoke. Across the driveway is an outdoor pool and terrace with chairs and tables (but alas no umbrellas) all of which were kept scrupulously clean. The lobby floor and two levels above it contain the guest rooms. There are two elevators which are used not only for the hotel but the parking deck below it, and they are painfully slow so we mostly walked. ROOMS My room was a king ordinary facing the street. The furniture was all in good repair and a laptop-capable safe and empty fridge (vs. a minibar) were welcome discoveries. Wireless Internet is available and included. The bathrooms are very small (there's a bumper on the door to keep it from smacking the toilet) but nicely renovated and everything was spotlessly clean and in working order. Beds are comfortable with a variety of pillows (labeled for your firmness preference). My friends' room was a two-queen with a large terrace facing the pool and driveway area. Otherwise very similar in amenities. We both noticed that the air conditioners, while new-looking, struggled to keep the rooms cool. If having a view or a lot of daylight is important to you, make sure you mention this when you arrive. On either end of the hotel there are a handful of rooms whose windows face a wall only about 3-5 feet away... not for the claustrophobic! FOOD There is no full service restaurant owned by the hotel. However, in the building (accessible by the outdoor elevator mentioned above) on the 6th Ave side is a little place called the Indigo Cafe which serves a variety of food (including breakfast at any time), has a liquor license, and is open until 9pm most days. Free breakfast was available in the conference area below the lobby, and was well-stocked and fresh if not overwhelming in variety. Hot and cold cereals, scrambled eggs, cold hard-cooked eggs, bread, muffins, pastries, bananas, oranges, apples, etc. were daily staples. Most days we were there they also had biscuits and sausage gravy, and on the last day this was replaced by bacon. The hot cinnamon rolls were a big hit with someone in our party. Given the chaos we encountered at the last Holiday Inn breakfast (Eatontown, NJ http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g46868-d98139-r70561651-Holiday_Inn_Tinton_Falls_Eatontown-Tinton_Falls_New_Jersey.html) it was well-run and we were very satisfied. None of us could stomach the coffee but others seemed to be enjoying it so maybe we're just java snobs. We found good stuff at the Cortez across 7th Ave. DRINK IHC loyalty club members are invited to a happy hour in the lobby on weekday afternoons. Otherwise there is no bar owned by hotel. The aforementioned Indigo Cafe has a liquor license, however, as does the Cortez cafe across the street. SERVICE Everyone there was very friendly and helpful. The entire property is kept very clean and the staff were quick to help with any need.

The general manager Jason Tharp was also excellent and dealt very efficiently and fairly with the small problem we had re. his bus driver wasn't available to pick up a few of the people who had flight problems and arrived late. Colin knew in advance what time and how many were coming in on each flight and they hired extra buses to meet us at the airport; even the general manger was there for much of the day to meet and direct us and to make sure everything went smoothly. The day we were checking out which went extremely well ; like check in did also , considering we were a large group; Colin and Jason were working their butts off to make sure everything went smooth which it did. This is not the ritz but people; be serious! Consider what you pay. I was shocked to read some of the reviews as all my group found their rooms clean; beds comfortable, fluffy thick towels ; bathrooms small but excellent working shower heads and water pressure and this hotel went out of their way to provide a large room to accommodate us all at their free, way above average breakfast as we were all eating and checking out at same time to go to port; They had also hired staff to keep the breakfast area immaculate; no dirty plates and keep their breakfast items refilled continuously. Of course, the pick up at airport and the shuttle to port were all complimentary and extra buses were hired due to the size of the group.

This hotel is about 4-5 blocks from the Gaslamp district. It's very close to Balboa park and the zoo. They have a decent breakfast that comes with your stay and a 5pm happy hour with free beer, wine and soft drinks in their lobby. Their lobby is a very lovely space with a wonderful view of the city and the breakfast area had ample seating for guests at the hotel. The rooms have wonderful views as well. Now on to the negative part of the experience. We arrived at the hotel around 4pm on a Tuesday. We were told our room hadn't been cleaned yet and we would have to wait for it to be ready. It turned out to be well over an hour, spent sitting in the lobby waiting, after having driven for five hours. Next I was told by the uninterested staff member at the front desk that the room only had two double beds (no sofa bed, as their website would lead you to believe) and roll aways were not an option because the rooms were too small. We were traveling as a family of four with two teenagers, a boy and a girl. I had chosen this hotel thinking we had three beds in the room. The kids sleeping together was not an option. The hotel staff suggested one of us sleep on the floor with a blanket and pillow. We were to be staying for three nights. I thought this was an unacceptable suggestion. After this conversation with the staff, my husband and I sat in the lobby discussing the possibility of finding a new hotel. At this point the manager came over and offered to put us in a suite the next day at no extra charge, but the stipulation was we had to make sure we were at the front desk first thing in the morning to make sure we got the room, as soon as the current guests checked out. Not sure why they couldn't just hold the room for us. The first night had to be spent in the overly small room with our son sleeping on the floor, in lieu of sleeping with his father or sister. The next day we were at the front desk at 8:30am, with our bags all ready to check out of the small room into the suite. The hotel held our bags for us while we were out site seeing. After being out all day, we arrived back at the hotel about 4:30pm. The room was not cleaned yet. I was told their computer was down, which apparently affects their cleaning schedule. They told us we could put our bags in the room, even though it was not ready. The manager warned us there was a rip in the sofa bed in our suite. We went up to our room which looked like someone had been having a party in it the night before. The sofa bed had a large rip in it, as the manager had said, and had a sunken spot in the middle, which you would roll in while sleeping. The room had burn holes and black stains all over the carpet. There was a dent in the ceiling above the bed (which looked like someone had hit their head while jumping on the bed). Our lamp was plugged in to a very scary looking crazily rigged extension cord taped under the carpet. The suite was a handicapped accessible room which meant it had no tub and an odd shower. This was fine, but I would think it's something the hotel might mention when checking you in. The room was better than our small one, in the sense that we all had our own bed and a lot more space, but it was the most run down suite I've ever been in. The next day, once again we were gone all day and came back in the evening and the room hadn't been cleaned. We had to mention it to the maid, who then cleaned the room for us at about 6pm. Computers down again? The pool is very tiny and 3ft at it's deepest spot. It's also fenced in and was locked up most of the time we were there. Their hotel parking ramp is the tightest I've ever seen. Very challenging to get in and out of. Good luck with a large car.

The breakfast was very good and helped to start our day. A good restaurant nearby would be helpful. There are a few but, not a lot of choices unless you drive or walk several blocks. Of course, the shuttle was available to transport you if you choose to be in by 11:00 p.m. The Sales Manager is also really helpful. We were visiting our Navy Son and he was more than accommodating in working with us on the reservation for \"Navy for Moms\" even up the the last miniute as we were uncertain about flight schedules.

They were cheerful and funny and equipped us with almost everything - toothbrushes, toothpaste, mouthwash, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, deodorant, bath gel, shower cap, makeup cleaning cloth - we needed to get through the night without any of our personal items. The only thing missing was clean underwear, socks and PJs! We stayed twice at the Holiday Inn. The first time was 5 nights before our cruise. The second time two night after the cruise. These are the positives and negatives of the hotel: POSITIVES: 1. Great front desk staff 2. Good size rooms and bathrooms 3. Good hot breakfast 4. Shuttle is quite good with friendly drivers but will only take you a radius of one mile from the hotel. You also have to make an appointment the day before you need to use it but once they take you to a place, you can call them for pickup same day. 5. Nice pool 6. Walking distance to shops and close to pier 7. When we returned to the hotel after our cruise, it was 10:30 AM. They got us a room right away without waiting at all and that was terrific. NEGATIVES: 1. There were problems with both rooms that we stayed in. The first room was a handicapped accessible room (we didn't ask for one) and the shower head kept rolling down the rail. The maintenance guy could not fix it. He said they didn't have the parts for it. On our second stay, the faucet was leaking really badly and the mirrored door of the closet fell off the hinges as soon as I pushed it! So the repairman came up and we waited for him to fix them. We think the hotel should have checked those things before guests moved in. 2. The beds were uncomfortable and we suffered painful backs after sleeping in them for a few nights. 3. The hotel looks old and rather rundown. 4. The maids were very unreliable. We'd put our sign to make the room hanging on the doorknob all day and come back at 4 PM to find the room unmade. We would then call the front desk and the maid would knock on the door at 4:30 PM when we wanted to have a nap and she had ALL DAY to clean our room. After that experience, we called down to the front desk every time we were about to leave the hotel to tell them to have our rooms made up and we'd return to find the rooms unmade and we'd have to call again and again.

We have stayed in the Gaslamp and knew budget friendly hotels are hard to come by. We opted for the HI Express because of the location and the reasonable parking fee of $12 per day. The staff was super friendly and very helpful. The breakfast is nothing special, but has your basics and it's convenient and included with your stay. Housekeeping came a bit too late for my taste. We would return to our room around 3:30 pm and it still wasn't cleaned. But, when they did clean, the room looked great. The bathroom in our room (King room) was VERY small and only one person could fit in there at a time. I wish I would have brought my own hair dryer to allow me to clear the bathroom sooner. This would have allowed my husband to get in there in a more timely fashion. The elevators are frustratingly slow, but we learned our way around using the stairs. We didn't use the pool, but it looked clean and well kept. It was quite small however. The parking garage is super tight. It brought back fond memories of Europe and having to maneuver your way around safely. Go slow and be careful. If you plan on walking to the Gaslamp Quarter, I would HIGHLY recommend that you exit the hotel down the 6th Ave. elevator and go down 6th Ave. to get down there and return. The first night we made the mistake of using 7th Ave. Quite a scary bunch on this street! We felt much safer utilizing 6th Ave. All in all, a decent place to stay for the price.", "Date": "July 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "MrPizz", "ReviewID": "UR8103351", "Content": "This is a good hotel and a good value for the money .

Boy are we glad we did. We chose the Holiday Inn Express in San Diego because of it's proximity to the entertainment and it's relatively low cost. Let me address the pros and the cons of our stay. Pros: -The hotel offered a complimentary continental breakfast each day which gave a fair selection and really saves at least $15-$20 per day in your spending. -Each night during our stay there was a manager's appreciation happy hour around 5:00 and lasted about an hour. During this time there was complimentary beer and wine. What a nice touch! -The staff always went out of there way to help guests out. First, they are great for recommendations for places to eat and things to see. Second, they have a shuttle van that they will do their best to allow you to use and save on the cab fare. Finally, we decided to add on a day to our stay and they actually reduced our daily rate for all days that we stayed. -Walking distance to everything as long as a couple mile walk isn't too bad for you. Cons: -The parking is slim and you have to pay either $15 or $20. -There aren't any restaurants extremely close. -Noise from the street and airplanes can get loud. I am a heavy sleeper and it didn't bother me at all. My wife is a lighter sleeper and she said at times it was bothersome, but not terrible. -Overall the cost per night seemed pricy for the quality, but relative to all costs in the area, it's not terrible. As a note about the city, we visited a baseball game at Petco Park and walked there. It was a great park and a nice experience. The San Diego zoo is absolutely amazing. The shopping and nightlife in Gaslamp is a great time. Visit Moose McGillycuddy's on Wednesday night I believe for $1 drink specials. As long as you don't mind a mainly college age crowd, the drinks are cheap, the crowd is upbeat and Jamie the bartender is one of the best bartenders I've ever been served by. Also, fit in Coronado if you get time, but plan to be underwhelmed by the Hotel Del unless if you are a true lover of history. Enjoy San Diego for all it has to offer. Truly one of if not the best city in America!", "Date": "July 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "galpalmzmd", "ReviewID": "UR8040297", "Content": "This hotel is within walking distance of everything . . . we walked to the piers, Balboa Park, the Fish Market, Convention Center, Little Italy, Gaslamp Quarter, etc. The in-hotel bistro serves good food at reasonable prices.

The only problem we had was upon arrival when we phoned for the shuttle to pick us up at the airport they said they would arrive in 5 minutes, but it was more like 30 minutes. While we waited other area hotel's shuttles were in and out in approximately 10 minute intervals. When we got to the hotel there were four other shuttles parked out front just sitting there.
