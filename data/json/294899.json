Our room was well equipped, with the exception of an Iron, which I am finding out is common thing in European hotels. The size of the room was good by European Standards, room had a view of the pool and the patio. One very important thing, while taking a shower make sure to give your self some room to move around, as the water temperature will jump up to the tune of 20-30 degree without any reason for brief moments, if you are not careful you could hurt yourself trying to get away from the water. while this seems trivial, it really isn't, The Internet went out one night at 4:00AM the staff came up quickly and fixed/resat and check with us to make sure it was running once again. kudos to the staff.

The public areas were comfortable although the drinks in the bar were expensive-$15 for a gin and tonic. But the biggest surprise was that the restaurant was excellent. We had dinner there on our last night being too tired to go forth and hunt for someplace. The food was imaginatively presented (read beautiful to look at) and excellent to taste. I was sorry I wasn't more hungry because I could have eaten some more of what they were serving. The hotel didn't seem to present its restaurant as a special place for dinner, but I would definitely stay there again just to eat there. And I say this as a certified California \"foodie.\" Mind you, not cheap but worth every penny spent. Another grand thing about the hotel was that it was across the street from a tram stop where for a few lira you could go straight in to the historic district of old Istanbul and then catch the tram \"home\" at the end of the day without having to worry about changing trams or getting lost. It is hard to miss the tram stop at Haiga Sofia in the heart of the historic district. I suspect the hotel is a little cheaper than the Barcelo Eresin Istanbul, a more historic and old world style hotel across the street and from my point of view you would get good value for your money spent at the Holiday Inn Istanbul.

For example, when we arrived we realised our room was overloking the busy street and was noisy. A complaint and we were reassigned a room at the back of the hotel without quibble. The bad bits: the rooms are frighteningly small, the neighbourhood not terrific. It is not well located for restaurants. Ask for a back room as the ones on the street are noisy.

We got carted half way across town and taken to a flea pit of a hotel. We promptly refused to stay and demanded to be taken back to the hotel. I informed the guy at reception I was not budging and told him I knew he was lying about the flood. They had actually overbooked we found out from a member of staff. I demanded our rooms that we had had booked three months ago. To cut a long story short they got us a room and extra beds for the first night and then for the next 2 they got us the 2 rooms we had booked. We did get our free meal and wine in the restaurant, but to be honest wish we hadnt bothered. The meal was terrible. Our appetisers arrived after the main, the food was cold and the service was terrible. After we had drunk our free bottle of wine we ordered extra and agreed we would pay for the next bottle. The brought an opened bottle to our table with a glass already out of it, and wanted us to pay for a full bottle! There was a wedding on in the hotel every night we were there. It is obviously very popular with locals and they are keen to keep them happy, which is understandable however guests cannot use the pool as the wedding is set around the pool. Not ideal as we were on a girlie weekend and a pool was part of the plan to spend some time there, along with time in the spa. The spa looked nice but only provided massages. We were expecting to have some beauty treatments. Maybe we should have checked first. The hotel itself was clean and the tram stop outside was a great way to get into town, however I would like to point out to ladies that the trams are very full. I mean very FULL. No seating room.

One thing I was not sure about, at sometimes I understood that hotel services such as \" Turkish Bath, Fitness center, Internet access \" were NOT free but it seemed that because we had IHG previlage club card we were granted all these services for free.

The hotel itself is great - we were lucky enough to be upgraded to a newly refurbished suite, which was lovely, with a large & functional bathroom. The only surprising aspect was the coloured flashing \"disco lighting\" feature, which was completely out of place in the calm spa style decor of the room! It was fairly quiet in the room, and we slept very well. The public areas are clean & bright, and the area around the outdoor pool looks inviting (it was too cold to use the pool in March). The highlight is the spa; as a resident you can use the sauna, steam room and Turkish bath. Unusually (for Turkey) these are all mixed, but the attendants will explain the protocol to you and provide towels, slippers and a pestemal (a cloth which you wear all the time to preserve your modesty). There is also a jacuzzi, gym and various massage treatments available for a (relatively high) charge. The downside - the prices for the bar, restaurant and room service are very high, but I suppose this is what you might expect in a 5* hotel in a major city. You don't have to use these services as there are plenty of alternatives nearby.

Also the Tramway connects to the subway system to and from the airport, though this option doesn't exist late at night. 3) Nice breakfast--olives, cheeses, fruits, omelet station, breads, hot savouries, and juices/coffees. If included in the rate, it's a nice way to start the day. Otherwise, I think it's really expensive. 4) Friendly, though not so polished, service. Staff seems to be experienced and helpful when they can be. 5) Very clean rooms. 6) Surprisingly nice pool area, with grasses and lounge chairs. Newish \"mini-gym\", with a few cardio and nautilus equipment, though nothing special. CONS: 1) Location isn't really walking distance to much. 2) Restaurant and room service are bafflingly expensive and not the best quality for dinner. 3) Front Desk didn't know the rate included breakfast; I don't like to be forced to \"prove\" I have breakfast included--I booked through the hotel's own web site! 4) Room was just OK--nice big plasma TV, oldish beds that were comfy but not the best quality linens, etc. All in all, I'd recommend this hotel if it's still cheaper than in-town places.
