The Travelodge is ideally located- a 2 minute walk from Marylebone Tube Station. If like us, the tube line was closed on the Sunday due to engineering work, Baker Street Tube Station is only about a 5 min walk. We arrived at the Travelodge at 2pm, and were advised we could check in at 2.30pm, or pay \u00a310 and check in at 2pm. We decided to wait until 2.30pm and had a drink in the bar. They have different offers on in the bar \u2013 2 bottles of Stella Cidre for \u00a36. When we went back to the bar later in the evening, the Stella Cidre offer had been removed. If they are going to change the offer, then please remove it from the your billboards and in the lift. When in the bar, the receptionist who also served us the drinks, came and took our documentation and then returned with our key card. We stayed on the 5th floor. The room was OK \u2013 double bed, 2 wardrobe spaces, only 1 wardrobe had a set a coat hangers, so it was good job we brought our own. Tea and coffee making facilities, which were re-stocked everyday. A small flat screen TV. The room was so hot, we had to turn off the heating (radiator) and kept the window open, I say open -ajar, as it would not open that far. The curtains were short and the light would come in \u2013 not ideal if you are trying to sleep, with a bright light glaring in. The bathroom- this has a lot to be desired. The shower had no power and when used the water would build up all over the windowsill. The bathroom window which overlooked offices, was distorted, to avoid prying eyes from outside. But beware, I would say you could still see the silhouette shape of your body when showering, The bath was held together by sealant, patched up to avoid further leaks. The toilet leaked and did not have a dual flush like most toilets in Travelodge. The bathroom needs a total refurb Room desperately needs a lick of paint, new carpet and new mattress. The bed dipped in the middle, so if you rolled over in the night, then you would sink in the middle! Check out time was 12pm, on the last day before we were due to vacate the room. We went out for a walk and when we came back to the room at 11.30am, only to find that we could not access our room. We went down to Reception where the card had to be re-registered. We didn\u2019t experience any noise from our room, maybe some from outside, but we had the window open. Towels were changed every day Why do Travelodge only have 3 pillows- we learnt this from previous experience and asked when we first went up to our room for another pillow. Its not the Ritz, but good if you are on a budget and lets face it how much time do you actually stay in your room in London -so much to do!", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Merseyside", "Title": "\u201cgreat for what I needed\u201d", "Author": "TheRoverMerseyside", "ReviewID": "UR125499445", "Content": "booked this travelodge as it was only \u00a325.

Yes my singal room 115 was small, but it was warm comfy and clean, the bathroom again was small and the shower curtain got in the way when you used the toilet but the shower was powerful and hot. The bed was fairly comfy I managed to sleep in it (but I had, had a few pints when I got in it). My room was on the first floor by the lift and yes I could hear people coming and going but I was not affected by street noise. The staff were welcoming and freindly and check in was over in minutes. So if you intend to spend a lot of time in your room then maybe here is not the place for you, but if like me you just want a place to store your bag and get your head down in a centrally convienient location then its fine for the money. Not 5* but it was what I needed. I did not use the restaurant so I can not comment on this, I used the coffee bar across the road which did a good breakfast sandwhich.

We arrived at 2.30 to be told we were to early to check in but the guy behind the reception desk (HUGO) was really helpfull and told us to wait ten mins and he will sort us out. True to his word he did and had a sense of humour which you dont find that often in some other hotels in london. The room was fine but the bathroom needed an overhaul because it looked like a last minute botch job but the shower worked and so did the toilet so everything was ok. The single glazing window with the aluminium frames did let in some coldness but the heating was working so everything was cosy when we got back from a day out. The bed was comfortable and had a really good night sleep until the rubbish truck turned up outside to collect the tonne of glass bottles from the bar over the road that was not a nce wake up call but never mind. On the second day we decided to try the hotel bar for food and drink and we were pleasantly surprised with the food (burger and chips) the guy behind the bar makes it himself and was a little snowed under when two lots of families came along straight after each other, but he coped. drinks offer at the bar are not bad either. Everyone moans or picks faults with the rooms but you are in london in an economy hotel in the center of London so dont expect the ritz or savoy hotel standard.

The bed was tucked under the draughty window and between both walls, yes both walls the room was (just) the width of the bed and only a little longer about 6ft by 8ft, the same as a prison cell... The walk in shower room had a built up door ledge that I tripped over twice during my stay, there was a curtain around the shower that could not be moved so sitting on the toilet involved wrapping yourself in shower curtain and it gave the room a massively claustrophobic feel. I didn't use the bar or restaurant, but went down for breakfast in the morning, unfortunately the cooked breakfast looked bad enough to put me off eating anything else and the coffee was too hot.

Nice, good size double room with small plasma TV, mini wardrobe and desk with the usual kettle and tea making facilities. Bathroom was decorated nicely with marble effect walls and everything working fine in terms of toilet, sink and shower although a bulb was out above the shower and the extraction fan did not work which is a must in a room with no windows apart from the ones that open about 4 inches in the main room. The shower was powerful and water was hot for a good while even after the morning rush and afternoon. The room overall was very good but I feel it was missing a main light on the ceiling as there was only one above the door and next to the window so could be dingy at times. The bed was in need of a new mattress as I woke up aching but for a sale room I couldn't complain really. The only major thing I had a problem with was the noise, I know London is a noisy place, I have stayed many times in various areas but this was particularly loud day and night, alright if you are a heavy sleeper but I have trouble sleeping at the best of times so this was a real problem. The Sunday night seemed to be fine, a little noisy during the day as expected and quieter at night but the Monday was bad, taxi's, vans, motorbikes and lorries seemed to drive past relentlessly until about 4am.

They didn't even bother to repair the disgusting grouting the bathroom, and their 'Mr Sleep' can't have been here as it is so noisy because the windows facing onto a main road with Marylebone station opposite aren't even double glazed. But I expect all this because I have stayed in various Travelodges in the London area and it doesn't get much better except if the refurbishment is more recent or is a building that wasn't previously a hotel, it hasn't had time to get so tatty.

The window itself (which actually had a hand print and other marks on when we arrived which we cleaned ourselves) didn't open much which wasn't that much of a porblem but I should imagine the 6 inch gap between the window and the frame on one side might cause problems in winter or when it rains really heavily. There was also no telephone - first time we've ever stayed in a room with no telephone. That said the bathroom itself was basically clean although the towels were well past their fluffy best (if I had them at home would be in the \"rag bag\" for cleaning use) but they were clean and smelt so. The bedding was also clean and fresh although I did notice a very small blood stain on the duvet cover which did lose them marks on this aspect. The bed itself was reasonable comfortable although we did experience stiff necks but this might be the fault of the rather flat pillows. Also one extra pillow is a bit mean and what I thought was a blanket turned out to be a bath sheet stored with the pillows. Odd. We did borrow an iron from reception and it worked well although when we went to return it there was nobody there and, despite ringing the \"summon\" bell as instructed, nobody arrived so we had to leave it in reception. We noticed that there was nobody on reception a lot of the time and you'd wander past queues of people waiting for somebody to arrive so you could check in. Not good although it has to be said very little staff were in evidence apart from the service in the bar which was good. Secondly, we didn't have breakfast but did have something to eat in the bar. It's a bit functional but the food itself was reasonable and also good value for this part of London. Beer was a bit expensive although the waitress did point out the 2 for \u00c2\u00a36 offer on cider but we're not both cider drinkers. All in all this hotel has fallen in standard compared to when we last stayed which is a crying shame as with a bit of TLC and effort given it's position it could be an absolute jewel in Travelodge's crown. This was the first time we've stayed in a Travelodge and to be quite honest if they're all of this standard I think we'll pass. Fine for a one night stay if all you need is a bed but if you're planning a weekend despite it's location you might get a bit fed up of the ambience.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location!

Our room (105) was massively noisy and the \"double glazing\" made little difference to the noise. Moving on to the staff, we had two rooms booked for three nights each, both under my name, but booked separately, because this used to be the only way that the best room rate could be guaranteed. We confirmed this on check-in and were told that this would be no problem, we just needed to get our key cards re-swiped each day. We did this, although the first time took 15 minutes because the staff member didn't know what he was doing. On returning for our third night, one of our party found that his room had been totally emptied of all his possessions. These had been placed (all together - clean clothes, dirty clothes, toothbrush, phone charger) in a used carrier bag and labelled \"lost property\"). We are in the process of complaining formally about this but I am determined never to use Travelodge again if I can possibly avoid it, unless I have visited the hotel before and am slightly confident that it won't be a hideous slum like this property.

The shower had no proper tray and the shower curtain couldn't prevent water going all over the floor- so be sure to brush your teeth and use the toilet BEFORE having your shower! And the shower head itself was at a high height and could not be lowered; this, combined with the fact that several of the shower head holes were blocked, meant that water dribbled out at random angles and gave you a shampoo whether you wanted one or not.

We had booked a few months previous online, booking their saver rate rooms for a great price. It wasn't the easiest booking system to use - you couldn't just punch in your start date to end date for the cheaper rooms - you had to book each night individually and hope you were given the same room for the entire stay. We thought we had booked four nights, but somehow managed to only book three. Problem was that we weren't aware of this and nobody let us know until 4pm on the day we were supposed to leave! Yes, I realise this was our mistake, but when we checked in the receptionist asked how many nights we were staying, we replied 'four' she then went on to say 'so checking out on Tuesday 8th' which was correct so we had no reason to think that we had booked wrong. Each day we had to go back and get our swipe key reprogrammed which was no problem. On the Monday (the day before we were leaving) we got back at 3pm, got our key reprogrammed and went back to our room. We realised we only had one towel, so my friend went back downstairs - she came back a few minutes later saying we weren't booked in for that night and if we didn't pay \u00c2\u00a3100 for that night straight away we would have to leave and pay a late check out fee. I found this very confusing as just an hour before we had been at reception getting our key reprogrammed and nothing was mentioned! We went downstairs and spoke to the girl on reception who was extremely rude to us, so we asked to speak to the manager. The manager has obviously no idea of customer service as he too was extremely rude, raising his voice several times, all in front of other customers. We admitted that obviously we had made a mistake with our booking, but we couldn't understand how it hadn't been picked up until late that afternoon - if we had been told at check in we could have easily arrange alternative accomodation for the last night. At 4pm though, that was a little trickier. He would accept no responsibility despite us being told at check in that we were there for 4 nights. He told us that the receptionist would have had no way of seeing how long we were booked in for (??) and she would have taken our word for it! In the end we had no choice and had to pay for that night's accommodation. He would not budge on the price, charging us the walk in rate, despite us having stayed there for the previous three nights. As with other people who have reviewed this hotel, I found making a complaint extremely difficult, and all I got in return was an email from the manager saying he did not mean to come across an confrontational. No apology and nothing to try and smooth over the situation.

Normally I have no problem with Travelodge (though prefer Premier Inn) and have stayed at many around the country - most budget hotels being better than the average 3* to be honest. Anyway, arrived and checked in to my room (604 - I think) having unpacked, layed out on the bed and my god, what a bad mattress - thin and wires/springs very evident and noisy and it slumped into the middle. Went to reception and was allocated another room (601?) - same problem - though not as bad. Went to reception, allocated 608 this time - guess what? Yep. So back to reception for the fourth time and given 611. Finally one that seemed okay (in relation ot the others) so I took the room. I say room because like all the others I was offered they were tiny - about 2 foot wider than the single bed and 5 foot longer? More a dorm. Okay its a travelodge but as I say, I stay at many budget hotels and never before have I seen rooms as small as these, especially when the cost was \u00c2\u00a3105. Back to 611. Tried to get sleep - very poor night - the matttress slumped to the mddle (though not as much as the others) and I tossed and turned most of the night - got about 1 hour at a time. Result - one very tired and irritable guest. Breakfast didnt help - again, you have limited expectations as its a budget hotel but this was bad. cold, anaemic , watery scrambled eggs, cold overcooked bacon, overcooked and thus rubbery sausages. You get the idea. IF this was a Premier Inn, I wouldnt have had a problem with gettign a refund under their guarranteed good nights sleep, In this case I started with the website - no help. Every time I submitted a complaint the website went down and I lost my commentary (I did however remember to copy it before pressing submit the second time). No, it wasnt my machine as all the other net functions I was running were fine. Then tried to phone. Followed all the options and ended up with someone who, after I explained the situation, said \"This is booking, I cant help you.\" So having asked for complaints telephone no I get \"Sorry sir this is Barcelona I dont have that\". Eventually used contacts to phone the press office and the communications director's office to get the phone no for complaints - boy do they ever like to make it hard. I must admit that when speaking to the Press Office, the phrase Barcelona and Fawlty Towers came out. The complaints person was told the story and how, had I not paid over the net, would have refused to pay for the room. Was told it would be investigated. Oh joy, an email arrived later from the manager of the Marylebone saying that yes there ws a problem with the mattress in one room but not the others. That is it. No apology, no offer of refund or compensation - pathetic. As I said, I use Travelodge and the others a lot. Never had to complain before and always had a good/acceptable (what do you want from a budget hotel eh?) stay and never had to compain. Following this disaster, especially the attrocious customer services experience, I will be giviing preference to Premier Inn and Travelodge will be lower down the list.

Hard and lumpy. Housekeeping had no idea that there were actually 2 people staying in a room with twin beds and left only towels for 1 person even after we complained. No cups or spoons. Missing TV control. Tea or coffee for 1 person. There also must be a severe soap shortage in the Travelodge chain. We got one bar which was the smallest bar of hotel soap I have ever seen.

The staff were pretty friendly, and they were quite helpful, but there was a language barrier with several staff, who did not have English as a first language. So it was a bit of a struggle to communicate at times... The one room we were given (108) was very noisy at night, as it was right opposite the tube and also directly above the delivery bay, so it was very noisy at 5am; and we had actually phoned a few days before to request the top floor for ALL rooms, and the guy said he would put that request in.... And yet, we were put on the first floor, and told we could not have the top floor now, as 'the top floor is full..,' (Yet we were told that it would be fine to have top floor, when we phoned a few days earlier.) So this annoyed us a bit. - especially after ending up with a room right above the delivery bay. So there seemed to be a lack of communication there, or the person who said we 'could' have the top floor, could not understand us fully, or he did not make a proper note of it... So if you are staying, try and ensure you are put on a high floor... and if you request a higher floor, make sure you DOUBLE check on the morning of the afternoon you are due to check in. On the third day there, most of the stuff was not avaliable on breakfast, and we had to keep waiting for toast, sausages, plates, knives, milk, and cups; and the stuff we 'did' have was cool by the time the other stuff came. But when the breakfast IS all there, it's good value, as you can eat as muich as you like, of sausage, bacon, eggs, toast, cereal, yoghurts and fruit muffins; and you can drink as much juice and tea and coffee as you like too. Also, children under 16 eat free, so make sure you mention that when paying for your breakfast... 4 big breakfasts including drinks, for \u00c2\u00a315 in total, for 2 adults and 3 teenagers is worth the money. We ate at 10am, and didn't have to eat again til tea time! When we came for a meal on the first night, (in the bar,) some of the items on the menu were not available... we have had this at several Travelodges now, so they need to get their supplies in order here. AND in 2 of the rooms (112 and 108 I think;) the safety catch was missing from the window, so it could be opened fully. so this needs fixing.., As soon as you check in (especially if you are with children/teenagers,) check the safety catches, as it could mean the difference between life and death. If your window does not have one, ask to be moved to a room that DOES have one... Not overly happy with some things, but not overly unhappy as the staff were very nice and gave us anything we needed. Overall, the stay was just average; not dreadful, but not brilliant.. Must emphasise though, that none of it was the fault of the staff, and they were very nice, and the cleaning staff were very efficient and thorough. Basically for the money, it's worth it... but it is not brilliant. Very handy for tube and rail though. I probably would be more likely to reccommend the Covent Garden one than this one, as it is very close to tube and the west end (Leicester square and Oxford street etc,) and the rooms were better, it was less noisy, we got the floor we wanted, everyone understood us, and the food was always available and I could not find any faults... So I would have to say no to actually recommending the Marylebone one... as there are several others which are much better.. However, it wasnt AWFUL and for the money it was 'OK.'... If there were no other places available, I would stay again, but I would be more likely to look for rooms at the Covent Garden one. Even the Kings Cross Royal Scot one as really nice and well supplied with food and with a friendly atmospheric bar, but it's 15 minutes walk from the tube... that is the only fault with that one.... The best thing about the Marylebone one is it is 2 minutes walk from the tube and the railway station...And the staff were very friendly.

Shoehorned into the room is a bed (smallish, with an OK mattress), a desk, a TV (8 channels only but flat screen) and a cupboard of sorts. The bathroom is tiny too. I'm six foot three so I felt like Gulliver. The outlook is the back alley. The towels were thin and a little damp, there was no shower mat and no soap, shampoo etc. This is minimalist lodging. I don't like the Travelodge very much, but I admire the management for getting 85 pounds a night for so little space, and amenities that feel shabby (except for the TV !). The doubles might be nicer, but were all taken as the price is supposedly the same for all room sizes.The hallways are tight, and there is an odor in the air which is hard to describe, but certainly is not pleasant. The staff were pleasant at check-in. Still, the desk cannot take a reservation for a future date (you have to go to the website or call), which seemed backward.

The bathroom fittings dated back to another era. Water temperature and pressure were fine but the taps looked ancient and worn. Somebody had done an amateur DIY sealant job around the bath and the bath itself was chipped. More dampness was evident above the wash-basin area. I don't think that any amount of cleaning would make this bathroom look good. On a more positive note the receptionist was very helpful and he allocated me a room at 10 AM which was several hours before the hotel's agreed check-in time.

The location of the hotel was ideal for us being next to the station as we did a lot of travelling about on the tube, the only downside to being so near was the noise at night.

The room had a good sized double bed, bedside tables, an open cupboard for clothes (not many hangers) and a table with a TV and tea/coffee making facilities. The wallpaper was peeling in places, the furniture is VERY old and in desperate need of replacing and the bed was pretty awful to be honest. The mattress was very lumpy and you could feel every spring in your back. The bathroom was a marginal improvement with good space and a fairly nice bath and shower.

Travelodge make much in their publicity of the idea that they can be cheaper by cutting out the fripperies like shower gel & hairdryers. Fair enough, as we didn't intend to do anything there except use it to crash out after being out in London all day. They say that they concentrate instead on ensuring you get a clean and comfortable room so you get a good night's sleep. Well, this one offered neither. The bed was one of the most uncomfortable we've ever slept (or not) on, with pocket springs which went \"boing\" at even the slightest movement. Nor was the room particularly clean, with dust all over the chairs, scald-marks from the kettle all over the desk and shabby wallpaper where (presumably) a child's felt-pen scribblings had been painted over in a colour vaguely within the same spectrum. There was a peculiar smell out in the corridor - kind of frankfurters marinaded in bleach, so who knows what that was... Staff seemed like students passing through for a couple of days, and were completely indifferent to us. Maybe their uniform should be a t-shirt saying \"Whatever\". OK, you don't expect an effusive farewell at the end of a stay, but a little more than a vague mumbling sound would have been nice.

I very much doubt we'll be going back...", "Date": "July 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast", "Title": "\u201cNot again!\u201d", "Author": "Tightrope78", "ReviewID": "UR8016739", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for the second time for 6 nights in mid June 2007. I had returned to the hotel because of the close proximity to both Baker Street and Marylebone tube stations. Once more I was in a single room on the top floor. Once more the room was quite tiny, though thankfully this time there was a proper shower. I did not eat at the hotel, and had no dealings with the staff. The bed was lumpy and the sheets were rather basic. I had to remake the bed on two occassions. I had had a niggling itch when I was at the hotel and it was only when I got home that I realised that I had been attacked by bed bugs! There are numerous bites all over my body! This hotel is not up to Travelodge standards! The single rooms are tiny whilst in most other Travelodges there is no difference between single travellers and couples. The rooms are even more basic than usual, and are in a general state of decline, as is the whole hotel. The money spent on plasma screens for each room would have been better spent on upgrading the rooms. Whilst this hotel should be commended on it's location I do not envisage me staying here again.", "Date": "June 27, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Travelodge London Marylebone", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d603841-Reviews-Travelodge_London_Marylebone-London_England.html", "Price": "$119 - $552*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Harewood Row</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Marylebone</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">NW1 6SE</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "603841", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/e7/aa/e7aab367d5e1d18d2f383d99103d16cc1large.jpg"}}
