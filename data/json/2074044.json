We were a bit daunted when we first pulled up to the hotel as it seemed run down in a cramped neighbourhood with several men milling around aimlessly on the pavement outside. Our first impressions weren't helped when we stepped into the reception area where we were asked to wait for the manager before we could go up to our rooms. 15 mins of waiting later, our fears were put to rest by a very eloquent smartly dressed individual who made us feel very welcome and we were shown to our stunningly decorated incredibly spacious room. Looked completely newly refurbished in a striking white and majorelle blue colour scheme. We were in the shadows of the Blue Mosque, with the patio windows looking straight out onto the domes. The bathroom was a little cramped, but the powerful rain shower more than made up for this. Breakfast was an incredible spread of hot and cold, local and European dishes. It more than set us up for the day. The best bit about this incredible little gem was its incredibly convenient location. The neighbourhood felt very safe, even late at night. We were 5 mins away from all the main attractions, made even more convenient by being able to walk through the Arasta Bazaar to and from the Blue Mosque and all the other attractions. There were lots of other shops and restaurants close to the hotel which we were very happy to get distracted by.

We usually had a drink in the breakfast room before heading out to dinner in the evening. They make a great pomegranate martini with fresh squeezed juice. There are many restaurants around the hotel but the best walkable ones are located just north of the Hippodrome area. It is a very touristy area though. I would certainly recommend this hotel if you can get a good rate and make sure transportation one way is included in your price as well as the breakfast. Also, hiring a local guide for one or two days is definitely a plus and highly educational. I would do the Grand Bazaar on your own and not with a guide...they will take you to shops they do business with frequently which would be alright if they didn't get a commission from these stores and become a bit pushy with the expensive merchandise...just a heads up.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Changsha, China", "Title": "\u201cA very good hotel\u201d", "Author": "Yan J", "ReviewID": "UR122225785", "Content": "I have been a globe trotter, I live on suitcases.

The location is excellent, the rooms were clean and the staff were friendly (except for one man behind the reception). Also there was unlimited free wifi which was a pleasant surprise and very useful. However - we did have quite a few gripes. 1) The room was much smaller than they make it out to look in the pictures. The bathroom in particular is very small indeed with virtually no space to move around at all, certainly not enough for two people to be in there at once. Also, not much storage in the room - no shelves in the wardrobe, no chest of drawers, very few hangars. This meant we had to leave a lot of stuff out. 2) The safe in the wardrobe was not secured into it at all - so anyone could just pick up the safe and walk out with it. Didn't give me any confidence when going out for the day that all of our worldly possessions could be taken so easily. More of an unsafe than a safe if you ask me. 3) Breakfast every day was absolutely terrible. An array of food that was not appetising in the slightest. Cereal with warm milk, lots of processed meats and some awful cooked choices that weren't even warm and not appropriate for breakfast. 4) The hotel is twinned with the Sarnic - two hotels sharing one reception, one dining area, one set of cleaners etc. The only difference between the two hotels is the room quality at the Sarnic Premier (which isn't that great anway) and the price! 5) The 'window overlooking the blue mosque' was not overlooking it at all - we could just about see the roof of the mosque over some other buildings between the hotel and the mosque. We probably looked at the mosque from our window twice during our stay - not worth paying the premium. 6) Our bed sheets weren't changed once during our four night stay. On the final day (as we were leaving) we found out we were supposed to have put a card on our bed each day requesting the sheets were changed. We realise this is partly our fault for being dopey, but we weren't told this at the beginning, nor was it clear what we were supposed to do. 7) The bed was way too soft, you sink into it each time you get in. So soft in fact that I frequently awoke in the middle of the night having gravitated towards the middle of the bed, as had my wife, so we were on top of each other. And not in a romantic way. 8) The hallways were a little messy - piles of sheets and towels dumped on the ground that we had to step round each time. 9) The main picture that you can see of the front of the hotel (the one on the website and on here in fact) is not a fair reflection of the hotel. It's not the front of the hotel at all, it's the side and not nearly as flash as it looks. You actually enter the hotel via a small inconspicuous door on the street, then to get to your room you have to walk through a corridor, outside, along a passageway, through the restaurant and then to the lifts. Not the nicest way to get to your room each time. The above gripes make it look like we didn't enjoy it at all, and probably make me out to be a right nit-picker. We did in fact have a comfortable stay. I'm not saying we would return to this hotel as we wouldn't, but if location is the most important thing, then you would have a pleasant stay.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cA great combination of comfort, style and friendly service\u201d", "Author": "Helen I", "ReviewID": "UR119020112", "Content": "I had the pleasure to stay at the Sarnic Premier Hotel this July.

There are tons of little restaurants and bazaar alleys around the way and as 3 girls traveling on our own, we felt safe and in the middle of it all. The service was especially fantastic. My luggage was lost before I even made it to Istanbul, and they tirelessly helped me call baggage services to claim it 3 days later and ensure I got it back intact. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone!", "Date": "August 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toledo, Spain", "Title": "\u201cGood option\u201d", "Author": "Julian_69_88", "ReviewID": "UR117251762", "Content": "The hotel is in a good location, near Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia (5 minutes).

They have nice breakfast area and restaurant on the roof. This is really best place to stay!!! Also it was very quite in the night, no noise (my Mom can't sleep if it's noisy).

On our early arrival from the airport, we were welcomed with unexpected coffe and tea at the very enjoyable back garden. After asking us if it was our first time in Istanbul, we were given all the touristic information about the city and recommendations one could ever have. All the staff (reception, breakfast, room maids) were always attentive to guest needs and very helpfull. - Room was charming and well decorated, and with a magnific view from the Blue Mosque! There were turkish sweets in our room one day - a very nice touch! Also, good internet access. - The location was perfect! In the heart of Old Istanbul, walking distance from all main sightseeings (so near Blue Mosque!), but in a quiet and nice street. - A very nice back garden, where we had breakfast every morning.

The room had a king size bed (which is really somewhere between a queen and a king by US standards), and a twin bed. There was also a chaise by the window which our 7 yr loved to sleep on. The blue and white decor is elegant and soothing at the same time. The hotel is brand new; we may have been the first occupants of our room. The bathroom was small but tastefully done; it had no bath tub but the handheld shower compensated. The windows could be tilted open for fresh air or shut close. The room was sound proof enough with the windows closed that we did not wake up with the 5 AM prayer call. We were able to control the temperature in the rooms to our liking. The only downside to the rooms was that closet/storage space was limited. Wireless internet was also slow. The hotel is a 10 minute (or less) walk from the blue mosque. There are many restaurants and shops (Arasta Bazaar) within walking distance. We were able to find taxis at the taxi stand a few steps away. We booked a half day Bosphorus and Golden Horn tour from the hotel, it was reasonably good. Service at the hotel was excellent. The hotel gets 5 stars despite some kinks because of the service, mainly Sedet who took care of our every whim. He shopped for snacks and juices for us when we just arrived, never let us carry our toddler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stroller down the stairs at the entrance to the hotel, picked up and delivered our laundry \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he is just amazing. Now to the kinks: The hotel claimed to have a terrace restaurant when we made our reservation, it did not. It was being constructed. In fact we had to go to their neighboring restaurant to have breakfast which was an annoyance in the rain because we had to be dressed for the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoutdoors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as soon as we were up. It did not really matter in the overall scheme of things, because our jetlagged kids ended up waking late most days anyway so we ended up missing it. At the end of our stay both restaurants were nearing completion, so we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see it affecting future guests. Lastly our airport transfer was a no show when we arrived in Istanbul. Of course the manager arranged for our transfer on our way back for free instead, but we would have rather preferred that the transfer showed up when we arrived in Istanbul after a 10 hour international flight. We attribute these issues to the hotel being new - people meant well and work very hard. One night we walked up to the terrace, and the view of the blue mosque was awesome. I am sure that the restaurant, when it opens, will add to the value of the hotel.", "Date": "May 12, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Sarnic Premier Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d2074044-Reviews-Sarnic_Premier_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$113 - $365*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Kucuk Ayasofya Mh.
