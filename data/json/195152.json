'I was hoping to check in and to park please' I said to receive a comment of you can't leave the car there you will get a ticket and sorry our car park is full, turn around, turn left down the road, across the traffic lights and follow the slip road left and turn left into the Marriot, its a NCP car park at \u00c2\u00a327.50 a day!!

I asked why he needed my pin and he said because the money will come out first thing in the morning for tonights stay. Right fine, and we will do the same thing tomorrow for Sunday. What? anyway next I was told breakfast was from 0800. I explained my company had booked the hotel saying I had to be 2miles for 0800 and was told breakfast would be fine, so I asked if it was just cereals. I was told no sorry you have paid and it starts at 0800, we cannot help. By this point I wasn't greatly pleased as then I had to drive my car to a much nicer hotel around the corner and walk 10mins back to this one. Returned abck with all my luggage and went upstairs to my room. Well the lift could hold me and my 1 bag and suit bag and smelled of dust. I got upstairs to the smallest corridors and oldest, upkept looking polace I had ever been to. My room was about 2metres squared with a small single bed, random frames on the wall that had not been dusted, a mirror that haasn't been cleaned, there was tea and milk with a pack of biscuits and a kettle with an old wooden cheap basket of freshening wood which didn't smell at all. Cigarette burns in the carpet, no coat hook ands no feedback questionnaire. Into the bathroom where the shower curtain was moulding, you couldn't sit on the toilet as the wall was 3 inches from the seat, no face cloth or towel, dirty sink, 20+ cracked tiles wih a shelf falling off the wall. On the upp side the toilet tissue was nice and there was a floor mat which seemed clean. I stay in a lot of hotels and am pretty versatile to what I expect but If the Marriot had room no matter if it was double the cost, I would of moved.

Reading the several reviews posted here, it was hard to know whether to give this hotel a go. Opinions are mixed. So -- let me try to help the next undecided traveler whether to make a booking. The Best Western Swiss Cottage is a no-nonsense hotel. Its rooms are very simple. The furniture, fixtures and fittings have seen better days and the decor is tired. But manage your expectations and you'll notice that the staff are aimiable, the rooms and bathrooms are clean, the hotel is in a quiet location, it's a very short walk to the tube station and nearby local restaurants (Chinese, Indian, Thai, for example), there are some welcome \"freebies\" (coffee/tea and biscuits in the room, free internet, etc.) and the rack rate for a single adult ranges from GBP 70 to GBP 135 (as of June 2011), depending on the room. In its class, in London, with these features and amenities, it's a reasonable deal. The key is to manage your expectations. This is very much a \"no frills\" hotel experience, but it delivers on the basics. If you're the type who looks for faults, especially by comparison to other hotels, then don't come here -- you're bound to find something you don't like. But if you can recognize reasonable value when you see it, then you may even be pleasantly surprised by this hotel. A final word. The reception staff have received their fair share of criticism in this forum. That was not my experience. In fact, the Best Western central reservation service made an error in my booking, setting me up for a single room whereas I had booked a double (and had the confirmation slip to prove it).

Although the price was significantly higher than we had paid for 3 and 4 star rooms for the previous week, we thought the property looked quite nice and worth a try. We were sadly mistaken. When we arrived at the hotel, the front desk clerk (manager, I believe) reluctantly tore himself away from his conversation with an employee, then couldn't find our reservation, and asked how we had booked. We told him \"Expedia\" and he rolled his eyes, told his assistant to immediately call and close all \"discount\" bookings, and proceeded to give us the \"Basil Fawlty\" treatment. Without any pretense at good manners or effort to welcome us to his property, he gave us the key to a \"discount\" room up in the attic, and turned his back on us. Up in the attic, we found a clean, fairly well presented \"British style\" room that had been recently renovated. It would never win any prizes for tasteful decorating, but at least it was clean, safe and secure. The only real faults with the room itself were poor water pressure and the fact that the hot water tap dispensed hot water and the cold water tap dispensed even hotter water. The bed springs were creaky and the TV reception was poor. But in an English 2-star hotel you learn to be forgiving, and overlook such deficiencies as \"charm\" or \"character\" :-) At checkout time I received further attitude from a clerk when he was forced to accept a credit card instead of cash for my WiFi usage. You'd think that three pounds per hour for WiFi would be a great source of hotel income (usually offered for free in most reputable hotels), but at the Swiss Cottage Best Western the taking of money was just another excuse for eye rolling and bad manners. I'm a well dressed, very polite and respectable guy. The one thing I do expect from any establishment where I spend hundreds of dollars and/or pounds is appreciation of my business. A simple \"welcome\", a smile, or even a simle \"thank you\" go a long way.

The service is good but if you require hand and foot service, this is definitely not the hotel for you. And if you can manage London's underground (Jubilee line to most major attractions), you've got a great bargain (off season) and a great hotel! If you are looking for something clean, safe, comfortable and recognize you are still in a large cosmopolitan city and exercise some simple safety concerns, I would recommend this place. The only issues I had was the guest in the upstairs room left the bloody shower on our last night there and we had to change rooms in the middle of the night (night staff was efficient for a room change).

On the whole it was very satisfactory. It was clean and well carried for. We had a superior twin with Continental breakfast for \u00c2\u00a390.00. That took some negotiating on the phone direct. Being winter and the low season helped. The breakfast was adequate but without variety. Cold cereal, 4 kinds, juice, italian salami, processed cheese slices, rolls and occasionally crousants [sp] tea or coffee and white or brown toast. For $10.00/person they could do better. Location in zone 2 was fine because it is 1 1/2 blocks from the Swiss Cottage tube stop on the Jubilee line which is frequent and very fast. Further, it is not as crowded as the Piccadilly line or the Victoria. Whines: The front desk staff was not terribly co-operative at times. The sound on my TV got locked at a low level and I was told that they were all that way. That was on Friday. On Monday when I went to the front desk to complain again, the clerk sent someone up right away and it was unlocked. When I checked I was told that the reservation was without breakfast. I insisted that it included a full English breakfast. My husband had talked to the desk manager or someone on Monday and arranged it. He reluctantly looked up the reservation and found the note but said it was continental breakfast. I was too tired to argue the point. As it turned out the English breakfast was the same as the continental with the addition of cooked eggs, hash browns, bacon or sausage, beans and tomato. We did not need that much food so it worked out. But the clerk's attitude was surly at best. When we asked about a church for Mass same clerk had no idea but found a card with one on it, but then gave total incorrect directions. When we asked if there was a launderette near by, he thought there was one at the end of Eton St. Well that was a mile down the road. Basically it is poor front desk training and supervision.
