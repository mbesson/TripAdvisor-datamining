I loved having the computer in the room....I could watch TV on it, check the internet and e-mail (occasionally!) and play region 2 movies, so it was a real entertainment center. The bed was very comfortable and the room was always clean. The location was terrific for everything I wanted to visit...lots of places to walk to, a bus to the Louvre right down the street, the metro not far, an easy walk to Notre Dame. Many interesting restaurants and cafes close by and several cinemas that were so comfortable and clean that it made me nostalgic for the ways movies used to be shown in the USA. I was very comfortable staying here and would definitely recommend it. The smallest rooms are pretty small so if it's possible to upgrade and you'll be there for a few days I would recommend that...but really, I thought this was a wonderful choice for my visit and I would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds", "Title": "\u201cA great welcome\u201d", "Author": "Gerald-Labour", "ReviewID": "UR125845258", "Content": "The lady receptionist was welcoming, efficient, and unusually for Paris, very friendly.

Our only complain was the shower. It was the tiniest I've seen, and I've been all over Europe and am accustomed to small rooms. I couldn't take a shower without the shower curtain clinging to my body, and when I tried to gain some room by turning sideways in the shower I would often bump the shower handle, scalding or freezing myself often. I was always glad to be done with my shower so I could escape the curtain. Anyone who is claustrophobic will probably want to ask for a room with a larger shower or stay at another hotel.

The room was lovely, beautifully decorated and had everything we needed. Most importantly, it was clean. The only downside was the loud television in the room next door which it seemed was never turned off! The rooms are small, but this is expected in Paris. This wasn't a huge problem for us as we only used the room for sleeping at night so didn't spend much time there.

It is walking distance from almost everything (my husband and I love to walk). We even walked to the Eiffel tower, but took the train back. As other reviews have mentioned the bathroon is microscopic. My husband and I are both very tall but knew about the bathroom after reading the reviews. It is fine and we managed for our stay. The computer software needs upgrading for you to be able to use the full use of the free internet. Was not a major issue for us. The only minor issue we had, was a bit of a cigarette-smoky-smell coming into the room somehow, despite it being a non-smoking hotel. The staff tried to rectify it for us (talking to the guests, perhaps?) and it wasn't too much of an issue. The staff are very helpful and friendly. They printed our Eiffel tower tickets for us and have a great system to forward any message on to you. The lift is tiny and can barely fit 2 people.

The rooms are generally quite small, and the bathroom was tiny, but both were very clean and nicely decorated. Bath towels could have been a bit larger. My only seriously negative criticism of the hotel itself is the rooms are poorly soundproofed, and the noise of doors closing is very intrusive. We didn't have breakfast included in the price of our room, but were very happy to go out and have it in a local cafe (of which there are a few on Place de la Sorbonne around the corner).

The bedroom area was perfectly fine with a nice view from the 5th floor over the Sorbonne university plus aircon and a TV/Apple PC to play with. The bathroom, though, was just a little too small for comfort - you had to perform a twist to sit on the toilet and the shower cubicle was so narrow I really struggled to wash properly. As mentioned there was a PC in the room to freely surf the net and do a bit of research on before venturing out. This was really handy. The hotel also provided free WiFi but I struggled to get connected to this using either my iPhone or iPad so had to rely on the PC in the room. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and spoke excellent English. The hotel was beautifully decorated inside and seemed well maintained.

The hotel is very \"hip\" and reminds me of the W hotels but of course much smaller (I think only 33 rooms). It is part of the HPRG group of hotels who have a number of small boutique hotels ideally located around Paris as well as some apartments for rent. I have stayed at the Hotel du Pantheon before so had high expectations of the hotel. It was nicely decorated in a very modern style. Good for the young. The hotel has a few drawbacks, none of which are deal breakers but something you need to think about: 1. It is very noisy if you have a room facing the street. If you choose this place then ask for a room facing into the courtyard - others staying at the hotel tell me it was beautifully quiet 2. Linens aged - towels especially small 3. No corkscrew in the room, and when we asked at reception we were told we were not permitted to open a bottle of red wine in our room unless we agreed upfront to pay any damages. This is insane. If you cant do this then make it part of the note for the booking. Caveat emptor. When in France drink a good Bordeaux!! 4. The rooms were oppressively hot. We turned the heater off but still hot, so we had to open the windows and then the noise was bothersome and you woke up freezing. So need to work on temperature control Advantages: 1. Location perfect- short walk to Rue St Germain, Notre Dame, the Pantheon, the Latin Quarter for dinner 2. It seems to be attached to residential apartments so you feel as though you are living in the city 3. Nice clean modern and recently renovated bathrooms 4. Cool lobby 5. Nice and helpful staff (very nice and very helpful) 6. We met other guests at a champagne soiree for New Years eve courtesy of the hotel with some finger food - nice touch. So do I recommend it overall? Yes. Would I stay there again?

My idea of comfort does not extend to turning over in the middle of the night and banging my head on the wardrobe.

We were glad that the weather was good so we didn't spend much time in the room. I agree with other reviewers that the wi-fi, although free, was patchy - couldn't get the Mac to work (nor the TV channels) or a wi-fi connection for my phone. Staff were ok - we arrived to find that another group were without rooms due to over-booking or systems issue, so that makes me wary of booking within this group again.

We were in a superior room which was about the size of a standard room in most places in Europe. This was not an issue for us, and does not affect our rating for the hotel. We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel, as we prefer coffee and a croissant at local cafes, (which is both cheaper and more authentically 'Paris'). However, if we'd wanted a full buffet breakfast, the rate would have been reasonable. We booked on a special deal, making the hotel a reasonable price for central Paris, and this governs our value rating. We may have thought twice if we'd had to pay the 'rack rate'.

The room was very clean and had air conditioning which we used as it was very warm most nights. The room also had a TV which doubled as an Apple Mac PC with free Wifi.

We paid to have breakfast each morning served in the dining room downstairs. We would reccomend doing this as the breakfast was lovely. You have a choice of toast, fresh fruit, fresh pastries, bread, ham, boiled egg and yoghurts served with either fresh orange juice, tea or coffee. It was very tasty and there was always enough variety every morning. The hotel were very accomodating allowing us to bring our own food back to the dining room to eat in the evenings if we so wished. We did this one night with a chinese takeaway and the staff provided us with plates and cutlery which was very nice of them!

It was so helpful to look up restaurants and directions on the internet, as well as keep in touch with people back in the States. I had a street view room and was concerned about noise, but during the night things calmed down and I had no problems - I even slept in until 11am each day. The hotel did provide an amenities kit, which included earplugs, in case this was a problem. The room was made up daily, the safe functioned. The shower was hot. I have no complaints. The location could have been closer to more of a neighborhood area, like the Marais, but it was easy to get places from the hotel as it was pretty centrally located. The breakfast, which I only had one day, was pretty decent for a continental buffet and included freshly squeezed OJ. I even emailed the hotel after returning to the US to see if I had left something in my room (turns out, I just overlooked it in my suitcase).

The location is just great - the hotel is in a side street so very quiet as a result even though you are just meters off the busy St Michel boulevard. It took us maybe 7-10 minutes to walk to the Notre Dame, about 15 minutes to the Louvre. Carrying the luggage of two people (mine and my niece's) I appreciated the fact that the hotel is maybe 2-3 minutes walk from the RER station Luxembourg which is directly on the line from the CDG airport so no need to transfer. We didn't have the breakfast at the restaurant although their breakfast premises seemed very nice we opted for a cheaper option in a nearby cafe - there are many cafes and restaurants to choose from. I choose the hotel based on its location and the good reviews on the tripadvisor but was a bit nervous that probably the rooms won't be as nice as on the photos as the price that I paid (we booked directly on the hotels website) was maybe a touch too good for such a location and the look of the hotel on the photos but I was not at all disappointed.

We had a large closet with shelves and hanging space. The safe was small- netbook didn't fit. Our bathroom had a tub/shower combo. The sink was teeny; even the toilet was very small. The bed was comfortable as were the pillows. There were two tiny bedside tables. The Apple computer/Samsung monitor worked well. We found the internet a bit slow, but okay. The keyboard (understandably) was European. There were english language TV channels. Our view was onto Rue Victor Cousin and the Sorbonne with the Pantheon in the distance. East facing room- the curtains worked well at blocking out the morning sun. The room was very dark in the evening. There were plenty of lights and lamps, but the black wallpaper, carpet and draperies absorbed, rather than reflected the light. I think that a lighter color scheme would have made a world of difference- both in brightness and making the room appear bigger. We had breakfast there one morning. It is okay, but saw some breakfast menus in Place de la Sorbonne that were a bit cheaper and, more importantly, had lovely square-side tables where one could people-watch while eating.

English speaking front desk staff; pleasant and customer oriented. Minimal amounts of ice upon request. Did not use the hotel restaurant. Stayed in (small)Room 15 on 2nd floor. Double bed. Very quiet. A/C was the best during hot, humid Paris summer days. (Whereever you stay ensure A/C available.)Bathroom size was ok, but shower was the smallest ever. TV doubled as computer w/internet access. Took 55 Euro/30 minute taxi ride to CDG Airport upon departure.

It was a bit on the small side but looked out over a courtyard with lots of posh apartments and had good sunlight. The iMac in the room was very good for internet, watching TV and movies and was a great idea. There was also free wifi but the hotel doesn't put a password on the network so everyone from hotel guests to students from the Sorbonne across the road can access it. As a result, the wifi is very slow and pretty much useless - a pain if we needed to use our laptop and iPhone. On the first night we went to bed and discovered that the bed was broken. The night receptionist couldn't offer us another room because the hotel was full and his (valiant) attempt to fix the bed just made it worse. As it was too late to look for another hotel, we had to try to sleep in the busted bed. The next day it was promptly fixed but there was no real apology and no offer of a refund or any attempt to compensate for the inconvenience. We also noticed that the cleaning staff tended to fling our belongings onto the floor so that they could make the bed or tidy up, which was a little disconcerting. On the plus side - hotel is in a good location, near the Luxembourg RER station and the St Michel metro. There are nice restaurants and good shopping nearby. The Latin Quarter is very touristy but bustling and the hotel is on a quiet side street. The staff were okay, not too friendly but they spoke English. They held our bags for us after checkout. Overall, the hotel is very stylish, certainly not your run of the mill chain, but falls down a little when it comes to service.

Having been coming to Paris for 10 years I can honestly say that this was the worst hotel we have stayed, as the room was far too small, The hotel did provide a cot for our baby - however it had to be placed against the window - and babies should not sleep in a draft. So the baby was put between my husband and I in the small double bed. We could not move around the room, so to get to our clothes we had to move the travel cot onto our bed and so on. I did question whether the room was superior but I was told that it was and that others rooms had even tinier bathrooms. Our baby had nowhere but the bed to play in - but the bed had to be used for bags when it was not used for sleeping, and babies can not really play on beds as they can fall off them. Noise from the road below was load at times. The window faced onto the street, meaning that we had no privacy if the window was open and it was gloomy if the window was shut. The room was stuffy the carpet was wet by the shower/toilet - there was no bath for a baby. The Mac was small - no bigger than a 19 inch screen but the room was so small, the furniture in the room was chipped. There were not enough towels provided - the first night we were told that they had no more clean towels, the second and third night we requested more. Our stay for 3 nights was not much shy of 500 GBP. I am well aware that hotels in paris may mean small rooms, but I feel completely ripped off by the room we stayed in. Staff seemed nice enough and other guests seemed to have bigger rooms, but they should never have put us in that room - it simply was no suitable for a baby. In hindsight I should never ever have signed for the pre-payment before seeing a room.

Our room was right next to the lift which was so small that we rode it once but never again! And i would venture that most people would take the stairs unless you like the feeling of claustrophobia. One of the nice features of the hotel is that there is an IMac in every room which doubles up as a television with a couple of English channels. It was a great base from which to explore Paris and there are some nice bars nearby too (serving the smallest glass of wine known to man - 90ml!) and overall Paris is pretty expensive, but this place has to be one of the best mid-range hotels.

The room was cute, clean, quiet - mattress was far too soft for us but I appreciate lots of people prefer this - my back cant stand it though. The shower room was fine, except anyone over 5ft 6 like me needed to carry out a reversing manoeuvre to sit on the toilet via the hand basin, and the shower pan leaked due to the gap under the cubicle door, but these are just minor gripes.

The stairs and passages outside the rooms were narrow probably as most of the Paris hotels, but they are decorated with photos which adds a nostalgic hint to this modern place. The room is small but enough for daily activities. Besides no mini bar, which instead is a public one located at the breakfast place, all the facilities of a decent hotel are there, plus a Mac, which is used as both a computer and a TV. The room we selected had a bathtub, which for a couple, could be anything but for a normal bath, inviting all types of imagination. We got from Sephora several galets de bain effervescents (the bathing stuff that melt in water and give out nice smell to bath). Thought that since we have a bathtub, why not do something with it. It turned out to be a brilliant idea, which included all facets of senses - the sound (of sizzling water when the thing was melting), the temperature (of the warmth of water in such a cold day), the sight (of the person in front of you), the smell (chocolate!), and, most importantly, the taste.. and what's beyond the bath. An exceptionally fulfilling experience. Its location is also very good in that it is close to the subways and RER, as well as the two islands where the museums are located. Itself is on the right bank of Le Seine where we walk around and see lots of bookstores. There are also an area of walking street full of restaurants and bars. One only thing I can think of so far as a weakness might be the flush of the toilet. When pressed once, only minimal water flows out, which was pretty scary and embarrasing since I just finished using the toilet and dont really want to call for help. The trick is to press it for several times quickly like pumping the water. Then at around the 5th pressing, problem got solved... All in all, it's a really cozy and nice-looking small place.

Not for the faint hearted, the rooms and communal areas are pretty bold, as shown in my pics; only just on the right side of bearable if I'm honest. If you are looking for traditional, prob best to try their other hotels (think French toile)! Colour choices aside, the rooms are really well appointed in terms of technology and have a flat screen TV complete with the usual array of TV stations (only one English speaking though - BBC news) as well as CD, DVD, free internet and radio all incorporated into the one compact Apple Mac unit. That's no bad thing, cos the rooms are very small so they need all the space they can get! I know Paris hotels are renowned for small rooms, and to be honest, I am not that bothered about the bedroom size as I don't usually spend too long in it, but the shower room was almost impractical and there was no bath. We had booked a superior room and that was pretty dinky so I am not sure what the bedroom/WC size is like in the lower garded rooms. At the Grandes Hommes, the rooms were still quite small, but the bathroom was fully equipped and two of us could at least stand in it at any one time. That said it was all immaculately clean and I slept amazingly. Breakfast was included in our price and did the purpose, but if you are staying on a room early, I am not sure it is entirely worth the 8E or 12E as it is not a very extensive buffet (there is no buffet for the 8E option). All in all, would recommend this place if you are staying for a night or two in Paris, if only for cleanliness and location.

They answered all of our questions and sometimes with more detail and information than we requested. It was great having a Mac in the room with free Internet because it helped with last minute research and directions. The room had a unique, funky style.

There is a delicious gelato place around the corner. We originally did not select the breakfast option but on Day 3, decided to eat breakfast at the hotel and found it filling and of good value. Convenient, as well. This is a non-smoking hotel :) THE ODD: The hotel has the smallest elevator that I have ever seen. My friend and I needed to take two trips to get to our room with our luggage. In order to turn on the room lights, one has to stick the room key into a special slot in the closet. Although our room had two twin beds, they were pushed right together so it was almost like sharing the same bed (in the hotel's defense, I noticed this layout in photos of other Paris hotels).

We were told to come back in half an hour. We returned hour (decided to go to the Pantheon) and room still was not ready and had to wait an extra 15 minutes. Wonderful lady at the front desk (whose name I forgot to ask), offered us coffee and juice while we waited. Pillow was too high and stiff for my liking.

If you want a big huge room in such an amazing location at a boutique hotel you have to get out your Eurocard and shell out some serious cash! I am 5'8\" and my husband is 6' and while we had some funny moments because of the small size, we were both very happy with the hotel. The value for the location, cleanliness, and charm seems really perfect. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. The staff were also very helpful and always present at the front desk. They respond quickly to requests and are just really on-the-ball. Most of the reviews I read of this hotel were similarly sparkling so I am happy to add my experiences to that crowd. Regarding some other reviews I have seen on tripadvisor: I don't know about the courtyard noise --- I did not hear any so the renovation must be over or in hiatus currently. The bedbug complaint that was written here freaked me out so I inspected the hotel room thoroughly and this claim is not validated --- larvae are visible to the naked eye. The room we stayed in was meticulously kept. I stayed a week and neither myself nor my husband got bites and it's been a week and we've seen nothing. The author of that review does not seem to have picked up the bedbugs at this hotel.

The staff was very friendly, the room (44, a design deluxe room) was amazingly beautiful with a very big bathroom. Everything was brand new. I had asked for a large bed because I'm very tall and they had promised me to take care of that by placing two single beds together. I was very happy to discover that they had remembered this promise. A possible downside is the size of the elevator, which was hilariously tiny. Just big enough for two people, and with a little squeezing, some luggage as well. I suggest you use it for your luggage and use the stairs (unless you are physically unable). Other small problem we had: the imac in our room would sometimes behave a little awkward (e.g. not responding anymore, showing a black screen, or refusing to let us watch BBC world and some other news channels).

The room is very small. And we had the 2nd biggest room on the floor, according to the evacuation map I saw pasted on the door of the room. While I understand that most rooms in Paris are small, I have stayed in bigger rooms in previous trips at a similar price. I just tend to try a new hotel each time, if you are wondering why I did not just go back to the other hotels I have stayed at. When our suitcase was opened, there was no walking space. But to be fair, the 5 shelves in the storage area in the room, provided enough space for putting our clothes and stuff. There is no wardrobe, only a column of shelves with a curtain over it. I call this the storage area. The bed is very small. The other reviewer said the bed was 1.60m wide. Ours should have been narrower because I \"measured\" the bed with my height. When I lie across the bed, my legs stick out. The bed was very soft. If you like soft beds, then good for you. The bathroom is also very small. But it has a very nice rainshower. The iMac in the room provided an opportunity to surf the internet, watch TV, listen to music, etc. There was also an iMac in the lobby. I could always hear the coming and going of the guests in the room next to ours, but once they were in their room, I could not hear them. There is a small elevator in the hotel. It did not work on one of the days when we were there. The breakfast consisted of 1 butter croissant, 1 chocolate croissant, and half a baguette each, which were brought to us in a basket when we were seated. You are not entitled to more. However, there was free flow of coffee or tea, juice, cereal, sliced bread, and yoghurt. While it was written on our confirmation email that the nearest stations are St Michel and Cluny-LaSorbonne, the nearest station is actually the Luxembourg RER Line B station, which is on the same line as the CDG airport, very convenient. The journey took 40 mins. And while it was written on our confirmation email that the check-in time was from 1pm, I was told when we arrived at 2:20pm, that the check-in time was actually 2pm. And even at 2:20pm, our room was not ready because \"there were too many people leaving that morning, your room would be ready in another 30mins\". All the staff we have met, had been very friendly. And the whole hotel - lobby, breakfast room, bedroom, bathroom - is truely very beautifully decorated, exactly like you see on its website. If you value decoration over room comfort, this hotel is for you. Otherwise, after all that walking in Paris, I would really appreciate a comfortable good night's sleep. To summarise the positives: - nice rainshower - free internet access - one elevator - convenient location - friendly staff And the negatives from my point of view: - claustrophobic room - narrow bed - very soft bed - small bathroom - thin doors - limited breakfast - room not ready way past check-in time", "Date": "November 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucks", "Title": "\u201cBeautifully designed hotel in a great location\u201d", "Author": "Philip99", "ReviewID": "UR22181551", "Content": "I'm just back from a lovely weekend break in Paris which was made all the more pleasurable by the pretty hotel de la Sorbonne.

Every room is equipped with a computer having full access to Internet, and on which you can watch TV or play DVDs. You can watch French and International channels on it. The bed was very comfortable, and I found the bedroom to be of decent size for Paris. Even if I had a single room, the bed was double and there was space to move around and put the luggage. The only down side was the bathroom, which was extremely small. Most people would say that I am quite tiny but I could just fit in this bathroom: I bruised my arm twice taking a shower and I could not get dressed in this bathroom unless the door was opened. The sink was one of the smallest I have ever seen. The room and the bathroom were clean, as well as the hotel in general. The breakfast was typically French, don't expect a full English! But it was really decent. The location of the hotel is very good, in the heart of the Quartier Latin, 5mins walk from Notre Dame and even less from the Pantheon. The RER station Luxembourg is about 5mins walk, and goes direcly to the airport Roissy-CDG in 40mins more or less, no need to change train or metro. The area is full of students as there is the Sorbonne University in the same street as the hotel, so there is plenty of restaurants and bars, and there are lots of people in the streets until late at night, so I felt quite safe.

I visited the hotel a month before and the rooms seemed OK - nothing much to write home about but maybe I was shown one of the un-refurbished rooms. 10 days prior to our arrival, my mother who is a recovering transplant and cancer patient, was advised to postpone her trip by a few days while she was being treated for a throat infection. Given her medical history, she was advised to wait to get clearance by the surgeon who operated on her during transplant as she has to take various drugs so that her body wouldn't reject the organ and he wanted to make sure that the antibiotics she was taking for the infection would not interfere with what she was already prescribed. I spoke to Arnaud at Reception and explained the situation and asked to speak to Mr Germain, the manager of the hotel who refused to speak with me. Due to the sad circumstances that were forcing us to change our travel plans, I asked if we could postpone our bookings by a week which I was refused and I was forced to pay the full amount for 2 double rooms for 3 nights in a hotel that I never ever got to stay in. When we visited Paris a week later, I dropped in at the hotel as the hotel that we stayed in called Lindberg called Arnaud and got confirmation that the manager Mr Germain was in. Of course, Mr Germain refused to come out of his office to meet with me. What I witnessed next filled me with horror even further. A hotel guest who must have been over 6 or 7 months pregnant in need of rest asked to have access to the room as her husband had gone out and taken their key with him. Arnaud told her that she would have to wait in reception till her husband who was expected 2 hours later to come back even though Mr Germain and House-keeping had spare keys. This hotel might have fancy iMacs but what guests really look for when traveling in a strange place is people with understanding and compassion which was grossly missing in this establishment. Both the manager Mr Germain and his receptionist Arnaud could have made an exception in my mother's case and in the case of the pregnant lady based on the unfortunate circumstances and they chose not to which only goes to show that they shouldn't be in the hospitality business if customer service is not their top priority.", "Date": "November 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Valladolid, Spain", "Title": "\u201cchic, but very small\u201d", "Author": "leuqar", "ReviewID": "UR21338481", "Content": "The hotel is beautifully decorated, clean, and perfectly located.

You feel like you are staying in a local neighborhood when you walk to it from the RER/subway. The top floor is the last one to be renovated (which we stayed on) and it was fine except for no air conditioning during 2 warmer summer days when we were there in late July 2008 (staff said this is coming in 2009). This floor will be redone before the 2009 summer holiday period. These rooms were less expensive since they have the older, less fancy decor. The lower floors are already redone with an art deco design which looks very nice. The breakfast room is nice with a full continental breakfast for a modest price with a free internet Apple workstation in the lobby area which helped people checking email and making calls abroad. My apple notebook connected to the wireless hookup easily in the lobby/breakfast area but I couldn't get the signal on the 5th floor. I noticed that their pictures on a travel website were older pics than what we actually saw when we got there. If you are used to larger rooms, you will be tight here. The bathrooms are very small but very well maintained but there is no bureau or storage area other than one closet in most of the rooms. Also, there is no locking safe in the rooms for valuables so bring a lockable suitcase if you need security for your belongings. A couple of small night tables and a small writing desk & chair were the only other furniture. No pool or exercise room at the moment. The multi-lingual staff was very nice to help us with navigating Paris and the hotel was only 1.5 blocks from the Luxembourg RER & subway stop making it easy to get to both CDG & Orly airports by train and then walking to the hotel. It's about a 4-5 block hike down to the riverfront and Notre Dame where the main St. Michel metro stop is and about the same to the Odeon metro station. If you want to investigate St. Germain, you're only a couple of blocks walking distance to a trendy spot with lots of nightlife too. For \"american food die-hards\", McDonalds and Starbucks were both within 2 blocks of the hotel. This is a good hotel for the budget, travel saavy person that is mobile using buses and the metro. I highly recommend getting unlimited Paris Visite passes and hoping both to get around - the french rail and bus systems are excellent ways to get around to save your travel weary feet.

It was our first time in Paris and we already can't wait to go back! I recently became a travel agent and during training was informed that even though many tourists book hotels near the Champs Elysees or Opera, the 5th and 6th districts (Latin Quartier/St Germain de Pres) offer visitors the most authentic \"Parisian\" experience. I have to agree. While the Champs is pretty, the Left Bank is remarkable. And Hotel de la Sorbonne made our stay even more perfect. I booked Hotel de la Sorbonne because I had read about their newly renovated boutique-style rooms that featured iMac computers complete with internet access. I enjoy accommodations with character and Hotel de la Sorbonne fit the bill. I will confess that we were surprised to see that renos were still underway when we arrived. We booked 4 months prior to our trip and checked the website frequently and were under the impression renos had been completed. As of mid-May, they were in full swing, with scaffolding set up and contractors scraping away the facade loudly at the early hour of 8am. THE PROS: *The renovated Superior Room we booked was freshly decorated, clean and modern. The decor is charming. Check out my pictures! *The staff! They were incredibly helpful. My French speaking skills were \"tres weak\" but they responded with a smile and sense of humour. They all spoke excellent English but I tried to speak French as much as possible in an effort to learn. They seemed to respect my feeble attempts! Try to speak French whenever you can in France. Even if you fumble, French citizens appreciate your efforts. I found all Parisians to be very friendly and hospitable, incidentally. *North Americans must remember that accommodations in Europe tend to be smaller than in Canada, the US, Mexico and Caribbean. I found our room to be quite spacious for Europe! *The location can not be beat! It is close to everything you need: 10 minute walk to Notre Dame, Louvre, a block from the Luxembourg Gardens, St Michel, the RER to the airport/train station, shops, restos, etc. Unbeatable! THE CON: *Only one... The hotel's renos were noisy and our windows were blocked with scaffolding. We didn't mind because we planned on waking up to conquer the day each morning, but those wanting a sleep-in during construction would have a hard time. We would definitely return to this hotel and in fact, we're plan to go back next spring to see what the final renos will look like! However, as a travel agent I must say that I might hesitate to recommend this hotel until renovations are complete. Use your discretion... If you are someone who wants good service, a beautiful renovated room in the heart of Paris, then stay here. If you want quiet mornings and a picture-perfect hotel entrance, then maybe wait a couple of months to stay here. TIPS: *Get a map from the front desk that pinpoints the hotel's specific location when you arrive. We got confused one night and got a little lost on the side streets trying to find our way back. Maybe it was the wine? :) *Ask the front desk to explain how the in-room internet works if you intend to check your Hotmail/gmail/etc. French keyboards are different than North American!

The bathroom was quite spacious, of a cool design and with a good shower, but a very tiny toilet. A very poor quality and minimal range of toiletries were provided. The hotel really lets itself down by only providing plastic glasses! The hotel lift (elevator) is so tiny that it should only be shared with someone with whom you are prepared to be intimate!

NEGATIVES: Miniscule rooms and baths; expensive. Lobby is tiny. No amenities such as a coffee pot in the room. Towels were small and thin. Shuttle reserved by hotel canceled on us. Stayed here Sept 27-29, 2007. This hotel is ideally located on the Left Bank, and within walking distance of a lot of places, including restaurants. It is quaint--and the size of the bathroom is almost hilarious, like a doll house (couldn't sit straight on the toilet, as it was that close to the wall--had to turn sideways!). Our room was initially on the ground level, facing the courtyard. It had the larger bathroom, and the location was very quiet. The location was also good because you didn't have to haul your suitcase up any stairs. The elevator (\"lift\") held 1 person and your suitcase. When the reservation was made by my friend, she didn't realize that a double was a 'double' bed, and not 2 beds. So, the second night, we were able to switch to another room with twin beds, but on the third floor, and with the miniscule bathroom. Lighting was so dim, it was impossible to read in your bed. The room was tiny. We arrived just before 2 p.m., and had to leave our bags in the lobby area, as the room was not ready. This hotel is considered \"budget,\" with the cost of a night being $180 (USD). That price is ridiculous, but then, it is Paris, where a cup of tea and a pastry will set you back at least $10. And an Egg McMuffin at McDonald's, with hot chocolate, will cost you more than $10, too. (The hot chocolate was good.) We had asked the hotel to reserve the shuttle to take us to the airport upon checkout. That morning, the clerk called to say the shuttle had canceled (the evening before!!) for technical reasons. This was quite upsetting to hear. After going down to the front desk, I learned there were other shuttle companies, and I had the clerk call to reserve with one of them. Why the clerk didn't do that in the first place, we will never know. One thing to know about this hotel--the street name (Victor Cousin) is also named Rue de la Sorbonne (at one end). I got disoriented coming out of the subway stop that was barely a block away, and walked around for an hour--lost! I speak some French, so was asking many shop owners where this hotel was. Not only had they never heard of it, but they didn't know the street! Had I told them \"Rue de la Sorbonne,'\" getting back to the hotel would have been much easier and faster. Be sure to get a copy of the map from the desk clerk when you go out, showing the hotel location on it--that would have helped. Location was ideal--many restaurants just a half block away, the post office was a quarter block away, and we walked to Notre Dame, the Louvre, and many other sites. There are 2 subway stations close to this hotel. There were at least 12 people trying to check out around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday morning, and it took us nearly 30 minutes to check out (precious time we hadn't planned on). I would suggest that you make arrangements the night before by checking your bill, and paying then. It will be much easier and faster if you do. If you need to get to the airport, reserve the shuttle (much cheaper than a taxi) for pick-up at least 3 hours before you need to be at the airport. I recommend this for several reasons: First, others in the shuttle may be going to a different place than you are, but which is on the way. Second, the traffic, even on a Sunday, was pretty bad. It took an hour to get to the airport. Third, if the shuttle doesn't show up on time, there is still time to order another one. Note, however, that the shuttles require 24-48 hours notice. We were lucky to be able to get the shuttle, with the help of the desk clerk explaining what had happened with the other one canceling out. Finally, do not try to take the subway to the airport if you have anything more than a small suitcase. The reason: The subways have lots of stairs, and no elevators (or if there is one, it is impossible to find). Paris is not an ADA-friendly town, and people who have difficulty with stairs or are hauling around heavy suitcases, will find the subways impossible to maneuver. (One of the subways we exited required walking up more than 70 steps in a circular pattern!!) A shuttle ride will cost about $30 one way. If I were to stay at this hotel again, I would definitely want the ground level. And I would be staying there strictly for its location to so many things.", "Date": "October 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm", "Title": "\u201cCharmed\u201d", "Author": "maraemma", "ReviewID": "UR8589210", "Content": "A friend who lived in Paris told me about the Sorbonne .

A charming, light bright and airy room with a Parisian feel to it. Out of one window I could see the Pantheon and out of the other the tip of the Eiffel tower visible by night when it was lit up. Bathroom is also bright and clean with a lovely bathtub and an unsual shower attachment . One slight problem here ; .be warned - when you run the bath , make sure that the shower is not on. I saw the water running into the bath and did not notice water coming out of the shower attachment!!! The result - water all over the towels and my toiletries bag .

Our basin had a massive crack in it and several of the bathroom wall tiles were cracked or filled, plus there was no stand-up shower, just an attachment to the bath taps.

We did not take breakfast in the hotel, instead opting for the cafes on the small Place just 100m down the hill, which was perfect. The location couldn't be faulted.

I was very disappointed because the hotel was in a lovely location but the noise in particular was the main reason why I would not return to this hotel.", "Date": "February 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location\u201d", "Author": "icassini", "ReviewID": "UR6820421", "Content": "The room was quite small but cozy and very clean and tidy.

The best thing about this hotel is definitely its location: right in the center of the Latin Quarter, a short walk (10 mins) to the Ile de la Cite. Another good thing are the prices - check their website for offers, we found a great offer (but this did require booking few months in advance). Rooms are rather basic and yes - they are small, but we didn't mind since we came to Paris to enjoy the city and not to stay in our small room. All the staff at the reception desk was very helpful and greeted us with smile. This can't be said for the lady that serves breakfast though. The breakfast itself was a rip-off (consisting only of croissant, bread and jam along with the coffee, juice and yogurt).
