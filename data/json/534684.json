{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great value Stayed here for three nights. Very clean, very basic hotel, close to the main train station and like most main train stations not in a very nice area, but we were never bothered by the people frequenting the sex shops and lap-dancing clubs, we never felt unsafe. The hotel seems to be used by many people coming the Frankfurt to work, just while they establish themselves. Many Russian and Polish visitors too.They provide a very nice basic buffet breakfast and for the price they charge it is fantastic value. The pressure in the shower was the best we had in any of six different hotels we stayed in in Poland and Germany. I would definitely go back.We did not use it, but they have secure parking.", "Date": "Aug 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR648246759", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "newgrange"}, {"Content": "Average hotel This hotel is situated in the red light district of Frankfurt. Easy to get to from the International airport, about 25 minutes away by train. From the train station the hotel is just 1 block away.It's located just behind a bar which appeared to be heavily frequented by men of Croatian descent. The reception area is small but is nicely decorated which gives the hotel the image of a respectable hotel. The rooms themselves were rather basic, with everything you would expect to find, except for tea/coffee making facilities. Ensuite, tv and again nicely decorated. I can't comment on the breakfasts as I didn't sample them.Location wise, it could be better. However if you don't mind staying in the red light district (which had a fairly relaxed feel about it) it's ok - a 15 minute walk takes you towards the CBD and the old town, which is very picturesque. A number of bridges over the river Main takes you into Sachsenhausen, which has a great selection of bars and restaurants. All in all a farily standard (and reasonably priced) hotel.", "Date": "Nov 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR772740747", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "ell33"}, {"Content": "Easy access to the Messe but a terrible neighbourhood...
