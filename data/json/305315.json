HUGE!!! My wife really loved it!!! We also enjoyed hanging out there drinking red wine and eating parmesan cheese \u9225?amazing value and top quality!!!

What a lovely experience it was! We loved the oversized rooms, the huge bathroom and the B and B atmosphere of the hotel. The morning breakfast spread was wonderful, with cold items and made to order hot items equally available. Our room included a chaise lounge for relaxing and reading that was welcome after full days on our feet!The villa is situated in a quiet neighborhood, within walking distance of the central part of town and a welcome respite from the congestion of the main part of the city. The best part of all, however, is the delightful, gracious and helpful staff managing the hotel. Each person we encountered was kind and went out of her way to be helpful with whatever our needs were, from finding the correct bus, or calling a cab to getting a guide lined up in Rome at our next stop. The hotel staff also provided a helpful written guide to restaurants in the neighborhood and kindly made reservations for us each night when we decided where we wanted to go. Our experience at Villa Antea was so perfect that we promised to tell all our friends about it when we got home. I have already written my travel agent and advised her to book her future clients at this gem of a hotel.", "Date": "Oct 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR242445977", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "AnnaLisa8"}, {"Content": "Great stay at the villa My wife and I just returned from a 4 night stay at the villa and would certainly stay there again the next time we are in Florence.

The breakfasts, the usual meats and cheeses plus any style eggs you wanted with bacon or sausage, were great and sustained us until the mandatory late afternoon gelato trip.

All the hotel staff and the owner were very friendly and took the time to make sure everything was to our liking. We don't mind a little walking and if you are in fair physical condition you'll have no problem walking to most of the sites.

The building and rooms are full of light and artfully decorated, bathrooms are sumptuous, and the staff were nicer and friendlier than at a typical tourist or business hotel. Being from New York City, I didn't mind at all the 15 minute walk to the City Center. I brought my mother to Italy for her birthday and she loved this hotel (so long as we took a taxi home!).My only issue with Villa Antea occurred about two months after our stay. As I understand it, Villa Antea changed ownership a little less than a year ago, but the previous owners, before selling the hotel, charged my credit card twice for my stay. I didn't catch this double charge immediately and after months of filling out forms, my credit card company declined to refund me the charges (next time I'll use American Express or cash!). I brought this issue up with the current owners of Villa Antea and they have since sent me a voucher for an equivalent visit.Since the double charge did not take place during their ownership, I am very satsified with their response and their willingness to take responsibility to remedy the situation. They seem to care very much about their guests' experience, even one year after their stay! Perhaps next time, I'll bring my husband to this hotel, as it is well suited to be a romantic get-away.

Our daughter had previously stayed there just before Christmas and loved it.As other's have commented it is a delightful place, very helpful front desk staff, enormous bedrooms and bathrooms (even by the standards or American hotels) with an interesting mixture of classical design and furnishings alongside very contemporary elements. The (buffet) breakfast was relatively simple but everything very fresh. The Caprise salad was excellent and the fresh fruit salad looked as if the ingredients were fresh as opposed to the usual European offering of canned fruit. As it was January we obviously weren't able to sample the outdoor terrace.Also as others have noted, it is about a fifteen to twenty minute walk to SMN train station - I'm not sure I could get to the Duomo in fifteen minutes without braking into a jog. When the weather is favorable this isn't that disadvantageous but when its cold and/or wet it's less appealing. In addition the walk is not particularly interesting, if one likes to be in the center of things this probably isn't a good choice. A taxi from the Centro late at night for a party of four was EUR14. The local bus stop is just around the corner, however, we're told they don't run frequently after 8 PM.The one thing that took the edge off for us was no hot water the morning of our stay; the boiler had broken the previous evening.Overall I'd say a nice place for those looking for a large bedroom and bathroom, who appreciate interesting design, don't mind limited hotel style services and don't mind an invigorating walk every time one goes into town. I have a harder time deciding on vale for money and whether its worth it in the spring or summer. EUR180 per night seems expensive to me but I don't know what rates are for comparable hotels nearer the center, I do know that Florence is expensive generally.", "Date": "Jan 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR733512960", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "TiburonTony"}, {"Content": "large, lovely  What a lovely villa!
