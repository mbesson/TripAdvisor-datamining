{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Hotel photos a misrep The hotel has its own covered carpark which is a relief since there was simply nowhere to park nearby. I would recommend taking the no.22 bus to the city centre (or if it's in the evening, take a taxi, it's only 10-15 euros and we felt much safer) rather than driving as you wouldn't have to worry about finding a parking space. Bus tickets can be purchased from the hotel reception- you need a ticket before boarding the bus. Staff are very friendly.I must say though that the photos you see of the rooms of this hotel are very misleading, and based solely on the pictures posted up I was very unimpressed when I actually walked into the room. But then the room was very spacious and quite clean, and the kitchen was fully functionable. There's a supermarket next to the reception so you can get all your cooking supplies there. Via di Novoli is a big road so don't be surprised if you are woken up by traffic in the morning.They say you have internet access in the room, but that is only if you brought your own laptop- you can borrow a cable from them. Wi-Fi doesn't work in the room.Just don't expect grandeur- at this rate you're getting value for money.", "Date": "Oct 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR597886988", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "JC_sakura"}, {"Content": "Great Rooms       The bed was comfy enough... no real complaints.", "Date": "Jul 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR506294140", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "jljahrig"}, {"Content": "Great facilities for a great price A fantastic place to stay if you don't mind being a 15 minute bus ride from the centre.

It would have been nice to have a kettle but a pan served well on the electric hob.Getting to the hotel: There are a few things here that might help as the directions are not too good if you\u9225\u6a99e using public transport. Take the number 22 bus from the station, the bus trip is about 10-15 minutes, the hotel is on the left hand side of the road and not easy to spot, the easiest method is to keep a look-out on the right for a big Euronics store, press the stop bell when you see it and the next stop will be the one you want with the hotel on your left. We were looking for the building numbers on the right (you can't see the left, it\u9225\u6a9a too far), the problem we had was that by the time you have reached just No60 on the right you have missed the hotel (No87 on the left) as the numbers increase quicker on the right.One very good thing is free internet (wired not Wi-Fi) in your room, reception will give you a cable, login  password if you ask.The room was very clean and bed was very comfortable, being a city location the views were nothing to write home about. You also have a nice large balcony.We walked to the train station on one day (May 1st as its a public holiday and no busses were running) and it takes about 30 minutes but is an easy direct walk without needing to change direction. we stayed on the top floor (5th) and did not hear any noise from the next door rooms and although a little street noise which is to be expected it was a nice quiet room.Highly recommended.", "Date": "May 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR189949249", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Ziggyuk"}, {"Content": "Excellent apartment for a very good price We stayed at the Quadra Key apartment for two nights in mid-April 2008 and found it to be excellent accommodation \u9225?particularly for the discounted price of EURO150 that we got through Wotif. After staying in plenty of 'character' accommodation in Italy, we were pleased to get something that was near new, very clean (we didn't realised it was serviced so returned one day to find the place completely cleaned for us) and with comfortable beds. Even better, it had WiFi web access so we could catch up on emails and skype home. Yes, it is a little out of the centre of town, but the 22 bus goes from just outside right to the Duomo, and the car parking bay is much appreciated if you are doing day trips. The local Hertz office is also only a 100 m walk away. There is a supermarket downstairs (a small one, although a bigger store is about 500m away) plus a laundromat around the corner. We were very happy with the two-bedroom apartment we received and equally happy with the service. A real find. One note, no kettle or toaster: don't know why, but this seems to be fairly common in Italian accommodation.

Parking is very secure with a key for the basement garage, as well as a key for the main door of the building and one for the apartment dead bolt lock. The neighborhood didn't feel safe at night, and street noise was loud. That said, the room itself was nice: clean and modern. We didn't use the kitchen except for the refrigerator. We would've liked a microwave instead of a dishwasher! The bathroom was very small, but all new and nicely decorated. It lacked a hairdryer.

I stayed as a single traveller in this apartment complex. The rooms are spacious and clean, and the staff all extremely knowledgable about the local area, and bus routes into town.

The ASDL line is relatively slow, but for a quick check of email is ok.I think that the advantage of staying here is the close proximity to the supermarket, and thus the ability to cook wonderfully fresh, delicious ingredients.

The apartments are spacious with a great little kitchen complete with oven, cooktop, dishwasher and full fridge (far superior to the facilities at our Tuscan villa). The staff were fantastic, very helpful on all levels and nothing was too much trouble from travel arrangements to restaurant recommendations . They were kind enough to open their reception earlier than usual to cater for our early departure and even offered us a coffee to start our day. We travelled by taxi to the city centre each day at a cost of around ten euros which represents fantastic value for the ease and convenience. At the end of the day (and it was hot) we easily hailed a cab and in ten minutes we were back in our air conditioned haven. The main road was hectic but we were not disturbed by any noise at night.
