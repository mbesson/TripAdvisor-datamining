The location of this hotel is amazing in regards to seeing the French Quarter and other New Orleans attractions. All the staff were friendly and helpful and were ready to assist at any request. The only complaint we had was with the attached restaurant. The service was terrible! We can't review the food as the server lost our order.

What does that have to do with anything? I was just asking, so we went up to our room 1406. My 20yr old son, 15 yr old daughter and me. First my son noticed the bathroom light was blinking on and off, the wall switch had a hole near it in the wall. Then he realized the bathroom door knob stuck so you couldn't get out without really twisting and moving the knob. Finally the toilet wouldn't flush all the way without several flushes and holding the handle. The shower had an old dirty wire soap holder. Just not what this trusted chain prides themselves on. I will say the front desk immediately addressed this issue and moved us to 1810. I did appreciate that but even this room was not what we have grown to expect ceiling tiles were pushed up, bathroom was not very clean, black finger prints on the inside of the bathroom door, black material in the corner of the bathroom.

The room was not what we had paid for, the staff were rude to the point of being obstructive, the premesis is unkempt and falling apart and our entire stay was plagued with problems. The room only had one bed despite being assured four times previously that our room would have two, and the fold out had no mattress. We had to fight to get a rollaway which they wanted to charge us for. The walls and floor were less than clean, as was the bathroom. There is also no soundproofing between the room and the hall. The staff were so rude that we put a complaint in to the hotel chain, who assured us a manager would be up to talk to us. The manager called rather than seeing us personally but assured us that the fold out bed counted as a second bed and that we should have checked in earlier in the day. There is a laundry that guests can use, however the soap dispenser ate my money, one of the two washing machines was broken and no out of order signs posted. We actually wrote out our own 'out of order' sign after having to advise other guests of the problem, which is still there 3 days later. When we asked the various staff we could find (who all assured us that the problem was being fixed) for soap to wash our clothes with we had two staff members disappear without a further trace, the front desk who advised someone would be up though 2 hours later no one appeared, and were eventually provided with a booster by the security guard, but no actual soap as he advised there was none in the hotel.

I ordered two eggs, potatoes, toast, and sausage. I swear, I could have raised a chicken, grown potatoes, milled flour, and baked bread faster than these guys made my breakfast.

So we had no hesitation in selecting it again for our return visit. Sadly, the only thing that still remains the same is the excellent location \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and, to some extent, the service. Overall, the hotel appears faded and in need of an upgrade. The walls and carpets in particular have seen better days. We reserved a patio room which afforded direct access to an open area on the 9th floor. Unfortunately, the downside to this was the fact that the door to the patio was frosted glass. Which, while offering privacy, did nothing to block the morning sun. Consequently, we found ourselves lifting the bedspread over the top of the door and closing in the top of the door each night in order to block the anticipated morning sunlight. The room was a generous size - which was nice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but, again, it had seen better days and was looking rather tired and out-dated. The hotel has no restaurant of its own but is attached to what used to be a TGI Friday. This is now called the Checkered Parrot. Upon check-in we were reminded that we had reserved with a complimentary breakfast each morning, and were given vouchers to use at the Checkered Parrot. However, upon reading the vouchers, we found that they entitled the holder to a complimentary breakfast up to the value of $20 per room. Unfortunately, the buffet breakfast for 2 at the Checkered Parrot came to well in excess of $20. This is the first time we have ever stayed in a hotel where there have been limits placed on a complimentary breakfast that needed to be topped up with cash. Feeling that the whole \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcincluding breakfast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 aspect of our booking was a misrepresentation, after the first morning we chose to eat breakfast further down into the Quarter. We were happy to pay fully for breakfasts there, rather than be dissatisfied with a partial voucher at the Checkered Parrot.

Staff were always very friendly and helpful 2. Our room was cleaned daily and bed very comfortable and A/C cold and updated flat screen TV 3. As this hotel is in the French Quarters there are a lot of businesses (places selling liquor)open 24x7 and as such, the hotel is located across the street from a liquor store. and one would expect folks hanging out drinking in front of liquor store. 4. Wireless Internet in the rooms is a bit spotty at times and also down at times. I would agree the hotel needs to do a better job of monitoring this as it is not hard to to. 5. This hotel appears to be old, but I would say it is not dated. Room and lobby appropriate decore (not up scale). 6. The hotel has 3 elevators to the 18th floor and a single elevator from 18th to the 21st floor. We stayed on the 18th floor and never had an issue with having to wait on the elevators. However, some folks we met did report this issue. I suspect that those folks complaing were attempting to get on the elevators during check out times or the elevator was full when it got to them and they had to wait for another elevator.

We were pleased to be able to check into our room early, but our friends weren't able to check in until after the 4pm check in time. When we went to our room, we found that the bathroom had not been cleaned . . . used soap and wash cloths on the sink and I don't know when the floor in that bathroom was last cleaned. Also, the bathroom smelled strongly of vomit, and it made the whole room smell bad. We brewed the in-room coffee to try to mask the smell. Our room was not serviced on the second day of our stay. By the time the housekeeping staff came by, it was well after 5pm and I was taking a shower to go out for dinner. We just asked for fresh towels and soap. On the third day, I decided to take our friends' child swimming, only to find her room key didn't work anymore. And, the manager refused to give us access to the room, even though I could produce the receipt showing we'd booked and paid for the room. When her parents returned, they found their room keys didn't work as well. The hotel locked our friends out of a room that was booked for several more nights. When the keys were replaced, the manager was unappologetic. The last evening of our stay, we took the child for a swim to find that the pool and exercise area were out of towels. I went to the front desk to request they send up more towels. Several patrons of the pool called multiple times to ask for towels. It was well over an hour before towels were brought up to the pool. The hotel needs to hire adequate staff to service rooms in a timely manner, and so that the staff isn't so rushed to get through all the rooms that they do a sloppy job.

Check-in I found most of the check-in staff to be quite miserable, no friendly welcoming smile, not a good start to your trip. Elevators As I was on the 20th floor, I had to take 2 elevators to get to my room. The first elevator was okay, but the second one was so dodgey I wasn't sure I'd make it through the trip alive. I had a great sense of relief when I stepped off of it. Room When I entered the room I thought it had been broken into - the lamps were so close to the wall that it looked like they'd been knocked, the air con was positioned right under the privacy blinds which made them blow around like crazy as though a window was wide open, not well thought out. The room was dark and depressing, the furniture wasn't well maintained and there was even a door in the room that I don't know where it led to, but it made you feel somewhat vulnerable. All the facilities were there however, and there was some evidence that the room was cleaned regularly, not very well though. Room Service The food comes from the Checkered Parrot restaurant which adjoins the hotel - best avoid it. I ordered a Jambalaya and recieved a sausage gumbo of okay quality. They also said that they cannot bring drinks upto the rooms - seriously? Location As soon as you step outside the hotel, you will find a number of very dodgey looking men stood opposite (outside a closed-down and graffitti-fronted shop), surveying the hotel. These people wait for a vulnerable-looking tourist or businessman, and will approach you and somehow (sometimes quite cleverly) try to get money out of you. I suggest you refuse, because you are constantly harassed by the homeless, drunks and drug users for money, New Orleans is a begging town, and I felt unsafe staying here. Comfort The bed is comfortable, but good luck getting any sleep with the constant noise of music, sirens, tram horns and drunks outside. Even in the corridors, there are swaythes of drunks. Oh, and if you think closing the door will keep the noise out, you are mistaken, because there is a 4\" gap underneath every hotel room door so you do not get anywhere near the privacy you would expect in a hotel. Free Wi-fi Don't even bother trying to connect to the free wi-fi, its the slowest internet connection I've ever come across. May as well not be there. Summary This hotel is good for one thing - people who want to come to New Orleans to get drunk, and just want somewhere to sleep. If you are travelling on business, as a family, or want to sleep at night, stay somewhere else!

Highlights are its being convenient to the French Quarter... but for the price I think I'd be strongly tempted to stay across the bridge in Slidell if I was visiting the area again, except for maybe a night or too if you really wanted to walk the French Quarter at night. The French Quarter is probably something that you should see at least once just because its there LOL. Shrug. Overall I had more fun touring other areas in the NO area vs. the French Quarter which is really very expensive for what it is. On the plus side, parking was reasonably good and they have a very nice, heated, indoor pool on like the 10th floor. I found it relatively quiet anytime I wanted to use it and to be honest, that was one of the reasons I chose this motel over others in the area. Again, for almost double the price though, a short drive to a MUCH nicer hotel in the Slidell area seems like the way to go for me. Oh, they don't have a safe in room or downstairs, but the staff was friendly enough to give me access to one of their employee lockers which seemed a safer bet than leaving my laptop, passports, etc. in the room.

No mention of my Priority Club Platinum status, which is unusual for IHG brands. They did however allow us 2pm check out when we asked, mentioning Platinum status. There is a very small but acceptably decorated lobby with a small front desk.

The common areas were nicely decorated, though the lobby looks out on the parking garage. The hotel has a small but nice indoor pool.

My friend called and booked 4 rooms, which were put on \"hold\" for us. We were told that the card would not be charged and that we would be able to pay in cash upon arrival. The hotel ran the card anyway, spelling my friends name wrong, so the card was declined. They cancelled our rooms and never notified us. When we called two days prior to arrival, to cancel one of the rooms, they told us it was too late to cancel it, but still did not say anything about us not even having a room in the first place. The second time we called to ask about early check in, and that is when my friend was notified that we didn't even have any rooms booked. Eventually that issue was resolved. We requested a handicap room, they gave us a regular room and wouldn't give us a cot because it was a fire hazard. You can have cots in handicap rooms because the rooms are bigger, and we knew this which is why we asked for one. On our second morning I was blow drying my hair and the outlet started to spark and have flames coming out from behind the outlet faceplate. I quickly unplugged the hair dryer and got burned. The hotel handled in all the wrong ways. They kicked us out of our room for hours until an electrician could come fix the outlet. Originally they told us that they couldn't get an electrician until Monday and that the hotel was booked so they were trying to figure out what to do with us. They wouldn't compensate us for anything because they didn't view the situation as an inconvenience and would only speak to my friend since the credit card was in her name under our room, even though I was listed on the room, made the initial complaint, and was the one that got burned. I was told by a friend that is a manager at a different Holiday Inn that I should contact guest relations and then the hotel is forced to address the issue and will be under review, This way they will question the manager since our complaint is legit and our issues should be resolved. We have the incident on video, but tripadvisor only allows photos. I felt that the rooms were clean when we arrived, but housekeeping didn't keep them clean as other hotels do. There was no outlet in the bathroom. Housekeeping kept leaving us with only two towels even though 4 guests were registered in the room and they didn't restock the toilet paper, we had to ask for it. The blankets were super thin and the pillows were really small. I'm really upset with how the manager handled our fire hazard situation, was unsympathetic, unhelpful and rude.

There wasn't even a refridgerator in the rooms, which for $179.00 a night you would think they would have one. The manager was very rude and errogant when we inquired with him about our friends truck fitting in the parking job, he treated my friend like he was an idiot. Also we paid for parking when we checked in ($27 a day for 2 vehicles for 2 nights) but when we went to leave the very rude lady at the gate told us it showed we only paid for 1 vehicle for 2 nights. So my friend paid for his vehicle assuming that his friends vehicle would not have to pay to get out because she said that only \"one\" vehicle had been paid for. But after we pulled thought she stopped our friends vehicle behind us and sure enough made him pay to leave too. Thats and EXTRA $108 that was paid because we paid for it when we checked in and then had to pay for it to get out of the hotel parking garage. To tope everything off when we recieved our bill for our hotel room there was a charge for $39.00 for a movie. We went down to the front desk and asked the clerk to remove it because we did not watch an movies and she stated she would have to investigate and make sure we didn't watch the movie for more than 30 mins or she could not remove if from the bill. Sure enough it stated we watched a adult movie package from 2:42 a.m. until 4 a.m. which we did not do. Our TV wasn't even on at those times and everyone in the room was sleeping. Had we ordered the movie and watched it we gladly would have paid for it but to know that we were sleeping and the tv wasn't even on really upset me. Of course the woman at the front desk looked at us like we were just lying to watch a free porn but I assure you we didn't even have the tv on much less watching it for over a hour. So lets tally this up $108.00 that we paid at check in had to be paid again when we left and then $39 for a movie that wasn't even watched is $147.00 that hotel got us for and it wasn't even worth it. Also the elevators were so messed up at check out that we were trying to go from the 12th floor to the 5th floor and it took us all the way to the 6th floor and then took us UP to the 18th floor and made about 5 stops before we got to the 5th floor.

The position of the hotel was ideal just on Royal street & one block over from Bourdon street so you can't get much better than that. Was on the top floor of the hotel so had to take two lifts to reach my room so a bit of a pain. If you are 18 or lower you are fine just one lift ride, on 19 and 20 too steps by lift or a walk up the stairs. The lifts were rather slow and there are only three for the whole building! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s OK most of the time but not at check in, or out or breakfast as you can wait a looooong time for one then especially if a bus of tourist arrives! The room was clean and the bed comfortable to sleep on, but the air conditioning was noisy so ended up with it off at night so I could sleep, In September that's OK but in July and August it might just be tooo hot for that!! The decor in the corridor areas was rather dire cream walls (fine), but brown doors and yellow/brown carpet, see the picture not too my taste at all! Had free internet access as part of the rate the only problem was that the wireless signal in my room was TOO weak to a) hold a lock for long before it dropped out or b) work at all some days. I spent a lot of time on the 10th floor near the swimming where the signal was really strong. The staff did not seem to mind there was no signal, 'phone the support staff its nothing to do with us, or use it near the pool or in reception, not really very helpful! One day it went really cranky and did not work at all but one of the \"bell boys\" was really helpful & tried to help, certainly did more that he needed too, well done! Ate in the restaurant for breakfast, the staff were really friendly but food was not very exciting. Some days had an a le carte option and others a buffet I think it depended on how full the hotel was. I fancied pancakes and \"maple\" syrup one day yum, only problem was that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not maple syrup just a mixture of corn syrup, colour, flavours and preservatives, \"never had any problems with our syrup before\" they said! \"No but I think you should change the description on the menu\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was my retort. In Europe they could be liable under the trade descriptions act!!! OK overall the hotel was clean and comfortable, staff were friendly and apart from the internet access helpful. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a 5* hotel so you get what you pay for, I could have gone over the road for $160 a night or here for $80!

We even received a call from the head housekeeper at 7pm on a Saturday. I was impressed. A few minor complaints. We were on the 17th floor and the thermo pain window seal had been broken so the window was fogged over and we couldn't see out. The window sill needed to be cleaned. They do have a guest laundrey which is good but it only has 2 washers and 1 dryer for a large hotel. People had to wait a long time to use the laundry.

It's a great price for the location in the French Quarter; close enough to the action of Bourbon Street but not so close to be a problem with noise and congestion. The lobby was clean. The room seemed marginally clean, probably because the slightly musty smell, the poor lighting and the outdated decor made me suspect it was not clean. It was very quiet, we never heard anyone in the halls and the place was full. The floors are oddly arranged; you get off the elevator and then have to walk up or down a 1/2 flight of stairs, which is a pain when you have lots of luggage. The elevators are small and slow. This is a huge problem at checkout. I heard people complaining that they had waited over an hour for an open elevator that they could board with their luggage. We gave up waiting and carried our bags down 9 flights of stairs. Tip: if you have to do this, enter the gargage when you first can so you can pull your luggage easily rather than thumping down each stair. So why stay, besides wanting a cheap, in every meaning of the word, stay? Stay for the concierge. He was working 10 am - 6 pm the weekend we were there. I think he said he worked 6 days a week and had Mondays off. He was wonderful. Although not a native to NOLA, he has been there long enough to learn a thing or two. He helped us find a restaurant that was delicious, in our price range, with music, complete with walking directions and a map. He saved us the AM walk to Cafe DuMonde for a closer cafe that had equally great beingets, which was important to us because we were pressed for time on one of our mornings. He suggested a few jazz clubs on Bourbon that were a great alternative to Preservation Hall. If you don't know NOLA and need some trustworthy guidance and you plan on spending your time exploring the city rather than hanging out in your room, I would seriously consider staying here.

But the worst-case ones seem based on the reviewers' insecurity or lack of knowledge re basic travel. Regarding the hotel and the rooms, the hotel has a great location near Bourbon Street and Canal, i.e. the streetcar system and a gazillion great restaurants, shops, and other attractions (including the Insectarium and Harrahs). It is what it is supposed to be -- a solid 3-star hotel -- and it isn't what it isn't supposed to be (ie the Ritz). As far as the room, they are decent size, but some are older style but that's indicative of most Nola hotels (they're dealing with existing infrastructure). I could quibble with some logistics (ie the bathroom door slams into the toilet and yes there's a 20\" tube tv), but the big thing is that the bed is comfy and the room is decently appointed. The elevator issue was a big \"huh\" -- during a busy holiday weekend it's been no issue or delay and the 18th floor connector elevator is lightning-fast (yeah they dont have AC but whats the point, you're only on them for a minute right?). Plus the staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful, from checkin to any issues or interactions. Curtis and a colleague assisted me on checkin to a pre-assigned room and re-assignment (my 1st room was ina nosier area and I politely asked if there'd be any way to move, understanding that I had a discounted room during a busy holiday weekend and that it might not be possible). I wonder how many other reviewers who had experiences acted indignant or copped an attitude -- the front desk staff was wonderful! Housekeeping was very respectful as well...I slept in and no knocks or calls, and when I didnt need service, that was it (front desk let housekeeping know and that was it). My only criticism of the hotel is its free internet, which is spotty (weak signal) and simply does not work in several rooms, with no wired internet available as a replacement or even a backup service available. The nearby Hotel Monteleone's service, which is provided by the same entity that provides the HI, has a way stronger signal than the HI's...go figure.

Use the bellman to get your bags in and out because they have a designated elevator or otherwise the wait can be 30 minutes. The indoor pool was perfect for our 8 year old son. There is no restuarant in the hotel..the kids eat free is at the food joint next door which has good food but is slow with lousy service. If your traveling with kids this location is perfect since your off Bourbon Street but within walking distance to the street car stop and other kid friendly activities. Be aware there is a store across the street that seemed to attract a lot of activity and some very interesting characters.", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "colorado", "Title": "\u201cNot bad\u201d", "Author": "ColoradoDeb", "ReviewID": "UR116162785", "Content": "The hotel was clean, but a bit outdated and run down.

When we arrived we parked in their secured parking lot which was nice. We really did not like driving in the Quarter so we were happy to have somewhere safe to leave our car parked for most of the trip. When we arrived the front desk service was prompt and welcoming. After waiting almost 10 minutes for an elevator (one was broken and the others were extremely slow) we arrived in our room which was on the top floor of the hotel. We really enjoyed this floor as you have to take a separate elevator to get up there and it was really quiet throughout our entire trip. Our room was definitely amazing value for only $50 per night! It had a large bed, granite counter tops in the bathroom with a large tub, and overlooked the Mississippi River. As we walked in, there was a steamboat on the river which was pretty amazing to see! Overall, I would recommend this hotel as a decent home base for any visit to the Quarter. It is a bit of a walk to Jackson Square (Definitely walkable though) but it is also close by restaurants like Mr. B's. We didn't spend that much time in the room as there is so much to see and do in New Orleans to keep busy with but our stay here was for the most part comfortable. On a side note, we found the maid service to be pretty pushy about cleaning the rooms. On the day we were going to check out at 9 AM my fiance ran down to the car to drop off some of our stuff. After he left, I decided to take a quick shower, as I was getting out the maid tried to walk in our room! It was still 9AM! Luckily, I was in a towel but it was still a little unnerving. After a few trips to the car to load up our belongings she tried to come in several more times and this was all prior to the required check out time.

It was four of us: me, my best friend, her 15 yo son and my 16 yo nephew. After leaving Slidell around 12:00 noon, we stopped at Willie Mae\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Scotch House for some of there delicious fried chicken. After eating, we went straight to the hotel parking garage to park so that we could go to the Aquarium of the Americas, which is within walking distance. The parking was self-park, and the parking attendant advised us to take our parking ticket with us when checking in. It was around 3:00 and check-in was at 4:00, so we left our luggage in the car and went to the aquarium. After the aquarium visit, we stopped at Sak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fifth Avenue and shopped a bit, then headed back to check-in. The hotel is on Royal Street, one block off of Canal Street, and one street over from Bourbon Street. In my opinion, close to the action, but away from the noise on Bourbon that can go on all night long. When we got back to the hotel to check-in, the lobby was full of guests in three different lines. Not sure what that was all about, but the little lobby was packed. And it was nearly 6:00 p.m. It must have taken us nearly 45 minutes to check in, but once we got up to the counter, the employee was very polite and helpful. I asked if we had a room with a river view, and she said no. But she quickly switched us to a room with a view of the Mississippi, which made me very happy! That earned them a few extra points in my book! We were also given a parking card which we could use to go in and out of the garage as needed while there, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drive anywhere once we arrived. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. The parking fee of $26/day was added to our hotel bill. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reasonable price for hotel parking in downtown NO, plus you can self park and are not forced to valet park. Some hotels have parking in the next block or several blocks away from their hotel, and you have to wait for them to bring your car to you, plus it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a higher cost per day AND you have to tip them! We were given a room on the 19th floor, which requires two elevators \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one that goes to the 18th floor, then we had to switch to a different elevator that went to floors 19 and 20. We had a room with two double beds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the beds were comfortable and the pillows were decent. Hot water was available at all times. Ac unit worked well and kept the room cool and comfortable. An iron and ironing board were provided in the room, as well as decent toiletries in the bathroom, and a coffee pot and coffee. The pool was on the 10th floor, not very big and the chlorine smell was very strong. The boys decided not to get in because there were quite a few smaller kids in there when we went. The pool only goes from 3 feet to 5 feet. The fitness center is right next to the pool, and is extremely small. There are a couple of treadmills and some free weights, but not much room to work with the weights. For dinner, we took the boys to Daisy Dukes, a small beer and burger joint a couple of streets over on Chartes. It was pretty good. We all left full. Later that night, BFF and I left the boys and went to the Carousel Bar in the Hotel Monteleone for drinks. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one block down on Royal Street, so a quick and easy walk from this hotel. Cool bar to visit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it slowly rotates around like what? A Carousel! Just kinda cool experience if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never been before. Also, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never had a Pimm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cup, try it. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty good. I had two of them. Slurp! The bartenders were very nice and were glad to explain to you what some of the various drinks were and how they were made. On Sunday morning, we went to breakfast at Oceana Grill, once again, in walking distance on Conti Street and Bourbon. Delicious Pain Perdu or lost bread served there! If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never had it, try it! We also shared one of their world famous crepes \u00e2\u20ac\u201ca wesome and huge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can definitely be shared between 2-3 people. Overall, the hotel is a good place to lay your head without breaking the bank. I would stay there again without hesitation. Good location to Canal Street, the riverwalk, the aquarium, the St. Charles streetcar line, and the French Quarter. Be sure to sign up for Priority Rewards too!!!

When I checked in the desk clerk attempted to run the credit card several times and informed me that the card had been declined. This in the very small check in area crowded with people. He explained that sometimes credit card companies will decline a credit card when it's used outside of where you live. How absurd. How do people travel? My sister then had to use her debit card to pay for the room. It came to light later that the clerk had run my card three times twice with the incorrect amount and all three times with the incorrect expiration date. I returned to the desk and explained what had happened. An aplogy was given but no more. Later in the weekend we left the room in the morning and returned several hours later to store packages. While in our room housekeeping came to clean the room, I answered the door and explained we would be leaving the room in a few minutes and could she please come back later. She looked at me like I had asked her to cut off her hand. Way too much attitude. We did leave the room 10 mintues later, walking around the cleaning cart right in front of our door, as she was cleaning the room next door. We returned to our room several hours later and our room was still not cleaned. I called down to the front desk and was told someone would clean the room and bring fresh towels. Three phone calls and one hour later someone delivered towels, wet and dirty towels. After chasing the person down the hall and requesting clean towels we received clean towels, thirty mintues later.

The problem is there are three elevators that cover the garage floors as well as the room floors. It was normal to have to wait for 30 minutes for an elevator. We were on the 17th floor and would sometimes opt to catch an elevator going up to the 18th, only to find that other people on lower floors had done the same thing.

I seen a few people who didn't swipe their room key and expected it to go. (it won't) Bottom line: elevators are fine. They can get full but I never had to wait for a second one because of capacity. Second, the hallways, common areas, rooms, etc. do not stink as some have stated. Third, the AC works just fine and I actually had to turn mine off last night because it got too cold. Finally, the neighborhood is what it is and you cannot blame the hotel for that. If you don't like the area then don't stay in this part of town. For me it was not an issue as I have stayed in the downtown area of many major cities. This hotel is an average hotel for those corporate travelers who are used to staying in Marriott, Sheraton, Hilton, Doubletree, etc. All the amenities you expect as a business traveler are here but without extras that you may get at the nicer places. Staff is OK but not exceptional. Overall, I would stay here again for the right price.

Our room was clean upon arrival, it was made up and cleaned while we were out. I had no complaints. Yes, maybe the bathroom was a bit outdated, but this is a 3-star hotel. We were always greeted when we entered into the lobby, I never saw \"bums\" in the lobby, or felt that I was in an unsafe area. As for the previous review regarding the elevators not working...you have to enter in your room card to press what floor you want to go on, when going up to or down from your room. Again, I never had a problem with this. It was quiet in the hallways, and never had an issue with noise. We were there over the Easter weekend. I can easily see when there would be more noise to deal with, depending on the events that are occuring while you are there. The stores across the street were convienent for grabbing snacks for the room. We were a block away from Burbon street, and very close to Canal street. We felt safe walking to and from our hotel, day and night. Yes, there are plenty of local folks that will ask you for money, but they are friendly and will leave you alone after you say no.

Our room was great, two double beds fit our family of 4 just fine. The accommodations were very comfortable. My only complaint would be that the elevator was very slow. On Saturday morning, we walked around a bit and when we returned to the hotel they got us a cab to the cruise terminal. After seeing the massive line to get into the cruise terminal parking garage we realized we made a great choice!! Upon disembarking today, we caught a cab straight back to the hotel, loaded our stuff into the car, let the desk staff know we were there to get our car and we were gone. (The boat cleared customs at 8AM and we were on the freeway home at 9:15AM).", "Date": "March 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Iberia, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "mdboutte", "ReviewID": "UR95834469", "Content": "We loved the location as it is right in the middle of everything. Parking was good because you park your own car and take the elevator straight to your room.

This was an inconvenience especially carrying things because you had to switch elevators. Staff was awesome! The only problem is when you exit there are two convenience stores across the street where rif-raf hang out. They are very loud and screeming at people to walk around them. Police need to patrol this area. One instance was a guy taking off his shirt to fight. Perhaps if policemen patrolled this area they could rid the area of these kinds. Beds were very comfortable.

It is very close to Bourbon Street and some restaurants so it is convenient. Also not a bad walk to the casino. At times you will have to walk a little to get places, and you may be in a very urban environment, but this is a city! Walking is expected. The area right outside the hotel looks a little shady, especially at night, so do watch your money closely!! Be careful. A friend of mine who owns a business in the city did say though that the street this hotel is on is safe, and the police station is very close. A variety of restaurants are nearby, from fast food to expensive. I loved this hotel location. Also we wanted a hotel that probably would not be haunted, so we liked the Holiday Inn for this reason as well! Our room was on the opposite side of where Bourbon Street is, (not on the side of where the hotel entrance is), so I am sure this reduced some street noise. We looked out to a small alleyway and were on the 10th floor, so while we did hear some noise (people, trucks) it was not too bad. The hotel is in the center of it all, so you will hear some trucks and other city traffic. Overall the hotel is very basic - do not stay here if you are looking for true luxury or extras, hotel history, stories, etc... It has a small, plain lobby area (it often gets busy with lots of people who have had a few drinks, but that is New Orleans!) It is not as exciting as other hotels but we got such a deal on this place we had to stay there. They have 3 computers for internet use right in front of the elevators. The hotel does not charge you, but they do not provide chairs either -interesting! The pool is on the 10th floor, with a small fitness room. We did not have a car because parking at the hotel is expensive. The front desk staff, doormen, and concierge were all helpful and friendly. We also did not bother them too much either, so I am sure this helped.... we just kept to ourselves. We asked for a 30 minute extension on check out and they said it would be ok. As far as cleanliness, I found it to be fine and I like things really clean all the time. You can request new towels each day or use them again. We checked for bedbugs immediately upon entering the room - and whew! No bugs although I did still check carefully the next few days. Only bad thing was the toilet seat was a bit wobbly. We had a little trouble getting the toilet to flush one time and I called the front desk. When they send someone up, they call you first to let you know a maintenance person is waiting outside. He was very nice, and was there to do the very unpleasant job of fixing a toilet - but he said \"No problem, this is my job\" and he was still smiling. When he leaves, the front desk calls you again to confirm that he fixed it to your satisfaction. They have a restaurant as well, which is fine - we ate there for breakfast when the other places were full. The service, food, etc were average to pretty good. Large meals and plenty of TV's to watch a game. It has an island theme. We had a good experience here! I know some reviews are really bad though but it was fine for us.", "Date": "February 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat price, nice stay\u201d", "Author": "JetsetTX", "ReviewID": "UR93916157", "Content": "Stayed at the Holiday Inn French Quarter for the first time on the long MLK holiday weekend, which also happened to be the weekend of my birthday. I've lost track of how many times I've been in New Orleans but this was my first stay at this hotel. It's a block from Bourbon Street so it is a good location. It is on the edge of the French Quarter a half block from Canal Street. I usually prefer to be a little further inside the quarter but the prices everywhere else were outrageous for this weekend so we decided to stay here. Check in at the front desk was pretty fast and very friendly. The room was average in size but did have a pretty big bathroom. We were on the 19th floor, which required an elevator transfer on the 18th floor, the main elevators stop there and you have to change to another elevator to get to the 19th or 20th. Thought that was kind of strange and by the time we left it was downright annoying, especially with a bit of a hangover. The hotel was very nice overall, parking was reasonable (for New Orleans) at $26. And if you use your car while you are there, which we didn't, you can take the elevator from the garage to your floor. The room was very clean as was the bathroom, except for the small stain on the comforter which really wasn't a comforter, I don't know what to call it actually, but that wasn't very visible. The rooms, on our floor at least, seemed to be cleaned later in the day. Once we had left for a late breakfast around noon, came back and they still weren't done. When we walked back out we asked at the front desk and they said they would contact housekeeping and later on when we got back they were done. Another day, we came back to find one of the cleaners at the end of the hall and had to ask for towels because though our room had been cleaned they had only left one towel. But hey, it's the big easy everyone's kinda laid back about things. The beds were very comfortable. I did have a problem with the curtains which did not close all the way so if light is a problem for you in the morning when you're still trying to sleep, you might bring clips or something to hold the curtains together to let less light in. Also, they could be a little longer so light doesn't come in through the bottom too.

Upon arrival to our room, there was an old, worn sofa and chair in the sitting area and an old style small TV with poor reception, The bathroom was lacking towels and had used soap in the soap dish in the shower. Yuck. We reported our lack of towels and the fact that the maid skipped some steps, and they brought us some towels. We had no other issues other than the alarm clock would not work and made strange noises periodically. Also, we had no safe in the room, so we had to go down and get a safe deposit box to use.

When I first heard I was going to the big easy, I was very worried because 2 weeks prior there were plenty of news articles on bed bugs and this was one of the hot spots. I did a bit of research and it seemed there were indeed reports at this hotel. When I arrived, I was underwhelmed with the very basic lobby area. I was put on the 19th floor and this was most annoying because you have to take 2 elevators to get there. The room was large but it was very dark and the furnishing was very old and you could see it hadn't been renovated in many years. I immediately pulled off all the sheets and mattress pads and started my bed bug inspection. After 45 minutes I concluded that the bed was safe to sleep on which I was grateful for. However, I was disgusted to see the stains, hairs, dust and food that was in and around the bed and even underneath the mattress pad. The washroom was relatively clean except for the washroom door, you could see on the light paint, all these fingerprints - you could see exactly where someone put their hands. It was quite disgusting so I had to resort to opening the door with my foot. The room was very basic, no dry cleaning service, no room security box and the TV was a regular projection style. The clock was also so bright that there was a blue aura when I tried to sleep. The following days, I would sporadically receive new towels and there was one day the tub was not cleaned as I saw my hair from the morning still in the drain. And on the third day, there was some sort of larger red bug that was crawling on the toilet seat. It prompted me to do another bug inspection but it seemed to be the only one there. The housekeeping service was inconsistent and the front desk people weren't very helpful and you shouldn't expect them to have any sense of urgency. Their attitude is almost like you are \"bothering\" them with your request. I paid $145/night and felt even at that price I was overpaying for what I got.

As we had booked a Holiday Inn, we didn't have any doubts about this hotel. How wrong we were! The hotel is completely run down and in need of a complete renovation. The lifts were terrible and would stop randomly and go up and down on their own with doors that wobbled and didn't make you feel safe at all, especially as half of them looked as though they were part of a building site! The rooms were dated, dull and depressing! The crux of the problem though were the completely un-caring staff who were just not bothered with helping. The hotel advertises guest laundry facilities, and having been travelling for a month already, we booked this hotel primarily so we could easily do our laundry. When we checked in we were told that the laundry was on the 12th floor - perfect. So, the next day we went downstairs (from the 18th floor) to get change for the machines and double checked which floor it was on. We went up to the 12th floor with all our laundry to be greeted with a complete building site and builders who just looked at us and couldn't speak English. We thought it couldn't be the right floor, so went all the way downstairs to check. Again, we were told it was safe to walk on that floor (?!) and so went back up. Got out of the lift where one of the builders just stared at us and then replied he took the laundry machines out a week before. Covered in plaster we returned back downstairs where the staff were completely unapologetic and didn't care in the slightest. I seriously do not believe we should have been able to walk on that floor as all of the builders were wearing breathing masks and we could not believe we were told it was safe, and lied to about the laundry machines.

Not real impressed with the smells of the street when arriving, but front desk people were very nice. Hotel has 20 floors, but the top two floors are not accessible by the main elevator--my room was on the 19th floor. From the lobby, you ride the elevator to the 18th floor (have to use a room key first before selecting the floor)--that elevator is air conditioned. On the 18th floor, you exit the elevator, walk to your right, and get on another elevator for 19 & 20--that elevator is not air conditioned. The heat index was 108 and humidity was high, so the transition on the 18th floor and the elevator ride to 19 were uncomfortable, to say the least. 19th floor was hot and humid, until entering the guest room, which was air conditioned to about 68 degrees and no humidity--what a difference! Pool is not on the roof top--it's on the 10th floor. Soda machines on the guest floors are $2 for a 20 oz bottle of Coke--save your cash, go to the store across the street from the main hotel lobby doors (store's name is Unique) and buy your drinks there. Meals are available in the Checkered Parrot restaurant adjacent to the hotel. Hotel offered passes for free breakfast buffet at the CP, but I didn't take advantage of it. Lunch at the CP was pretty good--had the nachos and chicken tacos--about $10 each but not bad in quality, and ample in quantity. The air con in the guest rooms is one of the older units that continuously blows unless you turn it off--no thermostat. The beds are comfortable, good selection of cable TV channels. The door in the bathroom is a little hard to deal with and gets in the way a lot. Bring your own pants hangars--my room had none and housekeeping had no extras. Wi-fi connection is weak, and there is no wired internet in the rooms, so page load times can be slow. There are two wi-fi channels-both are slow. There is one computer in the lobby with a printer (their version of a business center) but someone was always on it, playing games.

The positives: they are in a great location for walking around the French Quarter and to Harrah's Casino. It was also quiet which is something I always worry about when staying right in the French Quarter. And the bathroom toiletries were Bath and Body Works brand so that was actually impressive. They have a good amount of pillows on the beds which was also nice. The negatives: we checked in on a Friday afternoon and apparently so was everyone else. We didn't have a line to check in but it took a while to get an elevator b/c there were only three and everyone was using them to go from parking to their rooms, etc. They aren't air conditioned either so its pretty hot with a crowd. Our room was supposedly \"no smoking\" but when we got in it reeked of smoke so bad I got a headache. I told the front desk and they did come spray some air freshener while we were at dinner. The beds were hard and there was an unopened condom box under one of them-that freaked me out b/c it made me wonder how well the room was even cleaned?! The bathroom smelled like mildew and just didn't feel clean. The hair dryer had hair tangled in it as did the shower drain. On our second day-day of the wedding-they cleaned our room late and when we came back to start getting ready they took our dirty towels but did not replace them with any clean ones. When I called the front desk they said it be about 15 min. to get some to us. An hour later my husband went down to the desk and said he needed them b/c they never brought them up. That even took a while. About 15 min. after he returned, someone from housekeeping brought some up as well so we had about 10 towels! They are very unorganized.

Had a terrific view of Monteleon's terrace pool. The hotel is convenient to everything. The room was very quiet at night; slept well. Only two downsides are (1) no outdoor pool and (2) the room rate for the third night was $138 which included breakfast for two. We were given a $20 voucher to be used for two for breakfast. When we went to the restaurant for breakfast, the hostess told us that only a buffet was offered that day. The buffet cost was $12.95 per person plus taxes, plus you had to purchase a drink. So the voucher was worthless. Upon checkout, I asked the clerk if the rate of $138 was that price because it included breakfast. She said it did. I told her that the breakfast voucher was a rip-off and I wanted my rate reduced by $20. She adjusted my folio to $118. I was very pleased that that was done.

From the moment of my arrival, I found the adverse reviews to be irrelevant in terms of my experience. On arrival, there was a long queue at the check in desk; however, the reception staff worked efficiently and courteously and my wait online lasted not much longer than 30 minutes. I found the ambiance of the hotel to be warm and intimate despite its 20 floors and the other residents were very friendly and good humored (after all, it was the Mardi Gras season !). My room was absolutely pleasing, beautifully appointed, impressive maintenance and upkeep, and the bed coverlet and linens were of excellent quality. I was on the 17th floor and I never had to wait too long for the elevators. The hotel was absolutely clean and attractive in the public areas, as well as the room. There was an ice machine and soft drink machine on each floor. It was astonishing that the hotel was quiet - despite the fact that it was during Mardi Gras. I could see the intersection of Canal Street and Royal from my window and yet I was not much disturbed by the festive sounds and noise from the streets 17 floor below. I look forward to returning to New Orleans in future - and especially for Mardi Gras 2011 and will - without a doubt - secure accommodations at Holiday Inn French Quarter on Royal Street once again. My only negative observation was the brief stretch of tawdry shops, honky tonks, & mom&pop mini-grocery shops directly across the street from the main entrance of the hotel. It could be off-putting to some prospective hotel clients and it would be in the interest of the Holiday Inn corporation to either buy up those decrepit or closed \"eyesores\" and perform some urban renewal on those sites.

My group and I stayed for two nights and one lady came back from the event late the second evening to find her room key no longer worked. She had to stand in line for half an hour at midnight to get the key changed. Rooms are absolutely nothing special. Not overtly unclean, but there were hairs on the floor of the bathroom and there was a fungus growing behind the faucet. The air conditioner was bone-shaking loud, but provided little cool air. The room was stuffy the entire time I was there. I admit I did not approach the staff about this because I did not want to stand in a thirty minute line. Check out was a total time-warp. You have to kick it old-school here. Either call downstairs the morning you leave and they manually check you out or stand in line and turn in your key. I haven't done that in years.

Your are in New Orleans so I highly suggest visiting some of the great coffee shops instead! Also, we booked through Hotwire at around $54 a night - with fees/tax this came to about $65 a night!

I had a prepaid reservation (made through an \"official\" New Orleans tourist website) which stated that I was to receive free parking and an confirmed upgrade to a deluxe room. The desk clerk stated that the upgrade was based on availablilty. The booking website and email confirmation had no such disclosure. Since I paid such a low fare for the room, I didn't want to argue. I smiled and took the standard room. 2. The room was of average quality but the bathroom was tiny, dingy, and beat up. There was no counter space and the fixtures were rusty and dirty. The bed was small and the threadbare sheets did not cover my 6' 2\" body. 3. There were wads of kinky hair balls on the carpet in the bedroom and in the hallway. One hairball was on the ceiling above our door. 4. Being on the corner of Royal and Canal puts you in one of the noisiest places in the city. Even though we were on the 15th floor, we heard all the street noise through the cracked windows of our room. There is a liqour store directly across the entrance from the hotel and our room's cracked window let in all of the interesting late night/early morning commotion. We did not however, hear any of the other guests. 5. The unsecured parking lot has direct elevator service to guest floors, creating a security hazard for the guests. I had one occasion early one morning when a drunk women (bottle in hand) and a pimply faced kid were drinking and smoking in the elevator while they rode it up and down looking for the pool. Although there are guest room card readers and signs that state thay you must have a guest key to enter guest floors, the hotel no longer enforces this. 6. There are three guest elevators and one service elevator. On many occasions, only one elevator was operable. It was very frustrating to have to stop on every floor because service carts and all the other guests had to share one elevator. Advantages: 1. Location, location, location. Being on the corner of Royal and Canal makes it easy to see both the French Quarter and locations uptown and in the Garden District. If you have a car, the location is a plus.

We asked about restrooms and were told to use the restaurant located by the lobby (TGI Friday's). At 2:00, the room was still not available. Not a problem yet, enjoying the parade. At 4:00, room not available, new staff on and very rude, and the restaurant is charging $5.00 a person to use the restrooms. By 6:00, I am furious! The manager is called and he finds us a room. He then tells us that a restroom was located on the 4th floor that we could have used, (the staff never mentioned it) and gives us a credit on the room. The room was at the top of the hotel, you have to take two elevators to get to it, but the room was large and by this time we're just ready to unpack. I'm so upset over the hotel that it's hard to relax and let go, but once we unpacked and hit the streets and restaurants, we were able to enjoy the rest of our four night stay. The manager made a point to ask how we were doing when we saw him. Oh! and once while we in the elevator, way too many partying people crowded in and we were stuck between floors in the dark for it seemed like 20 minutes. Very scary with a drunk crowd. They started jumping to make it move!!! We had to be lifted up and crawl through a two foot space to exit.

Both highly recommended not least because of the very knowledgeable, witty and serviceminded tour guides.", "Date": "July 16, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, great location.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1961635", "Content": "We checked in around 6:00 PM. Our room was ready. We had a executive suite with a king sized bed. It was nice. The hotel has a great location. A block and a half to Bourbon St. Half a block from a Walgreens. It was difficult getting to the hotel parking, because part of Royal St. was closed. We parked there for 6 nights. The car was fine. They added the parking fee ($22.00 a night) to the hotel bill, so we didn't have to pay when we left. Maid service was not real good. Once we had to call for towels, twice we had to call for coffee. Cable TV was minimal (I know you don't go to the French Quarter to watch TV, but when you get back to the room, it is nice to watch TV. Basically, there were local channels, the weather channel, TBS, USA, etc. Like I said, it was a great location. Couldn't hear Bourbon St. Just a few blocks from the casino. When we go back, we will stay there again. One problem with the bill when we checked out - they charged us for many phone calls on our first day. I told them I didn't use the phone, and they took off the charges. Like I said, we would stay there again.", "Date": "May 12, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redwood City, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, good price\u201d", "Author": "Nachos", "ReviewID": "UR1762924", "Content": "We ended up choosing the Holiday Inn because it had a combination of a low price and a really convenient location.
