Most of my time was spent in Madrid I wanted a hotel that was in a central location with good transportation options for getting around or for daytrips. For me, Hostal Plaza D'ort was a good choice. I had the metro nearby at Puerto del Sol and could easily get to the train stations for Segovia & Toledo. The hop on/hop off bus stop was just down the street and a lot of attractions are within walking distance. I had a single room that was small but it had everything that I needed. Later (without me asking) they moved me to a bigger room. I surely appreciated that. It's located on a lively plaza and I always felt safe. There are many shops, restaurants and pubs nearby. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I'm very happy with my stay here.", "Date": "August 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Afton, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cTerrible hostel, bad for even budget hostels\u201d", "Author": "Plavec_H", "ReviewID": "UR121469378", "Content": "Smallest room Imaginable.

The service was excellent & all of the desk staff I dealt with were exceptionally helpful. The location was within a 3-4 minute walk of the Plaza Mayor.

It is right in the city center, within walking distance of most Madrid tourist sites, as well as tons of stores and restaurants. It is right next to Plaza Santa Ana and Calle Huertas, a very popular plaza and street where many madrile\u00f1os start their nightlife. Regarding the actual hostal, the rooms are clean, and some of the bathrooms are amazing. Others have not been renovated yet, so try to get a new bathroom if you can. The rooms are for the most part small, though some of the ones for bigger groups (the quad and the apartment) are very spacious. It can be a little noisy at times, because the walls are thin, and there is no elevator, so if you have a lot of luggage, be prepared to drag it up many flights of stairs. The outside-facing rooms are not too noisy because the plaza right outside it not busy and traffic is minimal. I would recommend this hostal to people looking for a clean, no-frills, safe place to stay with an amazing location.
