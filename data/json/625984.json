Nestled between numerous high end shops including Dior and Bvlgari, and only a two minute walk to the Spanish steps made for an amazing location. Although the room was small, we could not fault the cleanliness and staff. Looking out the window onto the cobbled streets of Rome ensured you don't stay long in your room anyway! Metro very close by, along with some great restaurants and shopping. Only negative was having to sit on the staircase to use the WiFi.

Very close Spanish steps , beautiful shopping area, all brands (LV , D&G , Gucci ... ) Staff were friendly , helpful ,, The owner was nice , he helped us a lot while staying in inn Spagnya.. The night shift front desk was really helpful and always ready to answer questions and give advices where to go and how to get there... If it's your first time to Rome it's very easy to find your hotel, you will never get lost ;) Big supermarket just 5 minutes walking from the hotel Metro (Spagnya station ) less than 3 minutes from hotel, where you can get to all Rome nice and famous places. Fountain di trevi 10 minutes walking the hotel is standard, standard room, standard breakfast. No elevator (4th floor is not easy)! No Internet in the rooms...

We were booked in a standard double room, which, from their website, looks delightful! Gross misrepresentation of their rooms, our room was filthy with excessively chipping paint on the ceiling about the shower (see photo), large dust balls hanging from the bathroom fan, mold behind the bathroom sink, a toilet paper holder that was barely connected to the wall and kept dropping the toilet paper, water damage near the window, cigarette burns in the comforter which also appeared as though it had been dragged in the street for how much dirt was apparently ground into the fabric, and a mini-fridge with food particles and sticky liquid remnants! This room was on the second floor. When they showed us a room on the third floor, it was better, but still had cigarette ashes on the window sill (we had booked a non-smoking room), cracking paint and a rusty shower door.

I arrived a couple of hours early and asked if I could leave my bag at reception. I have found at most larger hotels they will take bags but it is not possible to have a room until their check-in time. I was pleasantly surprised to be told there was a room ready so I was able to go off sightseeing without having to worry about going back to check in. The room was comfortable and clean. The hotel is small. It does not have a lift, bar or restaurant but what it lacks in those amenities it more than makes up for with the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. The location is wonderful, close to the Spanish Steps, the metro and streets full of bars and restaurants. On the morning I left, the hotel had booked a taxi for 8am. I went down about 7.45am and checked out. I was asked if I had eaten breakfast and I pointed out breakfast was not until 8am so I would get something at the airport. I was told that the waitress was in the breakfast room and I was welcome to have something to eat and I would be called when the taxi arrived.

The hotel is in an awesome location, 100 m from Piazza di Spagna, 50 m from Via Condotti and a short walk from the Parthenon. It's a great (and safe) neibourhough for a night stroll. The room (n. 404) and the bathroom was pretty clean and well kept. The breakfast was OK (Italian stile). There are two down parts: - First, while the hotel dosn't have a lobby, just a small front desk in the ground floor, the rooms are located in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th floors, with no elevator. You will have to carry up your luggages (I had help from the hotel manager). - And second is the size of the room and the shower. The room was so small we had problems to keep our stuf organized and the shower is so tide, you can avoid messing up. It's a good choice for those who doesn't care about stairs and the size of the room and are in search for a clean and well located place to stay. Afterall, if they had big rooms and elevator in that location, they would be charging 300 EUR.
