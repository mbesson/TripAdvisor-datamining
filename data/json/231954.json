Could not find an ice machine on our floor - decided we could do without it, so didn't go looking. With our stay occurring after Labor Day, our group had the whole top floor to ourselves which was nice.

So while we were in Florida anyway, we decided to see what it looked like. I researched several hotels before settling on this one. We wanted a place on the ocean beach with a view. This place fits the bill. The building is skinny, so there is only one row of rooms per floor, which means that each room faces the ocean and has a great view\u2013 and a balcony! There is a pool in the back, between the building and the ocean beach, and YES, there is direct, free access to the beach. You can hear the surf from your room, and if you're really fortunate, you can catch a full moon rising over the horizon in the evening. The amenities are up to the usual HIE standards, including the breakfast (and don't miss the ice cream vending machine on the bottom floor).

I can't say enough great things about it! We had originally booked a different hotel, had a TERRIBLE experience there on our first night, checked out the next morning and stayed at the Holiday Inn Express. BEST decision we made!! The rooms are very spacious and comfortable. We had 2 adults and 2 kids in the room and had plenty of space to spread out. Lots of places for luggage, large bathroom, nice shower, great breakfast every morning, with hot items (sausage, eggs, cinnamon rolls, pancakes, yogurt, etc). My FAVORITE part though was the ocean view!! The previous hotel (that was awful!!) said they had ocean view rooms, and I paid extra for it. That was a joke...you had to stand in one corner of the balcony and crane your neck to get a glimpse of the ocean. At Holiday Inn Express, you get a TRUE ocean view room. We were on the 10th floor and had a GORGEOUS view!! Watching the sunrises and sunsets on that balcony was a highlight of each day! It was so peaceful on the beach in front of the hotel (not very crowded at all)! The hotel pool was very nice! My kids loved it! One morning, my husband was on the beach and saw a sea turtle returning to the ocean after laying its eggs up on the beach. It was an incredible sight and he was able to video it! We loved our stay so much , that we even extended our vacation an extra 2 nights there! It was sooo worth it! There is ample parking in a well lit lot, and the staff are very friendly!!

I was looking for a nice place to decelerate after the whirlwind known as a Disney vacation. Once again counting on TA, I was looking for a place on the beach, with oceanfront balcony rooms that offered a free breakfast for my party of 6. This hotel fit the bill. After an hour and a half ride from Orlando and arriving at 12 noon, check in was immediate for one of the 2 rooms we had reserved. This allowed us to get the luggage in and get right on the beach. The room was clean and fresh and had a fridge and a microwave, and in room safe. The balcony was adequate with a beautiful ocean in front of us. Throughout the stay, the staff was friendly and helpful. Parking was free and close to the entrance. There was always hot coffee in the lobby. The breakfast was very good, with an automated make it yourself pancake machine, scrambled eggs and sausage, along with the other standard breakfast fare. The hotel was right on Atlantic Avenue, with the usual diners, fast food and pizzerias nearby. The chains; Chilies, Texas Roadhouse, etc. were all within 5 miles. Do yourself a favor and skip the \u201cboardwalk\u201d. Its tiny compared to the New Jersey type, its crowded, has little to no entertainment, and you wont be able to park nearby. The one negative I encountered was that the free Wi-Fi signal at the hotel was very weak, as my IPad wouldn\u2019t stay connected. The hotel was more than adequate for all our needs, I liked it and would certainly return.

We went to Daytona Beach for bike week, and stayed at the Holiday Inn Express and Suites. It was myself, my father and father-in-law. Everything was good up until the end. We decided to leave a day early, as I had previously emailed the manager and got that approved, she said no problem. It was close to 6pm on Friday, so by checking out then its what they call a \"late check-out\", which is accepted by most all hotels. The girl at the front desk checked me out, and I asked to make sure we would not be charged on more night, as we did not want to waste $240. She said that was no problem, and agreed to let us leave. I signed the receipt for our charges for the room fees for the week, which I agreed was correct. I assumed we were all set. I then today pulled up my online statement today from my bank, and I have 2 additional nights charged on my card. WHY ??? I do not know. I tried calling the hotel,as they explained to me that they needed to charge me and I could not check out late and the person at the front desk was wrong. Basically she told me I'm screwed, even thought they accepted my payment in full for the nights we stayed. I guess people can say or do what they want, but in the end, we fully planned to potentially stay at this hotel again, the rooms were nice. But I don't like the way this was handled, and we wont be going back.

I have stayed in many places in Daytona that were a little more resort and this place clearly is called \"Express\". My review is based on what it is rather than what my friend expected. The hotel staff were EXCELLENT, they allowed us to check in early (about 11:30AM), the facility was kept immaculately clean, the breakfast bar was well stocked (although the hours seemed a little weird; 6:30AM to 9:30AM?), when our in-room safe malfunctioned they came right upstairs and fixed it, and they allowed us a late (one extra hour on the BEACH) check out!!!!! The beach was GORGEOUS and was in close proximity to the hotel, the pool was kind of small, there was no jacuzzi tub and if you had kids the playground was woefully sad. The room itself was nice (but a bit small for the price), the AC worked well, the water pressure on the tenth floor was TERRIBLE (we asked for a lower floor, I don't know what happened there), the wireless internet did not work (perhaps because we were so high up in the building?), the room had two beds (which were INCREDIBLY comfortable!), a table with two chairs, a microwave and small refrigerator, a small coffee maker, a large closet; it really was fine. I don't know that I would stay here again as I really don't go to Daytona Beach for the \"express\" experience; I really prefer a resort setting. The location from the main attractions and activities in Daytona Beach were MILES away so the beach and surroundings are nice and quiet. If this is what you are looking for it's great.

Two of our days the breakfast hostess worked to keep everything full and all was good. On Sunday there was a different woman with a horrible attitude. She disappeared about 9 when everything was empty--we figured she was going to storage to get more food. She returned a long time later and when people asked for eggs or other food, she said, \"Breakfast is over\". The girl at the front desk worked hard to find and fill things but a lot of people were aggravated. One frustration at this hotel was the amount of people (maybe locals) from the beach who wandered into the pool all weekend long. I was sitting on our balcony one morning and watched cars pull in, park, and make several trips to the beach with tents, coolers, chairs, etc. The cars did not have hotel parking tag.

Not enough food, kept running out and the coffee was terrible. We ended up going out for breakfast not a big deal since there are tons of places to eat in that whole area, even across the street was a breakfast/lunch cafe that we will have to hit next time.

The positives: nice quiet section of the beach, at least in May; totally remodeled hotel, clean, no bad odors, no problems with mold, nice room, great beach view from the balcony, breakfast was fine if expectations are not too high. Decent price using 2 weeks advance prepaid. The negatives: Staff lacks professional manner. The cleaning woman was actually the best we came across. However, the room was only cleaned twice. I think that was because we were in our room mid-morning/midday at times and this interrupted their normal cleaning schedule. While the breakfast area was closely monitored, the lady monitoring it was a grouch. The breakfast (on the beach, mind you) ends at 9:30 SHARP. You might even notice some items being put away a minute or two before that. Earliest clock or watch is the one determining the shut-down. A guest came in as I was still sipping coffee at about 9:45 and he mentioned to the breakfast worker that he thought 9:30 was a little early for a beach breakfast to close (who gets up early while relaxing on the beach?), and she seemed a bit snippy with him. I didn't hear an apologetic response and the guest escalated a little. No big deal, but I had to agree that we were getting up earlier and presentable than we wanted in order to be sure to get something to eat. No pool towels were available for our Sunday evening arrival. It had been a busy day apparently. THE MAJOR PROBLEM: We discovered late on the 3rd day that our room door had a broken lock...and had been this way during our entire stay. We had already noticed that the door didn't close very well and we needed to push or shove it closed otherwise, it would be almost closed but not completely and thus not secure. However, I eventually discovered by chance that one only needed to push on the door to open it, even if it was completely closed. We weighed our options but felt we didn't have time to supervise a door lock repair while we were busy saying goodbye to close relatives that we see once every couple years (my parents), so I decided to simply mention the problem as we checked out. The desk worker didn't even look at me and mumbled that they'd look into it. We were on a tight schedule and didn't have time to raise any sort of fuss over it. I received a standard \"how was your stay\" email from the national HIE so I mentioned this problem on the survey. They corresponded with me after receiving my full description of the problem and said that the hotel general manager and hotel owner would be notified of the problem. That was 6 days ago. I have not heard any more about it and don't expect to. We were not robbed or harmed and that is good to report. We did barricade the door our final night there since we did spend one night with the knowledge of our door being easily opened to the outside. We were on the 10th floor (Room 1017). I don't know if this was an isolated problem or not. I noticed upon the discovery that the door handle sagged unlike the other rooms' handles. So, if you say here and see a sagging door handle, push on the door a bit and see if it opens up. If so, you probably have an unsecured room as we did. Overall, it was clean and generally pleasant. Security for us was a serious issue but I doubt all the other rooms have this problem. I suspect they've repaired the door lock on 1017. We're conscientious and never damage hotel property; we have no idea how the door lock was damaged. We took a very long, once-in-a-lifetime trip last fall out West. We stayed in over 20 hotels. We stay in hotels in Mexico from time to time. This was the first I can recall of any hotel I've ever stayed in that had a serious room security issue. I was a bit taken aback by it. Probably the rare problem, but you should be aware to check your door carefully in case there is a defect with their locks throughout the property.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPerfect beach hotel\u201d", "Author": "ujustliveonce", "ReviewID": "UR113074726", "Content": "Rooms were great.

The gave me a room just 2 doors down to make the move as easy as possible, and gave me plenty of time to make the move and get the original room key turned in. I can't recommend this place enough. It's away from the crazy core of Daytona Beach which makes it perfect in my opinion. The Cracked Egg across the street is fab for breakfast and lunch. Parking is ample, and every room is directly oceanfront. There wasn't a staff member that I encountered all week who was anything less than personable and caring.

It proved to be more than a safe choice. It is directly on the beach and I believe every room is facing the ocean and have balconies. Our view was awesome and from only the 3rd floor. I think there were 8 or 9 floors in the hotel. It was quiet and peaceful. I'd recommend this hotel. While there, we visited several other hotels just to compare the facilities and the rooms. While we did see a couple nice ones that were fairly comparable, this one was definitely the best overall. This hotel has one bedroom suites. We did take a few minutes to walk through one. They are a little bigger than their 2 queen bed rooms, but we weren't impressed. They seem backwards as you enter the suite in the bedroom and then move toward the living area where the balcony is overlooking the beach. Unless you get a really good deal or just want an extra bit of space, I'd pass on the suite.
