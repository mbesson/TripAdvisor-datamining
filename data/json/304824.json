The first room that we were allocated was a very small double room that had a single high level window.There was not enough room to move around once we got our cases in. We had specifically requested a twin and after some discussion they moved us to a twin room with a window that opened onto a wall less than half a metre away. It was larger than the the first room, we reluctantly accepted it. After the porter left we noticed a strong smell of urine emanating from between the beds. We summoned Housekeeping who appeared with a very strong smelling spray that eventually obscured the urine smell. We decided to stay and see how it went. Housekeeping sprayed the room a bit later for good measure. We went out and had a meal in town, then when we returned later we found a big pool of water in the middle of the bathroom floor. The duty porter came up and investigated and explained that it was a leaking tap, which could not be repaired until the morning. He left a pile of clean towels under the wash basin to absorb the leaking water. Not very satisfactory. The bath was high sided and was made a good four inches higher than usual by the shower door frame surmounting it. An elderly person or person with a slight mobility problem would have had difficulty in getting into the bath or the shower. We were not asked whether we had any mobility problems at the time of booking and were not aware of the high sided bath issue? The first morning the wash basin plug stuck in the plug hole with the basin full of water that I had shaved in. The reception was notified and the plumber would repair it at the same time the leaking tap was repaired. That evening we returned and noted that the repairs had been carried out. Sadly when we used the wash basin the plug got jammed in again. We asked for it to be sorted out properly that night. The porter arrived with a small screw driver and after some tinkering stated that it would have to wait until the morning which we said was unacceptable. I then stripped out the offending plug mechanism, getting drenched in the process but managed to get the plug working as a temporary fix. The Reception promised to get it repaired properly the next morning. We told them that tomorrow was not good enough. In the event I ended up shaving using running water which was a bit of a waste but \"needs must\".

It was a very pleasurable experience, which started from the arrival at the Ataturk airport. We ordered an airport transfer with Mina and the driver patiently waited for extra 2 hours as our flight was delayed. We were taken to the hotel in a spacious, cream color leather-seats van. As we entered the lobby, the receptionist greeted us by name (they coordinated with their drivers the arrival of their guests). Small gesture but it showed their attention to details. We received our keys, city tour tips and map and were escorted to the room without the delay. The staff was always helpful and ready to answer any questions. The room was nice - it really does look as they show it on hotel web-site. No suprises. There was enough space in the room, no complains here. Our room faced the street but it was not too noisy - you can hear a call for prayer, of course, but you can hear it anywhere in Istanbul. Mina has very comfortable beds and very soft bedding. The bathroom had a bathtub and complimentary toiletries, towels and sheets were changed daily. The restaurant on the 6th floor is rather small in size, but provides a spectacular view of the Bosphorus and decent breakfast selection. The rooftop terrace was also lovely place to enjoy breakfast at, however, beware of seaguls! If you leave your plate to go get smth from the restaurant again, you may come back to a plate missing some sausage! Those birds are not shy :) The terrace, against our expectations, was rather big - it went all around the roof of the hotel building. The view was wonderful, of course. The hotel is conveniently located at the Sultanahmet region of Istanbul and all the major tourist attractions were basically 5-10 minutes walking away.

The location alone is outstanding, but the staff is also very friendly and extremely helpful, making our stay very pleasant. By American standards, the room we stayed in was small and not the most up-to-date in terms of decor, although we liked the real marble countertop in the bathroom. The room would probably rate 2 or 3 stars in the US. However, when I travel, I spend most of my time exploring outside the hotel and only need a clean, comfortable, safe place to sleep at night. The Mina Hotel is a perfect base from which to explore beautiful Istanbul. My friend and I loved staying at the Mina and would happily stay there again if we return to Istanbul. In addition to the location and staff, we loved the spectacular view from the rooftop terrace restaurant. It is easily one of the best views of Istanbul, facing the sea but including the Blue Mosque and a panoramic view of modern parts of the city as well. It's a great place to relax in the evening as the sun sets and the lights come on along the water. When it is time for a call to prayer, you can hear the call from different mosques throughout the city float up to the terrace. (Because there is a mosque next to the hotel, you may hear a loud call/chant at night if your room happens to face the mosque). There is also free internet access for hotel guests. Overall, the Mina Hotel offers terrific value and service to its guests. We liked the people and the location very much and have very good memories of our time in Istanbul. One neighborhood note: try the potato guzelme (pancakes/crepes), made fresh from scratch to order, at the Asli kebap place next to the hotel. The place is run by two brothers and a sister, who were some of our favorite people we met in Istanbul. Also, check out the small information cards in the lounge area of the hotel. You may find free entrance cards to sites or discounts to nearby restaurants. In response to another traveler's complaint: The abundant breakfast buffet does include an orange beverage that resembles Tang. If you don't like Tang, freshly squeezed real orange juice is available at an extra cost. Otherwise, the fresh breads, great variety of cheeses, fruits, eggs, and other offerings are a good way to start the day. The menu for dinner has reasonable prices compared to other similar restaurants in the area. We think it's fine, especially given the quality of the service and the amazing view from the terrace. The food is simple and satisfying. If you want cheaper food, there is a McDonald's nearby as well as other diner-type places. Or if you would like very fine exquisite dining, we recommend Asitane, which specializes in dishes made from recipes drawn from 16th-19th century royal Ottoman kitchens.", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic little hotel, great location, staff & roof terrace!\u201d", "Author": "Cressida12345", "ReviewID": "UR68232486", "Content": "Brilliant location, walking distance from the tram and many of Istanbul's most popular sights (Blue Mosque etc.) Very helpful staff, prepared to help organise transport and meals for groups, as well as everyday little issues.

The rooms were small but this was not a concern for a short stay. The bathrooms were excellent with toiletries and big towels. The shower was powerful although as mentioned before the bath is quite high (this would be a problem if you had mobility issues). The beds were the comfiest hotel beds I have slept in with lots of plumped up pillows and a lovely duvet - fab. Whilst the rooms look great some parts are lacking in quality as a phone jack was hanging off the wall, a couple of lights were out and my bed lamp hung at an unusual angle! This was not a concern to me (so did not even report to hotel reception) but I am sure it would be off-putting to others. The breakfast room has a great view, the buffet breakfast is plentiful (eggs, sausage, breads, cheeses, meats, salad, fruit, cereals, yoghurt, cakes, biscuits, preserves, teas, coffee and orange juice (squash) and we very much enjoyed it. Most importantly to us, the hotel is 1 minute walk from the tram (Cemberlitas) which made it easy for us navigate even though we didn't use the trams. It took us 5 mins to walk to the Blue Mosque & Haghia Sophia, the same in the opposite direction to the Grand Bazaar and about 20mins to the Spice Bazaar & Galata Bridge.

It was a basic, standard double room with a shower/bath which was fine. The building itself is attractive, in particular the lobby and the hotel restaurant/terrace. The highlight was breakfast in the terrace resturant as there was a huge buffet and cooked breakfast to order. Fresh pastries, cereals, fruit and the marble cake was to die for, best I've ever tasted. The breakfast set us up well for a day's sightseeing. We ate out every evening apart from the last when we decided to try out the hotel restaurant on the roof terrace and am glad we did for it was one of the most romantic experiences I've had. The food was very good but it was the view that sold us. Since the hotel is within walking distance to the Blue Mosque and Grand Bazaar, and the hotel has 6/7 floors it meant we had a breathtaking view of the buildings and of the ships passing through the Bosphorous.

We had a room on a higher floor (fourth floor), with a view of the Marmara Sea (as well as a smaller mosque and various Istanbul buildings) just as we requested. I took a shower and noticed the water was not draining properly. When I called Reception, they said we would have to wait for \"Technical Services\" the next day. So my friend could take neither a shower nor a bath that night. We also noticed that while the fan came on, no cold air came out. The next morning we re-reported the problem to Reception. When we returned that evening, they said the shower had been fixed and the plug was draining. Around 5:30 pm, the air-conditioning was fixed, and we had air-conditioning for the rest of our stay. That day we both took showers; no problem. The day after my friend took a bath and I noticed the water was leaking into the hall; leaking from bathtub, not that it was overflowing. Also, once again, the plug was stuck in the bathtub. We called Reception who put down towels and said \"Technical Services\" would fix it in the morning. We pointed out the bath water would continue leaking all night and in fact could leak down to the rooms below. He seemed to think water would not leak through our floor to the rooms below (I don't know why not), but finally at our insistence that he get a knife or something to pry open the plug, he came back with a knife and pried off the plug so at least the water drained through the plug, not into our bathroom. He had to lay down some more towels because the remains of the water still leaked out of the tub but at least it had stopped leaking, and the towels soaked up the water.. The next morning we once again reminded them about the leak and the plug still not draining properly. When we returned the next afternoon, they said the leak was fixed, but seemed to know nothing about the plug draining situation. Luckily, \"Technical Services\" was there, and my friend took him to our room and pointed out the problem. He did not seem to have been told about it before, but he did fix it properly and efficiently once he was told. So whoever had the room after us, we did you a favour because I suspect the problem had been going on for a while but never fixed properly. We asked for a discount because I can understand one problem with the air-conditioning and one with the plug, but obviously the plug had never been fixed properly the first time. They refused because we were already receiving the Internet discount which was true, but there was nothing to indicate that the Internet discount meant your air-conditioning would not work for the first night, or you would have problems with your shower/bath on two nights. The view from the restaurant is good, and the one from the terrace of the Blue Mosque and the boats in the Marmara Sea is even better. They don't encourage the use of the terrace; you have to carry up all your utensils, serviettes, as well of course your food and coffee and there are no trays. But it is a beautiful view and worth the extra trouble. Our room was pleasantly decorated and the bathroom facilities were all clean and in good condition. The closet was a good size, but few shelves, but that may be standard for Istnabul. The breakfast was plentiful but mediocre; for example, all the bread was stale. We did not have any of the cooked dishes. The location is great. Not only 5-10 minutes walk from the Blue Mosque (we are middle-aged ), but also about 5 minutes from Divanyolu Caddesi (also knows as \"Tram Street\") where not only can you get the tram that goes to the \"New European\" section of Istanbul across the Galata Bridge, and other \"tourist-worthy\" destinations in Istanbul, but it has several restaurants (both indoor and outdoor) and bank machines. Also, I knew if I got lost (easy in Istanbul because not a lot of street signs), people could always guide me to \"Tram Street\". Also within walking stance from Topkapi. All the staff, except for Ali, are friendly and helpful. Two of them speak English quite well, and are helpful in explaining directions. There is a Laundry and Dry Cleaning Service, Amphora Laundry, 53 Peykhane Caddesi, about 3 minutes from the hotel. 5 Turkish Lira a kilo. When come out of the hotel turn right. Turn right immediately at the next street. Go I think it is 1 block down the street (might be two blocks) and turn left on to Peykhane Sok. On left hand side about half way down the block is Amphora Laundry. The owner \"Bobby\" speaks English well. There is also a \"Justice Palace\" close by where they sell stamps in the basement. The stamps from vendors can have an up to 40% mark-up. If the hotel orders a taxi for you, be sure to get an estimate of what it should cost. We took a taxi from the airport which was 29 Turkish lira which was within the 28 to 35 Turkish lira that other Trip Advisor writers had said was reasonable from Sultanahmet, especially as it was around 5:00 pm on a weekday. That is about half the 30 Euros Hotel Mina would have charged (about 2 Turkish Lira to a Euro). We also took taxis around the Ortakoy Dolmabahce Palace area which were 7 to 8 Liras each which was reasonable. But when we took a taxi to Chora Church which the Mina ordered for us, I had asked and been told it should be 15 to 20 Turkish Lira. I checked the meter several times on the way and when we were fairly close, it showed about 11 liras so I thought it would be between 15 to 20. When we got there, the driver said it was 40 Turkish Lira, and the meter showed 40. I said I had been told it was 15 to 20, and gave him 20 Turkish lira. He did not protest or argue or even shrug his shoulders. He just took the 20 Lira so he clearly knew he had tried to overcharge me and had somehow changed the meter. Even the 20 TL may have been too much. So always get an estimate if the hotel orders you a taxi and check the meter especially towards the end. The second taxi they ordered did not have his meter on, but he put it on when I asked. He did change his mind about his direction which cost us a couple of extra lira, but my friend thought it was legitimate as we were stuck in traffic and it was still just within the maximum the hotel had told us the taxi would cost. And as I said the taxi we took from the airport, and the taxis we took around Ortakoy were reasonable so not all Istanbul taxi-drivers are dishonest. In spite of the problems with the air-conditioning and the shower, I still recommend the Mina provided you get a price significantly below their list price. For us, the price was 72 Euros for a twin bedded room which for the very convenient location, the nice view from our room, the clean bathroom and pleasantly decorated room, the helpful staff (except for Ali who seemed mainly interested in pushing certain restaurants, etc.) and the great view from the terrace was a good deal.

The hotel does offer airport transfers which we declined, but if you fly in to Istanbul you should pay no more than 28TL for the transfer to the hotel. We took advantage of the return transfer which cost us a hassle free 35TL. The dinner menu is varied and offers good value for money, and the breakfast was substantial.

You can see the sign at the top of the building visible from the square. Hamdi has very lean lamb 'sis' kabob with pistachio...a must.

We stayed at the hotel from 25th -29th March 2009. Our experience there exceeded our expectations. We found all of the staff helpful and cherrful. At breakfast there was always a good selection. We did not come to Istanbul for English breakfasts but to enjoy the local food. The coffee was the best that we had in Istanbul. We did not have an evening meal in the hotel so can't comment on this. We had room 307 which had just been beautifully refurbished, so much so that we could smell the new carpet. The beds and pillows were comfortable, towels large and soft, and there was a full range of bathroom products always topped up. The hotel is located within easy walking distance of most of Istanbul's top ten attractions. There was a vast choice of places to eat - we particularly enjoyed the Han Restaurant and En La Luna which were within about 5 or 10 minutes walk from the hotel. We think the best way to get to the hotel from the airport is to use a prebooked minibus with Istanbul Airport Shuttle which drops you at your hotel door. It was a reliable and reasonably priced service. It was also cheap to travel across Istanbul on public transport, about 60 pence a journey. There is a small well stocked supermarket just around the corner from the hotel convenient for water, wine, beer, etc. We did attempt to do a trip up the Bosphorus on our own using the local boats but eventually decided that it was easier to take one of the trips organised for sightseers. It was well worth it. It was our first time to Istanbul and the local vendors, restaurateurs are very persistent at trying to get your custom. This can be trying but on the whole they are very pleasant and accept a friendly 'no thank you'. If you are shopping don't forget barter, barter, barter. Thanks to Engin for all your helps, tips, and advice which made for a very pleasant stay.", "Date": "April 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cExcellent mid range hotel in Sultanahmet\u201d", "Author": "footix", "ReviewID": "UR26331845", "Content": "Small hotel within walking distance of major tourist sites.

The room was fine and cleaned every day by a charming lady and the only fault I can think of was probably due to our feeling so tired after the journey that we misread the price for the Economic Menu as being in Turkish Lira and not Euros, which was a bit of a disappointment.

Mina Hotel was the first thing to change my mind, through its warm personnel, nice location and overall great room. It is a small nice boutique hotel located on Pierre Loti Str into the old Sultanahmet area of the city. My wife and I were there in Dec. 2008 between 24th and 30th. My wife booked the room and directly with them and got a fair price, from what I have seen. Room (404) was OK - very clean - cleaned daily - with a simple but cozy design. We were facing the city and thus had a double bad. Rooms facing Bosphorus seem to have only twin beds(I am not quite sure of this, though).Bathroom may need a little bit of refurbishing - nothing important just details and could be used as it is. Some people may be annoyed by the mosque behind the hotel as you can hear the prayer 6 times a day. We weren't as our room was facing the opposite side. Breakfast was good for one week we have spent there but could become boring for longer periods of time, as it was the same everyday. Nevertheless if you want variety you can order extra. As the food was not our first priority I can not consider this a minus. The dining hall - restaurant and terrace, during the summer, are located on top of the hotel and have a magnificent Bosphorus view. We also liked the location - max 10 min walking distance from Blue Mosque, St Sophia or Grand Bazaar and close to the tram station - which can get you almost everywhere in Istanbul. I recommend to check hotel's web site for various packages they can offer as we really got a good deal for our stay there.
