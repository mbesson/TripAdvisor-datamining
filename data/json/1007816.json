The room was a decent size, and the beds lived up to the hotel's perfect night's sleep guarantee, and there were lots of pillows to get comfy. Every staff member had a big smile and a friendly hello whenever they saw us. We were warmly welcomed by Lerner as soon as we stepped out of our car to check in. When we came back to park the car, she was very happy to tell us how the parking worked. I do think the parking was a little expensive, but it was very convenient - you could take the elevator right from the parking to the hotel lobby. It was wonderful to just park the car and walk or take the water taxi everywhere. My grandson and I loved the wonderful garden with its waterfall adjacent to the 8th floor.

My daughter and I stayed here for two nights while we did a college tour of the area. The hotel was in a nice location. They're doing renovations outside on the road and the traffic noise at night was loud (going over the metal road coverings). I realize this is not the hotel's fault. Our room was small, but it was clean (so small that you couldn't even open the drawers of the nightstand because they shoved a chair in the corner. Had to practically climb over the chair to get out of bed). Closet was squeaky and was difficult to open. Tiny bathroom. The air intake handler on the wall next to the closet was loud and sounded like it was on full-blast, even when the HVAC was off. Our keys didn't work, so I had to traipse back down to the hotel front desk. Since they had one person at the desk for the HGI and one for the other portion of the hotel (suites), I had to wait 10 minutes just to get a new key. We went out all day and returned at 3:30 on Saturday afternoon to a a completely unmade room. They didn't answer the front desk phone when I called, so back downstairs I went. Waited another 10 minutes to have him tell me that they'd send someone up to clean it then. No remorse at all. No apology. So, after being out all day in the pouring rain, we went out to Whole Foods and by the time we got back, the room was cleaned. Granted, the room was tiny, but housekeeping made the bed, emptied the garbage and threw room freshener (which was still wet ... at least I hope that's what it was) on the bed. No vacuum, etc. The front desk sign boasted about the perfect night sleep bed system, and although we had a king bed, I didn't have one of those. Would have liked to have, since the bed was too firm. Parking was expensive, and breakfast not included and was not, in my opinion, worth the price I paid, especially with a Starbucks next door and a Whole Foods around the corner.

This was a treat for us, because although we live in Baltimore, we decided to make a little vacation out of it, stay downtown, eat at our favorite Italian restaurant, and enjoy walking around. The front desk personnel at check weren't the most friendly. There were two lines--one for HGI and one for Homewood Suites--however, I saw a sign for Hilton Honors members and walked up to the desk, not realizing that the sign was on both sides for both hotels. I walked up, said I had a reservation for HGI and was told I was in the wrong line. I pointed to the sign for Honors and he said, \"yes, it's for Honors members.\" I told him I that I was a member and he said curtly, \"well, it will take me some time, but I can probably log in to the HGI system.\" I stepped back into the other line. The bed was nice; however, in the middle of the night I woke up and it felt like I was sleeping in a bathtub. The adjustable firmness was not firm at all, so my husband switched with me and we tossed and turned. At check out, when asked if everything was okay, I told her that it wasn't. The mattress was on one side was not firm, even though we had adjusted the dial to as firm as it could go, and that we felt like we were sleeping in a bathtub. She told me that she wished she could do something, like a free dinner or breakfast, but \"the bill had already gone through.\" I didn't know what that meant and I didn't feel like arguing, so I will wait for my Hilton Honors survey. Please keep in mind that this was just a fluke with the bed. Had I noticed it earlier and not in the middle of the night, I gladly would have called the front desk to be moved. However, i wasn't going to do that at 2:00am, pack up, and change rooms.

However, when management makes such bad decisions then I have to tell others. CHECK-IN/FRONT DESK: The Homewood Suites and Garden Inn share a front desk. No biggie, I've seen this before, especially in urban core areas. HOWEVER, there were usually only two people working the front desk. TWO PEOPLE FOR TWO FULL SIZE HOTELS. Those ladies still managed to keep a smile on their face even when they had a long line of worn out and angry guests. RESERVATIONS: We had booked a room at the Homewood with two doubles and a fold out so our family of five could fit comfortably. However, management had overbooked the hotel so our room was not available when we checked in around 6pm. So they moved us to two side by side rooms (not adjoining) in the Garden Inn. Ok, not a big deal. It WOULD HAVE been a big deal if we had brought food to cook for dinner in the Homewood like we had originally planned. (but we didn't, so I won't complain) BUT then, they made us move the next night (we were only there two nights) to a Homewood Suites. Once again, this SHOULDN'T have been a big deal. I did book a room in the Homewood and not 2 in the Garden Inn. HOWEVER, because there were never more than two people at the front desk, this meant I had to wait 30 minutes to check out and get our luggage stored in the morning and then another 30 minutes to check in and get our luggage into our room new room that evening. ROOMS: Yes, there were issues with the rooms. Several guests, including ourselves, didn't have hot (it wasn't cold-but to call it warm was a stretch) water in the Garden Inn. Then, when we moved to the Homewood the ceiling fan was literally falling down. When I called to the front desk they did send someone up (30 minutes later) and the maintence guy started looking at it to see if he could put it back in and it fell on him! (Luckily he wasn't hurt-he was so disturbed by the whole event that he left all his gear in our room-including an uncovered knife and needle nose pliers-luckily he called us 30 minutes later to tell us before one of our kids found them! (Ok, these are minor things that I don't usually care about-but given everything else they just added to the frustration) PHONES: Our cells had poor service in the building so we decided to order out for pizza. I checked the phone info sheet-no mention of charges-and dialed several local numbers. The third call finally went through. Later that night I had to make another call to the same delivery place. The next morning I had charges for four phone calls! Even if the call didn't go through (when I say didn't go through I mean fast busy or the call cannot be completed as dialed) they still charged us. (the nice overworked front desk staff-who knew me by name now-quickly removed the charges) POOL: Once again, normally not a big deal-but with everything else it was just icing on the cake. First, the pool is part of MAC, an fitness center, no biggie, usually. But, the first night it was closed for a staff party and no one told the hotel. Then both mornings it was closed for swim lessons. So, we planned to take the kids to the pool-which had been raved about by a porter and the concierge as having a great kids area and even a slide(I thought this was odd since it was part of an urban fitness club but, hey, maybe they also cater to the families in nearby Little Italy?) So we make the trek down from our upper level room across both hotels to the MAC, I go to sign in and the nice lady at the desk says, \"Oh, you can't come in here-you don't have shoes on.\" Yes, you need shoes for the pool. So, the three kids and I trek back up to the hotel and come back down-this time with shoes-and make our way to the wonderful kids pool. Only to discover that it's nothing but a standard size urban inside hotel pool. Still, it's November and we have a good time. That is, until my two oldest (7th and 4th grade) decide they want to swim some laps while I play with the youngest in the pool. There were several open lanes and I explain lap etiquette and they have themselves a good ol time seeing who could swim faster or longer-the whole time being very respectful and quiet. Until they get kicked out because kids aren't allowed to swim in the lap pool. VALET: I don't use valet so, once again, not something I would usually comment on but since it arose, here it goes. There were maybe three guys working valet (4 on the night I checked in) and they always were running. I figured they were hustleing to be good employees. No, they were hustleing because there weren't enough people working-this happened every day. In my long time at the front desk (I easily spent an hour and a half over two nights at the front desk) I heard countless people getting their valet charges credited because they were waiting 45mins+ for their car. The valet parking garage is attached to the hotel. Need I say more? In summary, these hotels are staffed with friendly (if slightly uninformed people) that are doing the best the can with poor management overseeing them. Would I go back?

She offered to add in the breakfast as a comp as it was included in the Homewood Suites stay which was the same price and stated she would note this on our reservation. Upon arrival, the breakfast was not noted in the reservation record but it was quickly added without an issue. Went up to the room and the floors were very dirty. You could literally see food from a previous occupant on the carpet, huge stain of \"some sort\" on the chair, water all over the bathroom floor (puddles, not just damp!) and water dripping from the bathroom ceiling as if they had turned on the hot water, closed the door and just left it like that for quite some time. Contacted the front desk, they sent up a housekeeping super to help us move to another room and even he was taken back by the dirt and the nasty look of the stain on the chair (use your imagination!). They moved us across the hall and down a bit to a room that was larger but it too was dirty! There was literally someone's food wrapper on the floor right in front of the door before you even got into the room! Again, the carpet looked as if it hadn't even been vacuumed! Stopped on the way down to our dinner reservations and requested they properly clean the original room and move us back to the original room when we returned that night. The first room had a nice view of the water and the second overlooked an interior courtyard....no thanks! At this point I am feeling that if they don't vacuum, what else do they skimp on in terms of cleaning. We get back from dinner, move our things, room looks clean, \"stain\" on chair is either gone or they flipped the cushion...don't want to know. We go to the rooftop garden to enjoy the view for a few minutes and when we try to get back in, our passkey won't open the door! Hit the intercom button for several minutes with no response and now we are getting quite nervous. Its about 11PM, we have no cell phones, and we're stuck outside with no jackets. Someone finally answers the page and says they'll have to find someone to send up. My husband starts walking the entire park area and finally finds another door that will accept our key and we get inside...never seeing a staff member! Breakfast was definitely not up to Hilton standards and when the manager stopped by the table to say hello and ask us for suggestions to improve the food or service we suggested that they might want to at least cook the potatoes. He checked them, apologized and thanked us for the input...very nice man. The food (yes I know it was free due to the comp!) is not great. The bacon is so thin you can see through it for heaven's sake. Same thing when we were on the Homewood side last year as it is a shared kitchen. It was just very poor for a Hilton. I love love love my Hilton experiences and with two bad ones at the same location you really have to question what is going on. When we went to check out, the manager on duty said she was also the manager who was on when we were having issues the day before and that she was aware of what was going on and had addressed the issue with the staff. I suggested she might want to walk the property including the common areas and see the dirt in the hallways, the less than Hilton standards in the rooms, etc. She said she does do that and that was pretty much it. I really felt that my comments were not heard and nothing further was done. I sent Hilton Corp. my comments about this stay over 2 weeks ago and heard nothing back. This location is soooo perfect for the harbor area and Fells Point that it is sad that it doesn't live up to Hilton standards. I absolutely will still recommend Hilton to anyone who asks because there is usually a very high standard with the company but definitely not this one.", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "PA", "Title": "\u201cOvernight Getaway\u201d", "Author": "bdonmoyer", "ReviewID": "UR119951607", "Content": "My wife and I decided to take a quick overnighter to Baltimore for a getaway weekend and chose to try the Hilton Garden Inn at Inner Harbor since she enjoys her stays at every other Garden Inn.

We were not disappointed, apart from the 2 x double beds rather than the king-size we booked everything was efficient, clean and just what we needed after travelling for about 20 hours !. As a comp for the room foul-up they offered us a free breakfast, which was excellent and ensured a 5* rating. The hotel is located in an excellent position, we arrived quite late but the receptionist suggested Roys across the street for dinner, even though we arrived at 10pm they were till busy but we had a welcome glass of Merlot whilst we waited just 10-15 mins for a table. The food was excellent, highly recommended. Next morning after a good Hilton breakfast we explored the Inner Harbor area, a 5 minute walk gets you to the start of the main attractions, for sheer location alone i would recommend this hotel. Other stuff....free WiFI, worked really well, and i needed it to sort out a bank issue. ATM in the lobby. Small shop selling essentials just off the lobby. Drinks vending on each floor...buy your water here as its cheaper than the shop, and colder ! The Icing on Cake ?....after a week on the cruise ship we had a day to kill in Baltimore before our flight home, the hotel concierge was most accomodating in allowing us to leave our luggage in the secure store at the hotel whilst we spent a day shopping, exploring and eating our way around the Inner Harbor ( we can highly recommend The CheeseCake Factory). We had agreed this with the reception staff before we left for the cruise but it was a relief to drop our bags for a day at no charge (apart from a good tip !) This is not just good but great service, especially when the concierge has also organised a luxurious private taxi to take us to the airport at the end of the day (rather than one of the nasty yellow cabs).

I mean, even budget hotels provide something besides coffee and water. And as for the lobby restroom, someone really should check it more frequently. It was disgusting when I went in there.

The hotel is in a great location - an easy walk to the Inner Harbor attractions and Little Italy. The neighborhood is very nice and we felt comfortable walking at night. The James Joyce Irish Pub across the street serves yummy crab soup and reubens in a rustic atmosphere with unobtrusive live music. We tried the breakfast buffet in the hotel this morning and were pleased with the made-to-order omelettes, hot coffee and friendly service.

I always take my two girls, Courtney, age 14, and Hailey, age 13, with me. I always do extensive research before booking a hotel and for the most part stick with the major chain hotels, (Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, etc.). By linking my Airline, Amtrak, and Hotel Reward Clubs and Cards, I have amassed significant points, stays, and rewards, that we take advantage of when possible. We usually will attend concerts, and then stay at a hotel in the city where the concert is located, and spend the rest of the weekend there. Most recently 2/18/11, we attended a three band concert at Ramshead Live in Baltimore, and stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn in Baltimore on President Street. We had an awesome weekend. No complaints!!! I called ahead and spoke to Maria and she pre-assigned our room #, and even zeroxed a map to the concert (walking distance) and highlighted our route. Also, since I am a Hilton Honors Gold Member, she arranged a late check-out for us so we could sleep in. Our room package included a full cooked to order breakfast, which had something for everyone and saved us the trouble of having to find somewhere to eat (as well as an additional expense). The hotel has a security team on duty from 7PM to 7AM. The parking garage, is conveniently located, well lit and has amble parking. I needed to retrieve some items I left in my vehicle and asked at the front desk if someone could accompany me to the garage, the manager on duty called the security officer to accompany me. Once in the room for the night, I requested additional pillows and they arrived within five minutes. (At the last hotel I stayed at, I requested additional pillows and was told they were so booked that no extra pillows were available.) I have horrible allergies/asthma and always check the vents to see if they are covered with dust or have been cleaned recently. Few hotels actually pay attention to this when maid service cleans the rooms. To my surprise, they were impeccably clean and dust free. We stayed on the 8th floor and although the windows would not open all the way, the screens were completely intact so I had no worries about my girls at the window with the windows cracked. The Hilton Garden In at Baltimore is a great value, great location, and considering we had a standard room, I'm sure a room upgrade would even be more amazing. I strongly recommend this hotel. **If you are a Hilton Honors Club member, there are NO BLACKOUT dates (which I have experienced with other chains). If you are not a member, be sure to join online before booking so you can include you member number when making your reservation, or ask for an application when checking in, so you will get credit for your stay.

I was shocked how much it differed from other Hilton properties, although this was my first stay at a \"Garden Inn\" property. The room was so small that the bathroom door had to be closed before the door from the hallway into the room could be opened. Also, there was not enough room to even use one side of the 2nd bed because it was wedged against a chair and the wall. And parking.... guests must park at a public parking facility with a separate entrance... very hard to find, and the hotel's communications didn't contain this information. I circled the hotel, in rush hour traffic, several times before finding a place to pull over and call the front desk to locate the parking. When I was checking in, the woman in line behind me had had the same problem. The location of the hotel was difficult to get to, making the commute to and from the job site difficult. I elected to check out a day early, to move to a hotel near the departure airport, and it was a major relief to get out of this place. The front desk mis-handled the charges for parking, resulting in the need to locate the parking garage attendant and have him separately confirm I had paid all parking charges for my visit. When I initially called the front desk about checking out a day early, I first reached an obviously indifferent clerk who said she didn't have my info and couldn't help me. A 2nd call reached a clerk who did provide the help I needed. The only thing positive was the pub located across the street from the hotel. Each night they featured a happy hour menu that made for a very inexpensive, but good, dinner. If you are going to Baltimore, I suggest you stay at the Hilton on W.

Usually hotels have some awful pattern to hide the over use. - but these crispy white bed spreads made me feel that they were clean and not hiding anything.

For the $99/night I booked at Hilton.com I thought it was an exceptionally nice room, very nice furniture including a couch and desk, extremely comfortable king bed with an adjustable mattress and plasma TV. Check in did take a few minutes while they verified the room had been clean. We did not use the parking garage instead lucking in to free onstreet parking on Alicianna Street (there are a couple of blocks without meters just past the Marriott). As mentioned in other reviews it is conveniently located between the Inner Harbor and Little Italy and only a few blocks from the Fells Point neighborhood which includes many restaurants, bars and stores. The hotel also has an outdoor garden on the eight floor which was nice. There is a 10.95 breakfast buffet which includes made to order items. A notch up from the standard chain free breakfast, but I wouldn't pay the money (as a HHonors Gold member I received a complimentary breakfast for two each day. Day one included a not so great omelette from a not so friendly cook - Day two was much better.

Following previous reviews, I'll use the number system to make it a little easier on myself! 1. Front desk is ridiculous - a joke. Hilton Honors Check-In? No chance. It took 15 minutes once we reached the desk as \"Bob\" answered every phone, answered every question asked of him on the phone and at one point, put the phone down, told us to hold on while he went and researched the answer for whoever was on the phone! Hello, we are standing right here - why is the guy on the phone more important? As far as a front desk is concerned, don't ask them anything. They have no answers. Don't have a clue what time any venues or stores around them open or close and no matter what restaurant we asked about, no one knew anything about any of them. Awful. 2. Our room. Being a diamond member, I have to say that most properties treat my husband fairly well. No room upgrade, unless you call a street view an upgrade. It had a chair and ottoman in it that took up literally the whole side of the bed that he sleeps on. Had to rearrange furniture before going to bed so he could get there and heaven forbid he have to get up in the middle of the night - he jammed his toe the first night! No bottled water in the room, and let me tell you, the water in Baltimore is crap. We went downstairs and overheard Bob telling some folks to help themselves to water in the cooler in the \"store\" to the left of the front desk. We said hey, what's up with that? We didn't get water in our room. He said \"are you Honors members?\" This was not 10 minutes after we had checked in. We said, well yes, Diamond as a matter of fact. He then said to get some water. We asked if that was a daily thing, and he said no, just on check-in. We usually get water daily at Hiltons, but then we don't stay at Garden Inns very often. The Homewood Suites shares the desk and lobby with the Garden Inn, and the rest of our business group stayed there with not a whole lot more luck. The toilet in the room flushed every 10 or 15 minutes, on its own. As a matter if fact, we thought someone was in the room as we first arrived because it was flushing as we walked in. Told the front desk - \"oh, we'll have someone up to fix that right away.\" Well, 4 days later, it was still a-flushin'. The closet door was jammed and basically, we had to leave it open the whole stay. They were told, but never fixed it. I developed a rash one night while sleeping, and after reading the bedbug concerns....I don't know? 3. Parking is $25/day for in-and-out capabilities, but in truth, you don't need your car if you're just staying in the inner harbor, so save yourself a whopping $3/day and don't get the in-and-out part. Way too expensive for just parking a car with no valet. 4. The breakfast in the morning is actually quite good. They will make eggs to order, which is a nice departure from the \"heat lamp\" eggs out on display. We asked for wine glasses for our room - no. We asked for plates - no. We asked for silverware - no. We got plastic packets of forks, knives, etc., and styrofoam trays. Give me a break. 5. This property is in a good location, but I would never stay there again should I ever find myself in Baltimore. There is a Hilton down the street, and though it might be a little bit of a walk, I'd probably check that place out. The Garden Inn borders Little Italy, and the smells coming out of those restaurants are incredible! Also, the James Joyce Irish Pub is right across the street with good beers, scotch and wine and the best corned beef and cabbage we've ever had. Vaccaro's is a bakery in Little Italy very worth going to for a late night dessert and cappucino, all a short walk away. The National Aquarium was interesting, but full, and I do mean full, of schoolkids on field trips. I would take it in on a weekend instead, but we didn't know till we got inside! 6. The fitness center is huge - has a contract with the hotel. If you work out, you won't be disappointed. 7. The water taxi is a great way to get around the harbor and is available in the dock area. You pay when you get onboard, get a stamp on your hand, and you can use it all day until 11pm - the cost is $9/pp. 8. All in all, this was a horrible experience. Not on par for Hilton, even a Garden Inn, by any standards.

I have traveled many places and have stayed in many hotels and have to say, that you get what you pay for. For a Hilton property and for $260/night (AAA rate; total price with taxes), this was a great stay. I read the reviews about the construction/noise issue and my room was on the 6th floor and overlooked the fountain and one hotel under construction (there may have been more from the earlier reviews written). My sleep was never interrupted, although I didn't see any construction activity while in the room and I was there all day on a Friday; not just Saturday and Sunday. The walls and windows are pretty thick and sound proof, so even if there was noise, we probably wouldn't have noticed. Overall, the room was very clean and spacious. There's a nice flat screen t.v., mini fridge and microwave. Had I known, I would have brought some drinks/snacks. Too my delight, there is a CVS right next door, plus a Whole Foods supermarket! The MAC (Maryland Athletic Club) gym/pool was a nice addition and we used it frequently. What other reviewers failed to mention is that the pools are saltwater pools, which if you've never been in, is very nice. Beware of the kid pool, though....apparently they only clean it once a month and we happen to catch it right after it was cleaned (they close it for a few days for cleaning). Parking is $22.00/day if you keep it parked the whole time ($25.00 if you take it in/out). Location is absolutely perfect...we never had to take our car anywhere. Little Italy is a very pleasant and safe, short walk. We did wind up taking a cab to Obrecky's for crabs. You could probably walk it, but the neighborhood is a bit sketchy to get there, plus I had a 6 month pregnant wife with me. Cost was $6-7 each way with tip so it is worth the cost of being safe. If you enjoy saving money (who doesn't??!), go to Penera Bread for breakfast instead of the hotel restaurants, which is a couple of blocks from the hotel (across the street from ESPN zone). If you must have McDonald's, it's also very close (same area as Penera Bread). Don't go to Amicci's for Italian food...there was a long line of people waiting, so we thought it must be decent, but I had better Italian food at a diner! Walk around a bit; all the restaurants are very close to one another and peruse their menus before making a decsion. The Irish bar across the street from the Hilton is great, too...real, Irish bartenders (with accents, to boot!) and they poor a nice Guiness. If you are a AAA member, you can purchase discounted tickets ($5/off) for the National Aquarium at your local AAA office. You pick them up at the Will Call window and can add on any additional shows, such as the Dolphin Show and 4D Immersion film. We didn't go to the Dolphin Show, but did go to the 4D movie, which was worth it. Make sure you visit the Jellyfish exhibit early as there was a pretty long line by the time we got there (although it moved quickly).

Hotels were charging a premium and after struggling to find a room for the 19th and 20th found this hotel for $500 per night (a rip off, I might add). Photos of the hotel and most of the existing reviews, led me to believe that this was a great new hotel. Although the stay was for the 19th and 20th, the hotel charged my credit card on the 5th of Jan, which really messes up my company's re-imbursement for the trip. I called the hotel to find out why and was met with rudeness about the subject, the manager did not even bother to call me back about the incident. None the less, I arrived on the evening of the 19th and although reception was not busy, was met with total indifference, NO - \"welcome statement or smiles\", just, what\u2019s you name, here is your key. Self parking, I found out is $22 per night if you leave the car the whole night or $25 if you go in and out. The hotel is 12 floors and I was on the 12th. The room was a little small and it did not have a bath tub. Just a very small shower stall. (If you are a big person, you are going to struggle in this small shower). On the flip side, the king size bed was fantastic and you are able to adjust the stiffness or softness of the mattress. There is a widescreen flat panel High Def TV in the room, and most of the local channels and ESPN are shown in High Definition. There is a small refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker. Also complimentary Wireless Internet. If you are a light sleeper, the noise of the city can be heard, even on the 12th floor. Breakfast is around $10 for a full buffet with a chef available for variances on your eggs. If you are a HHonors member (not sure from which level), the breakfast is complimentary. The restaurant is also used for Dinner. There is also a fitness center, although I don't think it is actually part of the hotel. For you health nuts, there is a Whole Foods store, one block away. There is also a Starbucks right outside. The hotel also shares their reception with a conjoined Homewood Suites.

I tried to call but no one answered at the desk. i went down and stood in the very long, slow line. When I finally reached the desk I asked about face cloths. The girl didn't know if we get face cloths! I should have know then to leave. An hour later we had face cloths. Now I needed the rug dried. This water from cleaning the floors is now on the rug being tracked all over the room. They made a lame attempt of a heater blower for 15 minutes. You'd think with all this hassell they'd give us a nice, clean, dry and stocked room..but no that didn't happen. The next day we put in a request for a wake up call. Needless to say, they did not call. Not once were we able to contact the front desk.When I got my credit card bill the hotel decided to take the charges out that I had prepaid two months prior. This caused all kind of confusion. The hotel offered us a refund for one night for all the trouble we had. But then they said they would sent us a free nights stay at any Hampton. Now they say that they will not be sending us anything because they credited my credit card in a timely manner. Huh? I called them several more times and sent emails and that is the answer I get.

If you're into location and a clean, comfortable room, enjoy the Good HGI. Harbor East is a great spot - literally steps from the best Baltimore can offer. You can spend an entire weekend within a half-mile radius of the hotel and never run out of things to do. It's all there for you: Inner Harbor, Fells Point, Little Italy, water taxis, the aquarium, Starbucks, movies, live theatre, Maryland Athletic Club (MAC) and unique, upscale shopping. The hotel is priced right - even a bit of a bargain for Baltimore, and the smallish-rooms are bright and attractive. The only potential negative is that by Christmas the water view from the harbor-facing rooms may be blocked by the rising Four Seasons/Legg Mason towers. If you need anything, anything at all, from the front desk, welcome to the Bad HGI. The attitude of the employees of the Bad HGI is somewhere south of indifferent. Regardless of the issue, you will be confronted with an unsmiling clerk with attitude. You will never hear \"I'm sorry\" regardless of the level of problem or disappointment you experience. Need a taxi? Well, we're too busy to call for you, but you can get one over at the Marriott you're told. Looking for a newspaper? No, we don't provide them, but you can get one over at the Marriott you're told. The obvious response is why am I staying here and not the Marriott? Call the front desk from your room for assistance - good luck getting someone to pick-up (although after about 40 rings, we called on our cell phone - holding the endlessly ringing internal phone in the other hand - and the call was answered in one ring.
