But when we arrived, we were brought to an apt that in no way looked like the pictures they presented. The furniture was old, they advertised air conditioning and there was none, somewhat clean, provided clean towels. The woman who collected our money for the bill spoke little English, provided map of Rome but failed to orient us to the apt. We went without hot water because she didn't tell us we had to flip a switch in the bathroom that generates the hot water. We called regarding this problem and they said they would come over, we waited and had to call again. We asked for a baby crib during the booking of our reservation and when there was none on arrival, I asked for one and she didn't bring one until the next day when we had to call and request one again. The building is not as new as they make it out to be. To get to the apt there are two escalators that don't work, then you have to cramp into a small elevator. Noise level is okay, but watch out on weekends because the motorists get crazy with there horn, even with the windows closed we heard all that honking overnight. When we had trouble with the airlines and arrived 2 days late, they still charged us for the full 7 days. I will never go back there again, with what we spent we could have had a better experience. But live and learn, at least we enjoyed our time in Rome, albeit the apt at the St Joannes.", "Date": "April 22, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Residence St. Joannes", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d324717-Reviews-Residence_St_Joannes-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$119 - $136*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">via Appia Nuova, 37</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00183</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "324717", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/22/82/228242d2e0a22c81dc3614922333cdb11large.jpg"}}
