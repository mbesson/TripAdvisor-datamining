Never!! Find another hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Teacher B", "ReviewID": "UR126782385", "Content": "Our school travel agent booked this hotel on our behalf and we raised concerns about the review by another school from April 2011. We were told that it had been a mis-understanding and all problems had been cleared up. I wish I had trusted my instinct. I have taken many school trips abroad and travel personally to many countries. Never have I come across a situation like this. The first days were okay. The food was very nice and the restaurant staff were polite and accommodating. Our pupils were described as lovely, and all seemed okay. During breakfast on our last day, we found out that a member of the hotel staff was taking pictures of the children's rooms without our consent or knowledge. We went immediately to ask the person to stop, and we were met by a torrent of loud comments with an aggressive body language. I was amazed to learn that the Manager was not there, and, apparently, the person in charge of the whole hotel was the receptionist. This person continued to take photos and shouted at the teachers about the state of the rooms. She seemed to think we should be responsible for the general wear and tear. What a joke. The female members of staff would not be intimated by this person, and stood our ground, but I have never been shouted at in such a manner. To say she needs a course in customer care is an under statement. Things did go missing from our rooms, I lost one earring. The children reported missing biscuits and shower gel, which at first I thought was teenage untidiness. However, the number of people who reported this can not be considered a co-incidence.But the way the person yelled at our teachers, talking to us like we were children, is totally unacceptable. I believe that they are pulling a scam. Avoid this hotel. I shall be writing to the overall Manager of Comfort Hotels and I have my own video evidence.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNo good for school trips!\u201d", "Author": "Grace B", "ReviewID": "UR126643523", "Content": "I stayed as part of a school group for 3 nights. For the first few days we couldn't fault anything apart from choice of dinner on the night and the behaviour of some maids. The English speaking staff were friendly and the rooms were large and clean. There we no major issues until check out. Several times staff took photographs of student rooms and pointed out what they were not happy with. This inspection was not expected but we accepted that they were worried about the slight untidiness. the real problems started at breakfast on the last day. Staff rushed to our rooms to take last minute pictures while we were eating and managed to find several issues with the rooms. They accused students of breaking things which they didn't. A cigarette end was even placed in a year 8 room, none of whom smoked. several other things were also set up. one other issue was behaviour of some of the maids. some unusual things went missing. Several children reported bags of crisps and biscuits missing, along with deodorants and other items. Usually things like that could be ignored but it happened to a lot of children. Apart from all this the staff were very rude on checkout with one woman shouting and another calling us pigs. Overall the hotel itself was okay but the staff make it difficult for large groups.

I enjoyed the hotel. It was comfortable, clean and cheap as 3 star hotels go. A few months ago I booked another eight nights for June 2011 in a twin room for sole use. To my surprise I was given a huge en-suite room with balcony. The room also had numerous tilt-turn windows, so it was a light room. My single bed was comfortable; I had a writing desk with chair, a television on top of the desk and a mini fridge beneath it; I also had a settee, as well as a small table with 2 small armchairs and a sizeable wardrobe. The tiled bathroom had a wash basin, w.c., and shower, and I had plenty of towels. Before the sumptuous buffet Continental breakfast (5 star quality), which also included scrambled eggs and bacon, I was able to pick up one or two complimentary German quality newspapers. The restaurant also served good quality evening meals at reasonable prices. All in all, the room service, restaurant service and the service provided at reception could not be faulted and the cost of my room with breakfast was well below what I would have to pay in the U.K.", "Date": "July 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDissaponting service and treatment of guests.\u201d", "Author": "JulieAWright", "ReviewID": "UR103644952", "Content": "2 nights spent here as part of a school trip. 64 students and 7 staff.

There was a small fridge and a complimentary bottle of water was provided on the first day. The buffet breakfast was 5 star standard, with choice of cereals, fruit, fruit drinks, cooked meats, cheese, rolls, boiled and scrambled eggs, bacon, coffee and different teas. (I might have missed some things.) I had one evening meal, which I paid for with a British visa card. The meal was well presented and served very professionally. I have some suggestions, which would make this good hotel even better: a small electric kettle with sachets of coffee, tea bags, as well as biscuits. Either connect a digi. box to the crt tv, for more channels with better reception, or replace the old tvs with flat screen digital tvs. The only disadvantage of this hotel, is that it is some way from the centre.

It is quite far from the touristy parts of Berlin, you have to take several busses.

Wireless internet (8 Euro per 24 hours) wasnt working on the first night, but was on the second night. Dont know if that happens often. Restaurant was good - was a bit slow getting our drinks, but the food was good. No English speaking TV channels, so make sure you have a DVD or movie to watch if you wanna relax after a day in Berlin.

It was the chepest option we could find for that period, and I was a bit put off by its location. But it turned out not to be so bad - you need to take the 151 bus (the bus stop is right across the street form the hotel) to Pankow, where there are both U-bahn and S-bahn stations. It's a straight line to Alexanderplatz, about five or six stops. So travelling to the centre took about half an hour, depends on how long we waited for the bus. If you stay out late, or just don't want to wait for the bus, there's a taxi stand at the station, getting to the hotel costs just under 10 euro. The rooms are spacious, simple and clean. A double bed was actually two beds pushed together. There's a fridge, but no mini bar. No safe in the room, but they have deposit boxes at reception free of charge. All in all it's exactly what you'd expect from a three star hotel. The staff at reception is helpful in answering any questions, all of them speak good english. You can buy Berlin welcome cards at reception, there are free maps of the city, and an information stand with brochures, etc., but most of them are in German. Breakfast is nothing to write home about and not really worth getting up for if you'e a late sleeper. A pretty limited choice, the only hot options beeing scrambled eggs and bacon, but you won't go hungry (if you do, you can buy any imaginable kind of junk food at Pankow station). The only problem we came across while staying at the hotel, was when our electronic key card stopped opening the door. For some reason they couldn't recharge it or something, the actually had to change the lock to our room and give us an ordinary key. The problem was handled efficiently, but it took about an hour. Overall, staying at the Comfort Weissensee hotel was a plesant enough experience, especially taking into account the price. However, if I ever visit Berlin again, I'd preffer to stay somewhere closer to the centre of the city.", "Date": "January 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denmark", "Title": "\u201cValue for money in Weissensee\u201d", "Author": "Zfinks", "ReviewID": "UR18145237", "Content": "We stayed at the Comfort Hotel Weissensee for 5 nights.

The breakfast buffet was ok, different kinds of cereal, tea and coffea and bread with cheese and jelly. Also eggs and bacon and different kinds of ham and sausage. One could miss some fresh fruit or a sweet treat, but it was ok. The hotel is nice and clean, but not very cosy in our opninion. There are no green areas, and that is definently a shame. It is located about 20 min. from Alexanderplatz, if you go by bus and U-bahn, witch is very easy. You just have to change in Pankow.
