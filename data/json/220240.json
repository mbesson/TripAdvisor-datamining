The hotel itself is very nice with just the right amount of traffic and buzz for a weekend in the city, it's not super busy but not super dead. However, keep in mind you're in the financial district so it's a short car or cab ride away to some of the more happening parts of town. I came from a tradeshow at the Navy Pier and we visited both the Shedd Aquarium and Art Institute over the weekend, so it was a convenient locale for us. The Acura car service is a nice touch, we used it three times during our stay and was much nicer than a cab ride. They have limited hours, but it was awesome when it worked with our schedule. I was literally snowed-in on Friday when the city received 3-5\" of snow and Laurelin Hefter, the W Insider, was super nice and made sure I had everything I needed for the night since traffic around the city was at a standstill and cabs were nowhere to be seen. She turned a miserable night into a comfortable evening at the hotel. Gym was nice, IPO has a decent menu and the bar has everything you expect of a hotel bar. We were lucky to have an upgraded (SPG Gold) interior corner room that was farther away from the train, so you only heard a muffled train and very little traffic. The bed was amazingly comfortable, didn't want to get up other than go downstairs for a free cup of coffee in the morning.

Our room was a \"spectacular\" room, and it was nice, but it certainly had some curiosities. I suppose it was built for a family with children, but it was just my husband and myself. The room, upon entering, has a closet and hallways to both the left and right. On the right was a bathroom with a sliding door, and the comfy King bed with a 52\" plasma on the wall. I love that there was a docking station for my iPod. As we played around with the lighting, we noticed the bed is lit underneath--kinda cool. There's a sliding door on the wall that as you open, lights up to reveal a bottle of wine, 2 nice wineglasses, and a corkscrew. We had brought our own wine, but it was a nice surprise to have the glasses already there, without having to call for some. Down the left hallway was another bathroom, without a shower, and an additional sitting room with sofa and chair and another 52\" plasma! I imagine the sofa folded out into a bed, but we just enjoyed having an alternate place to view the Bulls game. The decor was interesting and fun. And I love the luxurious bed and linens. On the negative side, the toilets in both bathrooms were really cramped in there--not much leg room in the one, and the other one, you had to reach back behind the vanity to flush. The tub in the shower had several chips and the drain looked a bit yucky. We were staying only one night, so it was not a problem for us, but definitely a turn-off. And of course, the ever-present el that you don't seem to notice at all until you're sleeping. It didn't keep us awake, but it is likely a problem for many.

I've been to Chicago before and stayed at the W Lakeshore and was originally planning on staying there, but they did not have availability for New Years Eve so I decided to give the W City Center a try as I always seem to have a good stay at W's. First off, this hotel is very conveniently located within The Loop. If you're coming from MDW, it's right off Quincy and about 100 feet down the road. There are a couple convenience stores nearby, coffeeshops, and countless restaurants all within walking distance. From the outside, you can tell this is not the newest structure in the world but it has been renovated and just looks classy. You walk in, and step into what must be the most unique looking Living Room (lobby) of all W hotels. It's classy, elegant, and you can't help but like how historic it looks! I had a bit of a later than expected arrival the first night, but was greeted by the Welome Agent Amanda who actually recalled speaking to me over the phone a few nights earlier. This may not seem like a big deal, but these people must take a lot of phone calls every day and to be able to recall something like that was just a nice litte personal touch that I can appreciate. She informed me that I had been upgraded to a Fantastic Suite on the 5th floor and gave me a quick rundown of the hotel facilities and I was on my way up to my room. The Fantastic Suite itself is a very nice large suite, with a layout similar to that of a horseshoe. The room was in great condition, the bed looking very modern and similar to those found at other newer W's. This is the complete opposite of the W Lakeshore where the rooms are simply starting to look dated, and are much smaller. The bathroom was very clean, and I took a quick shower before wanting to head out for a little bit and get some items that I had forgotten back home. As I went back downstairs, Amanda had asked me how everything was and I asked her where the nearest convenience store was and how late they are open. She asked me if there was anything I needed, and I told her I was looking for contact lens solution and shaving cream. I have stayed at other Starwood properties and the shaving cream tends to be in little throw away packets while contact solution is in a very small bottle and that's if they have any. She went back and came with a travel size shaving cream canister and a large bottle of contact solution which was complimentary. This was very surprising, and very pleasant to see and probably the first time I have seen this in my years as an SPG member. I then asked her about quick dinner spots nearby since Concierge was not on-duty at the time (it was late) and she probably gave me a list of maybe a dozen or so restaurants within walking distance! The entire time, she was very pleasant to deal with and sometimes I feel like these are the little things that really make a stay go from 4 stars to 5 stars. I never left the hotel that night and dined at IPO which is their signature restaurant. I rarely ever do this as I find hotel restaurants to be overpriced and lacking in quality and overall service. IPO proved this to be wrong, as the food was reasonably priced and the Sturgeon I had was absolutely delicious! I went back up to my room and had a nice nights sleep shortly after. I returned back to this property two nights later for New Years Eve, and arrived earlier than expected as the W Lakeshore (sold out for NYE) disappointed on many levels. I was very glad to be back and walking through the lobby was greeted by Laurelin who I later found out was actually the W Insider at this hotel. Anthony Ortega, who is one of the management staff at this hotel checked me in and upgraded me to a Fabulous Room since all Suites were sold out. He also recalled speaking to me earlier in the week and made me feel very welcome. I went up to my room on the 14th floor and it was larger than expected. Very spacious, very modern, and in immaculate condition. I kept wondering why I even ever stayed at the W Lakeshore the night before, I should have stayed here for my entire trip! I went downstairs to get some dining recommendations for lunch. I had a bad experience with Concierge at the Lakeshore the day before, and this left me disappointed and wondering why ever go to a Concierge if they don't make the effort to help you and make you feel like other things are more important than your time? Laurelin Hefter, the W Insider at this property restored my trust by giving me recommendations for lunch, and I not only had lunch but also dinner at the places recommended. Insiders at W's know the hotel inside out, know whats around the city, and always give the best recommendations while ensuring that the service remains enjoyable. She also gave me directions and her card, and let me know to give her a call if I need anything else while I am out. I've spoken with many of the Insiders at various W hotels and always found them to be a pleasure to deal with, they really know their stuff and Laurelin was a standout and probably the best Insider I have dealt with yet. They're all great, but this was just on another level I felt. The Insiders can take care of anything for you really, and had I not had friends get us a table at Vision for NYE, I know that the Laurelin would have helped us greatly! Checking out the next day, I almost did not want to leave. But I left knowing that the next time I am in Chicago, I will be staying here without hesitation. Chicago is a big city so there are many Starwood properties here, but there are a few things that separate this hotel from the rest. It's a unique building, the rooms are great and better than other Starwoods in the area, it's in a convenient location and houses a better than average restaurant in IPO, but the thing that makes this the best Starwood in Chicago is the incredibly well-trained staff that really make you feel taken care. This is a talented team of individuals that will do what they can to ensure your stay is as enjoyable as possible. From the Management staff in Brian and Anthony, the Welcome agent in Amanda Sweetman, and the W Insider Laurelin...and the rest of the hotel staff, this is exactly why I remain loyal to the SPG program and why I cannot wait until the next I am back in the Windy City.

The decor is ultra-modern, lighting dark, busy. Some of my travel companions like this style and refer to the hotel as \"Funky\" and \"lively\". I must qualify my review by saying I do not like this style of hotel and that influences some of the ratings. The biggest influence though is the price. The hotel was very expensive, even compared to other options in Chicago. I chose to pay extra out of my own pocket for the brand. I was very disappointed, both by the style of the hotel and the services recieved. The room is stark and has a lot of modern, gimicky furnishings, including a metre squared light with a business slogan worded across it. Just not my style. The main problem I had was with booking a wake up call. I rang at 2:00 am to book a 6:00 am wake up. The operator did not acknowledge who I was, the time or provide any friendly greetings. Then I was woken up at 5:00am insteady of 6:00 am. The operator offered minimal appologies, and when I repeated several times I still need the 6 oclock call, provided minimal acknowledgement. I set my phone alram in case, which woke me up a 6:00 am. When I checked out out 7:00 am I had not received the call still. One example perhaps, but I think relfects the service culture in a hotel that seems all about flash and dazzle and not so much on substance.

Naturally, I totally freaked out. But after a few deep breaths, I phoned the hotel and was immediately treated with ALL respect, and my call was forwarded to a miss Shumeka Bonds in their accounting department. Shumeka listened carefully to my complaint, and I could even hear her pen scribbling notes as I was talking. She asked politely if she could phone my bank and get right back to me. I was skeptical, but agreed. Could you die??? She actually called me back in less than 15 minutes and sure enough, she'd spoken with my bank manager, and the entire snafu was resolved in less than a day. In this world of feeling that great big huge nameless, faceless corporations run absolutely everything and don't give a damn about the \"little people\" like me, it was overwhelmingly delightful to deal with Miss Bonds and all at the W, who treated me as though I was a celebrity.

It was amazing to see how the other half lives! Everyone we encountered at the hotel treated us very well, from the person who parked our car, to the AMAZING concierge Eden Bernal. Eden - you have EVERYTHING to do with why we loved our stay! Thanks to Eden, we were able to skip ahead of a line at Lou Mitchell's that was easily 45 minutes long. Oh yes, we were THOSE people! Eden also got us tickets to the Shedd Aquarium ahead of time, again saving us a very long wait in line. Anything the concierge can do for you, he or she will do for you happily! We were very happy with our ultra-modern room that faced the alley. It was by the El, but wasn't too noisy. We did mention our desire to rest to the woman who checked us in and she seemed to accommodate us. The room was small but really, really nice. All the lights were on dimmers. The under-bed lights made the bed look like it was floating! There was a generously sized closet with nice hangers and a light, and even a couple of shelves. We had a slow-draining tub and found a tee shirt from the previous guest in a dimly lit corner, and in both cases someone came right up to take care of it for us. The linens were soft and warm and the windows could be opened to let in the fresh air from the unusually lovely fall day. It was too bad that all the add-ons were so expensive (the wine in the room looked good, but not for that price!), but we loved what we had. Our other slight disappointment was how early the hotel bar closed. Midnight? I guess everyone there goes elsewhere to bar-hop, but we would have liked to sit down and enjoy a night cap. Around these parts the party goes to 2 no matter how remote the location. We stayed here for a friend's weekend and were very happy to be just about a block away from an El station. We could get out to the wedding in about 20 minutes. Yes, you can hear the train, but it makes for wonderfully short commuting times. We took a bus to the Shedd Aquarium, and that was very easy and inexpensive. I think we might have walked 4 blocks to catch it. It was very reasonable. The walk to Millennium Park was a little longer, but as long as you wear reasonable shoes and dress for the weather you will be just fine. Walking around Chicago is one of the nice things about the city. If you are against walking, again, the El is right across the street, and the door person would be happy to hail you a cab. The final touch to our weekend was that they allowed us to leave our car in the parking lot for an extra few hours while we toured a museum after we checked out for no extra charge. We were pleasantly surprised, especially since parking can be so very expensive in Chicago! It was a wonderful trip. So wonderful, in fact, that we are going back to another W this February!

First, the \"W Insider\" was absolutely fantastic and helpful. Her name was Laurelin. She gets five stars. The hotel location is great and just steps from the Orange Line to Midway. The property is fine and has that W feel. Some like that vibe and others do not. The vibe tries to be dark and clubby. I think either one likes that sort of thing or does not. I am now nearing 40 and while I used to like it I am now more annoyed with it (that is on me). Having the guy on the Mac acting like a DJ now seems silly--but that may be just me. I have stayed in W's in Seattle, San Diego, New York and both in Chicago. In each of those properties I have had trouble with guests in neighboring rooms coming home at 315 am like clockwork, cranking up the in room stereo and continuing their night. I think the W seems to attract this type of guests more than other hotels. I am no prude but getting distrubed every night at 315 can sour you on a place. Granted, you can get disturbed at any flag but it seems to always happen at the W--again maybe it attracts the people that party all night. In any event, I think the hotel facilities and experience are average. However, the W Insider did her job--she can't control the crowd the hotel attacts. One more thing--we were on a high floor but with no view of other buildings and felt nicely insulated. However, we could hear traffic whistles from the street and the L. It was not bad (you are in a big city so you expect noise) but I would imagine it may be different if you are on a low floor.

I asked at the desk and they said someone threw all the games pieces together and they sorted through all of them so he could play. Amazing customer service.

Other reviewers are correct - the rooms are small. Smaller than I anticipated even after reading the reviews. We were in several other guest rooms while there and they seem to vary in size and lay out, you may have luck requesting a larger one when making reservations. What this pad lacks in space in makes up for in style and service. Each aspect of the guest rooms were thought out and there is creative space planning and design, the decor is modern/contemporary but not over the top. I did find the halls and common areas to be super dark...you feel like you're in a nightclub 24/7. Overall everything was very clean and the staff was so so nice. If you are thinking about planning a wedding for this location - do it! The setting was beautiful and the staff was so attentive and friendly. We were so impressed by the bar service and table service once we were at dinner. Everyone went out of their way to make sure your stay and evening was memorable. We didn't eat in the restaurant but hung at the bar both nights and it was a fun place and pretty 'happening' for a lobby spot. Service here was great too. At one point our keys became de-magnetized, as I was going back to the elevator to go to the front desk someone on the service staff recognized me and practically chased me down the hall to help me. She let me in our room and then requested the front desk send up new keys, which were then in hand in less than 5 minutes. Wow. This is a great hotel, for the price, we'd probably look elsewhere in the future though. It wouldn't be a great place to take a family looking to stay in one room - we wouldn't have even wanted to have our newborn with us as a crib would have really crowded an already tight space.

How wrong I was! Every single member of staff that I encountered was so friendly and so accommodating. They had no airs or attitude about them and, if you can even imagine, actually appeared to like their job!! What a refreshing change! I got a very spacious queen room that faced the courtyard. It was clean and well appointed, though the bathroom was a little on the small side (I was traveling alone on this occasion, so it wasn't an issue, but couples may want to request a room with a slightly larger bathroom), and I had to call down for a coffee maker. Other than that, the room was great and I really love those Bliss products! I also really appreciated the 'Acura Experience' where you can get a complimentary ride in a very nicely equipped Acura vehicle to your destination (I think it was up to a 3 or 5 mile radius of the hotel). That was a very enjoyable bonus. So too was the option of not having the room made up and receiving Starwood points instead. I think this is a fantastic idea and even though I chose to take advantage of this offer, Guest Services were still more than happy to send up extra Bliss products for me. The only thing I did not like about the hotel was how thin the walls are. The person in the room next to me received a call at 5:30am and, not only could I hear the phone ring(I actually thought it was my phone), but I could also hear almost every word of their conversation. Later that evening, I could hear the alarm in the same room, going off every 10 minutes. That was rather annoying and is the reason I gave the hotel 4 rather than 5 stars. Actually, I would only have deducted half a star, but that isn't possible on TripAdvisor.

I lobbied and fought to stay in a W Hotel because it is a brand that I trust. This property definitely did not disappoint. We arrived on my birthday and they were kind enough to upgrade my room. When i got upstairs- I was slightly disappointed with the size of the room, but as it was just me alone- it worked. The sink in the tiny bathroom was small, but here again- it did work for one person. As for service, I requested foam pillows, but the room came with down (i did upgrade at the last minute). So i called to have the pillows exchanged- someone was knocking on my door with new foam pillows within the minute. Yes the minute. Same with the coffee pot the next morning. When they replaced the pot- they gave me one that was the wrong size. Again, within a minute I had a new pot. And for ambiance, the W is known for the gray, purple and white interiors with moody lighting. My lobby and rooms are no exception. The creative lighting in the room was amazing, what i thought was just wall art was actually a light fixture. It made me love the space even more. The elevators at this hotel almost made me feel like I was slightly high. The loud, pulsing house music and kaleidoscopic, 3D jewel wallpaper made my colleagues want to close their eyes. I just enjoyed the ride! The night we checked in there was a party in the lobby. There was a model in an over-sized martini glass at the center of the lobby, the upstairs bar had a human vending machine, the drinks were free during happy hour and the dj played the best music. This was a great way to kick off a weekend of work. My favorite topic is the food: As is par for most business trips, my meals came from the hotel. They were SUPER pricey, but very very tasty. If you like oatmeal, you will LOVE theirs. The location of the hotel is not ideal.

Yet, instead of being 2-3 feet tall, they are 20 or 30 feet tall. Add to that a couple disco balls with rotating light patterns projected on the walls amid a sort of electronica music. You can see why there's something of a feeling of being Alice in Wonderland when you walk into the lobby. A major difference: The level of service gives you exactly the opposite of the distressing feeling that Alice got from the Mad Hatter. Example: A big appeal is the set of Bliss toiletries in each room. I asked the concierge about buying more. There's no W Store at the W City Center, but she directed me to the Bliss spa at the sister property in Chicago, the W Hotel Chicago Lakeshore. (Tip: Be very careful not to confuse the Chicago City Center property with the Lakeshore. They are at least a couple miles apart and in very different neighborhoods with very different feels.) Well, the concierge went a few steps farther. She printed out directions to the Lakeshore. She reminded me of the Acura MDX that is often available for short trips for guests, checked on its availability, and walked me over to the Acura desk. Within minutes, I was cruising to the Lakeshore. This was my fourth stay at the W Chicago City Center, and I could regale you with other stories of that high level of service that exceeds every other hotel in which I've stayed in the US--including stays at Ritz-Carlton and Four Seasons properties. There was the time I was thinking of buying a CD with some of their electronica music, and I stopped in the hotel shop. The sales clerk spent a good 15 minutes asking me about my taste in music, playing excerpts from different CDs, and even suggesting a blues club I might enjoy! The hotel has changed since my first stay a few years ago. No longer do the front desk clerks check in guests with computers using candlelight for auxiliary lighting. Instead the Welcome \"desk\" is a series of red podiums. The corridor isn't the dark passage that some found scary; it was brightly lit. The towels were quite adequate--but not the super-fluffy ones that led me to order a couple sets for my own home. They didn't have music playing when I checked into my room; but there was a flat screen Philips tv with a beautiful picture. Although the hotel is very stylish--the elevators are dark and moody with music playing, keep in mind a few issues: The rooms are small (but certainly tolerable for one person). My view was a courtyard with buildings, which is not very impressive. (Tip: Chicago has a lot of trains, including the \"El.\" They can be noisy. So . . . sometimes a dull courtyard view can mean a room with some of the train noise blocked.) The fitness center had only one elliptical machine--but the aerobic equipment was well equipped with fancy screens for watching tv and inputting personalized programs. The hotel is barely a block from the Quincy-Wells El station. This can be convenient, but watch out if you have a lot of luggage: There's no elevator at the station. You'll need to walk up stairs to moreless the third floor level. A 7-11 and a Walgreen's are close by for basic sundries. The hotel is in a part of downtown Chicago dominated by large banks. It's not a bad walk, though, to the Art Institute. This was my fourth stay (or maybe I've stayed even more times--I may have lost count). So you can tell that I love this hotel's style and service.

The room was pretty clean, but the size was just too small - even for two people used to city living and close quarters. I would say the room was comfortably no larger than 12' by 10 or 11'. The bathroom was absolutely tiny, but the real inconvenience was the lack of sink or shelf space for toiletries, etc. Bliss products were great. The water pressure was fairly weak though. My fianc\u00c3\u00a9 (a fairly light sleeper) turned up the AC to create background noise that he hoped would drown out the subway train noise coming from not too far away. The W hotel brand in general caters to younger, trendy travelers, so the lobby that pounded Euro/techno music was no surprise. Still, it's not for everyone. The location is not ideal for the average Chicago tourist who wants to walk around the Mag Mile and Gold Coast areas and venture north. If we were not bound to the wedding and had options to stay elsewhere, I would have preferred the Park Hyatt or the Peninsula, which are my two favorite hotels in Chicago. The W is fine for a short stay if you are okay with cramped spaces and noise issues.", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cA Perfect Engagement and Birthday\u201d", "Author": "Anna S", "ReviewID": "UR117876667", "Content": "When we arrived the hotel was beautiful with fresh modern decor and great fragrances.

There are two W hotels in Chicago. One is nearby the Lake Front. This review is for the hotel on Adams Street which is in the business district. There are some complaints about this property in other reviews about location and noise. The location is in the business area. During the evening, it is not especially busy because it is not a neighbourhood. If you are accustomed to urban living this should not be a problem for you. The area is not unsafe, but you might see the occasional homeless person or vagrant. Other reviews mention noise from the \"El\" which is the elevated train track which is a good half block away. On the first time I stayed at this hotel, I was in room 1004 facing Adams Street and the JW Marriott across the street. I heard no noise. I have lived in Central London, NYC and Philadelphia and city noise is not bothersome to me. This stay I am in room 1815 which is a larger room than 1004 and overlooks the interior courtyard. There is no view and other rooms are directly facing. But there are very adequate blinds to ensure privacy if you need that. This room is also incredibly quiet. Frankly, I am not sure how anyone could hear the \"El\" trains half block away. I scored the room cleanliness low for this visit because on Friday and Saturday the room was not properly cleaned -- at least not to my liking. I am fussy. I emailed the general manager. She replied immediately with an apology and promised to look after my issues. She followed through immediately. She emailed me while I was out at dinner to say that the issues I raised had been addressed and she would like to know from me if it was satisfactory when I returned. When I returned from dinner, my room had been cleaned and my issues fully resolved. There was a fine bottle of red wine along with a fresh cheese assortment and fresh flowers. Very nice touch. This property does not have a spa. They will organise an in room massage if you like. Or we took advantage of the \"Accura Experience\" to go to the Bliss Spa inside the W Lakeshore. Bliss is a nice spa but nothing over the top compared to the great high end spas in the world. My massage therapist, Jose was outstanding. He gave me one of the best deep tissue massages I've had. The breakfast is quite good however, I like breakfast in the room in the morning and it is too expensive which is why I gave it a \"3\". Food is very good and arrives at the correct temperature; the coffee is also good. The price is much too high. There is a wonderful diner out the front door and left about 2 1/2 blocks which I highly recommend. Waitresses are excellent and very good quality breakfast for a very good value. There is in room WiFi but again for a 6-night stay and every night is a new charge, it is too expensive. I would prefer it bundled into the rate.

There isn't a lot going on in the financial district around the hotel during the weekend but that was fine with us - less street noise and it was still very easy to get to everything. It is a several block walk to Millenium Park etc (got in a couple good early morning runs along the waterfront). Also their car service (via Acura) is good for being dropped off - but book early, as it was completely booked for the evening when we checked in at 4;30 PM.) Original room was interior court yard view which was supposed to be quieter. Unfortunately it was directly across from the eleveator and so we moved to an exterior room on a high floor. With the exception of one siren vehicle in the early hours street noise was not an issue. Had a two bed room and it was very comfortable, bathroom was great and everything was very clean and well maintained. The first floor has bars and restaurant and walk through it to get to reception.

I booked my reservation one month out, about one week before I was due to arrive at the property, I receive a email from Hefter Laurenlin, asking me what is the purpose of my trip and what she can do to make my stay as comfortable as possible. (WOW WOW WOW) I felt very special. Upon checking into the Hotel I was greeted by Kelly one of your Welcome Desk Agent who had a very pleasant attitude and welcome smile. She also give me a brief overview of the hotel which I thought was great, then she told me to wait a few minutes she has and envelope for me, I said to myself what\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.

I asked her where is the nearest CVS store, she stated to me what are you looking for she would be able to assist me with my request. During the five nights I was there I had several other requests and which Vanessa assisted with and follow up with me by via email, voice message on just in passing to let me know that my request was completed. I felt like a King during the five nights I was there, the team really goes above and beyond to make you feel home away from home. But I must say Vanessa and Hefter really when above and beyond to make me feel special. This was my first time in the Big City and at your property and it will not be my last. OH. one other thing I wanted to mention. I ate in IPO for dinner three nights during my five night stay. IIII LOVEEE Pepsi, after I was seated by the hostess the waiter said can I get you something to drink, I reply a glass of Pepsi she said that they did not had any Pepsi they only have coke, I said coke was find, on the second night dinning in IPO I said I will take a glass of coke, another waiter came back and said here is your Pepsi I said WOW WOW WOW how did he know, (he did not tell me just smile) he was not even the waiter on the first or second night.

That reservation made our anniversary by far. To simply have someone so attentive, detail oriented, and actually cared for the guests staying with her establishment says a lot, truly.

This is the first time I go to a hotel and no coffee or tea is offered in the room.

My daughter set up the W as the designated hotel for guests coming to Chicago for her wedding. Initial calls to get our reservation were not well handled; some of the staff I talked to at that time had no clue. I called in December to make our reservation for the group rate and was told by one guy, \"But sir, you are asking me to look up a group rate for next year!\" That was kind of amusing, since I was asking about dates less than two months away, and the block had already been set up, so I was a bit leery about the level of IQ of staff when I headed up to Chicago to stay at the W. But we were pleasantly surprised. Once we got there, pretty much everyone was helpful, smart, and cool. The Acura experience deal is quite nice; used it to get my tux and to get to the wedding venue and got to ride in a nice vehicle. No high pressure sale, just a little info about Acuras. The concierges were both very nice and helpful--got the name of one of them, Edan Bernal. Gave us directions to great places in walking distance for breakfast and lunch: Lou Mitchell's and the Miller Pub. The W is very conveniently located, and yes, it is right next to the L, but if you actually have trouble sleeping because an L train is going by, you probably didn't have enough drinks at the bar. They do have a nice bar and lounge area at the W. It's expensive, but that's expected when you're at a nice hotel. Bar staff could cheer up and be more personable: one of three servers appeared to enjoy life; the other two seemed to think having a fairly nice job is a burden and that it is hip to be sour and indifferent to customers. I could complain about some of the loud, rich, young, rude people who hung out at the bar one night; but I've learned to ignore such imbeciles and just enjoy a good drink, which the bar does serve. We got upgraded to a nicer room (I think they call it the Spectacular room; the place is pretentious as all get out: on one of the drink coasters in the room they had this written: \"What are you thinking right now? Write it down.\" I told my wife I was going to write something insulting, but she said I needed to settle down, so I did.) They also have an obnoxious saying which you see at all times in the room: Stop trying to find yourself and create yourself instead. That's not exact but that's the gist of it. Profound, I thought. Oh well, the room is still really comfortable, has a great tv, a damn nice bathroom, and the usual overpriced crap in the mini-bar. Still nice to have an option to have a drink in the room if you want one. Beds are very nice and comfortable. One day they didn't clean our room but when I asked the next day, it was done promptly. Really was no big deal. Then when we were checking out, and it was much more convenient to check out a little later, they had absolutely no problem with giving us a later checkout and didn't hassle us at all. That was cool. Lots of places are royal pains when you ask for late checkout. I realize this review may appear less complimentary than my overall rating indicated, but I really did enjoy staying there.

I stay at other W Hotels frequently, mainly in Atlanta and New York. This W is similar to most - trendy, loud music, young clientele, expensive drinks. I was upgraded to a \"fabulous\" room (1917) and the room was good size with an ample work desk, king size bed, and reasonably large bathroom. Bathroom lighting was good, but the shower was pretty average for a W (standard tub and shower head). I get spoiled with the large walk-in rain showers at the Atlanta W Midtown. The bed was very comfortable and I was mostly able to sleep well thanks to playing the iPod stereo while falling asleep. As other reviewers have commented, the L was right below my room and runs every few minutes late into the night and early in the morning. My room didn't shake but it was indeed loud enough to awaken me in the morning. I am a pretty heavy sleeper so this didn't bother me too much, but if you are a light sleeper I would consider a different hotel. I ate room service breakfast and it was delivered right on time and was very good, though expensive (bowl of oatmeal, berries, and OJ = $24). Lunch in the restaurant was also very good. Drinks at the bar are pricey but typical for an upscale hotel in the city. Housekeeping did a nice job making up the room and the rest of the service staff were very helpful and friendly. The hotel is about 5 blocks from the Art Institute and there are several good restaurants within walking distance and a good pub 2 blocks away. The famous Berghoff Restaurant in 3 blocks away and a good place for lunch. There is not much in the way of evening entertainment that I found near the hotel. Whereas many W Hotels tend to be a gathering place and attract a good party crowd, that is not the case here. Except for the lobby music, this W is pretty quiet in the evenings.

I was plus one for the Clear VIP party with Kanye and T-Pain Saturday night @ Le passage and I stayed in, i didn't want to leave my room under any circumstance and consequently missed one of the biggest parties of the year in Chicago.

He has favorite restaurants and hotels but usually stays at the Trump. We are Starwood members so decided to try out the W for my first visit as I as tagging along for the weekend. We arrived at the W to a tiny room but usually size doesn't bother us if the service is excellent and the bed is comfy. This room was clean and minimalist. The common areas and the lobby were fantastic and the location is certainly good for touristy stuff. The Sears tower is across the street, Michigan Avenue is not a far walk and our favorite restaurants were a quick cab ride away. We spent our wedding night at a W in Manhattan (Union Square) and had a fantastic time. We weren't even paying for our room on the wedding night and were treated like royalty. Overall the Chicago CIty Center W seems to not have a clue about service. The front desk told us we could use pts for the weekend nights but upon checkout changed their mind. I ordered yogurt and coffee from room service on Saturday. After 1.5 hours they called to apologize for the delay. I was nice but assumed that since yogurt didn't need to be cooked they would send it up immediately. Another 30 mins went by so I called to cancel as we did not plan spending Saturday in our tiny hotel room. I got in the shower and as I was standing in a towel Room Service arrived with the \"cancelled\" order 2.5 hours after the order was placed. It was 2.5 hrs. late and they still wanted to charge us $38 for yogurt and coffee. The food was eventually comped but it seemed awfully over complicated for such a simple order. Sunday morning my husband went down to the lobby to obtain 2 cups of the W complimentary coffee that they offer at their lobby until 10:00 a.m. There were no cups so my husband asked a man behind the bar to find some as the complimentary coffee was ending soon. After waiting 10 minutes and asking 2 different people for cups, the original man returned and started cleaning up and dumping the coffee. My husband reminded him of his request for cups and but was shunned. He eventually went back and got cups but not without attitude. By the way there is no wireless and the connection is $30/day for their network. This was annoying. Overall the service was lacking for a W property. We had a decent stay but my expectations were higher and friends who were at other hotels near by for much less money had a better experience. The pros are the location, lobby bartenders, and the gym. Other than that I would not go back to this W location. Perhaps I'll do some reading about the other W property on N.

One peeve-at check in they told me internet was not included in the room rate. I went to my room and called SP member hotline, where I had booked, and they told me it was. So, I called back the front desk and the staff confirmed it was, so I signed on for the 3 day package. They told me it would be removed from my bill at check in.

Due to previous Hotwire hotel experiences, we had pretty low expectations. However, from the moment we arrived, we were treated fantastic by the staff at the W. The lobby, beautifully decorated to feel like a relaxing lounge, set the feel for the stay. The front desk staff and concierge was enthusiastic and went out of their way to be accommodating. Our room was located on the 7th floor and had a very European feel to it (small). There was just enough room for the bed, an improvised \"built into the wall\" couch as well as a desk, and just enough room in the bathroom for one person at a time. Even though the room was small, it was comfortable and nicely decorated. The only noticeable distraction was the sound of the L trains at street level, which sounded more like heavy rain. My partner and I spent most of our first evening in Chicago exploring the city. We returned to the hotel at around midnight absolutely exhausted and ready for a good night sleep. When we first entered the hotel, we were taken aback by the nightlife. Apparently, the hotel was hosting some sort of party in the lobby complete with a DJ. We made our way up to our room and collapsed on the bed. As we rested, we could clearly hear the loud music from the party enen though we were 7 floors above it. Cups on the nightstand and a mirrored wall were vibrating to the beat of the obnoxiously loud music. I called the concierge to inquire as to when the party would end and she told me 2am- another two hours! She said other guest had complained and she would report our complaint to the manager. Another 15 minutes, the music was still quite audible and walls still vibrating. My partner headed down to speak to the front desk. He returned five minutes later to tell me we were being moved up to the 19th floor. 20 minutes later, we were resting comfortably and most importantly -quietly- in our upgraded room. Kudos to the W for great customer service and correcting what could have been a very unpleasant night. The upgraded room on the 19th floor was very spacious and the bathroom was quite sizable.

My only true disappointment was that my room was incredibly small. I barely had enough room to walk around the bed and the distance from the desk to the bed was about 2 feet. The bathroom was not as small as some may have alluded to on this website, but I would have appreciated a bit more counter space. Love the Bliss toiletries! And the towels are nice and fluffy, and I really appreciated the nice comfy robe! While the large screen HDTV was great, watching it from the bed was difficult as it was located above the desk on the left side of the bed. Also, sitting at the desk, I got a neck ache from watching the tv. It would have been better to have it located on the wall across from the bed. I too had a window looking out into a courtyard area, so I kept my blinds closed at all times. The smallness of the room made me a bit claustrophobic as I also had work to complete while staying there. I do wish there had been a coffeemaker already in the room, but I'm not sure where it would have been placed. There was not a lot of room on the desk to place another item. The bed was extremely comfortable and the faux fur throw was a lovely touch.

Even the maids were extremely friendly as was the maintenance staff. The ambiance of the entire hotel is very chic, and I just wish my husband could have enjoyed this stay with me. While some may complain about the cost of valet parking and parking in general, it's downtown Chicago.

I loved the Acura experience. It was very nice to be worry free on the way to our show. The driver was very accommodating (even when we forgot our tickets and had to go back). The vehicle was very nice. The bartender in the Living Room bar was a bit aloof and not very friendly, but we had heard there was some personnel changes going on that may have been making a few employees unhappy. The lobby area was beautiful and had a lively crowd. The best part of our stay was our dinner at Restaurant We. The hostess and the manager were both very friendly and accommodating. Our server James made our night. He was so much fun. He really seems to enjoy his job and his guests. I am vegetarian and he helped guide me around the menu. I always like to see more vegetarian entree options and a vegan option would be outstanding. James had great suggestions about things to do in the city. We told him we were going to see the Jersey Boys. He gave us some great suggestions on where to go after the show. When we returned to our room, James had arranged a very thoughtful and wonderful surprise for us. We found some champagne, some unbelievably delicious chocolate truffles, and a hard cover Jersey Boys book. This was a special touch that both my friend and I will always remember. I worked in the hotel/restaurant industry for years. I'm not always one to give glowing reviews because my expectations are high. Please make sure you do all you can to keep James on board. He is an outstanding asset to your hotel. We enjoyed the hotel amenities, and I would return to the restaurant solely for the great service. The property is excellent.

I told her that it has been horrible since AM and then she offers a coupon for taking a shower in a nearby Gym. Nice!. First of all, I wish the W gave me this option 3 hours ago . Second, still the total non-apologetic tone of the receptionist - put me off. I travel to Chitown quite a bit -but this hotel is OFF my list.

We were so tired from walking around Chicago one night we decided to try out the restaurant downstairs, \"we\", and were even more unimpressed. There were only 2 other couples in the restaurant which should have been a huge sign to us, but we decided to sit down anyway. The waiter was unattentive and kept forgetting things, including on 2 separate occasions a drink order and the side we ordered with our meal. When the side was finally delivered, 10 minutes later, it was cold and in a tiny dish (and they wanted $8 for it). Then he charged our credit card the wrong amount - twice. Overall a very disappointing dinner. We asked for late check out the day we were leaving - a Monday when the hotel was a ghost town - and were told the W only offers that services for Platinum members and we would need to pay another $75 additional to have late check out.

I wasn't travelling alone, I had my 100+ lb. German Shepherd K-9 and two cats in the vehicle with me.

The fact that the dog in question is an impeccably trained and housebroken military K-9 made no difference whatsoever. Just as I was about to give up, and resign myself to either driving straight through, or pulling over at a rest stop and sleeping in my SUV, I made one final call to the W City Center Chicago and told them the size of the dog in question. Even though W has a size restriction as well, they were quite willing to accept the dog as a guest as well, and on my arrival, I was greeted by two members of the bell staff who assisted in unloading my necessary baggage, including two somewhat annoyed cats who had just spent 12 hours in travel carriers. The front desk staff expedited my check in, and when I arrived in my room, I was greeted by a welcoming note from the management staff, and a complimentary bottle of red wine, in addition to a dog bed, and treats for the dog and cats!

Also, it was tiny. It could not have been more that 120 square feet. There was a small shower and a bathroom with no place to put toiletries. A waste can has no home and nearly blocks the toilet. They call this a \"Wonderful Room\". I would disagree. This is a room for a business person traveling alone who will need use of a desk but not a relaxing chair to kick back in (as it had none). I called to explain to the front desk that this room was not to my satisfaction and is not what I booked or anticipated. I was told I could upgrade for $70 extra per night. Finally, after going down to the front desk and speaking with Justin (this is all around 12:30am), he took care of the problem and immediately offered to move me to a new room. He had obviously heard this complaint before. The new room was possibly twice the size. The beds are comfortable and the bedding and pillows are very nice. The style is contemporary with clean lines. Plenty of lighting by the bed for reading. Bed lights up from below as well - with LED lights. The fixtures are nice and there are 2 layered roman shades. One shade allows you to see out of the window but distorts the incoming view. The other shade blocks the light. Nicely done. The TV's are very large and there are plenty of outlets to plug in items on the desk. There is a charge for wireless internet. Be careful on the Fiji Water at $8.00 per bottle. The bathroom has plenty of towels, good lighting, and amenities (shampoo, body lotion - all by Bliss). The lounge offered nice choices and good service. The concierge could have improved in the friendliness category. The bell service was very good as were rest of the staff when asked for help. When booking this hotel, be sure to check the room size.

Go there expecting a happening nightlife scene in the lobby, and dark lit hallways. Not a child-friendly atmosphere. The lobby has a great bar/lounge that gets pretty packed after work and on the weekends. They offer free flavored water and fruits in various parts of the hotel (lobby, fitness center, business center, etc.) The service is impeccable. Everybody is ready & willing to help with anything you want. They really live up to their \"whatever/whenever\" motto. The front desk is super friendly and accomadating and the consierge could not have been more helpful. He personally called us to give us reccomendations for dinner/nightlife based on the other places we had been & liked. Great service! Another great perk is the free Acura service the hotel offers for destinations within a 5 mile radius. You just book a time in advance and have a brand new Acura take you to your destination (from 12PM-8PM i believe) and save money on cab fare! But if you do need to take a cab you will have no problem getting one right outside the hotel doors. And the hotel is also incredibly convenient to the El since it's in the loop. Easy walking distance to ALL train lines. The rooms are spacious (at least the room with 2 double beds is, i remember staying the last time in a king size room and it being semi-small) and beautifully decorated. The beds and pillows are so comfortable. The bathrooms are nice and the Bliss Spa products are GREAT. I really have no complaints about the rooms at all. All and all I'm glad I stayed here for the 2nd time and will likely stay here again the next time I visit Chicago.

I am always amazed by how this place (and other W hotels) evoke such vehemently negative reviews from some people. I try to find some of the things that people write that they find so annoying, but I just can't - I find this place to be so awesome, I'm always impressed. For this visit: Arrival - I arrived on an early morning flight to Chicago and took the CTA train from O'Hare to downtown Chicago - an easy trip as I don't carry a lot of luggage. Exited the blue line subway and walked about 2 blocks to the W City Center. The first impression of the Living Room (lobby) and Welcome Desk (registration) is so serene and cool - I find it really relaning (can't beleive that others find it frenetic). It's so stylishing lit with elements of repeating circles (like water droplets, small mirrors, marble cut floors , curved seating pieces)- the mixing of modern design with the traditional architectual elements of the building come off as a wonderful assemblage. The welcome desk agent was very friendly and efficient. To my delight, I was able to get into my room right away - even thouh I was 5 hours prior to check-in time - Yeaht! My SPG membership was acknowledged and I was told that they were glad to have me return here again. Elevators smell so good and have a wonderful modern art assemblage within. My room was on the 15th floor overlooking interior courtyard (I asked for a quiet room) - overlooking the courtyard reduces the urban noise and the ambient noise from the nearby L trains. Room My room was spacious, decor was very cool, modern, with a cool minimalist vibe. Everything was spotlessly clean and was in order. At this time, most of the lower floors are closed for renovation, but redone floors are opening up for occupancy every week. I saw one of the newly opened floors - totally rehabed (not just surface rehab, but new everything) - a much brighter palette of white for these floors (but still looks hip and minimalist). Looks very nice, but I still love the older (noir) W look as well. Did my unpacking - nice spacious closet and plenty of drawer space - everything looks better in the W space! Bathroom was huge - and love the Bliss toiletries, I buy them for use at home. Then I left the hotel to enjoy a full day out in the city. For rest of my stay, room was always cleaned well and linens/toiletries replaced. I never heard any noise all weekend - the bed and the bathrobe was wonderfully comfortable! Amenities: Used the \"Sweat\" Fitness Center - great equipment, and sparkling clean, well-maintained. I had a nightime drink and Hummus snack in the Living Room lounge, which was pretty deserted for the Easter weekend, but nevertheless - it's was still so much fun just to relax here and I loved the cocktail that I had - lots of interesting drinks to try on the menu. Had a lovely breakfast at the We restaurant - service was friendly and efficient. All staff that I encountered - servers, concierge, stylists (housekeeping), doormen, everyone was great - seemed genuinely friendly and eager to please. I asked for and was cheerfully given a late check-out (another benefit for SPG membership.) This allowed me to have another full day in the city before heading home. Only glitches to an otherwise perfect stay: 1) Requested turndown service and it was never done - not a big deal, just a minor disappointment. 2) Bill folio that was slid under my door in morning prior to checkout charged me a higher room rate than I reserved and confirmed at check-in. I brought this to attention of the Welcome Desk and it was corrected right away with an apology - no hassle. The correct amount was billed to my account the day after check-out. I have always enjoyed this hotel and this stay reinforced my feelings. I look forward to returning again when the renovations are furhter along.

That is, until we got there... This hotel was amazing! Everyone from the valet people to the front desk help were incredibly polite and always smiling. Upon check-in, like a lot of other W guests, we were upgraded to a larger room. We stayed on the 16th floor and were amazed at the size of the room and the bathroom! Huge! We did hear the El, but let's be serious people: there is little that can be done about that! Wear earplugs! Lol.

We are a young, gay couple and we absolutely loved our time at the W! To combat some of the negative opinions: -Our bathroom was huge; nothing like having to sit with our legs at an angle with the counter pointing into our backs... -I feel like those who have complained about the darkness of the hotel have overreacted; yes, the lobby is dark with lots of ambient lighting and disco balls and awesome music but the rooms were like any other I've ever stayed in: the majority of the light came from two end-table lamps, one torchiere and one desk lamp. The bathroom had adequate over-the-sink lighting and two or three ceiling lights. -The bedroom was extremely clean. (PS - the BED is AMAZING! They really have something with the \"W Signature Bed\"!) Some positives no one has mentioned: -The toiletries are from Bliss! Body Butter, face wash, hand soap, etc. They are quality products and they smell great! -The TV was HUGE! LG LCD Flat screen... -They change out the welcome mats in the elevator to say \"Good Morning\" and \"Good Evening\" depending on the time of the day! (Hey, it's the small things that count...)

The food is decent, although does not meet expectations for a supposedly 4 star place. Although understaffed, the staff tried hard and is very friendly when you finally can get a hold of someone. It seemed all the staff were always smiling, friendly, genuinely apologizing for the poor service, and harried from running to put out one fire to the next.

The hotel is right on the El (solution: request a room \"facing inside\"). No biggie. It's just that the place feels tired. When I mentioned that to a staffer, he told me they have heard that from many visitors and the hotel is responding. He said they are about to begin a major overhaul of the entire place, including changing the design (think light and bright) and adding more rooms. That will be nice for the future, but for now if you're in the hunt for hotel chic, I suggest considering some other places. A specific example: The shower in our bathroom looked like it was made of institutional tile from the 1950s. It wasn't retro, just old and dismal. About the service: When I stayed here last November, I never opened the front door when I was entering the hotel. A staffer always saw me coming and opened the door. Certainly not required but a nice little touch. However on my most current visit, the front door people were often talking amongst themselves and rarely opened the door.

I booked their so called \"Sneakaway for a Summer Sleepover at W Hotel\" offer at $309 a night for 3 nights (July 13-16). I know that the room will be a bit small (they said ~230 sq ft) but the description said that it includes Breakfast, in-room Movie, wine-cooler sorbet and free access to the health club etc. etc. Although I had booked the Westin River North at $275 a night for a room twice the size (AAA rate), I decided to switch to the W Hotel because (1) their website shows really nice rooms and I thought it would be nice to try a W Hotel which I had never tried before, and (2) the package includes breakfast, which at Starwoods hotels usually would be about $25-30 anyways. Well that turned out to be a hotel from hell for me: 1) The room (#731) is barely a 200 sq ft, and the bathroom is so small that I have to turn sideways in order to access the toilet (and I am a small person). When I sit down, the toilet paper is right in my face (right side) and my left knee is touching the shower curtain. The carpet is dirty, and there are no drawers for cloths except for 3 small drawers in the night table by the bed. 2) When I checked in I was given some coupons for breakfast, drinks and so on. When I took a closer look, I discovered that the \"breakfast coupon\" is only for \"in room dining/breakfast\" (there was no mention of that in their website). Also I only got 2 coupons when I was staying for 3 nights. So the next day I went to see the front desk and asked for a third coupon. The staff (and then the manager) told me that I should not have gotten the second coupon in the first place: the package is ONLY for ONE breakfast for the entire stay. I said: if the package says \"free hotel parking\" does it mean that it is only for 1 night? or free access to the health club is it only for one night? After much exchange he finally gave me a third coupon. At the time I did not have access to look at what the website said and so I thought it merely says \"breakfast\" - still \"breakfast\" would mean daily breakfast. If they do mean ONE breakfast for the entire stay they should be up-front and mention that. After I got home I checked into their ad again and viola! it said explicitly \"daily breakfast\" http://www.welcometowhotels.com/sleepawaycamp/?IM=SOP_top_WH_WCAMP 3)To add insult to injury: the coupon is for \"breakfast for 2 people\" up to a maximum of $20 - for in-room dining. Their smallest coffee size is a carafe which is $10, pastry is $5, delivery charge $3.75 and service charge $3.56 for a grand total of $24.83. The pastry turned out to be ONE danish. So I wonder how can they even say that it is breakfast for 2 people for $20 - unless they expect 2 people to share one danish pastry. Even though I stayed there by myself, I still had to pay the extra $4.83, the amount over the $20 allowance. How can a hotel advertise \"daily breakfast included\" when one still has to pay???? 4) When I couldn't access their wireless internet in my room I called their help desk: first they transferred me to the IT help line which put me on hold for 10 mins so I hanged up. Called the help desk again, and they said they would send someone to my room to help me. Well it turned out that this was a hotel maintenance guy who knows nothing about computer. He said he was there to make sure that I had my PC plugged in correctly!! Finally I got through to their help line, and the person who answered told me that their wireless network does not support Linus platform. he could not send someone to my room or work on my PC because he is not in the hotel - that the support is outsourced! So I said fine and stopped using the PC at the hotel. On the day before I cheked out I ran into a fellow in the elevator typing away on his notebook computer. I commented to him that I could not log onto the network. he said that's odd, becasue he IS the IT manager at the hotel and he could check that right away for me. Well I was on my way out to dinner, on the last day, so what good is it for me to use my PC when I only have one more night to stay there??? 5) Staff attitude: well the help line staff and the doormen were very nice and courteous. But some staff at the concierge and the reception desk are not. One case in point: the final bill incuded an item \"mini- pak\" of ~$34 which I never used. When I checked out I said I had not charged anything called a mini-pak and it souned like some snack in the room bar. I said that if I had used it I would have remembered. The staff replied \"well, even a bottle of our water is $10 so $34 is not that much\". I held my tongue instead of saying \"if a person is silly enough to spend $10 on bottled water, he/she should be reborn in their next life in a third world country!\". When I asked a concierge how far is the restaurant that I wanted to try, and whether it is \"within walking distance\", he said \"everything is within walking distance\". A more courteous staff would say \"it is about xxx minutes walking\", or \"it may be bettr to take a cab because it may take you about 45 minutes to walk there\" Normally I do not like posting negative messages on travel sites. A good customer should always talk to the establishment first and give them the chance to correct their mistakes. In this case I have talked to their manager. Their \"survey\" is going back to their downtown hotel, rather than to W Hotel headquarter so I believe the so-called survey is useless. If anyone knows how can I get this message to W Hotel - higher up than the managers who hang out at the reception desk, please let me know.", "Date": "July 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cFabulous!\u201d", "Author": "TheKatt", "ReviewID": "UR17519341", "Content": "Fabulous property.... stayed 5 nights and loved this hotel.

The apparent answer: puce and gray decor, young and edgy-looking desk help and mini-bars that offer baseball caps and \"intimacy kits.\" Ah, progress. It would be more fun were it not so transparently contrived. But then, I am undoubtedly more curmudgeon than cool and edgy. The W City Center has its plusses and minuses. On the plus side, the location is excellent if business takes you to the city center area. The rooms, though quite small, are comfortable for a solo traveler. The bedding is first rate. The iPod ports are a nice touch. The staff is young and enthusiastic and tries hard to please. The building is an architectural gem, with exceptionally nice lobby features somewhat obscured by poor lighting. The lobby bar is a nice place for an evening cocktail or morning coffee. Minuses? For starters, puce and dark gray are maintenance nightmares: every mistake with a service cart leaves a noticeable plaster ding on a wall; every laundering error creates fade marks and stains on comforters that began life in purple but are fading to maroon. The result is that new stuff becomes old stuff quickly, and W doesn't seem inclined or equipped to do much about it, and so the rooms and corridors look more beat up than they should. It didn't help that the remote for the nice big screen tv didn't work. The youth and enthusiasm of staff is pleasant, but has the down-side of inexperience and lack of training. Hence, the concierge, asked to obtain men's dress shirts to remedy a clothing emergency, did not know the conventions of men's shirt sizing (i.e., that 15 1/2 by 34 means collar circumference and sleeve length, in inches), and the doormen didn't know how to locate a street address just a few blocks away. And here's news - - if W's brand identity is cool and edgy, why is USA Today the only free daily paper? I suspect cool and edgy types would prefer the local paper (and Chicago's is better than most) so they could find out what was going on in that toddlin' town. In terms of value for the price, the W stacks up relatively poorly against the competition - - the week before, I paid somewhat less to stay at the far superior Sofitel Water Tower.

Walked into the room - no desk and the tv cabinet/mini-bar/dresser unit was inches from the front corner of the bed so you had to turn sideways it get to the window or climb over the bed. No glass door shower. No chair. Furniture with peeling, scraped veneer. Room was about as big as my wife's walk-in closet. I called the welcome desk to ask for a change. Was called back by \"Guest Service\" and told no rooms were available, but after I continued to complain he said he would check. He called back five minutes later and said no rooms were available and the hotel was fully booked. (A lie) I asked as it was only 5:30 PM had everyone checked in and he said yes (another obvious lie). He said he could upgrade me for $1,500!! When I protested he offered me a free breakfast. As I declined as I was attending a meeting, he said would look again. While I waited, I paced off the room and measured it at 160 sq.ft. including bathroom, closet, windowsill, etc. Also called the Starwood Hotels 800 Reservation number (W is a Starwood Hotel) and was told there were rooms available at all price points that night. As no callback came in 5 minutes I called the welcome desk again and asked for the manager. I told the Welcome Desk attendant what the problem was. I was called back by another \"guest service\" person who told me the hotel was \"fully committed\" and there were no rooms. He would not define \"fully committed\". When I complained that the staff was rude he argued with me and said as he had not spoken to me yet he could not have been rude. Told him that there were rooms available (he said the 800 number was overselling the hotel) and that the room didn't meet the standards of the room I booked. He said he would look again. Finally got a callback after a total of a wasted half-hour and was moved to another \"Wonderful Room\".

This was, by far, the smallest room I've ever stayed in. There was so little space between the bed and the desk that, if you want to pass by, you have to push the chair in AND walk sideways. There was so little room on the floor - the only place to put your suitcase was in the small closet. If you have more than one suitcase, good luck.

Very small bathroom. It was so small I knocked toiletries off the counter while putting a robe on. The sink basin itself was so small that, while washing my face, much of the water went onto the sink counter. If two of you need to get ready, good luck. 3. Terrible room service food. My husband's burger was very mediocre. The fries were soggy. My steak sandwich was rubbery, and the bread was like cardboard. There is a McDonald's down the block and a Starbucks and Seven Eleven around the corner - those are your better bets for quick meals and snacks and inexpensive sodas. 4.

Because we had stayed at W in San Francisco last year and loved it, she was anxious to stay at the W again. A week or so before we went to Chicago, we received our credit card bill to find that the W had already charged over $600 to our credit card. When we arrived at the W, my wife pointed out that we had already been charged for $600 for our room. The desk clerk argued that we had not been charged but maybe only had \"a hold placed\". It was only after we presented a copy of the credit card statement and she disappeared into a back room did she agree that we had already paid $600. One of the first things the desk clerk said to us was to ask if we wanted to upgrade to a larger room. We declined thinking that a $300 a night room should be adequate. This turned out to be the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in. Everyone knows how small the bathrooms are on cruise ships. The bathroom we had on our last cruise which happened to be an interior room not one of the top of the ship rooms, was bigger than the W 's bathroom. I counted the floor tiles. The sink was smaller than my bar sink at home. There was about an inch or two on each side of the sink to try to balance anything you tried to put down. You had to close the lid of the toilet to reach the flush lever. The only drawer space in the room were three small drawers in the night stand. The carpet was dirty. Of course it is very hard to see anything because it was so dark in the room. One lamp had a fairly decent light but the other lamp--the one on the desk--if it was a 40 watt bulb, I would be surprised. I tried to use the DVD player provided in the room but it was so dark in that corner that I could not see the controls. On Sunday, I asked the concierge for recommendations for dinner. He suggested we eat at the restaurant in the hotel. Later when we were ready for dinner, we found that the restaurant is not open on Sundays. On the positive, the lobby area is very nice, very hip with projections on the walls above the two giant archways. W always has a nice smell.

Quite honestly, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even know where to begin. Every year, the second week in December my husband plans a downtown weekend for my birthday, which he has done for several years. This includes a minimum two-night stay, dinner and the theater. We live in the suburbs and love spending the weekend in the city. We enjoy shopping, holiday decorations and because of my birthday so close to the holiday, my husband takes special care to make it memorable. To date, we both immensely enjoy the weekend. All except this last birthday at the W Hotel City Center. I will highlight the less desirable incidents as I feel awful that my birthday celebration was such a disappointment. December 14, 2007 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Upon arrival in the room, we had to turn the thermostat up because the room was freezing, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean cold and uncomfortable but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153see your breath\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd freezing. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2The bed was not a standard king, which was stated and the room extremely small. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2The sheet had a large stain which I am going to say was blood at the head of the bed between the pillows. I called the front desk immediately and let them know that we had reservations downstairs at the hotel restaurant at 7:15 p.m. and they could change the sheets while we were at dinner. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2We had dinner at the hotel restaurant (Ristorante We). Absolutely the worst service of any restaurant that we have been to and the food was mediocre at best. From the time we were seated, it took 10 minutes to get a glass of water and my husband had to wave someone down to ask for bread. It took another 10 minutes for the waiter to take our order. As we had plenty of time to look at the menu we ordered the appetizer and entr\u00c3\u00a9e initially. It took 25 minutes to receive our appetizer. At that point, we were in the restaurant 45 minutes before receiving an appetizer! The entr\u00c3\u00a9e arrived in another 20 minutes. My husband insisted we order a dessert, I told him that I was unwilling to wait 45 minutes for dessert but he insisted that it was my \u00e2\u20ac\u0153birthday weekend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and he was equally upset with everything, but remained optimistic determined to have a good time. We ordered dessert. Not only did it 30 minutes to get to us, the order was wrong. My cr\u00c3\u00a8me brulee was chocolate cake and then the waiter was indignant when I said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t order this\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He said that he would put in the order for cr\u00c3\u00a8me brulee. At that point, the tears started and I asked my husband for the key to our room and waiting another 30 minutes for my dessert was simply absurd. I left the restaurant and waited in the lobby until he was finished with the bill. We he left the restaurant, he then said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153you will NEVER believe this\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, not only did he not remove the incorrect dessert from the bill, he haggled me when I told him that it needed removed from the bill and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even ask him to remove the dessert that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat. My husband said, which even surprised me, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153today is the first day in my entire life that I left NO tip, though the service was lousy until he hassled me about the dessert, I had every intention of leaving a tip. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2After that horrible experience, we return to the room only to find the sheets had not been changed. I told my husband that I have had enough of the W hotel and I was going to take a long shower, while he took a shot at getting some clean sheets. Sometime after 10 p.m. the sheets where finally changed. December 15 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 8:00 a.m. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2We left the hotel to go downtown to shop (bought new fleece pajama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the room was so cold) and returned to our hotel at 3:30 p.m. to get ready for our 5:00 p.m. reservations at Everest then to the theater for Jersey Boys \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Time was of the essence. It had begun to snow so we needed to leave by 4:30 p.m. Upon returning, our room had not been touched, we where gone all day and no one had cleaned the room. The cleaning lady showed up a 3:45 p.m. to clean our room, so we went downstairs to have a drink while our room was cleaned. At that point, my husband apologized for picking such a horrible hotel for my birthday. He said he was ashamed of himself for not doing more research and picked the room from a website because it had a contemporary eclectic style. He felt awful and I felt bad for him and bad that we were stuck there for another night. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2With 4+ inches of snow that we had overnight, the room was freezing when we returned. We thought the cleaning lady had set the thermostat back down, but we discovered she had not. We turned the heat up for the second night in a row. December 16 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Packing up to leave the room, in adjusting the blinds and drapes realize the window was OPEN. The window was open about an inch and would not close no matter how hard we tried, it was broken open. Which explained why the sounds of the city kept us up every night. My husband has apologized with shame countless times, and ends with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I just wanted you to have a great birthday.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t your motto - Whatever, whenever? Based on the service we received, it sure didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like it to us.

The location is great - only about 4 blocks to the Art Institute, restaurants and the Mag Mile. The bed was AWESOME. We had all intentions of getting up early and going to the museums but couldn't drag ourselves out until 10:30! Our only issue was a couple of nasty servers in the bar on Friday night. No big deal really, we just avoided them.

I wrote a review on this website about Hotel Costa Verde in Costa Rica and tore it to shreds..I have no problem being honest. Honestly, I was impressed with the W. It's a 4 star hotel that I payed 150.00 bucks for using priceline. I was able to check in early, and was treated like royalty. The young lady who checked me in (Helen) was extremely polite and fast. She offered me an upgrade to the \"courtyard view\" but was very fast to tell me that there is no view, it's just a bigger bed. She also said that it's quiter in that part of the Hotel due to the train. The lobby was kept up nice and had some decent techno/trance playing in the lobby. A far cry from \"obnoxious\" which is how another writer described it. In fact it's very low key and in the backround. Not loud at all. The room, 612, was exactly what I would expect @ 150.00. A small bathroom yes, but the room itself was fine. Very comfortable bed, big enough TV and very neatly decorated. Very modern and sleek. There was some music playing on the CD player when we entered the room. My wife didnt care for it, so we turned it off. It was that easy! My wife commented on the deoderizer they used in the room. It smelled goood but was indeed strong. Checkout went smooth. My wife and expect a lot, and were hesitant to even walk into the Hotel after reading the reviews on this website.

Indeed, the rate seems low, taking into account the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s level of service (far surpassing what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve experienced at Ritz-Carlton/Four Seasons) and its remarkable style, typified by the title of the CD in each room: The Warmth of Cool. My ultra-speedy checkout exemplified the near-clairvoyant service that anticipated my needs again and again. Despite the early hour (5 am), the clerk was right there at the desk. He drew my attention to the part of the bill where I was going to look. When he saw my bags, he asked right away about a taxi. By the time I left his desk, a taxi was already at the door and my bags were being loaded. Outstanding service was everywhere I turned. The clerk at the gift shop took the time to play and discuss CDs on sale. When I returned to the gift shop, another clerk remembered my interest in the toiletries\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe W stocks Bliss products, good enough that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve bought a supply for home use. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hip but welcoming style is there as you walk in the door and notice a special scent and a set of flower arrangements unlike anything I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d seen elsewhere. The lobby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s architecture is a sort of neoclassical style, but with low lighting (candles near the front desk computer terminals help the clerks read) and with abstract multicolored, changing designs projected on the walls. My room was small but it seemed snug rather than cramped. A limited palette gave it a comforting feel, and storage was abundant\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddrawers in each nightstand and in the closet, which also had a hanging cloth storage rack. One day I found a complimentary bottle of water, in an attractive Voss container. Even the business center (conveniently located just off the lobby) is stylish, dominated\u00e2\u20ac\u201das you might expect\u00e2\u20ac\u201dby Apple computers. There was no charge for me to use one to look up my return flight and print out my boarding pass. For me, the location worked out well. Only one hotel is near McCormick Place; most meeting-goers must rely on the meeting bus system, as I did. The hotel is barely a block from the Quincy elevated train (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153L\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) station. From landing at Midway Airport (and then retrieving checked luggage) to the hotel via Orange Line took me only an hour. The Quincy station has a lot of steps, a narrow turnstile, and no elevators that I saw\u00e2\u20ac\u201dso it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a good choice for those with a lot of luggage. I could use the L to travel elsewhere in Chicago, and taxi rides to many of the top restaurants are not long. From my room, I occasionally heard the roar of the L trains. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disturb my sleep (in a very comfortable bed), but it might bother others. The hotel is in the financial district, with little activity after 5 pm; some might prefer a hotel in the shopping-oriented Magnificent Mile of North Michigan Avenue. (Keep in mind that there is another W Hotel in Chicago, the W Lakeshore, in a completely different location.) Almost adjacent to the hotel are a McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, a Starbucks, and a Walgreen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut the Walgreen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closes at 7 pm. The W is not for the fussy. My CD player tended to skip when I closed a drawer in the nightstand on which it rested. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a DVD player that was easy to use, but the tv is not flat screen. An outlet in the lamp made it easy to plug in my computer, but I needed an adapter to use that single outlet to recharge both my Palm and my cell phone simultaneously. The desk was roomy, but there were a couple scuffs. An orange-brown spot\u00e2\u20ac\u201dperhaps a patch\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwas evident in the tub. One of the light switches at the door didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to operate anything. I reported this to the desk. A day later, it still didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to operate anything, but a ceiling light in the bathroom (previously nonfunctional) was on (and I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t figure out how to turn it off). The view was nothing but gray building walls. The fitness center has aerobic equipment with individual televisions and headphones, but the view is just the walls of the adjacent building. If I return to Chicago for a stay where the location makes sense and my budget can handle the rate, the W City Center\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s utterly extraordinary level of service and unparalleled style will put it on top of my list.", "Date": "September 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reno, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cPriceline's BIG MISTAKE\u201d", "Author": "jma52", "ReviewID": "UR8749164", "Content": "I got a very cheap rate off priceline.com for this place.

There are beautiful flowers and candles everywhere as well as a very cool video show that is shot from a projector onto the massive walls. In the lobby, every detail is cared for perfectly. When you enter, a mat outside the hotel welcomes you with the specific time of day (i.e. Good morning in the morning) and the mat is changed in the evening to say Good Evening. Upon check-in we were offered a cocktail almost immediately, which I found unique. At check in we were advised that our room (booked through Priceline) contained one full size bed and that in order for the room to sleep the two grown men sharing it, we woudl need to pay an upgrade fee of $70 a night. Come on, who would expect two buddy's on a football cavation to stay in the same bed. The front dest clerk was wearing a suit jacket with what appeared to be a dirty Nike t-shirt underneath. We proceeded to the upgraded room and it was fine, but nothing special. I suppose teh PRiceline room was previously a closet based on the upgraded room size. The hotel is conveniently located near the orange line L so transportatoin is easy. On night 2 of our stay, we went to the hotel bar about 12:30 a.m. or so. When we tried to order a drink, the snappy female bartender motioned her hand horizontally across her neck and shouted, \"we're done\". I asked the occsional W person floating around the room what time the lounge closed and he indicated 1:00 a.m. Not sure why you can't get a drink in 30 minutes but in any event, the cry of \"we're done\" is certainly less than welcoming.

For every task that they did well, there was an equal and opposite task that flopped. As a former frequent traveler I have stayed in many different hotels ranging from 3 stars to 5 stars. And, lately, I have been having good, solid experiences booking 4 star hotels for my leisure trips through priceline, but my stay at the W City Center in Chicago ended that string of luck.I had read many other reviews on this website before my trip and I felt like I had enough information to know what to expect, but I was wrong. I rated my experience at the W a \"2,\" but it was closer to a \"2.49\" and just like in math class, I rounded down. I am not sure what the exact criteria is for star ratings, but for service, the W City Centre is a solid \"3.5,\" but that's as good as it gets. My flight landed at Midway at about 9:30 am, so I took the Orange line and arrived at the hotel at around 11:00 am. I was expecting to check my luggage, but to my surprise I was able to check-in. And, according to them, they upgraded my bed from full to queen and gave me a courtyard view on the 11th floor, so that noise from the \"L\" wouldn't bother me. What a joke!!! My bed wasn't even a full, it was more like a double... maybe even a twin-and-a-half. My wife and I, who sleep in a King at home, were practically on top of each other. And the courtyard view, looked more like the view from a project in Brooklyn. And, I understand that the interior rooms in the hotel have no choice but to have a view like that, but please don't tell me it's an upgrade, when it really isn't. I would have rather heard the train and had a view of the outside world, than to feel like I was in prison. The room was tiny! After I learned was staying at the W, I looked it up and saw that the rooms were small, but the website doesn't do the room justice. There was exactly enough room to turn around, but that was about it. there was a lounge chair in the corner that was unecessary in that size room and the desk where one could use a laptop was at the foot of the bed. When you pulled the chair out to take a seat, it hit the foot of the bed, so you had to squeeze into the space between the desk and the chair. At 6'3\", 180 lbs, I'm not a huge man, but it was a feat for me to do that. The television was in a cabinet to the left of the bed, so I had to turn my head at an awkward angle to view it. And, the question that kept running through my mind was, \"If this is a 4 star hotel, where is the plasma TV?\" I have stayed at many other 4 star hotels in Chicago that have had plasma for years and if I remember correctly the W Lakeshore has plasma TV's in it's rooms. I liked the fact that there was a safe in the room for my valuables, it made me feel much more comfortable about leaving certain things in the room. But, it was a too small for my laptop. The bathroom was also very tiny, but it had a full-sized tub and a fantastic shower head. Also, the little Bliss sample products were great so I purchased full-sized versions. The toilet was extremely noisy, but I believe I figured out why. The flush was a little longer and stronger than a usual toilet, but I think it was so that all \"debris\" could be cleaned with one flush instead of possibly flushing more than once. I mean it's so loud, the flushing next door would wake my wife in the middle of the night. The service at the door was great, but it came in spurts. At one point there might be three gentlemen opening the door, but at others there might not be any, only the person that hails cabs for you and if your hands are full and he's busy, then you're stuck! I didn't see a handicapped button you can push to open it automatically. The location is decent. You're very close to the Orange and Brown line trains, two blocks from the Blue line and 4 or 5 blocks from the Red line. And, unless you're going out at midnight, like we did, there is usually a cab in the vicinity. Overall, this is not a 4 star hotel. You either have great service or none at all and I didn't appreciate being misled to think I was receiving some sort of benefit. I decided not to patronize the restaurant (Shikago) or bar (Whiskey Blue) because there are many other places in Chicago I'd rather spend my money. Please do your research.

The bonus is there were street vendors set up selling discount sunglasses (3for$20)and jewelry on the way. There was quite a bit of a walk from the hotel to see all the sites. The first day we walked from the hotel to Buckingham fountain, to Navy Pier, up the riverfront, down Michigan avenue and back to the W.. and since I was wearing my pedometer, I know that I walked 33,725 steps that day.

I've brought my child to hotels that are mostly for adults because he is well behaved and doesn't mind entertaining himself, it never before was a problem. The staff made it obvious that they didn't appreciate children being there and made it a point to not accomodate my interests regarding matters with my child (i.e. crib in the room, etc.). I found the staff to be totally incompetant and obstinate. I needed a new comforter because I spilled on the original one- it took EIGHT phone calls to get a new comforter. After the fourth call, I asked to speak with a member of management and it still took four more phone calls before I got the comforter and even then it wasn't the right size. I finally gave up. In the end, I waited over two hours for a replacement comforter. Moreover, if you are picky about cleanliness- beware; some may not be impressed with the level of cleanliness of this hotel.

The cab driver and I had to unload and juggle my luggage in the freezing cold as the first doorman I saw stood inside the all glass outer lobby doors 15 feet away and watched us. He was nice enough to open the door - staying inside - as I finally approached it. He did not open the second set of doors - two additional door staff just inside those doors smiled nicely, but didn't open those doors or offer to take my bags. Perhaps they were all just decorative to add to the \"club\" ambiance? Check-in was easy, and service throughout the rest of the stay was fine - friendly and professional. The lobby was dim and loud as I had expected - it's not particularly my style, but for a business district hotel, it had probably the liveliest social scene around. The hallways were ridiculously dim - possibly to hide the horrendously scuffed wallpaper? Where this hotel really redeemed itself was the room. It was a nice, medium size (not bad for a downtown business hotel at all), and was well-lit, well-furnished, comfortable and clean. The bathroom was quite large and nicely furnished, albeit with a public bathroom-style toilet. The linens were extremely nice, and the bed was very comfortable (if soft). The hotel is on the same block as the El, but the El wasn't loud enough to be annoying.

However, within a few short hours, I was ready to leave. Within 4 hours of checking in, after coming back from lunch and visiting the Art Institute, my partner and I walked in to our 12th Floor suite, only to discover that both of our computer bags and laptop and contents in each were gone. One bag was a Tumi computer briefcase, which had been a Christmas gift and this was the first time it was being used. There was no signs of forced entry, so obviously it was an inside job. I have stayed at lots of upper-tier hotels but never have I had a theft from my locked hotel room. Many times I have gone out and left my laptop opened up on the desk and housekeepers have cleaned around it. I was completely shocked, as you would not expect this from a $200 +/night hotel. This theft of two laptops and computer bags and other miscellaneous content topped $5,000. The first Security representative from the hotel that took our report was courteous, apologetic, and helpful. However, the Director of Security for the hotel didn't improve our perceptions of the hotel, as he explained in great detail that he was new to this hotel and he was having issues with his ID accessing the room key audit. He would then have to wait another day till management could get his ID reset, etc, etc. We certainly didn't feel safe and secure in a hotel where its Director of Security was having issues with his own ID. Salawi, the Night Mgr, was very accomodating, even lending us a laptop to use during our stay. Mr. Caramucci, the Operations Manager, did file a claim with their insurance and later we did get partial compensation for our loss. To begin with, even the representative for their insurance was very cold and unapologetic, after taking 3 days for her to call me back. She even tried to infer that it was our fault, since we had not locked our laptops in the hotel's safe. In this hotel, our laptops would not fit into the safe, much less an entire computer bag. When you are staying in a hotel especially one of this stature, you should have enough trust in their security, that you can leave a bag, while you are out of the room. Needless to say, I did not feel that my Starwood Platinum status was redeeming itself now. My comments about the hotel are rather consistent with the other reviews here. It is a nice lobby in terms of decor, but that is about it! You walk in and instantly you feel like you're in a nightclub(even at 8 AM) with techno music playing at all hours, a strobe light projecting images along the walls. To me, it is not a soothing and comfortable environment. Give me the Ritz Carlton anyday!! At nights, the lounge crowd consumes the entire lobby and you feel like you are in a reunion of drunk sorority sisters, all trying to out-talk and out-dress the other, making it impossible to carry on a conversation without having to scream at one another. The hallways are very dark and almost impossible to see in front of you. Even the rooms are dimly lit as well. One of my bathrooms was so dark, it was even frustrating to take a shower.

It seems as though they have some severe service/management/upkeep issues. The rooms are small--not \"hotel in the city\" small, but Times Square Hotel in the City Small. (The room 10' wide and was no more than 180 square feet). The bathroom was extremely tiny, as I sat on the toilet my foot had to rest on the metal doorstop. But that's the least of their problems. The shower didn't drain, and I didn't want to take a bath. So I ended up taking a shower in water that got to be over 6\" deep... My SO had to take a shower in my dirty shower water, and it never drained so the bathtub was probably over half full by the time all was said and done. I told the maid (who came and knocked on our door at 9, even though we were only staying one day and had requested a late check out--something a good hotel would make note of and not bother interrupting you over) but by then I had already showered and didn't care, and it sounded like it would be more hassle so we told her not to go get someone. Upon checkout they didn't do anything for our troubles. The bathroom didn't seem to have a fan, just a vent grate in the door... So there was little in the way of privacy there. There was a heater in the bathroom, but when turned on it made the place smell like a smokey bar, even though it was a non-smoking room we were in. There was no room service menu in our room, just a \"Dining In\" book... But then there was a Room Service button on our phone, so I'm pretty sure they did have regular room service. We ordered breakfast, it took 45 minutes to get our order, then it came and it wasn't correct. They serve potatoes but didn't bring ketchup. They serve toast but didn't bring BUTTER? How can room service not bring butter for toast? It was $48 for an omelet/potatoes/toast, 2 scrambled eggs/bacon/potatoes/toast, and one orange juice. And it wasn't even good, neither of us finished eating even half of it. The room wasn't wide enough to have the TV in front of the bed, it was off to the side and didn't really pull out/rotate so you could watch it head on... (BTW, someone else on here complained about it, but not having FOX News on their channel lineup is a good thing as far as I'm concerned.... ). If they really were as hip as they think they are, they could have easily put a flat panel TV on the wall in front of the bed... The lobby space is very architecturally pleasing; the hallways are filled with the wafting smell of gardenia, which I like.... I really like the design they have going on, it is very trendy and works well. They even found a way to make the drop ceiling in the room look really nice. The door man didn't bother to open the door for me as I was walking out, he just stood there watching... (maybe I'm being prissy, but he IS a door man, and he wasn't doing anything at the time, and he was standing right in front of the door). We were told wifi Internet was actually $25/day to use (which includes free calls, too... something I could care less about) not $15... Either way it's overpriced. The rooms were very loud. Every noise in the hallway, upstairs hotel room, adjacent room, outside cars, el, etc were heard. Parking is $38 which is high but is probably fairly average for hotel rates, even though garages in the area aren't more than $20/day. I'm never staying here again, and will highly recommend against it to anyone who asks. And if you do go, avoid room 609... As cute as it sounds, it's just bad news!

The room was small and even though it was away from the El trains was still very noisy. It was nicely refurbished but it was rather a thin veneer. If you take a look at the ceiling you can see that they have just painted the polystyrene tiles to match in. The TV Armoir took up the whole room and the TV reception was very poor.

Yes, the lobby and hallways are dark. We're talking VERY DARK! Anyone with vision problems does not want to navigate through this place!

But, we agreed the mattress was probably the most comfortable we've ever slept on (and if you simply \"must\" have one, there's a gift catelog where you can order anything in your room!). One of the window blinds didn't work and the cost of the in-room wireless connection was prohibitive, but we all agreed the room was pleasant. BUT, a couple major concerns: We had reserved two rooms and I confirmed it personally the night before. But when we arrived, they only had one room for us. After some tense moments, they gave us a handicap accessible room (much roomier than the other standard room but had a shower that flooded the bathroom floor), but it was located on the opposite side of the hotel from our friends. Disappointing. Do not eat in the restaurant unless you have lots of time and money. For both dinner and breakfast we were the only people in the dining room, but each meal took almost two hours. The food was good -- but very over-the-top and ghastly expensive. My small bowl of oatmeal at breakfast was $8.00!! A safety concern: Because this room only had one bed, we ordered a roll-away cot for our son. While my family went sightseeing, I laid down for a bit (I locked the door, but didn't bolt it). Suddenly, without a knock or a \"yoo hoo!\", the door burst open and an employee with the cot just walked right in! He was as shocked to see me curled up in bed as I was to see him! He apologised for not knocking (\"I didn't think anyone would be here\"), but it was scary! Yes, I should've bolted the door, but come on, management -- teach your people to knock!

We opted for a bottle of champagne, and first were given 5 chocolate draped strawberries. Thank you, thank you , thank you. My girl freind was in heaven, and what a perfect atmosphere to endulge. There are comfortable lounge couches, and couches in corners, that are very intimate. Lighting is low, but the music was just fine. Service was outstanding. Prices are about 12 per martini, and there is an extensive martini menu. Champagne is $120 to $425. You can also get bottle service for vodka, etc.Prices range from $250 to $700 a bottle. The back bar has King Louis at $200 a shot, but I find this higher than anywhere I have been. Usally goes for $150-170 range. However, the bottle at the bar was half full, so go figure. The elevators are plenty, and are very fast and easy to read numbers. The room access was easy , even with loaded hands. The rooms are a bit dated, small, but I found to be fine. There are dark painted walls, different framed bottles, cigar holders, etc on the walls. The mini bar is well stocked, and the bath is small, but it marble, but well appointed.The room has an iron and board, and a safe. The view we had was not the greatest, but spent most of the day out, and at night, we were out late and slept in. Didn't eat too much there, as we ate at a wonderful sushi rest. in town, called Japanis or Japoniv one of the two. Sorry for the spelling, however I don't recall the name well. That place was plain jamming! It was packed full of young, vibrant people, all still eating late into the night. Made reservations with our concierge, but the earliest we could get in was 9:30. It seemed perfect. I would recommend this hotel again, and am looking forward to trying more \"W\" hotels again. One more funny thing I noticed, was that the valet answered the phone, not as valet, but as wheels. I guess a play at the \"w\" theme seen throughout this hotel.

Two places I highly recommend for some great deals, and of course FRAGO mints. We ate at the \"WE\" restaurant and split an entree' which was no problem. Still had our own vegetable, rolls and I opted for a salad which was big enough to share. I had one after dinner drink and our bill was $70.

First - five bell staff standing around joking with each other, each more glamorous than the next, couldn't be bothered to get our bags, but they did spend a lot of time high-fiving attractive metrosexuals who walked by from the neighborhood. Check In - very nice front desk staff, but the clubby music was booming so loud that we couldn't hear her (at all), and she wasn't able to speak up - so we used hand gestures during most of our check-in conversation. Lobby - is truly spectacular deco architecture with interesting gobo's and light shows layered on top of it. First room - was so small we called down to the front desk and told them we thought we were in an Edgar Allen Poe novel. I literally had a panic attack of claustrophobia. What designer in their right mind would paint the walls of a 10 x 10 room brown and black, and the 9' ceiling black? We did NOT book through expedia or a discount broker, we booked through the Starwood.com site, and I expect that when a room is bizarrely small, the square footage should be listed so the customer can make an informed choice. Front desk moved us right away, and charming and cheerful bellman zipped upstairs to help us. We were moved into a much larger room - but still with the hideous dark paint and chic but incompetently designed lighting. Things that worked: amazing bed and linens, fantastic room service staff, high end bath amenities. Wonderful shower heads. Free, nice coffee in the lobby in the a.m. with convenient to-go cups. Things that were just plain stupid: no phone book or reference materials in the room - you have to call the help line for EVERYTHING. Extra toilet paper is in the hall closet - duh, do you think that's a convenient place when you need it? No hook in the chic bathroom so you have to put your robe down on a wet countertop - not so glamorous. NO VENTILATION IN THE BATHROOM - how romantic it is NOT to have bathroom smells wafting through the room. Most of the furniture was Pottery Barn esque painted the oppressive black. Very difficult to manage temperature in the room - the whole system is centralized and there's no individual control. Overall, Kimpton hotels are just as stylish but much more intelligently designed to actually function and not just look good. My advice - if you need to sleep this stylishly, go to a Kimpton.

To this add: a heat register that made so much noise as to make sleeping difficult, a wall mirror which had apparently come off of its mounting, and just leaned against the wall, an inoperable phone (probably to prevent complaints). I really can't imagine where we would have put our luggage. Needless to say, we went down to the desk to make other arrangements. We were offered a couple of extra cost upgrades.

We slept with the heat off, and the window open, and we were still warm. There was no hair dryer in the room. A phone call to housekeeping and 20 minutes produced a hair dryer which didn't work. We gave up before the second replacement arrived. A few positives: The \"style\" department brought us a very nice deodorizer to help neutralize smoke odors - worked great. The second room was quite spacious, and yes the toiletries were nice. However, it is impossible to offset all of the other problems.

However the W lacked some basic luxury service such as cleaning of dorrway ( some people left food for a whole day wuthout it being cleaned). furthermore there was no pool which is annoying when you have kids. Everything you see in the room is beautiful, but you have to pay a lot of money if you want to keep it or use it, such as a large bottle of water next to the bed which costs 8$!!!!! Overall though, the hotel is very well designed and even though the staff wasnt very friendly I thought that the rooms and the general trendy atmosphere gave this hotel something to talk about.", "Date": "August 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "LA, CA.", "Title": "\u201cOk concept, but the stafff.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3757249", "Content": "The staff, basically the outdoor staff, need to learn some manners.

There wasn't much of a view from the room but it's right downtown so I knew what to expect. The room was quite large and comfortable all the way from the bed (as usual for a W) to the chaise lounge by the 27 inch TV. The bathroom seemed quite large to me and the toilet had it's own little room. There was really good water pressure too. I was there over a weekend so the bar wasn't quite as crowded as it would be on a week night. As other's have noted the lobby area is great and well appointed. Then again so are the rooms. Housekeeping does a good job of keeping everything neat and clean. I enjoyed the food from room service, it arrived hot and fresh. All the staff I encountered were very friendly. I had some friends arrive a day later than me, I spoke to the Welcome Desk and they did their best to have their room ready early as my friend's flight got changed and they got to Chicago at 10:00am. They even gave them an upgrade! Eventhough it was very hot (Temps near 100) the A/C didn't give out at all. It's walking distance to shopping and Grant Park. The inroom coffee was nice but there's a Starbucks 1/2 a block away along with a couple of convience stores.

HELLO, in between is a great stretch, try tiny --and if this was the 'in between', I would really hate to see a 'small' room. The bed and 'furniture' (I use that word loosely) took up the entire space. The carpet in the room was grey but that could not hide the traffic and frequent attempts at cleaning. The room also smelled stale and musty. The bathrooms are a bit tight too and not sparkly clean. Not dirty, but not that really clean look that makes you feel comfortable after having used it.

BIG MISTAKE! We booked a room with a king bed in the 'Mega' category. We received a Starwood Gold upgrade to an 'Alternative' suite (Room 1201) which had a Queen bed. When I called the welcome desk to enquire if they had any other suites with a King, I was told that they were too busy to speak with me - and they would call me back. 10 minutes later, I was told that ALL of their suites have King beds - and that their engineering dept. must have changed the bed in our room without informing them. (Which sounded a bit like a lie - the bedroom could not accommodate a king bed). We waited another 15 minutes for an 'Ambassador' to come up to our room with keys to another suite (room 601) which had a King bed - but this 'suite' was considerably smaller. (What the W calls a suite at this location is really just two small connecting hotel rooms). It was apparent that our new room hadn't been used in a while - everything was covered in a layer of dust - including the mirror in the parlour room - which someone hand written 'Clean Me' in the dust. We decided to make the best of it and unpacked. The ice machine on the 6th floor was broken, so I had to climb the stairs in search of a working machine. I know that W thinks their dark corridors are 'cool', but when I was wandering the halls looking for an ice machine, I felt unsafe - if their was a fire, how would you be able to see at all? The next morning I was awakened to sound of guest room doors being repeatedly opened and slammed shut. After counting 10 loud door 'SLAMS' - I went out to the hall to see who was doing this - SURPRISE! it was housekeeping! I asked her to to be more courteous - as some people are still sleeping - and she just stared at me - no apology. We decided that we would be happier if we moved to the W Lakeshore - and called downstairs to ask if they could make the arrangements. I was again told that they were too busy to speak with me - and they would call me back. When they did call back - I was told that our rate would not be honoured at the W Lakeshore, nor would we receive an upgrade there. If we wanted a suite at the W Lakeshore it was 750.00 per night. At that point we decided that we were moving to the Sofitel and checked out. Our bill was wrong - double charged for Internet and not billed for parking. They even tried to charge us an 'early check out fee' which they graciously waived.

The first stay, we got a very nice room with a king size bed, one bathroom and another room housing a (second) toilet and sink and also the wardrobe space. The second time, we were told we had a \"wonderful\" room reserved for us with a queen bed, but when we got up there the room was tiny and the bed was only a 4ft 6 wide one. I thought queen sizes were 5ft. We paid $30 per night to upgrade to a \"super\" (I think) room which was even better than our first one. We had room service a couple of times and everything was very good. So why the 3 blob rating? It is mainly because of the attitude of the hotel (not the staff) to the fact we'd booked through Hotwire. Maybe I'm naive to expect anything other than the worst rooms when you book through Hotwire, but we did seem to get the smallest room on the floor on our second stay. Also, you can't get Starwood points if you book through Hotwire either, so I didn't join the program and won't be going back to a W in any hurry.
