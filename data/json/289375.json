Although there is free car parking as others have commented, don't rely on it. If you arrive late, I would guess that is after about 4PM on some days, you won't get in either at the front or back. There is free road side parking nearby but watch the signs carefully to see what time you need to be clear in the morning. The bar is a little quirky and if you are fond of late night drinking might be a dissapointment. There is a bar service of sorts from the night porter, but the selection was rather limited.

The rooms were on the small side and we had to move to a second room after our bathroom floor became flooded after using the toilet. This was done without any fuss and a porter came with the new room key and assisted our transfer.The hotel seems to be in the process of some redecoration and our second room smelt of gloss paint. Annoyingly the radiator valve could not be switched off which meant we had to suffer an annoying wooshing noise of the water flowing through it. We were so tired after a full day at the O2 that it did not really bother us. The breakfast was a little above average with the food being replaced promptly and not having that steamed look that you often see. There was a good choice and you could order poached eggs, kippers, smoked haddock etc . The latter was served with two poached eggs and was lovely. The toast machine caused much amusement but the staff were willing to get your toast for you if you felt overawed at having to make your own. Beds were comfortable and bulk soap.shampoo and hand lotion were provided in the bathroom. Usual tea and coffee plus a little biscuit and a more than adequate hairdryer was provided. The TV was awful 15 inch and very old and the channels froze so it could not really be used. As is common with many hotels of this type it provides accommodation for coach parties. There were a party of Germans staying the first night so breakfast was very busy and it was a little noisy at night but everything was much quieter on the second night/day. The bar was fine and for London the prices were very reasonable.(\u00a33.35 for a pint compared to \u00a34.50 at the O2) we met friends for dinner so did not use the restaurant facilities although the prices looked a little on the high side. A good variety of items were available for room service. It is ideal for the O2 as the buses run all night and Blackheath has plenty of eating places. Avoid the fish and chip shop opposite the staion as on a previious visit we were charged over \u00a320 for two fish and chips. When I questioned this I was told \"This is Blackheath sir - everything is expensive here!\" The hotel has a great location overlooking the heath and is well placed to get to London in about 25 mins or 15 mins to Greenwich in the other direction. I felt the hotel had really friendly staff and great potential but is a little tired and needs smartening up and modernising.

I haven't eaten an evening meal in the Clarendon since then as there are loads of alternative bars and restaurants in walking distance. It's also walking distance from Blackheath Station so it's 25 minutes from Central London. Parking - free car parks on site. They may be full but on street parking is safe and you only need to pay between 9am and 7pm so if coming in after work there's a maximum of an hour to pay and you'll be off in the morning before the charges kick in. Bar prices - \u00a33.35 for a pint in a 3 star London hotel is not bad at all. Not so good points - Room prices - For most of this year I've paid \u00a379 per night. In January/February this was reduced to \u00a369. At these prices the Clarendon was excellent value. Who cares if the decor is a bit tatty if all you want is a comfortable bed for the night and a reasonable breakfast? However, the price has just gone up to \u00a3109. At that price I will be looking elsewhere next time I'm in the area on business. If I find that everywhere else is the same price (getting ready to fleece tourists for the Olympics.....) or if I find that everywhere else is fully booked and I can only get in to the Clarendon I won't be too disappointed as the Clarendon is OK.

I have never seen such a poor TV in a hotel room, EVER! When I'm away from home on business I am not interested in other hotel facilities (bar, restaurant, etc.); I just want a good TV - please. Remote controls are unreliable and the channel programming is all over the place. The main decor is 1980s chic, with some recent investment in the bathrooms.

Be ready to take down the offending car's no. plate and march into reception to rouse the lazy driver out of their slumber. There is another car park in the front of the hotel, but the loacations of some old bollards, and the problem of some of the staff using this car park as well, means that you will be looking for a parking place somewhere else. Breakfast is a tired farce; a greeter assigns you to a table and someone (eventually) asks you weather you want Tea or Coffee. The cereals never change (Crunchy Nut Corn Flakes, anyone?), the orange juice may or may not be watered down and I have given up on the cheapest-ingrediants-in-London cooked breakfast.

Blackheath station is down a steepish hill in a 7 minute walk. Trains go frequently to London Bridge, Charing X (Trafalgar Sq) and Cannon St (City) and less often to Victoria. Being in SE London, the hotel is relatively close to Canary Wharf and the Olympic site via Lewisham and DLR. Hotel is designed for large groups. I was expecting coach trips after reading reviews but there were none. Instead lots of specialist construction workers from England's provinces for the olympic project lined up for early - good simple breakfasts. Room was clean and basic - no free internet access. TV channels were very poor in choice and radio limited to awful Radio 1 and some independent rap-type station. At least Radio 4 should have been available.

I discovered only after 2 days that there was a more direct route from my room to the breakfast room and reception - despite using the orientation of staff (they didn't seem to know their way around) Blackheath has lots of restaurants and pubs to cater for hotel visitors at a better price and quality. Hotel restaurant and bar food was edible but had no character - super-bland even before pulled straight from the freezer. Some guests send under-thawed food back. So head out to Giraffes or other places nearby. Staying in London hotels is a necessity more than a choice and Clarendon represents value in this context. I would recommend foreign visitors to stay further out of the city in a homely town and commute in. Within 30 minutes train journey of London there are many picturesque quality places to stay with much much better value and less alienating experiences.", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "York", "Title": "\u201cWonderful location, staff a little abrupt, rooms very dated\u201d", "Author": "Tourman2", "ReviewID": "UR117691782", "Content": "Stayed here at end of August 2011 with a coach group.

The location was good for this as the hotel is within walking distance of a tube station and a bus stop to travel to the O2. However despite outward appearances the hotel is overpriced and the rooms, although clean, were too hot, with no air conditioning, noisy at night, as we had to open the window due to the heat and were overlooking a main road, and uncomfortable - the beds were springy and lumpy. The attached bathroom had a bath with no attached shower - some people might find it difficult to wash their hair without some kind of shower attachment. The bath was also fixed into the wall so if you wanted to grab hold of both sides of the bath to get out of it it wasn't possible, as you could only rest your hand on one side. This made it awkward to get out of the bath and wouldn't be appropriate for anyone elderly or infirm. But the worst thing was having no hot water, which we only discovered in the morning when we went to have a wash. It had been slightly warmer than cold the night before and we had thought it might be alright once the tap had been running for a while. But it didn't get any warmer. We had to boil the kettle and pour water from that into the bath and basin to have a wash. I politely explained to the receptionist when we checked out that there was no hot water and they would want to make sure it was hot for the next guests in that room, and she just glared at me and said \"You should have called us.\" When I started to explain that we didn't have the chance as we only realised in the morning when about to have a wash before breakfast, and we didn't have time to wait around that morning for the problem to be fixed, she walked off after just a few words. Just a simple 'I'm really sorry about that' would have been nice but we had no apology at all, she just didn't want to know. The last thing worth mentioning is the breakfast. We went down to breakfast about halfway through the time given and just managed to get a table before the queues built up - when we left the breakfast room there were about thirty people waiting for a table, many of whom had been there for quite a long time. We saw a notice saying the breakfast time had been extended by half an hour for that morning. It was really busy in the breakfast room, the staff were rushed off their feet. A menu on the table said that staff would serve hot drinks and toast at the table but we weren't offered any of this. The buffet selection was decent and there was a reasonable range of hot and cold food to choose from, with plenty for vegetarians as well as meat-eaters. And we did manage to get some toast and hot drinks eventually when someone came to clear our plates away. But it was a little bit late then. I felt sorry for the staff as there weren't enough of them to deal with all of the customers. To sum up I'd say the hotel is in a good location for the O2 so I'd recommend it for that, if you just want a safe roof over your head for a night after a concert.

One room was on the top floor so water pressure much less good and the bathroom was tiny. One room had a much smaller, older television than I had had previously and reception less good.

If smaller B&Bs can provide free wi-fi access then why do bigger hotels feel the need to screw customers? The major problem though was with my evening meal. I ate in the lounge and ordered soup and a burger. Some brain dead idiot thought that both courses should be served to me at the same time! When soup appears on the menu under \"Starters\" and the burger is in the \"Mains\" section that should give a huge clue as to how and when they should be served. I didn't ask the waiter to take the burger back to keep it warm as I'm quite sure that anything going back to the kitchen would have been spat in (or worse) before being returned to me. (Both the soup and the burger were actually quite tasty - although the burger was slightly colder than I would have liked by the time that I ate it). If I am working in Greenwich again I'd go back to the Clarendon, but I'll order the evening meal one course at a time so that they can't make such a huge cock-up again.", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cTry to avoid\u201d", "Author": "London5687", "ReviewID": "UR87903008", "Content": "The rooms aren't that nice and neither is the hotel.

On two occasions, the linen was ripped and with spots. Television was blurry, teapot filled with water from the previous guest (who knows for how long). The bathroom had pretty old fittings, with two separate taps for hot and cold. Not really up to today's standards. Showering was a challenge, since water pressure was quite low and temperature hard to set. One light bulb in bathroom was broken during our entire stay. The elevator is outdated and quite damaged. (Door is incredibly loud and the elevator ceiling is cracking.) General cleanlines in the hotel is below average. (Example: on the 2nd floor - elevator area, there were 2 used wine glasses left on the window sill. These glasses stayed there for 3 entire days!) Breakfast: Typical englisch breakfast. Quality was ok. Orange juice horrible.

The location in Blackheath was a pleasant surprise and on a sunny evening there was nowhere nicer to be than in my large room at the front of the hotel with the sun streaming in! Yes, there was traffic noise (I had to have the windows open as it was very warm), and yes, it is a bit creaky on the floors and along the corridors, and yes, you can hear noise from the corridors, but I felt the hotel had character and was very comfortable and good value for money. Blackheath village with all sorts of restaurants is a 3 minute walk, a lovely pub 1 minute to the right outside the hotel, and a green with duckpond etc., and all within 15/20 minutes travel of central London.

We had requested early check-in, but the woman at the front desk gave us a hard time about it initially (we were there at about 9am, and she immediately said \"You'll have to come back at 2pm\" when I said we had a reservation). The room was comfortable, although the decor could definitely use a 21st (or even late 20th) century update! We had no complaints about the room or the breakfast, which was plentiful and tasty. However, our major complaint about the hotel was the staff's complete disregard for the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign that we had on our door. After a late night out, we were sleeping in fairly late, and the housekeeper actually knocked on and then unlocked our door despite the sign's presence!! She quickly said sorry and scurried off after she realized we were there, but I thought that was absolutely unacceptable! That was the second time this had happened - the first time, we were just about to leave and asked her to please come back in five minutes, which she grudgingly agreed to. A further problem was that there was no concierge, and the front desk staff were either not very knowledgeable, or not interested in helping out a couple of tourists who'd never been to London before. We asked for advice on transit to get to downtown London, and it was only late in our stay that we realized there were several options available to us, not just the overground trains that the staff had told us to use. They also pointed us in the wrong direction when we asked which way to walk to Greenwich Village. Overall, the hotel itself and the breakfast were fine - everything was reasonably clean, in good working order, and comfortable. The staff, however, have a long way to go to live up to the standard of politeness that Britons have long held, and some more in-depth tourist information and assistance would have been very much appreciated.", "Date": "August 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBig Let Down\u201d", "Author": "Alanmelon", "ReviewID": "UR19348873", "Content": "Where to start?! From the outset, our experience of the Clarendon was not a good one. On arrival, the grossly inadequate car park was full to the brim. On asking door staff we were told \"you can try the other car park round the back but that one's full too\" leaving us to drive around for 10 minutes, eventually parking in a very exposed location and having to drag our luggage across to the hotel. Check in should have been straight forward, except that despite carefully booking on their own website, the reservation was under the wrong name. After following directions up and down staircases and through several doors, we arrived in a very outdated room with exposed pipework, and d\u00e9cor desperately in need of renovation. However, all appeared clean and tidy, so the room staff seemed to take pride in their job. For a hotel room of this price, there was some expectation of quality touches, but the stingy supply of toiletries and tea and coffee facilities soon put paid to that. On return from an evening out, we were looking forward to a good night's rest. Unfortunately, such an expectation was not to be fulfilled at an obviously busy Clarendon hotel, with all entrances surrounded with drunk rowdy smokers, one of which was situated outside of our thinly windowed room, thus preventing any sleep until the early hours, which after an hour or two was interrupted by the return of a large group booking on the floor above, crashing doors, shouting loudly and running from one room to the next. The lack of any decent sound proofing made this unbearable, and apparently staff at the Clarendon must be trained in the art of turning a blind eye, as this cacophony went on for what seemed an eternity. Fortunately the rest of our stay was fairly uneventful yet also unimpressive, topped off with incorrect billing due to some miscommunication between the point of booking and hotel systems. It's clear that the management of the Clarendon are well aware of their good location and lack of any competition in the vicinity, as demonstrated by the high prices for what is essentially a very dated, noisy and unimpressive hotel.", "Date": "August 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFine for overnight stay at weekend\u201d", "Author": "travelview", "ReviewID": "UR19224385", "Content": "We stayed here for one overnight - the Saturday of the early May bank holiday. The bank holiday weekend was busy with tourists but many Londoners had gone elsewhere, so the city was less crowded than usual. Reception staff were pleasant - both for checking in and checking out. We have stayed in other hotels in London - which are generally of a poorer standard and more expensive than anywhere else in Britain - so perhaps other travellers have been expecting more than London hotels usually offer. The Clarendon is at least clean - which is better than many London hotels. There are lots of stairs - corridors are narrow and standard rooms are smallish - again not unexpected for London. Rooms are well-enough furnished, though not modern. We would agree that the curtains could be thicker - it is certainly very bright early in the morning. The location is good - with front-facing views over Blackheath. A couple of minutes walk to Blackheath Village with its restaurants, cafes, shops and galleries. Easy walk across the park to the Greenwich Observatory - and Naval Museums etc - from there you can take the boat to the city centre - getting off at Houses of Parliament - much more pleasant than the tube - and not much more expensive.", "Date": "August 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phnom Penh, Cambodia", "Title": "\u201cWell worth a visit\u201d", "Author": "Pingpong10", "ReviewID": "UR18292950", "Content": "I travelled from S.E Asia to visit family and did actually book an apartment in Greenwich which did not turn out to be as advertised so I went along to the Clarendon Hotel. The reception staff were lovely, extremely helpful, the porters a dream, and as my husband was joining me in 4 days, they gave me a special rate. I actually returned twice to the hotel during my stay in the UK and it felt like home at times. The double rooms are large and airy, bathrooms good size, and everything was clean. The TV's however are the small. In fact Peter\u2019s comment on arrival was 'What\u2019s the Postage stamp on the wall' However as most folk do not come to sit in their rooms it was not a problem. Well maybe a bit when Wimbledon was on! If you get a room at the front of the Hotel you get magnificent views over the Heath. However do be careful on booking, sometimes from Thursdays thru to Monday -they usually have weddings, parties which are no problem till the guests leave around 12-2. a.m. and the noise outside the hotel is awful and apparently beyond the Hotels control. When this happened to me on my second stay, I was offered a room in the GODs, ! However the next day I was moved to a room on the other side where the view is of the garden (which is lovely) and can even watch the TOWN FOXES come in and scavenge after one of their many evening events. Breakfast is great value, but very busy on the mornings following Party nights, but on the whole the staff cope extremely well. If you read other reviews on this hotel , will see that they do have a lot of Fire Alarm incidents. I had 2 in my stay there, one on June 27th where guests ended up outside the hotel. Great way to see the London Fire Brigade, but bit concerned at the lack of Roll Call -numerous guests didn't bother. There is limited parking, i did have to park in the street a couple of times but could move the car back in the late evening. Bad Points Internet charges are outrageous, Hotel needs double glazing. The hotel lounge is a REAL LET DOWN. It is in the basement, and really dour ,unappealing, and serving instant coffee ugh... However, there are numerous cafes outside, Blackheath is a lovely Village. Do go to the farmers market if you are there on a Sunday. Do walk across The Heath and into Greenwich, the return is uphill, but rewarding. You could of course take a bus. Conclusion; A great hotel in need of refurbishment but is given tender lovely care by its staff, none of whom I could falter. Maybe a bit pricey but maybe the extra money will help upgrade it. I would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "July 27, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Clarendon Hotel - Blackheath Village", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d289375-Reviews-The_Clarendon_Hotel_Blackheath_Village-London_England.html", "Price": "$125 - $356*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">8 - 16 Montpelier Row</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Blackheath Village</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">SE3 0RW</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "289375", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/42/e2/b7/front-of-hotel-at-night.jpg"}}
