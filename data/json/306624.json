I think it's important to mention this, because I'm not sure we'd pick this hotel again if we had to pay for it, but then again, all I know is that the whole thing cost us 14,400 Airmiles for 4 nights and being in the old part of town appealed to both of us. There are many good things about the hotel, but also some bad ones, so here's my attempt at a summary. Bad news first ;-) BAD: - we were originally allocated room 615 (6th floor), which had a lovely view of the Creek etc., but...it smelled a bit and the condition of the bathroom was not quite what we expected, even though it's a 3* hotel - whatever that means. There was mould and...well...simply dirt. True to the form, the bathroom flooded on the second day of our stay and so we were moved to room 614, which was literally next door. What an improvement! Much cleaner bathroom with a deeper bath tub, no bad smell in the room, although closing the balcony door involved a bit of wrestling - really cramped breakfast room, which at nights becomes an Italian restaurant - the hotel is totally geared towards Russian clientelle which is why perhaps there is a bit of a clash of expactations - the decor is dated and tired; don't expect any bells & whistles - taxis provided by the hotel are a rip off - go to the main street and hail a taxi in 5 seconds flat for half a price - this is part of Al Khaleeja family of hotels, so if you're returning from somewhere by taxi make sure the driver knows where to take you. They often mix it up with Al Khaleeja Palace, which is also in Deira. Al Kahleeja Hotel is on the corner of Baniyas Road and Al Sabkha Road and the entrance is at the back, so not easily spotted from the main road. - very hard bed matterace GOOD: - the staff are all very friendly, welcoming and helpful; they really make you feel at home from the minute you walk in - central location, within walking distance to the Creek, gold and spice souks and in the heart of the shopping district; a lot of hustle and bustle, but the noise is in the background and you can't really hear it once you shut the balcony door - clean bed linen - free internet in the lobby - the breakfast selection is fantastic; they will cook eggs/omelettes to your liking; there is a vast selection of hot/cold European/Arabic cheeses, meats and snacks like stuffed peppers, houmous and other things (which unfortunately I don't know the names of!), cereals, yoghurts, fresh fruit, cakes, breads, croissants, juices, tea, coffee etc. To be honest, we've stayed in many better hotels, but the breakfast selection here topped most of them...if only you didn't have to fight for a seat each morning...; Mind you, one day we overslept and the staff were obliging enough to bring our breakfast upstairs at no extra cost (maybe because it was the morning after our original room was flooded...) - have a drink in the pub upstairs and it will be served with a bowl of popcorn, a bowl of peanuts and, at times, with an additional plate of olives and carrot crudites; once you finish the snacks, they will be replenished; in my book that's a meal in itself! - hair dryer supplied on demand - you can smoke in the room, although we always went out on the balcony anyway; strangely enough the ashtray was never emptied unless we've done it ourselves... All in all, an average experience in terms of the hotel itself. What stands out in my mind is the breakfast selection, but then again I'm a foodie. We will definitely go back to Dubai though!", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel close to the souks\u201d", "Author": "angela7", "ReviewID": "UR120047801", "Content": "I have yet again stayed at the Al Khaleej Hotel, and as usual it is absolutely perfect for a stopover and so close to the souks, you can walk to them within five or ten minutes.

They have an excellent breakfast which is included in the price most times, and their menu, particularly the lamb chops and the pizzas are wonderful and a good price.

Fresh rolls, fruit, omelettes, etc. The rooms are adequate with a balcony most having views of the creek and within two minuites walk. This hotel is in an interesting old area close to the souks (walking distance ten minutes) and markets. It is not a tourist hotel as it does not have a pool, but if you are interested in shopping and want to see the old part of Dubai go for it. There is also a great little place just around the corner that does reflexology and massage for ladies only. They do serve great Italian food in the little restaurant and the most lovely chocolate cake (thank you Chef!). Good value for money considering the outrageous prices some hotels charge in Dubai.

Hotel staff was very nice, russian-speaking-client-oriented), prolonged our stay without problem, though they were overbooked. Room price 350dhs for double, 300dhs for single. Also, for the Valentine's day they decorated lobby, restaurant and outside with baloons, hearts , gave out small presents to couples which was unexpected and neat.

I found the hotels information and called to find their location to business and downtown action. They informed me it was central to the business district. They were wrong... There location is about a 20 minute drive from the closest business district. Check in was easy since I arrived at 1am, but when I walked in the room I was disappointed at the condition and dating of the room. They have old everything with an old smell to the rooms. I was luckily on the 6th floor away from the hotels Belly Dancing Club. If you get a room on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th floor, you will hear LOUD MUSIC TILL 3AM without fail every night. I could hear the beat of the music from the 6th floor, but not enough to lose sleep. THEY BLAST THE MUSIC IN THE CLUB ALL NIGHT!!! I saw many guests extremely angry at the reception desk nearly every time I was in the lobby screaming about the noise. They did nothing. The staff was helpful for the most part. The janitors or cleaning people were the nicest, friendliest, people in the hotel. There managers are more interested in flirting with the girls in the hotel than running the hotel. On many occasions I would see the managers in the club flirting with the dancers and getting drinks. When I got my bill I found numerous charges that were not mine and I needed to argue with the receptionist to have her remove the charges. They also billed me an extra $30 USD/$100 DHS more for every night than they advertised to me. I tried to have it removed, but they refused so I gave in and payed. The biggest problem I had staying at the hotel was there is no internet in the rooms. They only have 2 computers in their business center and typically there is a line of people waiting to use them. If you use the computer longer than 1 hour per day, they bill it to your room without telling you, even though it says the computers are free to use. There room service menu is decently priced, but the food is sub-par. I recommend finding a hotel in Bur Dubai and paying close the the same price as you would for this hotel. Only stay in this hotel if it is your last option and you are ok with the above mentioned problems. Dubai is a great city to visit, live, or work. I recommend your travels to include Dubai.", "Date": "March 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Global", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for the money!\u201d", "Author": "DSP83", "ReviewID": "UR14086466", "Content": "This was a lovely surprise for the money, as I'd found some varying reviews before booking. We paid $135 for a very last-minute booking out of a travel agent in Baku (who is contracted by my partner's employer); it's hard to know what to believe, but the prices posted at the front desk of the hotel were more than twice this amount, so definitely do book before you go. We had found similar prices at various sites online. This is not luxury by any means, but it is more than sufficient, and if (like us) you are development warriors working in the third world, it is a lovely break from paying $100+ for a hotel room with cockroaches, cold water, etc. Though it did smell a bit of cigarette smoke, it was clean and the linens were spotless. The bathroom was fully functioning, good-to-great water pressure (depending on your standards - again, mine have been lowered significantly living in Africa!), and lovely complementary soaps. The only drawback to the bathroom was that the tub was small and strangely shallow (though elevated off the ground about a foot) - we think it had something to do with being adjacent to the elevator on the other side of the wall. Anyway, as long as you're not looking for a good long soak in the tub, this is hardly an issue. Our room, like every room, I'm told, had a private balcony and we actually had a great view of the creek - a lovely place to sit for a nightcap. The minibar was well stocked and reasonably priced (hard to imagine but true!), and had a selection of sodas, Heineken, water and candies. A fantastic electronic safe was included, allowing us to leave our cash and other valuables without any concern. The TV selection was OK, mostly international news, including the standard CNN, BBC, Al Jazeera, etc...also a Russian News channel for any Russophiles. Our room was very spacious, though I will qualify that by noting that we got a suite (even though we paid for a standard double) so I'm not sure what the normal rooms look like...not that it matters, b/c what is it that you're really doing in your hotel room that requires space?!? I can't vouch for the breakfast or the restaurants, because we never patronized them. The bar looked seedy (what you'd expect for a businessman's hotel), but the Italian Restaurant looked pleasant - we didn't purposely avoid it, just never got around to eating there in our 4 days. The staff was friendly and helpful, and we booked an evening desert safari through them without a problem. The location, for us, was excellent - a 2 minute walk to the creek and you're on a dhow (water taxi) to zip across the river to Bur Dubai (the 'Old City' - a large portion of which is a brand-new recreation of the old city!). You do have to take a taxi to get to the beach or head out to the other far-flung attractions - but this is pretty standard b/c the whole place is so spread out. I'd recommend staying in this area, b/c it's the only part of the city that IS walkable (near the Gold Souk and Spice Souk), and then making trips out to as necessary - taxis are reasonable and there's almost nothing that would cost more than $15, with most trips closer to $5-$8. It is also possible to walk to the City Centre, if you're a walker (we are!) - it took about 45 mins one night, but is a lovely stroll and there are always ample sidewalks EVERYWHERE in Dubai! All in all, this is more than a good value for the money. It is not the kind of place that you want to lounge around and unwind at, per se, but it's a clean, safe, functional place to sleep and more than comfortable enough to spend an hour or two in the evening or afternoon unwinding. If you're an expat there for a weekend to retouch with civilization, such as it is, this is a great choice for your money. If you're coming FROM civilization to visit Dubai, you might be less impressed with this place, but it all depends on how much money you want to spend. Certainly don't hesitate to go if you're looking for a good value on a tight budget!", "Date": "March 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cgood value\u201d", "Author": "angela7", "ReviewID": "UR10020261", "Content": "I always book hotels in Dubai through SOUTHTRAVELS. which is located in Dubai itself so they know all the hotels.

The breakfast is fresh with a good selection of fruit and rolls, and a few hot dishes. The bed linen is old and really needs to be replaced, but the room is a good size. I felt the concierge and his staff could have been a bit more helpful..that is the only bad thing I have to say about the place.

My flight arrived later than scheduled and we arrived at the Al Khaleej at 2:00 AM. I had booked and paid for the room through a travel agent in Kuwait. Upon arrival I proceded to the front desk and presented my voucher. The night manager told me that there was no booking for me. They checked around the office and acted like they knew what they were doing. In the meantime a group of local tourists walked in. I am under the impression that they did not have a reservation. They were served while my wife and I stood there for half an hour. Finally the manager said that they would give us a room. He told me that it could be my travel agent's mistake, or their reservation department's mistake. If they couldn't find the problem, I was told that I would have to settle the bill in cash the following morning. I was made to feel that I was lucky to be getting a room. Come the following morning, we checked out without any problem. It had obviously been the hotel's mistake because my travel agent is not open on weekends and therefore could not have been contacted. I understand that mistakes happen. I just don't feel that the staff handled the situation properly or professionally. The thought of paying for a room that I had already paid for bothered me a lot. I'm sure I would have had a more pleasant stay had the staff acted appropriately. If you plan to stay at the Al Khaleej hotel in Dubai, make sure to check your booking and have all the paperwork to prove it. It would probably be worth it to call the hotel and confirm your room, and get the name of the person on the other end.
