The area around the hotel is not at all aesthetically pleasing and I would not want to be out at night in the vicinity.

The beds at Eugenio were glorified cots and extremely uncomfortable, my wife ended up sleeping on the floor. The breakfast was terrible and very little variety. The owners who attended the reception desk were extremely disrespectful, aggressive, and even nasty at times -very poor customer service.

But it does come with some issues that novice traveler (or even seasoned ones) need to take into account. First is the location. While on the map it seems within reasonable walking distance of the train station, just don't do it. One pickpocket attempt a block from the station and a distraction grab and run that separated me from my backpack and $3,000 worth of camera gear. I also had a similar attempt near the Civitavecchia (fake trip and fall). So be on your guard, take the 105 bus or a taxi only! This is a dodgy area and not worth it to be out on your own, especially at night. The entrance of the hotel is hard to miss, I walked right past it the first time and those extra 3 blocks cost me more than my cruise and side trip to Rome, sigh. Push the #4 button, go up two flights of stairs to the entrance of the lobby. The building exterior is old and run down, as is the stairwell but the quality of the rooms more than makes up for it. The owners are very helpful and the rooms while sparce by American standards are clean and reasonably roomy. There is A/C which was a godsend, my room opened out onto a small courtyard. Reasonbly quite but the walls are thin and you will hear the running of water. Getting in and out is a bit complicated with the key, several doorways, and a buzzer to push but part of the charm. NIce breakfast. Free, stable, WiFi, with good speed. In room safe, use it! It's really obvious the owners of this hotel go to great lengths to make the rooms as nice as possible and care about you and your impression of the hotel. Will make dining recommendations. Offered to drive me to the nearest police station to file a report after I checked in. Grocery store a block a way for supplies, small fridge in the room. CNN on the TV.

We were on a slight budget and I had read the reviews and the warnings about the location of the hotel, appearance, etc. but chose to book anyway. Upon our arrival, I was getting more and more antsy throughout the cab ride-- believe the reviews you're reading, the area is very discouraging. When we arrived, the outside of the hotel didn't even look like a hotel, but probably an abandoned building. The only reason we knew it was our hotel was because it had a sign \"HOTEL\" right above it. You have to be buzzed to get in and I still can't forget the broken window and eerie dark entrance (I felt like I was in a movie). There are some stairs by the way, so be prepared to carry your bags up the steps (there is no bellman obviously). Once you climb those, there is a very small elevator that can only fit one person at a time to get you to the 2nd floor (to check in). The family that owns the place is AWESOME and so helpful and want to ensure you enjoy your stay in Rome! The older woman checked us in, went over the rules (she stressed to always make sure you close the entrance door of the hotel..that kind of freaked me out) and showed us to our room. The room was surprisingly great! There were 3 of us so we had 3 twin beds, plenty of space, and a ****SPOTLESSLY CLEAN**** bathroom. I still wasn't convinced when we first got there and wanted to checkout immediately but I can honestly say, as much of a HUGE neat freak I am, this hotel met my standards, I'd recommend it to anyone! I'm used to staying in Marriotts, Hiltons, Hyatts, etc. and we had even stayed at Marriotts while we were in Paris and Prague before we got to Rome but I will say this hotel was worth it. Free breakfast and Free Wifi was on point! We had to pay for EVERYTHING at those other two hotels, so this was a great luxury. The only downside to the room was that the beds didn't come with a huge comforter or anything...really just a sheet or two, plus the spread that is on top of it (which wasn't very thick) but we were fine. As for the outside, we actually stayed away from Termini and walked to the city center everyday (passing by the Colosseum everyday was an added bonus) and we were 3 girls walking back by ourselves each night (though i don't suggest doing that anywhere in the world, we had no problems-- a lot of tourists were heading back to their hotels as well so we weren't the only people in the streets). Also, there is a huge supermarket across the street, and a great restaurant next door that we'd go to every night for dessert, pizza, etc. to satisfy our midnight cravings.

Decide what's important to you, then choose accordingly. We also stayed at the Hotel Grifo, which we preferred due to it's quieter, prettier location. Pros - - Transport connections. It's 2 blocks (ie. 2 mins walk) from Vittorio Emmanuelle metro stop, which is one, yes, one, stop from Termini. Very useful if leaving early to catch your train/ plane back home. 30 mins to walk from Termini station, if that's your thing. Tramstop to Termini is also right outside hotel. - Local supermarket immediately across Via Principe Eugenio. I found the locals very helpful when I couldn't operate the weighing scales :-) - Good quality yet inexpensive, (therefore popular) Chinese restaurant immediately across Via Bixio. DIdn't find any Italian restaurants in vicinity. - Large,airy, high-ceilinged rooms, with ensuite shower/ toilet, TV and FRIDGE (we found this v useful to store our early morning breakfast/ airport food on the last day). Room also had narrow concrete balcony overlooking large shared courtyard. Handy for smokers. Rooms better here than Hotel Grifo. - Very clean, tiled floors. Unfortunately this means sound travels, especially if you're near the reception area. This is a common problem in many Italian hotels. - Staff speak passable English. But the younger ones speak more than the older ones, and they all love it if you speak some Italian! Cons - - Rather scruffy, untidy neighbourhood. Didn't encounter any trouble, and the hotel is on a busy street, but we didn't want to amble slowly around after dark. No charming pavement cafes here. Nothing to see in the immediate area, 30 mins walk to Colosseum. - Miserly breakfast. Deliberately tiny bowls, spoons etc to discourage you from eating much. Cheap quality food items. - The hotel is situated on first floor of a big *shared* apartment block. Don't worry, it's secure. Several locked doors to get through before you finally get to your room. But you share the front door with lots of other apartments, have to push buzzer to get in. If it wasn't for the big yellow HOTEL sign on the building, you'd easily miss the entrance.

You need to walk a lot in Rome, but being near an underground ensures you can at least get close to all the main attractions, and saves a lot of time. The rooms in the hotel are small but have a bar fridge, air con (a MUST HAVE in Rome during summer), lockable safe, and ours had an ensuite. It was clean and similar to previous reviewers we felt quite safe in the neighbourhood. But if you arrive at Termini station after dark I would recommend taking a taxi for the 5 minute trip to the hotel rather than walking. The owners of the hotel were not the warmest people, but did take time to give us a good tourist map and show us the best train/bus lines to take. It really is just a 20 minute walk from the colosseum. The only drawbacks to this hotel were that there was no internet and the ensuite had no real ventilation and a number of mosquitoes haging around. Also, the beds and pillows were extremely hard - while most beds in Europe are hard, we found we had aching necks and backs most days while staying here. You might need to use clothes to boost up the pillows a bit. The breakfast was quite nice with bread rolls, meats and cheese on offer as well as some fruit, pastries, and cereal.

This is a 2-star budget hotel, but it's an excellent value. CONS: (1) The hotel is located on a busy street, but it is dark and very urban, not neighborhood-y at all. Despite that, I felt safe walking up to the hotel at any time of day - it was no different than a block in New York City, where I live. (2) No pretty view from the rooms: It's just the busy and gray neighborhood below. (3) No irons in rooms, but there is a common ironing room. I used it and it was fine, but of course it's convenient to have an iron in your room. PROS: (1) Transportation was a breeze. The hotel is just 2 blocks away from the Metro, and Bus 105 stops directly in front of the hotel. We frequently took the bus to the Termini station, and back again since the Metro doesn't take you everywhere. In general, we found getting around Rome to be very easy. We knew we could either take the Metro or take any bus in the city back to the Termini, and then at the Termini, transfer to bus 105 to go straight to the hotel. (3) The staff is excellent: they are polite and nice, they speak English, and they gave us detailed bus and metro directions. They even have their own maps and any time we wanted directions, they took out a map and went over the directions with us. They also gave us restaurant recommendations and made reservations or called places to make sure they were open since we were traveling right after Christmas. I also had a cold during our stay, and they provided us with hot tea in carafes that stayed hot through the night, several times, for free. (4) For a budget breakfast, we thought the hotel's was more than adequate. We had hard-boiled eggs, salumi, breads, cereals, coffee, juice, and fruit. It was certainly better tasting and had better variety than a Holiday Inn Express continental breakfast. (5) There's a supermarket across the street, and if you choose this hotel, you probably are interested in saving some money by getting a few snacks or drinks from the market. (6) The rooms are clean - and that's probably one of the most important things to consider when staying at a budget hotel. (7) The room was quiet. Even though our room was on a corner and there were busy streets below, the room was quiet and we had no problems with noise or getting a good night's rest. (8) Our triple room was spacious, and it even had a balcony. I've posted a few pix of the room: forgive the unmade beds- but you'll see the size of the room.

We usually took the 105 bus from the train station -- only 3 stops away and it dropped us off right in front of the hotel. But we could even walk there. Also, there's 2 metro stops within walking distance. Keep in mind that I'm almost 6 months pregnant and had NO PROBLEM getting to and from our hotel the whole time. Also, some people mentioned that it was in a \"seedy part of town\" and I really disagree. It's just that it's more residential, so you don't have tons of tourists or touristy hot-spots in the immediate area around the hotel. We really liked this aspect, and never felt unsafe in any way. It was quiet at night and fun to see the normal hussle and bustle of morning rush for the everyday Romans. Also, it was very convenient having a large super market DIRECTLY across the street.

We fly into the Da Vinci airport which is Rome's main airport so the train we got from the airport brought us directly to Termini for less than \u20ac10 each. From Termini, we also got a train to the Vatican which took roughly 20 mins. The hotel is very close to the Collessium which is a magnificent piece of architecture. As per reviews I have seen on this site and other sites, the neighbourhood does not appear the safest. There was some homeless people nearby plus a great deal of graffiti was to be seen but Rome is littered with graffiti in any case so I would not let this put me off. I must say that I never felt threatened when walking late at night. Principe Eugenio is sort of on the 2nd floor of an apartment block and from it's exterior would not exactly resemble a hotel from first impressions. At the front, there is black gates and you must buzz in to get them opened. This is slightly off-putting at first as there is nobody to greet you or anything fancy but rest assured once you get up the stairs, you will be impressed. The main shopping street Via Del Corso is only a short stroll away(15 mins approx) as is the Roman Forum, Spanish Steps and various other temples&museums. A tram also runs directly by the hotel as do other buses though I must admit I walked everywhere bar the Vatican. I actually walked home from the Vatican as the weather was so nice plus we got to see more of the city. Rome is an expensive place for accommodation but I feel the \u20ac375 we paid for our 3 nights was money well spent.", "Date": "September 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellington", "Title": "\u201cFantastic family hotel, very handy location\u201d", "Author": "MacKiwi", "ReviewID": "UR5553442", "Content": "This is a great family run hotel. The family are very friendly and have lots of information about the city and what to do. The rooms are a good size for a large European city and traveling in winter the central heating was great. The only noise we could hear was the trams and that wasn't all night. The breakfast was very good and the family made sure that you had enough to eat. They seemed to speak at least 5 languages and there were many different nationalities staying at the hotel. Yes there is graffiti in the surrounding streets, but there's graffiti throughout Rome. The tram to Termini stops almost outside the hotel and it's about a 5 min walk to the Metro. The stores around the hotel mainly sell Chinese clothing and are open long hours so there was always people around and we felt safe walking to and from the Metro to the hotel. When we visited the Metro stopped about 9pm but buses ran the same route above ground. The hotel location is secure and you have to buzz from downstairs to have the owners unlock the front door. The hotel is located up reasonably steep stairs, there is an elevator if you don't mind the old fashioned 'see-through' type with iron railings. We would defintely consider staying here again if visiting Rome.", "Date": "August 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cFamily rooms in a family hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Crazy-kitten", "ReviewID": "UR4072321", "Content": "I would recommend this hotel in Rome.

But if you want is a simple and reasonably-priced base for exploring Rome, this small family-run hotel is perfect. The staff were incredibly helpful, even we arrived early with the room not yet ready. They took the time to point out what to see in Rome and how to get there. The hotel is well situated for getting to and from the Main station, as well as convenient for underground, bus and tram links. You can get quickly, safely and easily to all the major tourist destinations. Our room (with bathroom) was spacious, airconditioned and had thick windows and shutters so you could escape from the city. Even better, it had a balcony overlooking the street where we relaxed after a hard day of sighseeing and enjoyed a beer. The breakfast included fresh rolls, a delicious basket of fresh fuit and even some ham and cheese - a luxury we didnt experience again in Italy! The free bottle of wine on arrival didnt hurt either!", "Date": "September 28, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Principe Eugenio", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d573271-Reviews-Principe_Eugenio-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$86 - $152*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Principe Eugenio 90</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00185</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "573271", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/28/cc/28cc8f1528669e55894923b5330b1c0f2large.jpg"}}
