I understand they must have been burned in the past and they're trying to avoid hookers and partying and drugs on the premises, but some of us are just good, normal people who need an inexpensive place to stay. I hate the idea of the doors locking at 7pm or whenever it is so you have to buzz the owner to get back in. The no visitors rule had me scared to death even for my friend to come pick me up. And the maid was so weird and suspicious about me asking for an extra towel, I didn\u2019t even bother after that. Just a note: For what they're charging per night ($80 something), it is not worth it at all - there are comparable places in Hollywood that are much nicer. The weekly rate is $340 and very worth it, if you need a cheap place to stay and you have very basic standards.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery strange!!!\u201d", "Author": "txbyrdman", "ReviewID": "UR115947243", "Content": "This was our first time to have to leave a deposit for a room key and tv remote.

They are fairly nice people but not totally assimilated into American culture. Understanding this would probably help you enjoy your stay here. If you need a cheap place to stay in Hollywood I would say this place is as good as it gets. There is no pool, it is somewhat close to the freeway, there is no real social space, but, the staff is good at what they do, the rules more or less make sense for the clientele and the area (they don't allow visitors etc.), and the location is very central. They also don't have fridges, they should get those... Anyways, it's got pluses and minuses but for the price it is an overall keeper. In response to the previous post, I would say that the management is pretty laid back so long as you play by their rules, and realize there is a reason why the world has the word \"ugly americans\", because we come from a presumptous culture.

I felt extremely welcome and I even came in late a few times without being made to feel guilty(you have to be buzzed in after dark).

My room was incredibly clean and equipped with an effective air conditioner. Housekeeping came in every day in the early afternoon to do a very thorough cleaning job.

The problem was: I paid $114.00 per night because the only remaining room had a kitchen. The \"kitchen\" was a mini fridge and a microwave. The manager or owner, David was nice enough, but I felt like a criminal staying there. I had to pay a $20 deposit for the tv remote, like I would steal a $5 remote, so I have to put $20 down to ensure that won't happen. Also, I was staying by myself, but had a friend in town, and when I tried to bring her to the room just to grab some stuff, so we could go out for the night, he actually tried to charge me $5 for her to come into the room!!! Why not $20? After all, she might steal the remote. I was so offended I told him I would not pay the $5 (out of principle) and he told me I had to pay it or I could not stay there. I paid the $5, which I wish I hadn't, and just gone somewhere else, but I didn't. I understand you're in Hollywood, where there are some criminals, but I can find a place in the same neighborhood that doesn't think I'm one. You have to have better judgment than that. That whole experience ruined it for me. Next time I'm in town for business, I'll go to the Best Western, two blocks away.

One night a guest made a distrbance at 4 am and he would not calm down. The following day he was evicted. The room did have airconditioning and because the room faced Franklin Ave we did use it at night. It was very convenient, we walked to downtown Hollywood (it was a good hike) and also took the dash.

I have read about other H\u00f8llywood hotels that were dirty, buggy, and had questionable people around them, and I did not find that at all with this hotel.
