The room service food was excellent and all service was efficient. As the hotel becomes a night destination there are elevator operators placed in the elevators to assure guests priority. The location is easy freeway access but the great location is adjacent to the clubs, restaurants and action of the gass light area.

The hotel staff was courteous and attentive. The room was extremely clean. The contemporary decor was both fun and relaxing. The location of the property was just what we wanted, near enough to the main action of the Gas Lamp district, while still being slightly off, the more heavily populated area. We took advantage of room service for breakfast daily and for dinner multiple times. The food was very good and delivered extremely quickly. It was however quite pricey (as is to be expected- as room service always is). The complimentary snacks and drinks in the minibar were a nice touch. Complimentary internet access was also a nice feature. I booked our room on-line and was taking advantage of corporate rate program. There was a discrepancy with our confirmed room rate, but upon showing my confirmation, it was corrected without question. I usually utilize the hotel concierge for recommendations and reservations. At the Andaz, there was not a formal concierge but everyone I spoke with was more than willing and able to make our stay at the hotel and the city a wonderful birthday weekend. Instead of having access to one person to assist us with special arrangements, we seemingly had an entire staff who were ready to take care of our needs.

The rooms are a good size and very comfortable with big flat screen TVs, a good desk area and there is free wifi throughout the hotel. The fridg is stocked with juices, pop, sparkling and still water that are complimentary. There is also a basket with artisanal chips, a granola bar and Toblerone bar that are complimentary and replenished. There is a roof top pool and apparently a club, which I did not venture to, as the unusually chilly weather did not encourage the former and my age did not result in my frequenting the latter. I was told by the check-in staff (which I thought was very open-minded of them, given my age group in the 50's) that there were 2 clubs, I believe one of which is a wine bar and that I would have a wrist band with free access to these areas if I so desired! There is an excellent sushi/Japanese restaurant in the lobby, Katsuya, which will do take out so that one can enjoy dinner in the room. There is complimentary wine in the lobby from 6 to 8 and always a changing array of fresh fruit in a large bowl at the small business centre in the lobby. I ordered room service breakfast once and it was delivered promptly at the requested time. This is a hotel with a heart, and I truly enjoyed my stay. It is located in the \"Historic Gas Lamp District\" with many nearby restaurants and in close proximity to the Convention Centre. It is also close to the San Diego trolley system which takes you to many locations, for a $5 a day pass. The desk staff suggested I take it rather than a $25 to $30 cab fare to the outlying Fashion Valley mall.

We had prebooked a double room in December and got a confirmation, only to be disappointed when they downgraded us to a single queen bed room when we arrived. They made the excuse that they were overbooked that weekend, but I thought since we booked so far ahead we should've gotten the room we wanted. In any case, the queen room was super small (it felt too cramped for 2 girls) and the bed was pretty standard. The bathroom was designed kind of awkwardly, since I could basically watch my friend through the glass between the sink and the bed. I did have a major issue with the shower-- I don't know if they did it on purpose for a design element, but I HATED the showerhead. The placement of where to put the shower arm was so inconvenient (and I am only making a fuss because I kept getting soap in my eye since I was too short to reach the shower head and had to hold it the whole time while trying to shampoo, so annoying!!!!) I do have to give the hotel some stars: the service was attentive especially when I asked them to get my car charger from our rental car, they knew just where to look. Also the location is excellent and super convenient, right in the heart of the gaslamp district and close to all the shops and restaurants, that deserves a star in itself.

I repeat, this is not the hotel for you! However, if you are in search of some serious nightlife, you will find that the Andaz exceeds all of your expectations. A Hyatt property located in the heart of San Diego's Gas Lamp District, the Andaz is a boutique hotel, with everything that implies: intimacy, luxury, and hospitality. Elegant, attentive staff greet you as you enter the foyer, and are just waiting to assist you throughout your stay. The decor and vibe is very \"Cristal,\" with sumptuous appointments and a contemporary aesthetic. During the day, the Andaz whispers subtle affluence and offers various inviting climes for rendezvous. A rooftop lounge with cosmopolitan views and a chic wine bar with cozy corners are two of the options. At night, the entire hotel transforms into a mecca for dancing, drinking, and d\u00e9colletage. The rooftop lounge becomes one of the city's most desirable nightclubs. The wine bar provides plenty of comfortable seating for stiletto-weary ladies, along with a thumping DJ and a full-service bar. Yet, there is more: downstairs, the Ivy Club is currently featuring a \"Rio-Carnival\" theme, with feathered dancers who gyrate on podiums and staircases, and Capoeira artists who infiltrate the dance floor. For a bachelor/bachelorette party, birthday celebration, or couples getaway, this is THE spot!

Free water offered anytime at the front desk. Comfortable bed. CONS: Valet was $35!!! The new year\u2019s party was pretty fun. But there were some annoyances. 1. We rang in the New Year on the rooftop, but there was NO countdown! Whoever the DJ was they should be FIRED! Isn\u2019t the countdown the best part of new years? No one knew the moment just passed by! 2. I waited 15 minutes for the elevator in the \u201cbasement\u201d club to go back to our room. The elevator attendant dropped off a full load but would not let us ride up even though it was the \u201cfor hotel only guests elevator\u201d. He made us walk up the stairs to the first floor only to catch the SAME elevator there. So annoying. The Room: 1. We had a tiny king room. The rooms are SMALL. There is not bureau to put your clothes. There was a bench with a couple drawers. Thank god we didn\u2019t stay long. 2. No floor length mirror in the room, not even on the back of the closet door. How am I supposed to see how my outfit looks? The ONLY mirror was in the bathroom over the sink. There was a magnifying mirror, but I could not use it because whoever installed it must have been 6'5\", and I am a petite 5'2\". The lighting the bathroom was very dim. Bad for bathroom. 3. Clear glass bathroom doors?! Kind of sexy for the shower but not the toilet! I need some privacy there. I would suggest frosting the bathroom door glass, especially since you can see the ENTIRE bathroom from the outside hallway!!! 4. The bathroom sink and shower leaked like sieves! There were giant pools of water all over the floor. 5. There was a refrigerator in the room, but it did not keep anything cold. 6. There is absolutely no sound proofing between the rooms. I could hear full conversations in the adjacent rooms through the walls! 7. No sound proofing in the windows either! All night long there were fire engine sirens right outside. We were on the 6th floor. Granted it was NYE, but it sounded like it was IN my room. One word to describe this hotel is sleazy. Lipstick on a pig is still a pig.

I'm there by myself, what on earth am I going to spend $150 a night on? Most hotels only block off $50 a night. -the bathroom is completely non functional the sink is in a little alcove outside the actual bathroom. Inside the bathroom is a toilet and the shower. No racks or shelves to hang/place clothes or towels. It's really a strange design! That being said, I asked for a quiet room (which I thought might be pushing it with 2 nightclubs in the hotel and staying over the weekend) but I did get a quiet room (with a view of some gravel and a wall) but I heard no noise from either nightclub during the 3 nights I was there. The staff are very helpful and always talk to you when you enter the hotel (which actually can be a little annoying if you are not in the mood to talk - as I wasn't when I had a horror tour and they asked me how it was and I wanted to say \"terrible\" but I lied and said it was fine and quickly went to the lifts to save the hassle).

Then I ordered room service, docked my iPhone docked in their speakers and got some work done in a bathrobe listening to Coltrane. When I came back to the hotel with friends after dinner on Thursday, the whole hotel turned into an extension of their night club. We had to get past a muscly man in a black suit just to get in the lobby, and another one to get in the elevator to go up to our room. Then the dance music started and we thought we were going to lose our minds. The walls and floors were shaking from the bass beats. Music, conversations, and cigarette smoke just came pumping into our room like there were no barriers. It kept going until 2 a.m. when the club shut down. This repeated again on Friday night.

Didn't bother us at all but this hotel has a serious club atmosphere so if that's not your thing you may want to look elsewhere. And as a hotel guest you have access to all the clubs.

The wine bar looked pretty awesome but after seeing the prices of the rooftop bar drinks we found other happy hours in the area!! The second night we were out and about going to dinner and a comedy.

The staff was nice and kind, but they did not follow through with their promises. I expected that after bringing guests to stay in more than 10 rooms at their establishment AND it being the most important day of my life, I would get service that was above and beyond exceptional. Well, I can honestly say I have received better, more timely and accurate service at Motel 6. Upon returning to our 1st floor suite (after requesting a higher floor upon making the reservation) we found the room had not been cleaned. There was still breakfast stuffs from that morning, trash and dirty towels and the bed was still as it was when I had left early that day. This is most upsetting because I had spoken with the maid personally and asked that she please return at a specific time, once we had left, to get the room prepared for the bride and grooms' return. My Maid of honor had also spoken with the front desk to see that the room be cleaned and perhaps given an extra special touch, being it our wedding night and all....

The hotel is very modern, and has a great vibe. I checked in on Friday night, and because I am a diamond member with confirmed suite upgrade, they upgraded me to a top floor suite with a view of the baseball stadium. The room was beautiful. Unfortunately, because of the noise from the club upstairs (given the Friday night combined with long holiday weekend), I asked for a room change after staying in that room for about 1 hour. Though the room was beautiful and the bathroom was stunning, the noise was actually a deterrent. The staff was extremely courteous, and came upstairs with three room keys, and had me tour three different rooms of comparable size but on different floors and locations in the building to see which one I preferred. I ended up choosing a room facing the inner courtyard in the middle of the building....so it was in effect furthest from the club noise both at the rooftop and on the ground floor. The room was very quiet. The next morning....the manager left me a personal note with apologies, and somehow knew I was playing a tennis tournament in San Diego (probably because of the huge racket bag on check in), and left me a new can of tennis balls, and a note hoping that I'd \"Ace\" the tournament. Thought that was a very nice touch. Breakfast was complimentary as a diamond member, but it was wonderful.....beautiful atmosphere at their restaurant on the ground floor. Very chic....nice American fare, and presented very beautifully. The last morning.....I had breakfast up at the rooftop where they had set up tables with umbrellas. Also very nice. The room itself was very modern. Everything you would expect from a 4 - 5 star hotel. Water pressure was good.....turn down service. Free mini bar for most of the items....(one of the andaz perks). Valet parking is a bit steep, but it IS the most convenient thing in the Gaslamp district.....which is quite lively and vibrant on weekend nights. I also thought that it was nice that the hotel recommended restaurants in the area...and not just their own restaurant. All staff were extremely friendly, courteous, and helpful. I think my only gripe about the hotel was the noise from the club, and also that the pool was closed for most of the day on Sunday for a big pool party....which we would have to pay to get into. The pool party definitely draws in a big crowd, but I think it is rather disloyal to close the pool to its dedicated paying guests who are actually staying in the hotel. I bet the hotel is quite serene on the weekdays.

We stayed for a bachelorette party and had three rooms booked there. I also purchased the Bachelorette bottle service package at the Ivy rooftop bar. We had another group of girls (4) that were staying at a different hotel that were a part of Friday's bottle service festivities. They were hassled by the door men and weren't being allowed in after they gave my name and said they were there for bottle service. The problem could have been handled by calling my room and saying I needed to meet them at the door rather than embarrassing them and leaving a horrible lasting impression! So now his gripe is about wristbands. Don't you think you would have to physically get into the hotel to actually acquire one?! When I called earlier in the day to see what my party and I needed to do I was instructed to go upstairs give my name and we would receive wristbands. I do not understand how that was so difficult! So we're done with the rooftop bar and decide to get food while one of our friends that wasn't staying there takes a nap in our room. She wakes up before we get back needs air and goes outside downstairs only to be turned away when trying to come back in. She left her heels in the room because they were hurting her feet along with her purse and cell phone. She told the person working what room she came from and gave my name and still got turned away BUT not before an employee gave her a map and sent her on her way at around 330/4 AM!! Why wasn't she given the option to wait in the lobby?? We get back and see she's missing call our friends that she is staying with and they go out on the town to find her. Luckily they did but not after she got lost and had an encounter with one of the MANY homeless people that live in the area!! We were all in awe that had happened! I told a female that was helping us load our bags as we were checking out she could not believe it either BUT didn't offer to compensate me in any way. I spent a lot of money at this hotel as did our friends that stayed as well and to be treated like that is beyond belief!!

It's a happening place on the weekends but this only enhanced our stay. Comfortable beds. Great ammenities. Superior customer service. Celebrity sighting. This hotel is in a great location. The Andaz is very stylish and well appointed. I find the concept to be very refreshing and look forward to staying here again. The customer service was superior to any hotels we have stayed in- inlcuding the Ritz Carlton. We also saw a very handsome celebrity that was staying in the hotel- kind of exciting! Check in was a little weird- as I wasn't quite sure where the front desk was but they check you in and escort you with your luggage to your room and explain everything. Most things in the mini bar are complimentary which is so nice to have. Decent sized bottles of alcohol are available for purchase in your room as well. They have a Escalade that will take you anywhere within 2 miles of the hotel, so be sure to use it. This is a happening place at night! We counted at least 3 bars one of which was on the rooftop. They have a special elevator for guests (to go to your room OR any of the bars) so you don't have to wait in line. It was great when we were getting tired at the end of night because we would come back here and hang out for a bit and then go to bed. The pool is also a happening place during the daytime, worth going to. Shower: it is open with glass but there is a solid door on the bathroom. It's different but it didn't bother my husband and I. It actually made the room feel more spacious. The rooms are not large (which is normal for downtown hotels in any city) but despite some other reviews we did have drawers at the foot of the bed which we found adequate. Ext vs Int rooms: I requested an interior room based on previous reviews of noise and was totally bummed that there is only a view of concrete walls, so I think I'd probably request and exterior room next time. Customer Service: So good that it was noticeable (and this was before we had any issues). They were great in every capacity. When we did have an issue with our shower leaking and they fixed it once, they had to come back again. They handled it well and I was pleased. It is rare to have good customer service anywhere these days but the fact that is was obvious from the minute we checked-in was refreshing. I highly recommend Sunday brunch at Searsucker down the street. It's about a 5 minute walk on 5th street. We found it by accident while walking around, try the 'man-mosa\" it was a big hit with our group. It was fantastic and fun and different!

Staff was very friendly and I was offered a drink upon checkin. The room came with a well-stocked bar and almost all of the nonalcoholic items were complimentary. I did find a couple of things to be a little strange. First of all, the room had no drawers. I ended up putting items that could not be hung up on a shelf on the top of the closet. Since I am short, I had to step up in the closet to reach. More puzzling was the giant glass wall that separated the bedroom area from the rest of the room. There was very little space between where the wall ended and the table under the TV began. I kept imaging myself walkimg into the wall, especially half asleep. I will say that everything looked clean and modern and both the sheets and mattress were very comfortable. While the room had enough space for 1, I think it would have been cramped for a couple. My parents came out to join me at the end of the trip and stayed in a larger room. Their room was similarly furnished with one important difference - there was a glass enclosed tub/shower in the middle of the room and no, it was not frosted glass. I would have felt like an exhibitionist, although my parents said that the glass fogged over when in use, so it wasn't much of an issue for them. It did strike all of us as a little odd though. When a couple of issues came up (thermostat not working) they were handled quickly and courteously. The rooftop lounge and pool were very nice. You could see the baseball games on the big screen in the stadium. I would recommend bringing your own beverages - a thimbleful of Bailey's cost $12.

The reservation agent suggested Andaz as the nearest \"sister\" hotel and we booked the room for our last night in San Diego. To be fair, we had no idea what the hotel looked like or where it was. Imagine our surprise when our taxi pulled up to a super sexy boutique hotel. Sleek in design, immaculate and pristine interiors, we were greeted by eye candy staff who were extremely courteous. One offered to check us in, the other whisked our bags discreetly away (our room wasn't yet available) and another made a complementary espresso for us. The rooms are amaaaazing, like something out of Wallpaper magazine. Very hip, urban and tasteful. Dark wood, iPod-friendly, LCD screens, free WiFi and a cocktail bar already set up for you to enjoy. Complementary drinks are available for you in the fridge (everything from pop, juice, cold water ... oddly the only thing not free is Gatorade) and you have a full mini-bar if you want to make your own martinis. Also available is a complementary snack tray - Pringles chips, Toblerone and granola bars. Sure, it's not Whole Foods, but it's more free food than you'd get on a airplane flight these days. For those who forget things easily, there's a menu available in your room of amenities available - at cost - through the hotel. These include a sewing kit and yes, even a vibrator. I guess you can be prepared for just about anything at the Andaz and they won't bat an eyelash. The bathroom is worth mentioning as a whole separate paragraph. The shower head is detachable and is shaped horizontally. It'd make for a great windshield wiper for your car. No bathtub, but very spacious shower. The only downside of the bathroom - gorgeous as it is - is that it is very tiny and there are no doorhooks so you're leaving your towel on the floor and all of your clothes on the floor. Please Andaz - put in a hook on your door or wall! Complementary thick plush robes are available for you in your closet. We pur ours on after our shower, even though it was summer time and arguably the wrong season to be wearing any kind of plush. We couldn't help ourselves. The grandeur of the place was so luxe! The beds were firm and probably the best ones I've slept on since the Hampton Inn and Suites. Even though we were only there for one night, we were both able to sleep really well, a testament to the mattress and pillows. Both my friend and I are pretty picky sleepers so this is not a small feat! We were sad to only have had one night at this hotel - we spent the next morning having brunch at their on-site restaurant. Fantastic waffles and great coffee. We didn't get a chance to sample their evening dinner, the on-site night club or the rooftop pool.

I have to say, my expectations were exceeded on almost every front. You could easily see the staff becoming very snobbish based on the fact that the hotel is such a hotspot, but they were pleasantly down-to-earth and \"real\". The hotel is home to one of the hottest nightclubs in town (on the roof deck), and hotel guests get VIP access (no cover/no waiting in line). On the flip side, this means that the music is pumping until 1am on Thu/Fri/Sat, so I would not recommend this hotel to early riders or my grandmother.

Lots of champagne drinking at all times. The rooms are stylish but not over-the-top. The bathrooms are spacious, which I always appreciate. One of those fantastic touches is that non-alcoholic drinks from the minibar are free; I don't know why, but I find it incredibly luxurious to actually enjoy things from the minibar without feeling the fiscal guilt of $5 bottles of water. The gym is small-ish but adequate with some free weights, a smith machine, and cardio equipment. One caveat (and I hope management reads this): our room had a very sharp, angular, low wooden chest of drawers at the foot of the bed that is impossible to see in the dark.

We were most impressed. The only downside was that the drinks were way overpriced; we paid $29 for 2 cocktails in the Wine Bar.

I've been doing a TON of travel all year and in the middle of traveling around with the family but I had to fly to San Diego for business and looked online and decided to book here as the rooms looked amazing online. I was just in San Diego a few weeks ago before we headed to Hawaii and we stayed in La Jolla in another Hyatt property. This time I was coming alone and wanted to stay in a hipper setting. I haven't stayed in the Gas Lamp area in many many years. I booked online directly on their website and it was quick and easy. I booked and put in my AAA # so they included breakfast daily. Unfortunately my meetings were so early and I had a hectic schedule so I never had a chance to try out the breakfast there but if you are a AAA member I suggest you book with it. I'm also a Hyatt Gold Passport member so they offered to give me a free late check-out up to 2 PM but I was leaving super early in the morning to drive back to LAX so didn't get to take advantage of it. But good to know for you Passport members. The hotel lobby is really gorgeous and really hip. They have personal managers that meet you and check you in. I did the online check-in but they still took some information and my credit card info. They are super friendly and it's cool they offer you something to drink. I usually travel with my wife so I book a King suite but I was coming alone so I booked a Queen suite but online they had an option to upgrade to a King room if it was available for $15 more per night. I opted for that and got the upgrade so stayed in the King room. The really polite guy at the check-in walked me up to my room and showed me the room. The king rooms are really beautiful. He explained that all the non-alcohol beverages are FREE. As well there were some snacks free. Here is a list of things that they didn't charge for: Still water Sparkling water Sodas Tonic Water Ice Tea Cranberry Juice Granola Bar Chocolate Bar Chips Lemonade Orange Juice Coffee and Tea This was the first time I stayed in a hotel where they had this type of set up. It was GREAT. In most places when you pay $200+ a night they charge you $5 for a bottled water or a $4 coke. I really liked this concept of offering these things free. Not only that but the next afternoon when I finished with meetings, I was in my room and a knock on the door and a really polite girl came by to ask if I wanted any more drinks so she gave me 4 bottled waters and asked me if I wanted anyone else. Just a great concept. I never ate in the hotel but they had room service and a restaurant there. There are so many restaurants in the area within walking distance. Definitely hit the Quarter Kitchen restaurant which is down the street. Beautiful restaurant and great food. The shower was really great with high pressure and rainfall from the ceiling type set up with another shower as well so you can use both if you want. Just keep in mind the shower is right in the middle of the room and you can see it from the bed so keep that in mind if you are shy traveling with someone else that you don't want to see you naked. Really cool decor and also a comfortable desk and also a sofa with a large 50' LCD TV. I didn't watch much TV as I was so busy in meetings and when I was in the room I was working. The GREAT thing that I loved is they don't nickel and dime you and charge for wi-fi. They had free wi-fi internet as well they had a cable. The signal was very strong and I ran a speediest.net and get 3 MB connection. In the lobby they have a few computers with a printer so I printed my boarding pass for my flight. Just keep in mind there isn't much privacy there but good enough for checking emails and printing stuff. Everyone was really friendly. The hotel is actually quite big. I was surprised how many rooms it has. The lobby evokes a totally different feel vs. seeing the rooms once you exit the elevator but once you get inside your room it's great. The only funny thing is the elevators always had this scent of men's cologne so they must intentionally put some odor there to smell like men's cologne. I'm moving to San Diego next month and actually bought a new car last month while I was in town. It was in storage but I used it while I was in town. The valet guys were always very quick but just keep in mind it's pricey at $35 a day. I always tipped the guys each time I came back so it can add up if you have a car. But those guys were so quick and friendly you should always give them a few bucks. FYI there is no self parking so that isn't an option. I read some complaints that said there was lots of noise. I didn't find it noisy at all but keep in mind I was there mid-week (Tuesday and Wednesday night). I was on the 6th floor in room #651 and it wasn't noisy at all. The bed was really comfortable and I didn't hear anyone else on my floor. In fact, I think the entire 2 days I only saw about 3 other guests so it doesn't seem like it's so busy during the week. Definitely I'd highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again and recommend it to my friends or clients. Really cool hotel.

My only major issue was the noise..... On the booking, a quiet room was specified and to be fair, they gave me a street facing room on the 4th floor, so I did not experience any noise from the nightclub. The problem was that the orientation of the room meant that I looked out over a nightclub and a 24hr food place and the double glazing might as well have been non existent. It was OK Tuesday through Thursday, but I was there over the Memorial Day weekend, and the noise on the other nights was awful. Earplugs helped, but by no means drowned out all the noise.

The hotel itself is very modern - a style I prefer in my hotels - and the service is good. The front desk staff is very friendly.

I stayed there Sun-Thur so I didn't experience too much noise although on Thursday night there were a group of young kids who were very loud in the hallways late into the night/early morning which really ruined my sleep that night. The \"quiet\" room I had also was on the side of the hotel facing the street so there was street noise (buses going by, etc.) but it wasn't too bad as I live in a metropolitan area and am used to that. I really liked the layout of the room and loved how the bathroom was designed/laid out with the sink in the area near the bed divided by a glass wall so I could watch TV while getting ready. I also liked the speakers in the shower area so I could hear the TV while showering. The biggest nice perk is that all the non-alcoholic drinks and some snacks in the mini-bar are free which is nice. I was there for 5 nights so it was nice to grab a drink and not have to worry about an exorbitant mini-bar meal. I used the hotel's rooftop gym twice and it was very nice - not a lot of machines but enough if you run or do free weights. The rooftop deck is beautiful!

My husband I look young and he is a marine officer (and was often wearing his uniform). They never addressed us or even spoke to us. I saw them greeting several guests as they entered- offering wine and snacks. They never once offered a thing to us (and we stayed for almost a week). I do not know what it was about us, but we felt totally neglected. When I needed help with the printer, no one seemed to care that it wasn't working. It made the whole place seem snobby and uptight which led to an unpleasant experience overall. On a side note, the valet guys were usually very nice and helpful. I would never stay here again. We spent too much money to be treated the way we were treated. I would try someplace else (unless of course you are middle-aged and wealthy-looking I guess).

(The night before I stayed at Andaz San Diego, I stayed at Andaz West Hollywood... and the two hotels are totally different. Read my review on Andaz West Hollywood) The bad 1) Worst Check In Experience I've ever encountered. We waited for 10minutes to check in. We checked in at 12pm and the hotel staff told us the room wasn't ready yet because the hotel was sold out the night before and check in technically doesn't start till 4pm. My bf and I decided to wait for a room so we can clean ourselves up before we go to the zoo. We wait till 2pm in the lobby and no front desk staff gave us an update on the rooms or offered us a drink while we waited. So we decided to go to the zoo instead of waiting for the room. At about 4:30 we got a missed call from Andaz and I called them back and it appeared that we did not check in yet, however our rooms were ready. I was confused. 2) THe hotel has a nightclub and on Friday and Saturday evenings, it is full of people ready to go dancing and drinking. We got back from the zoo dressing like tourists and we found that you do not get service if you aren't decked out in a cocktail dress with heels or in a suit. No one opened the door for us and when we walked in, the door man asked \"how can I assist you today\" in a tone like, \u2018wtf are you guys doing here dressing like this\u2019? The next night my boyfriend and I got dressed up to go for dinner at Nobu and we found that we got better service if we dressed up. 3) They do not cash travelers cheques. When we went to cash one of our travelers cheques, the front desk agent was confused on the cheque and he went to ask another agent and the other agent said \"I don't know, I never cashed one before\". So he came back with the answer, \"we don\u2019t cash travelers cheques\". This is the first time that I was unable to cash a travelers cheque at a hotel that I stayed at.... 4) They offer complimentary coffee but why offer it if they don't refill it? We went to grab coffee and there was none in the pot. The front desk agent did not acknowledge us with the front empty coffee pot... but by that time my bf and I were already so disappointed with this hotel we didn't even bother asking them for more coffee. 5) When I went to go check out, the front desk agent (Phil) did not acknowledge me whatsoever. When I told him I was there to check out, he asked for my name and room. I told him my name and my room # and I told him that I would not be leaving my room till half an hour later. All he said was \"Ok, your checked out\". He did not greet me or asked me how my stay was, and instead I saw him on the laptop surfing when I was waiting for him to help me AND after he helped me. Five minutes later I went back to the front desk to ask them for a receipt, (I can't believe Phil didn't even offer me a copy of my receipt) and another check in agent help me. He told me that I was not checked out yet. UNBLIEVEABLE!!!!!! Apparently Phil did not check me out. (I was so upset, I asked the check in agent what his name was, and that how I know his name was Phil.) LOUD LOUD LOUD! We stayed there from Saturday to Monday. Saturday was horrible. When I was heading back to my room at 12:30am I saw a girl, drunk out of her mind, crawling in the middle of the hallway and screaming to someone to open the door room. My boyfriend heard people slamming the walls while he was sleeping. The hotel staff were very snobby, unprofessional and stuck up. They gave us a feeling like - you should tip me for opening the door for you, or you don't belong to this hotel because you are wearing shorts and a t shirt. This hotel is not catered to tourists but to locals who like to get dressed up and go to the Ivy Lounge and get really drunk and make loud noises in the hallways. The Good 1. Location was awesome. Central. Close to 5th Ave where all many restaurants and boutiques were. 2. Clean. Hotel was very clean and trendy. 3.

Our room wasn't ready when we got there so we left our bags with her as we went up to the pool to get some drinks and some sun. About 30 minutes later, Tasha walked up to the pool and personally handed us our room keys and let us know that she had put our bags in our room. COOL RIGHT!? BTW, for those who haven't been to the Ivy (It is now called the Andaz Hotel btw for those who didn't know), it has one of the best rooftop pools we have ever been to and trust me, we've seen some all over the country. The staff there is all very nice and friendly and might I add very good-looking. The room itself was perfect for a young couple like us. Quiet, romantic (we stayed in the Andaz Large King which had a glass-enclosed tub/shower adjacent to the bed) and some of the snacks and drinks at the minibar were complimentary. The nightclub was small but had a nice Vegas-like vibe going on. Perks for staying at the hotel: the front desk gives you a wristband that allows you to get into the nightclub and rooftop club free without having to wait in line with the other 100+ people! We went back and forth to both and had a blast! I could honestly go on and on about how great this place was but I will end this review by saying one last thing. Instead of calling us a cab to the train station, the hotel drove us there in their Cadillac Escalade, compliments of the hotel. If that won't get us to go back, I don't know what else will!

The party lasts till about 2am so you might be kept up until then--not a problem if you were out partying yourself I guess. Although close to the gaslamp district, the hotel is next to the salvation army, so the number of homeless folks that you see can ruin the atmosphere that the hotel tries to create. parking is $30 a night, but you can find parking at the meters. We parked at a nearby parking lot (on 7th and E) for $5 overnight (until 6am, but the attendant was nice enough to extend it to 7:30am for us. We were told we can park until 12noon for $10). If you park at the meters, make sure to look at the sign on the meter as to when street cleaning will take place (some will say tues/thurs/sat, others mon/wed/friday from 3-6am). If you park at the meters during street cleaning, you can get a ticket.

After having a little tour earlier last month I decided it was time for a stay to evaluate the hotel upon eventual pros & cons as I had to stay a day in SD anyway. I booked 2 Rooms on a Thursday departing friday. To say it upfront: I did not find too many pro-arguments. First, the web check-in did not work. Upon personal check-in I was explained that the rooms are not ready yet (12:15pm). I advised the staff that I reserved with an arrival time of 11:30a after arriving from a long haul ex Asia. Suddenly they found 2 rooms, though not on the same floor but so be it. Then they proudly mentioned I have been upgraded to a \"Loft\" to which I responded that this is not really an upgrade per se, I used a Diamond Suite Certificate and if they could elaborate what \"Loft\" means. It ended up being a regular room with a diverter in the middle and a desk/couch behind it. The bathroom was smaller than in the other (Standard) room. The second reservation did not receive a Diamond Upgrade. Also my \"Loft\" did not have a bathtub which I specifically requested. They offered a downgrade to a room with a bathtub - great option! The whole CI process took 40 minutes. An embarrassing situation to say the least and just proof of the low key performance many of the Andaz properties are providing on a daily basis. The parking is 30$ - not too bad for SD but not cheap either. Facilities: The roof is supposed to be the crown jewel of the hotel. It consists of a restaurant/bistro area, sitting area, bar and the pool with the well equipped but not very airy gym on the same floor. The pool is roughly 1.20m deep. To give you the picture, this reaches barely the top of my shorts. Swimming is possible on 2/3 length of the pool. Beware of your knees! My impression was, that the pool is more for a quick \"cool down walkthrough\" and \"cocktail hangout\" than serving its purpose as an actual swimming pool. There are ~ 7 sun beds, 3 Cabanas without shields and 3 half open sun chairs plus a sofa area with a TV. The Audio system surrounding the pool changed its volume level every 3 minutes - maybe they were probing \"The Apprentice\" for San Diego's DJ scene. The breakfast was served on said bistro area the next morning. Service was ok - not more not less. I am Hyatt Diamond so the breakfast was included for my room automatically, the second room had the breakfast included per the AAA Rate I booked. The bar staff created proper drinks. The food which has been ordered poolside was of good quality and freshly prepared. It missed the special touch regarding presentation though which somewhat would be expected considering the pricing model. We did not use the restaurant downstairs as we ate out but ordered a dessert later from room service. A chocolate tart that was supposed to come with Hazelnut Ice Cream. The night staff had their creative Thursday so they decided to substitute the Hazelnut Ice cream with a spoon of almond/nut mix. Nice try but that won\u2019t fly. After an interesting discussion with the room service operator the ice cream was delivered ~ 25 minutes later. Short before the cake dried out. \"The IVY Nightclub\" on the roof is one of the hip spots in San Diego - At least this particular Thursday night I could not tell you why. Maybe it gets a bit better once summer settles in and they don\u2019t need the heaters anymore. Guests receive a fancy IVY wristband so no ID checks etc are required anymore. You will get these starting at 8:30pm at the Front Desk. The beds are the biggest plus of the Hotel. Very cozy and comfortable. The bathrooms are compact but nicely assembled paired with hardwood flooring. Assorted bathroom amenities were available as well as plush bathrobes and good towels. All rooms are individually designed and in the hallways are original art pieces and individual carpets. The furniture already shows some usage but is still acceptable. Within the hotel there are certain sources of noise, the nightclub being one of them. Especially in the interior rooms with the windows towards the inside courtyard are in the target line of this. The carpets in the hallways are somewhat noise redeeming so that the guests returning from the various night venues are not alerting everyone on the same floor. The hardware is good - however the hotel seriously lacks in one important field and that is unfortunately in professionalism and customer satisfaction. There seemed to be no senior management on site. At least none that comes from a full service Hyatt. It was all pretty junior staff and the Andaz specific IT is not making their job easier. 3 hours after I left the hotel I received an email alert from my credit card the hotel just authorized more then 200$ - again. In the meanwhile this charge hit my account permanently even though the manager assured the reversal of the charge. The bill looks like a ping pong game as they already credited and debited my CC \"by accident\" more than 5 times. Greetings to the accounting! Bottom Line: It doesn\u2019t matter what demographic group you belong to - there are standards that a full service property in the Hyatt chain (even if under a different name) should fulfill. Servicewise, this particular place needs serious support from Hyatt Senior Management in nearly all fields of daily operation. From a professional point of view, the stay was a disaster. My friends enjoyed it though which I am very glad about and if you look at it the casual way then there is some leeway and the property get\u2019s away with some things. As a guest who knows other Andaz properties as well I can just say there is more than just space for improvement. When every second phrase has to be an apology then something is fundamentally wrong.

The room was beautiful and luxurious, if a little small. There was a great mini-bar, complete with some complimentary offerings such as soda, juice, chips, chocolate, and a granola bar. The bed was super comfy, except the pillows could have been a little firmer. The shower was relaxing. The free wireless was fast and reliable. There was also an ipod dock in the room. The coffee maker yielded just okay coffee, but it did the trick. The hotel also had a great little exercise room, with a few treadmills, elliptical machines and bikes, plus a couple of weight machines. Each machine had its own television and there were complimentary headphones provided. The machines all seemed very new and in great condition. My boyfriend and I treated ourselves to room service the first night and were floored by how delicious it was. The cheeseburger and mac 'n' cheese, especially, were exceptional. The $30/night for valet service seems pricey, but luckily, I didn't bring my car. Andaz's location makes for a very walkable vacation. I easily got to the zoo, Balboa Park, the Casbah, movie theatres, and tons of restaurants and shops on foot. The hotel was exceptionally quiet. I barely even heard other people staying there.

I reiterated with the assistant manager I was traveling on business and needed to stay within a specific rate. Thought everything was OK since 2 colleagues recieved hotwire rates even much lower. Instead I was hassled and basically told I was a liar about the agreed upon rate by the general manager. On my second day I was contacted to leave the hotel 3 times. I explained I booked for 2 nights and confirmed again my rate. Upon leaving the general manager looked at the note about my rate, noticed the exact agreed upon amount I mentioned yet INSISTED there was a mistake. I told him I was responsible for the amount above my already paid hotwire and he said the assistant manager who was not there should not have provided my lower rate. He then proceeded to bill me over $100 ABOVE the rate HE SAW IN THE COMPUTER SYSTEM. When I approached him about this twice he said the assistant manager was not there and that until he figured out why I received such a low rate he would be forced to charge my credit card. I mentioned again my two colleagues actually stayed through hotwire for a rate even lower and that I was willing to pay more just not the $100 more he was trying to charge me. I also mentioned hotwire was on the phone to confirm and he even has a note in system with the agreed upon rate. He said it is \"complicated\" because the manager should not have had the authority to do this. Essentially after the second time I stated it is an internal problem with the hotel and that he was essentially saying he did not believe the other managers note. His response was that he would not bill my credit card until later that day and confirm with the manager. So when I left I was charged over $100 above what was agreed and he wasted over 30 minutes of my time trying to explain this. I had an afternoon business meeting and left without continuing to argue since it was clear he was going to charge my card anyway. Terrible customer service. In addition the hotel was not that great.

Check in was a breeze: The staff noticed I was a Gold Hyatt Member and offered me a complimentary 2p check out (I didn't end up using it, but was quite happy with the offer). The staff escorted us up to our room and gave us all the instructions on using their complimentary Cadillac Escalade service and setting up a time for us to pick up our VIP passes for the club (included with the room). We ended up taking up the offer on the Cadillac service to and from a restaurant in down town and had great drivers that saved us the hassle of walking or cabbing, well worth giving them a tip! Location: The hotel is right in the heart of Gas Lamp. Tons of great restaurants, pubs and nightlife to get yourself into. We did end up at the roof top club of the hotel. It was a great time, but the drink prices were RIDICULOUS. A mixed cocktail (Crown & Coke) is around 12-15 bucks so most of our drinking happened before the club. However, if you are here to party on a Friday/Saturday night, it is well worth checking it out. Room: I was not a big fan of the room. We were in an Andaz Queen and it was real cramped (see pictures). The bathroom was also real compact and for some reason there was an open hole towel holder on the glass of the shower. This caused the whole bathroom to get full of water whenever we used the shower. I'm not sure about the other rooms, but I would probably consider trying to upgrade to a King if I stayed here again. Surprisingly, I did not here any noise like other reviewers from the night club. I think it all depends on where you are located in the hotel and we were on the 3rd floor.

They had great toiletries and robes as well as complimentary snacks and drinks (pretty rare for such a highly rated place). Definitely caters to adults as there is a \"booty kit\" with \"intimate\" items i found to be amusing :) At night you could slightly hear the music from the roof, but not bothersome at all as it didnt wake me from the little sleep i got anyway-- but i am a twenty-something (although not for long) :) Overall rooms were comfy, clean, and beautiful.

Also points off for a key-card fiasco at check-in that stranded many people trying to check in for hours (we didn't get into our room until 6 PM although we arrived at 3 PM, no offer to comp drinks, etc for that), and the fact that the pool/deck area on the roof which is one of the major perks of the hotel during the day allows SMOKING in all areas -- gross!", "Date": "February 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "san diego", "Title": "\u201cworst treatment I've ever encountered\u201d", "Author": "dasnake87", "ReviewID": "UR56054801", "Content": "The room, the hotel and the nightclub are very nice, However, if you plan on having people in your room after hours, I suggest you stay at another hotel.", "Date": "February 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcruciatingly loud hotel\u201d", "Author": "athenaert", "ReviewID": "UR55360647", "Content": "The hotel has three clubs and the techno music permeates the hotel rooms.
