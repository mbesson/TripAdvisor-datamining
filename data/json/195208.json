We don't complain about a lot of issues we encounter, we aren' the types that send food back when it's not perfect. But if we could, we'd send this hotel back to the pits of hell. I booked this hotel via Orbitz at the last second. I should have Googled around and found the other poor souls that gave money to this rent-a-slum. We checked in really late at night and the guy at the front desk was actually a very nice man. He must have been new and still had a soul. He mentioned something about us \"being disappointed in the end\" and I didn't get it. When a hotel front desk clerk basically tells you \"Welcome, it's all down hill from here\" that is a good indicator that something might be amiss. Ah, hindsight... The rooms, have no AC. After trying our best to walk quietly down the tiny hall with a full load of bags, we entered our cell. Out in the hall there was a tray of roomservice food that someone left over that was there for over 24 hours. The room was swealtering. After having the window open for 5 minutes, our room was full of bugs. So we had to close the window. We tried to sleep on what appeared to be a WWII-era bed. My pillow had what appeared to be dried blood on it. The bed had other people's hair all over it. At 2am our room was at 80 degrees so we had to open the window. However instead of the bugs, there were cats outside mating. Or maybe they were trying to tell us to leave. I don't know. We finally slept that night and promply woke up the next morning, went to an Internet cafe and booked another hotel. The \"free\" hotel Internet is really a 3rd-party Internet provider that the hotel pays. Well they didn't pay their bill and the Internet didn't work. We packed up all of our stuff and just left without checking out. We made it to the new hotel and called Orbitz to see if we could get a refund of our \"prepaid\" travel plans. At first Orbitz didn't see to cool with this. She called the Hyde Park hotel to cancel the remainded of the trip and had me on hold for about 5 minutes. She said that the hotel staff that she talked to were VERY rude and not helpful. She said that Orbitz would happily refund me the unused nights (4 less the 1 night in hell).
