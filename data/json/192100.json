We booked this hotel through 'just in time' hotel booking agency and decided on this hotel as it was central and with a small baby plus pram it meant less tube trips to the places we wanted to visit. We arrived in London at 9.20am and thought we'd call the hotel to see if it was possible to leave are luggage with them while we spent the day looking at the sights. They said it wasn't a problem. We arrived at the hotel at 10am where the receptionist was on the phone. She passed me to forms to fill in (still on the phone) When she finally got off the phone, I showed her my confirmation booking form (deposit had been paid) which she then told us, sorry we've no room here!!!!!!! She said she'll get on the phone to try and re-locate us. Anyway, to cut a long story short, the agency (which weirdly wasn't the one we had the name or number for!???!) blamed the hotel for the mistake and the hotel blamed the agency. The hotel also said that we shouldn't have had a booking as they don't have space for cots (cot required was written on our confirmation letter) We then spent almost 3 hours asking at every hotel we passed if they had a room for the night. All to no avail:( The hotel and the agency kept 'promising' they'd sort something out and that they would call me back. I chased and chased them by phoning for most of the day and it wasn't until late afternoon that they called me back to say they found a hotel but it was in Shepherd's Bush area, a 25-30 min road journey away. By this time are day had been ruined and I was getting quite upset by the whole situation, especially with having a baby to think about too. We told them that we didn't want the other hotel (they wouldn't give us the name of it until we confirmed we wanted it, again all a bit weird!??!) So the agency said they would send an email to confirm cancellation and refund our deposit. Today is Tuesday and I still hadn't had an email. I called the agency number that was on my letter and they had no idea that we didn't stay at the hotel. The said their report back from the hotel was that the booking went ahead and all was fine!! I explained that it wasn't and told her the story. Within an hour, I received an email confirming cancellation and refund. So beware....who was the agency that the hotel was dealing with over the weekend and why oh why would you take a booking and deposit when you no full well you can't accomadate people???

It was cheap for London, but not the best of standards. However the way that this hotel is being portrayed is, in my experience, monstorously over-exaggerated. I thought that the staff very good, they helped with a couple of things very sufficiently and were very polite. I found no fault in the people here at all - however there a number of things I noticed which let this place down: 1. the curtains in my room didn't close properly, but I never had any problem with the windows, 2. some of the windows panes were very dirty, but the net curtain was in reasonable condition, 3. the toilets were unusable, not because they're out of order, but because the windows are not frosted glass (meaning that people in neighbouring houses could observe your toilet activities), 4. the breakfast should have been more substantial... Overall I'd say that \u00a370.00, what I paid, was too much for something which was semi-standard. Although the bed was comfortable and clean. Overall I'd say that Boston Court Hotel could be a lot better if the owners took more notice of the issues raised in these reviews. 'Tis a shame, this place could be better. I found it comfortable and enjoyable enough, however the standard of the room and toilets is such that I'd expect better from a London hotel. Whether I'd stay here again is questionable, they'd need to improve the overall standard to make me come back here. But it wasn't all bad, and like I said, the staff are really nice and polite.

Perhaps the dirt was holding it in place. * the 'hot' water was tepid at best, even after running it. It wasn't hot enough to shave in but there was no plug in the basin either so being able to shave was just a crazy dream anyway. * the toilet hadn't been cleaned. It smelled. * the toilet roll holder was the metal sort you get in municipal public toilets. The toilet rolls weren't in it. * the bins hadn't been emptied since the last occupant. * the last occupant's towel was also still in the room. * even the kettle had water in it from a previous occupant. * the bed had only one pillow, no spares anywhere in the room. On investigation, this turned out to be two pillows, so old and flat and compacted that they both fitted into a single pillow-slip with space to spare. * there was paint on the bed linen. It had obviously been used as dust sheets during decorating, then put back into service as guest bedding. * the bedside light was broken. * there was a full size, noisy fridge in the room with nothing in it. I had to unplug it in order to get some sleep. * the shower, on a different floor, hadn't been cleaned. It contained hair from at least three other people. I had to clean the shower before I could get in it. * I had to climb up around 80cm just to get into the shower. * the TV didn't pick up any channels at all. I envy the other reviewers who got 50% reception. * the room furniture mostly consisted of a battered 'dressing table' (actually a desk), with chunks knocked out of it and burn marks on the surface. There was no chair or stool to sit at the desk. * the breakfast was one cold, hard-boiled egg, two slices of toast made of cheap, white bread (no option of brown), a slab of jam in a bowl, a plastic cup of cheap and bitter apple juice, and a couple of sachets of coffee and sugar. No teaspoon to make coffee or to eat the egg with. The toast arrived warm, which was a genuine surprise. I timed how long the breakfast took to arrive after me asking for it: thirty-nine minutes.

The reception is similar to what you would expect in a back street takeaway even down to the TV with only 50% reception. I was provided with keys with a tag held together with tape. Then the hotel room. Imagine a hostel somewhere in a third world country. Well now add the vision of one that has never been cleaned for a few months. In the corner of the room was the shower. A box with cheap doors that did not close painted in white gloss paint a number of years ago and now turned cream. The curtains were heavy with that feeling of dirt as they have never been cleaned. The carpet of the same standard. The TV again with the hotel standard of 50% reception however the worst of all was the bed. It felt like a rock the pillow thin and hard from many years of heads resting on it but oh my goodness the sheets were off grey and the bed spread the again heavy with the feeling of grime. I placed my own towel over the pillow to lie down and noticed the paper falling off the ceiling and walls with the very high standard of repair, parcel tape! The toilets were up one level.

The only soap available was five or six unwrapped hotel soaps stuck together in a pile on the soap dish. They had all been used. The shower smelled awful. The mattresses were painful to sleep on. The bedding was old and scratchy. The curtains were filthy. The springs in the mattress were broken, and the mattress was up against a wall with splattered stains. The windows didn't close all the way and the bar across the street stayed noisy very late. The fan provided was coated in dust. The refrigerator was rusted and smelly. We called the \"front desk\" at 6:30 am as we prepared to leave for a day of touring. We wanted to know where the iron was, which was mentioned on their website. The woman who answered, who had clearly been sleeping, said we could use the iron after 8:30. That's when someone would be at the desk. She was still in bed! We said we'd come get the iron ourselves, and she said no. Then we asked for new unused soap, and she said they did not have any. It was deplorable. By far, hands down, the WORST hotel I have ever stayed in, in my entire life.

I could not believe my eyes when we arrived at the most disgusting place I have ever seen. The carpets were filthy, the paint was peeling everywhere and the rooms were not fit for anyone. I had been looking forward to a weekend away at a reasonable price but that was not to be. I refused to spend 1 night there. When I told the receptionist that we could not stay there she couldn't understand what was wrong with the place. I asked how many stars the hotel had and was informed it was not an hotel, more like a B & B. There was nowhere to have breakfast and you had to have it in your room. We had to carry our suitcases up 3 flights of stairs only to come right down again. We were made to pay for 1 night even though we didn't stay and managed to find a very pleasant hotel round the corner. Owners should not be allowed to rip the public off by misleading advertising. This hotel should be removed from ALL internet sights. My so-called REASONABLE weekend landed up being quite costly.", "Date": "May 5, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Boston Court Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d192100-Reviews-Boston_Court_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$114 - $628*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">26 Upper Berkeley Street</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Westminster</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">W1H 7PF</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "192100", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/7a/82/7a821bad53704dad8c2aa7ce10d57eb41large.jpg"}}
