The tv had several foreign stations in different languages, even a Dutch one! The staff in the hotel was very friendly and helpfull with all our questions. Breakfast was different from what we are used to in other European cities, but we love to adept to local eating habits, so it was wonderfull, with the lovely Turkish bread, feta, cucumber and tomatoes. But for people who want their cereal or toast, this is also available on the buffet. The situation of the hotel was ideal: very near to a tramstop, but lots of things, like the Sultanahmet camii and the Hagia Sophia were in walking distance of the hotel. At the same time, it is quiet at night. At the last day we left in the afternoon, but after we checked out of our rooms, we could leave our luggage in the hotel, so we could do some more site-seeing before leaving for the airport.

We were very pleased with the cleanliness, the breakfast was nice, the reception area is small but comfortably furnished with couches and a big screen TV, We especially liked the free use of their house computer and it was very user friendly enabling us to keep in touch with our family every day.

Also, Piyer Loti street is not one of the nicest in the area.

When we arrived the temperature in the reception area was very very hot and was a bit scruffy.The welcome was pleasant and friendly. The air conditioning was not effective in the reception dining area and we felt that this may be a \"Hot Hell Hole\" for the duration. However, once we were taken to our room on the 3rd floor, I was very surprised as to how clean it was. It was spotless and the room air con was working fine, so even though the room was not very large, it was fine for the 4 nights. There was a restaurant in the hotel and a bar, but during our time there, we saw no one using either. Perhaps the heat / stuffyness in the hotel was enough to keep people out and not in !!. Breakfast was a weird combination of all sorts of things. The portable air con unit in the breakfast area was working, but we felt that the food had been out on the self serve area for some time (cheeses / meats / bread etc), so we were very cautious as to what we picked ( I did not really fancy a plate of olives for Breakfast). The coffee was almost undrinkable and my wife used her own English teabags. They did have a notice up to ask how the could improve the breakfast menu-but I did not make any suggestions as I forgot to do this. The location is brilliant for visiting the \"Sights\". Overall,we were happy with the stay, but only as a base to sleep. As the stay was part of a multi-location break, the cost was in with the package, so no idea what it would be to pay for this hotel as a seperate cost.If you are only looking for a clean, cool room to sleep, then it's great. For food and customer relaxing in the hotel public areas, then be careful, its not really the place to stay. It has free internet access on their public computer in reception, so good for keeping up to date with your emails. Staff were polite and helpful and so we were happy to put up with the other quirks as mentioned above.", "Date": "September 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Budapest", "Title": "\u201cGood three stars hotel\u201d", "Author": "karamella54", "ReviewID": "UR60531082", "Content": "I spent 4 nights in Golden Crown hotel with my husband. Previously I read all comments on this hotel, good ones and bad ones too. I was wondering what is the truth. Facts: very good location, 2 minutes walking to Cimberlitas tram station. 1 stop from Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia, Topkapi Palace, etc, 10 minutes walking from Grand Bazar. View is not the best - there was an ugly building on the opposite side, it's a factory or something like thet. Shops are near. Rooms and bathroom are very small - but clean and friendly. If you travel for a long time with lots of baggage you may have problems, we had only one bag and kept our clothes in it.... Breakfast: thay say it it an open buffet - I think it is rather an extended continental brakfast. One kind of bread , two kinds of cheese, boiled egg, corn flakes, tea, coffee, butter, jam, honey, cucumber, tomato, two kinds of olives, apple, orange. For two days we got a kind of frankfurter in a sauce - it was not good. Receptionists speaks english and they are helpful, waiter do not speak too much english ... If you like to stay in your room for a long time; if you have lots of baggages; if you want to dance in the room; if you like a buffet breakfast with a wide selection; if you want to spend your evenings in the hotel bar; if you want to swim - it is not your hotel. (Better to choose a 4-5 stars hotel for a much higher price) If you want to walk around in Istanbul, and only go to the hotel for bathing and sleeping in a clean room/bed, if you are satisfied with a simple breakfast, if you go out in the evenings, if you like to be near to almost everything, and if you want it all for a reasonable price, it's your hotel.", "Date": "April 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austria", "Title": "\u201cLocation, Location, Location - that's about it for this one!!!\u201d", "Author": "KiwiCoupleAustria", "ReviewID": "UR48230159", "Content": "My wife and I recently had a five day break to Istanbul. I read the reviews on this hotel and thought I would take a bit of a chance thinking that a hotel room is hard to stuff up - unfortunately I was so wrong. For starters we booked a double room and were given a twin room on the first floor barely above street level. After asking to be moved we got our double room on the fourth floor. Things were looking up, until we went to bed. The A/C barely worked (I can only imagine what it would be like in high summer) so the window had to be kept open. Unfortunately a large truck seems to pass every five minutes so ear plugs were needed. The bed was very old and tired. We had to sleep on top of the duvet to stop the springs sticking into our backs. After one of the worst nights sleeps I have had for a long time we got up and hoped breakfast would help - unfortunately they managed to stuff this up as well. They tried to be European but it was horrible. Not enough seats, not enough milk, only cocoa pops for ceareal. No yoghurt and some chopped up sausage represented the meat on offer. We actually stopped going to breakfast and went up the street to a fantastic Turkish patisserie. The service was OK if you could find someone that spoke Engligh - but still their English was better than my Turkish. This hotel seems to be popular with German tour groups and a mixed age group. But for the price we paid I would certainly reccommend going elsewhere.", "Date": "November 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol", "Title": "\u201cGood value budget hotel in centre of city\u201d", "Author": "emptynesterBristol", "ReviewID": "UR33855884", "Content": "We stayed here for 4 nights in June.
