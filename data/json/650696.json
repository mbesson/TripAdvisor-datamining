After reading the reviews on this page we were a bit worried about a lot of things. It even made me have doubts about if I wanted to stay here and not just go to a different place. On arrival there were two very nice English man. No their Englsh wasn't the best but they were very friendly and helpfull. After signing us into the big book they explained us the 'houserules'. We've been reading about these in the reviews as well. - Leaving roomkey when leaving the hotel - Receptiondesk closed from 1 - 6. Which means you have to be back in the hotel before 1 or stay out untill 6. - Breakfast is 5 euro per person per day - Lugageroom 10 euro per room When you know these things in advance.... No problem at all. (at least not for us) We were assigned to a room on the third floor. We took the stairs because the elevator is a bit shabby. (actually I'm just a easilly scared person ;-)) After arriving in our room, we were happily surprised. The room was pretty big and looked clean. We got a double bed, closet and our own bathroom with toilet, shower etc. It overlooked the streetside and therefor it was a noisy room. So. If you're looking for a cheap hotel, close to the trainstation (50m), shops and restaurant and about a 20min. walk to the old Rome.... This is the right place. Rome is a busy place with many many tourists. Even an expansive hotel will be noisy. For the two stars and cheap price this is a lovely place to stay! To reply to the things I've been reading here: - we didn't leave any of our money/passport etc in our room and just took it with us. So no robbery here - yes, the station area is pretty dodgy but I didn't feel unsafe for a second because of all the tourists (so no worries there) - the beds are really just fine! Clean, big, and no noise (at least not in our room) - the bathroom was fine and since it was in our room it was clean but just fine. (no smelly pipes) - no unfriendly staff. Just be nice to them and they'll be nice to you! Just.... enjoy Rome. Don't expact a 300 euro room and you'll be happily surprised!", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tirana, Albania", "Title": "\u201cgood for a couple of nights, if you need to use public transport\u201d", "Author": "Marin81", "ReviewID": "UR126917977", "Content": "this hotel is OK, if you are staying for 1 nights or 2. very very close to the train station. plenty of bars and shops around. cleanliness is acceptable, but bathroom very small, and a bit smelly due to pipes. beds are very unconfortable, and very noisy. however, for the price we payed (40 EUR night) was more than OK.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVanishing Money\u201d", "Author": "Raychel S", "ReviewID": "UR123121573", "Content": "it was hotel policy that keys are handed into reception before you went out so we always did so that the cleaner could clean the room, I had left our money in the suit case for safety in the room and we went out for our day trip.

Be prepared that your belongings get searched through really properly. Staff is rude, insolent and seems not to understand English in the case of complaints. The last night of our stay I noticed that one hundred Euro were taken from a little case keeped in the back of the drawer of the nighttable. It was was obvious that someone searched my belongings since all things were reorganized. I went to the manager, who played the incident down and told me to check my things thoroughly again - then I might find it. He did not take the matter seriously and talked down to me. However, I agreed to check the room again and told him to come back to him, whatsoever. Clearly the money turned not up and when I came back to him the next morning he became rude, insolent and seemed not to understand English anymore.

I booked this hotel as it was next to the train station ( with all the usual dodgy characters around, which mean't the entertainment was free watching from our window. didn't feel in danger walking around there as there were so many tourists), so it was easy to get about using the metro and buses. if you want luxury , you won't find it herer, but if you want a base in which to explore the beautiful city of Rome, it was a bargain.....clean and comfortable.
