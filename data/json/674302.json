Mr Hossini was working at the front desk. He was hostile from the very first moment. For example, he assigned me a room on the second floor (directly above the restaurant with the outdoor dinner seating) and when I kindly asked if he had a room on the higher floor he proceeded to yell and shout at me. He was saying that if I want a better room I need to come first thing in the morning (?) . This was not explained in a reasonable manner but in a shouting, aggressive, hostile way which was supposed to make feel like an idiot for even asking but in reality made me want to walk right out of the hotel. If this was not a business trip and my colleagues were not staying here I would have done exactly that. I came to the reception 10 min later to see if there was a print out for me and saw him just check in another person with the room on the 6 th floor. When I confronted Mr Hossini and and asked if it was true that the hotel was not full and that he just did not want to give me another room he said ' that's right'. He felt compelled to add that he did not like me from the moment that I walked in. If you decide to stay in this hotel, make sure to be on the 'I like you' list for Mr Hossini or you will be fed up with the stay before you even see your room.

A number of reviewers have stated that their bedroom was tiny. It's not. Yes, the rooms are small. This is Paris. I've stayed much smaller bedrooms and vividly remember kicking my toe on the bed at one place it was so small. This in comparison was quite roomy. I didn't eat the breakfast so I can't comment on that. I did grab something from a nearby cafe on both mornings and wandered down to Porte de Versailles enjoying the architecture and munching on a pastry. - The free WiFi was simple to log onto, fast and it worked. - The staff were helpful. - The room was spotless and cleaned to high standards. - The shower was challenging and sprayed in all sorts of directions but it worked. - Contemporary decor. - Reasonably priced for Paris. - Safe area.

Cons: The charming room was tiny, very tiny. The bathroom was tiny too. The bathroom door squeaked (and was at my husbands head when he slept, I feared I would wake him when I needed it in the middle of the night). I found the staff very unhelpful and at times rude. I did not know how to sign on to the internet. One man said you are already in as soon as you go on, while another knew nothing. He could also not help get on the computer in the lobby. I eventually figured out that I had to join a free French network to get on. They were equally unhelpful with the phone, not letting me use the lobby one to confirm a reservation or giving me directions on the room phone. After pressing random buttons I got through with the third button whatever that was. But the reason I would probably not stay again was the location. It was just too far from everything.

The hotel is a 30 second walk away from the metro station which is ideal for getting around the city. The hotel is not in the heart of the city and is towards the edges of the city center, however, the access to the metro being so close means that this is really not an issue. The rooms are not huge, but this is quite normal in European cities. However, the room was more than big enough with a double bed, desk and wardrobe. We went in February and it was very, very cold - the heating in the room worked very well and kept us warm enough. The bathroom was a decent size, with a good shower and was clean. However, the hairdryer did not work, which caused a bit of a problem for my girlfriend as she had not bought her own. We went down for breakfast one morning quite late, but within their advertised time. We were told that they had stopped serving breakfast. When I pointed out to them that we were in the advertised time, they had someone bring some up to our room. The breakfast room is down in the basement and is quite small. The choice is not vast but it is easy enough to find something you want. There are a number of bars/cafes near to the hotel. However, be sure to check the prices before ordering; my girlfriend and I ordered two large beers late one evening and were charged 35euros!!! Not quite what we were expecting, but we just had to laugh it off. We did find Paris very expensive in general, however the current strength of the euro does not help this. Our eurostar return was quite late in the evening, and the hotel kept out cases in a room behind reception for us whilst we went out sight-seeing for the day.", "Date": "August 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Casselman, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cPleasant Hotel next to Metro Station\u201d", "Author": "grmartineau", "ReviewID": "UR74898792", "Content": "Hotel is good value for money - very reasonable price for Paris.

The two supermarkets in the area were also a plus. While the rooms were small by North American standards, we knew to expect this of Paris going in.

To begin with, the receptionist felt comfortable taking a personal call while my wife, children, and I stood by for 10 minutes waiting to check in, get our room key, and take our luggage up to the room. Once we got to the room we noticed that the white sheets and comforters were not that clean. On the way to the shower my wife cut her foot open on an exposed screw sticking out of the carpet that used to hold some type of door stop. Once inside the bathroom, there was no shower curtain or anything to stop the water from the shower from going all over our bathroom and soaking the entire bathroom floor. The receptionists could care less about these problems. That was our first experience with the hotel. When checking out, things got even worse. My wife and I took a train to the hotel from the airport but decided to take a shuttle back because there was an advertisement for a 16 Euro (per person) shuttle back to the airport. We asked the receptionist to book the shuttle two days before checking out and the day we checked out we asked to confirm the shuttle and, of course, the receptionist never called to make the reservation. The receptionist then called the shuttle service the day we left and assured us that the company was reputable and reliable. The receptionist confirmed that the price would be 32 Euros for my wife and I and that the children were free. After showing up almost 30 min late, the shuttle driver charged my wife and I 60 Euros for the trip once we were at the airport. I told the driver that the receptionist at the hotel confirmed the price of 32 Euros and he said that the hotel was wrong. I can't believe the hotel would recommend and book us a service that ripped us off. So basically all around terrible service at this hotel.

The cleaning staff was fine (room was always kept by the time we returned each evening), but the reception staff wasn't very helpful. None of the people we encountered working the desk could speak any english (not that they should have to, but it's nice if you can get one that has english speaking staff). also, the day we were to leave we had an early flight and had to leave the hotel around 4AM. The main entrance is a sliding glass door entrance that is locked at night by the desk clerk. the only way to get in or out is for that clerk to let you in/out. we were on our way out and the clerk was nowhere to be found. took about 15 minutes of playing around with various controls behind the reception desk to find the right switch to open the door. once it was opened the clerk came out all surprised (i think he was sleeping in the back). so just be aware if you're coming or going quite late :)", "Date": "November 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cPleasant Stay\u201d", "Author": "live4kids", "ReviewID": "UR18861925", "Content": "For 2 adults and 3 kids, i had booked a double room and a triple room. when we checked in, the man in the reception mentioned that he could not give 2 rooms close together as the double rooms are away from triple rooms.
