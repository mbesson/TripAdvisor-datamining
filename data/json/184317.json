The hotel is handily located at the intersection of Oak Street and Marine Drive, on numerous bus-lines. As a frequent business visitor to Vancouver, I appreciate the quietly-understated ambience of the hotel: it is calm, unassuming, clean, and safe. Frankly, for a business traveller, this is the best deal going. The bellman / van driver, Jacky, cheerfully takes me to and from the airport, so that I might more conveniently board the Skytrain for downtown each morning. I come back to my room to discover a chocolate bar on the work-table next the telephone -- these folks look after their guests.

Urmilla in housekeeping, in particular, asked to make sure all was good and also helped with extra garbage bags, etc. to make it easier to serve team food. Hallways were uncomfortably warm. Rooms were much cooler. Beds really comfortable. White Spot restaurant was great. Our team needed a late dinner, right before closing. Restaurant took a last minute preorder after Boston Pizza refused to deliver based on proximity (order had been prearranged) I think the White Spot manager's name was Cassandra (?) - offered 5 suggestions for me to ask the girls during their time out - and then she had all the meals waiting when the girls arrived at 9:40. Made me look like a star mom! Parents ate at the attached pub restaurant. Again our server was exceptional, offering honest suggestions for food/wine selection. Good humour and promptness ... we weren't expecting much and she definitely added to our experience. Both White Spot and the Pub restaurant were very reasonably priced and well run. This is a nice, comfortable hotel with exceptional service. We've stayed at many hotels with our team and this one was the best yet for friendly, attentive staff. It's quite remarkable to have such consistently helpful service from all areas of a hotel: Urmilla in housekeeping, front desk people working after 5 pm, manager at White Spot, waitress at Pub Restaurant and also, the sweet Australian woman who took my reservation, suggested a banquet table to be put in our room for easier breakfast serving and the staff who made sure it happened without a reminder. I also observed the hotel manager, when his front desk clerk was dealing with a parking charge complaint over the phone and two teams were piling in at the same time, advise his clerk to refund the charge so as not to make a small issue one that would make us wait to check in (and probably increased the satisfaction of the customer on the phone).

At $95-115, it is relatively inexpensive for Vancouver in the summer (downtown hotels are easily 3x as much). There is free street parking and only $8 in their lot. (2) Quality. While it is not the Ritz, it is modern, clean, and well-maintained with free robes and fridges in the superior rooms..and super comfortable beds and pillows. (3) Convenient. They have a free courtesy phone in the arrival area and pick you up quickly. (4) Food. The White Spot Restaurant on the ground floor has great casual food for any meal and there are several fine dining places nearby. Tracey, the reservation manager, is a delight to work with and the desk is always helpful and efficient. If you are doing a day trip to historic Steveston (recommended), it is just a short drive.

It looks like it was built in the 70's and parts of every room were updated every decade. The bedding looked and felt like it was about 20 years old. That would have been the one thing I would have changed to make the room feel clean and cozy. Due to the fact that we got this room through a bid on Priceline the front desk staff was not very accomodating to the fact that I had requested 2 beds in the room and when I got there they had us slated for 1 Queen. They said that because we were Priceline we were only guarenteed a bed for 2. In the end I had to pay $10 to get a cot. I have never had that happen before. There is a White Spot Restaraunt in the lobby. They also say they charge $4 for parking per dayWould I stay ther again? Probably not.", "Date": "July 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cOkay\u201d", "Author": "cryetti", "ReviewID": "UR7571559", "Content": "OK stay.

Shuffle bus services starts from 5:00, every :00 and :30. If you are at the Vancouver south terminal (Domestic terminal) you have to dial for the service (phone inside building, find the code then dial). The front desk staff was friendly, helpful and speedy. Got to the room (on the 4th floor) it was big...ok, i had a double room all by myself so it's big. Went down for dinner, noticed it's till 10:30 (or was it 10?) so all those 30+ people arriving late won't be able to have dinner, which was unacceptable. Free wireless internet access, go ask the front desk for the password (or dial 0 from your room). There were 2 things I didn't like about the room, first was the noise, you can hear the traffic outside, plus if your next door or the room above you are taking shower, you will hear the water pipe noise; second was the hair on the pillow (eww).

It was 5 minutes from the airport and after a long flight, we were ready to settle down for the night. It turned out to be very clean and comfortable for the time that we spent there. After I made the reservation for the first night, I decided that I needed to go on Priceline again and get another airport location for the last night there. I again asked for a 3 star property, but decided to bid a little lower, ($60) and got the Coast Vancouver again. It did have free parking, but everywhere you go in Vancouver, there are warning signs about people breaking into your cars. This made me a little nervous, but I made sure that there was nothing visible from the outside and tried to park in a well lighted spot, and didn't have any problems. I almost wish that I had spent my entire vacation at this hotel. It is only about 15 or 20 minutes away from downtown. I stayed 5 nights at another hotel and paid over $100 a night more.

We asked for a quiet, nonsmoking room, and got it--on the top floor at the far end of the building. The room was large enough for us and our things, and the decent furniture included a round table with two comfortable chairs. The bathroom had plenty of counter space, and the shower flow maintained its temperature steadily. The king-sized bed was reasonably comfortable. The bed and bath linens were adequate, in good condition, and clean. As we'd been told, the room was recently redecorated, and everything promised was provided and in good order. The air-conditioning worked well and was fairly quiet. The coffee-maker worked well, and the small electric cooler (not, strictly speaking, a refrigerator) kept cool enough the few things we put in it for breakfasts and snacks. The draw drapes effectively darkened the room. Local phone calls and 800 calls were included, and the telephone took messages. Parking for our rental car also was included, and there always was space in the garage. A free newspaper was provided Monday-Saturday. Terry robes, an iron, and an ironing board were in the closet, and a hair dryer in the bathroom. The people working at the front desk were polite and helpful not only when we arrived and checked out but whenever we needed information. A laptop computer was available in the lobby for free use by guests (limited to 15 minutes when another was waiting). The housekeeping was careful, thorough, and timely. The hotel is not located adjacent to the airport but across the river in Vancouver, a better location for visiting the city. The hotel also provides free airport shuttle service every half hour on the hour and half hour. We rented a car from an Enterprise location very close to the hotel. All things considered, the Coast Vancouver Airport Hotel provided very good value for what we paid. In my judgment, the management is doing an exceptionally good job. A White Spot restaurant off the lobby provides both meals and room service, which can be charged to one's hotel bill. Service there was sometimes slow, and the food not exceptional value for the money.", "Date": "August 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Iowa", "Title": "\u201cNo Complaints\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4142242", "Content": "I had absolutly no problems.
