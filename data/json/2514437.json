It was a last minute trip and the weekend we went, almost every hotel was booked solid. After much thought, I decided on Eventi. We booked the room directly with the hotel online and I also became a Kimpton Hotel Member. When booking I mentioned this was a special trip with my BFF, we were in town to see Oprah and Marthat Stewart. It was also a belated birthday celebration. We took a red eye flight and arrived at the hotel at 10am Saturday morning. I knew the odds of being able to check in were slim but I tried. We were told the room was not available. We had a full day planned and needed to freshen up a bit before heading out. The front desk lady informed us the restrooms were on the 2nd floor. Their lobby is chic and welcoming. But it was inconvenient that the restrooms were on another floor. The service was lacking. Instead of offering to help us up the elevator to the 2nd floor, the bellman simply put our luggage on the floor in the middle of the lobby. Both my friend and I were a little taken back. Alas, we carried our luggage ourselves up to the 2nd floor and back down to the lobby. What should have happened - the bellman could have offered us one of the 3 luggage carts lined up against the wall or at least offered to help us up. We returned back to the hotel at 8pm after a rainy day of walking and visiting in the city. I must add that Kevin, the concierge was helpful and kind with giving us directions. I must also add that this hotel is in an odd location. The website says midtown, but really its Chelsea - in the middle of the fashion district. Macy's and Herald square was a shirt 4 block walk, and a 6 block walk to the Flatiron District. I digress - we had a corner room (deluxe king) We had no view and that was ok. The room was clean and actually a good size for NY. And the bathroom was great. The shower was large and roomy. My most favorite part - the bed!!! It was one of the most comfortable beds EVER. My friend agreed it was some of the best sleep she has ever gotten in a hotel bed. There is no room service aside from cheese plates passed 10pm. We were never around for their complimentary beverages in the lobby. But it sounded nice. I expected a little surprise, a treat, a chocolate, a bottle of wine....basically anything acknowledging it was a special trip and birthday weekend for my best friend and I. This is why I love Omni Hotels, because they go the extra step to make you feel important to them. We had very little interaction with the staff during our stay. We did like the fact that a well dressed \"security guard\" kept an eye on the elevators after 8pm. It made us feel safer. The two large gray bins of towels and sheets really could have found a better place to be stored instead of right outside our door. Beds are excellent! Room is clean. Very little noise factor (we were in room 1102) When we checked out, we asked them to keep our luggage because our flight only left at 3pm. Once again, no one helped with the luggage. And they actually left our bags sitting in the middle of the lobby for 5 minutes unattended. We decided we would return and keep this hotel as an option for the future. There is room for improvement in the service area.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington", "Title": "\u201cA great stay\u201d", "Author": "Helen C", "ReviewID": "UR127361782", "Content": "I was there for 6 days in March.

I am very fond of Kimpton hotels and the Eventi absolutely met my standards. Very clean and modern. Service was friendly and attentive. We had a cityview king room, which was small but adequate. The bathrooms are huge with a rainfall shower and no tub. Our room was on 18th floor with floor to ceiling windows and a great view of the Empire State Building. Nicely appointed with very comfortable beds. Located within a very short walk to Penn Station & Madison Square Garden. Not much in the immediate vicinity but within walking distance to a lot more. I love Kimpton\u2019s complimentary wine happy hour and the Eventi offered an acceptable choice of Chardonnay and/or Shiraz. The only problem I encountered was I was inadvertently charged for mini-bar expenses, but it was taken care of with a call to accounting. Also, if you are a member of the Kimpton InTouch Rewards program, make sure to inquire about your $15 mini-bar credit. I was not made aware of this until after I returned home and inquired about the charges on my account.

Eventi is in a 'middle of everywhere' location with a nice walk to Hell's Kitchen in the west, Chelsea and West Village to south-west and Flatiron District to the East. And R line takes you up to Bloomie's if shopping is your bent (we found a 20% off sale that meant it was better value than the closer Macy's). Getting to Upper West Side requires a change - but you can't expect to get everywhere in a big city without this. We found a Roastown outlet a little down Sixth for coffee and tea and a nice fancy food place where you could load up various meal options and pay by the pound (we had this for one breakfast, lunch or dinner on different days). The staff were unobtrusive but polite when encountered. The cleaners were attentive, thorough and cheerful. We had room service a couple of times (pot of tea) and while unusual to us as Australians, I guess it's accepted that you pay gratuity as well as a delivery fee and there's still a standing invite to tip on the receipt. Helpfully, a 20% gratuity was already included in the restaurant bill. The meals we had on our last night (as the rain poured down on the canopy, which helped create a lovely atmosphere) were what you'd expect from a hotel - nice enough but not earth-shattering. The G&T's were tall and strong. The most inconvenient aspect of our stay was the practice of freezing an additional $100 a night 'for incidentals' on our credit card beyond the full cost of our stay. Hotels in Europe (places stayed in London, Paris, Berlin, Munich, Warsaw, Athens, for example) don't withhold upfront the amount to be paid on departure, but it seems to be an increasingly common practice in Australia. We haven't stayed anywhere else in America so we don't know if this is something that happens across the industry here. However, in Melbourne, for example, while they withhold the full tote of the stay in advance, the hotels (2 we've stayed at) will only put a stop on your card of $50 to cover mini-bar/room service - and ask you to sign a confirmation. For our 8 night stay, $100 a night constituted a fair portion of our budgeted spending money that was then locked in the ether. This practice doesn't seem to be articulated on the hotel website, otherwise we would have been able to plan/budget for it or even chosen another place to stay where we could have had an extra $800 in our pocket while here. All fine to have it released for when we get home (no explanation about how long it might be to return it, and why not release it on a nightly basis if the incidentals are used? More convenient for the hotel not to) but would have been nice to have the money to access if we needed it. This was the service aspect that soured our stay and turned a Good rating to Average.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cTry a new location in New York City\u201d", "Author": "WhatsTheNextTrip", "ReviewID": "UR126997451", "Content": "We come to NYC several times a year and stay in a different area of the city each time.

The hotel entrance is on 6th Ave and the condo entrance is on 29St. We tried two different rooms -- the double queen facing west with views to the Hudson and NJ are bigger, while the king rooms facing east and with view of the Empire State Building are smaller. Nicely appointed. Evening wine and morning tea/coffee. Great staff at the desk; in the evening, a discrete \"house officer\" watching over those using the elevator. The location of this is very convenient, especially if you are arriving by train at Penn Station. The hotel is 1 block from the subway and an easy walk to Time Square and the theater district. If you like costume jewely, you are in the middle of the wholesale (most open to retail trade...talk them into 50% off the marked price) jewlry trade. All are imports...some stores from China and others from India. Korea Town is at 32rd St between 6th and 5th and that's interesting to try for dinner. Others a further walk away are east and north -- New York Public Library, Pierpont Morgan Library, and south -- Madison Park and Union Park.

Lobby - fairly small but tastefully decorated. This was the venue for the wine hour apart from one beautiful March evening where it was held on the terrace. Great lounge music played at all times. Staff - we found all the staff to be friendly and this created a homely atmosphere totally unexpected in Manhattan. Room - we travelled with our two teenagers so it was a little cramped but not a problem. Nice minimalist decor and a smart bathroom. Dining - we didn't try it. Rather than spend $15 per head on a basic breakfast we would use the nearest Whole Foods for morning pastries ( a few blocks south on 7th). Location - this was great and a short 5 minute walk to Macy's. The area didn't feel too touristy mainly due to the number of fashion wholesalers in the neighbourhood. However, it felt safe (unlike the area west of Times Square near the Port Authority bus terminal which had a number of high end hotels). There aren't a great number of restaurants in the area but Korea Town (basically one street) offered a great choice if you like oriental food. Be aware of the possibility that at some stage in the future there will be a residential condo building going up oppoiste the hotel. Other tips - we bought the New York Explorer pass which was about worth it. It did have a guidebook containing a 15% discount at Macy's which we used throughout our visit.

I booked online and had booked, what I had assumed, a AAA rate. My reservation also said so. This rate included free parking ($50 normally), so it seemed like a good deal. The hotel is on 6th ave and 30th st. Very well located. We arrived at 8 PM. Valet was there to take our car. On check in the the front desk lady was behaving a bit cold. Maybe it was a long day for her. I told her that we had the AAA rate where the parking was included. She said, no, that was not the case. They had a separate parking inclusive rate and the AAA rate had no parking. I tried to argue but saw that it would lead nowhere. So I requested her to change our rate to the parking rate, which also she said we could not. Had to be done before hand. Not wanting to make an issue about it at that time, we took our keys and headed for the room. We were on the 19th floor. The room, for NY standards, was pretty decent size. As was the bathroom. Beds were comfortable. Free internet as I was a kimpton loyalty member. Post check in I decided to write to the loyalty club about my issue. Next morning I get an apology response from the loyalty club. She wrote to me that she had seen the webpage and agreed that it was confusing and that I was not wrong to assume that parking would have been included in the AAA rate. So she had spoken to the hotel manager and ensured that we did not get charged for parking!!! But that was not it. Due to the trouble that I had to go through they comped me 1 night at the Eventi for use anytime in the next 6 months!!! This was amazing. Such high level or service has pretty much ceased to exist in the US or for that matter anywhere in the world. I was amazingly surprised and sent her a thank you mail. This action has made me a kimpton loyal customer. The hotel itself is very nice. They have a free wine hour in the evening and free tea/coffee in the morning. It is located in the heart of manhattan. It is a 10 buck cab ride to downtown or the central park area. And enough eating option within a 5 block radius. The bell staff is very professional and courteous. The only thing is that valet takes about 20-30 minutes. But I guess they must be parking a bit far from the hotel. The hotel also has an attached parking garage at the back. Dont know the rate for parking. The best part is that the hotel is not overpriced. Our rate was 300++. For manhattan this is not bad at all. A lot of other average hotels charge more than this.

This was our 5 stay and a Kimpton hotel but was the best yet, highly recommended. One thing the hotel is very close to Penn Station (5 minute walk) and I'd recommend getting the train into the city via Newark airport. I have previously got a taxi and paid $70+ for a very long and tedious drive into the city. The train took less the half the time of the taxi and was $50 cheaper for the two of us.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liberty Township, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, nice rooms\u201d", "Author": "tbtrips", "ReviewID": "UR125617520", "Content": "This was a great location for our weekend visit to NYC.

The hotel was recommended by the group hosting the meetings I was attending. We received a substantial discount off of the rack rates, which in retrospect was a little surprising. I arrived very early on a Wednesday, getting to the hotel at 11:00 AM. I did not expect to get a room that early in the day, but to the credit of the person I spoke to at the front desk they made an attempt to find me one. The hotel had been fully booked the night before and was fully booked the night I stayed. While they couldn't completely check me in that early they got me 90% of the way there and were able to provide me with a room when I came back from lunch at 1:00 PM. I was quite pleased. The lobby is smallish but very comfortable. I was able to return some e-mails and make some calls while I waited on my room to become available. The slightly-too-hip electronica-heavy Muzak was a little loud, but bearable. The room I stayed in was on the 6th floor with a view facing away from 6th Ave. It was nice and quiet, with a window that partially opened. The room was smallish, but very well appointed and attractive. The bed was very comfortable. The flat-screen TV actually showed HD programming (what a concept!), literally a first for me. While the screens are ubiquitous, it seems like it is not a priority among the hotel chains to deliver HD content. The bathroom was nothing short of spectacular with a walk-in shower and beautiful marble tiling. It was impressive (although better water pressure would have been nice.) The closet was very shallow and appeared to be a little bit of an after-thought. The desk was also very small and would not have been conducive to doing a lot of work there. There was a small easy chair in one corner, but as the room was small it did not seem to fit in the overall scheme of things very well. The location cannot be beat. It's just a couple of blocks away from Times Square and as convenient to everything in Midtown Manhattan as any hotel that I've been to in the area. There are plenty of places to ear nearby, including a couple of surprisingly nexpensive options, including a small food court that is next door. This is probably not a great hotel for an extended business stay, but is perfect for tourists wanting a nice place to stay or for a short-stay business traveller.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northeast, United States", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, but stay in a suite for the best experience.\u201d", "Author": "JoshC87", "ReviewID": "UR125419627", "Content": "I loved the suite here, it was very well appointed, the view was a New York City dream, and the bathroom is memorable, all in all, Eventi is the epitome of casual luxury.

The bathroom amenities were some of the best I have found at this price point of a hotel. The bed was comfortable and sheets were soft. The two best attributes of a hotel bed. Room furnishings were trendy but comfortable. Some places seem to get caught up in the trendiness of the room and forget it should be comfortable. The Eventi figured out how to marry the two. The staff delivered a very nice amenity plate for another guest's anniversary. We assumed they just mixed up the trays and come couple down the hall got my wife's birthday cupcake.

It has a slightly dated 80s feel but is a stylish and welcoming hotel, well-placed for exploring Chelsea and midtown. Madison Square Garden is around the corner and Times Square was only a 15-minute walk. We upgraded to the Live suite, 2 large, interconnecting rooms on the top floor looking out at the Empire State Building. Mesmerising view. The pool table in the room was popular with our young son, as was the enormous TV. We were happy with the accommodation although slightly disappointed that neither of our two bathrooms contained a bath, just 2 huge showers. We did, however, have a baffling and annoying experience on New Year's Eve which although rather trivial somewhat took the shine off our stay. Our suite contained two substantial mini-bars stocked with all kinds of booze and snacks - not just beers and miniatures of spirits, but some half-bottles of vodka too. We decided to have vodka and tonics with our friends before we went out to celebrate New Year's Eve. Oddly, there was no tonic, or any other mixer, in the mini-bar. We decided to have beers instead, but there was no bottle opener in the room either. I called the front desk to ask them to bring a bottle opener up and some mixers for the mini-bar, but was told \"sorry, we don't do mixers.\" I asked why not, and whether we were expected to drink the spirits in the mini-bar straight. They apologised and said it was hotel policy not to have mixers in the mini-bar, we would have to order drinks from the bar. I tried to get some vodka and tonics through room service but was again told: We don't serve mixers. I wondered if I was missing something - surely tonic water isn't an unreasonable request in a 4-star hotel. Eventually they somewhat reluctantly agreed to see what they could do and said they would send somebody up. Eventually a guy came to the room with a bottle opener and a tray randomly containing a glass of cranberry juice, covered with cling film, a small bottle of tonic and a bottle of soda water. He was polite but seemed bewildered as to why we would want any of this stuff. We asked if we were the first people ever to ask for mixers in this hotel and he said we were. The mini-bar only had so much space, he said, and we could't expect it to include everything. We had to sign for our tray of mixed mixers, and it was added to our bill. Apart from this odd episode, most of the staff were helpful, especially the guys at the door, and we had a good stay. Room service breakfast was pretty good. There's a 5 Guys burger joint around the corner which I highly recommend, and you can stroll to the beautiful HighLine walkway in 10 minutes or so - a must. We also visited the bar at the nearby Ace Hotel one night - we had considered staying there so were curious to see how it measured up. It's a hip, young and lively place with a drinks list that includes beer cocktails. They were also well-stocked with tonic water.

We left for the day and asked them to clean it, but when we returned at night all we had was turn down service and a still dirty bathroom. It wasn't a big deal to clean it ourselves, but for the price they charge, the room should be clean when you arrive and should certainly be clean after you point out that it wasn't up to par. My only other advice is to avoid room service. I tried twice and had two absolutely awful experiences, including waiting 2 hours for breakfast that was supposed to arrive in 30 minutes. I understand things get backed up, but we were repeatedly told that our food was on the way when it clearly wasn't. Worse, when the food arrived, it was missing part of the order as well as things like milk for coffee. We ordered breakfast at 10:15 and had to get an extended checkout because our food still hadn't arrived until well after the noon checkout time. They comped the meal, but it doesn't really excuse the repeated lies about the status of our order. Bottom line - great hotel, lousy room service, questionable housekeeping (at least in our instance). Nothing is perfect, so I'd definitely stay here again and just avoid room service (which is what you SHOULD do in NYC anyhow, but sometimes it's nice for breakfast).", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boca Raton, Florida", "Title": "\u201cImpeccable Service\u201d", "Author": "Lesley A", "ReviewID": "UR122354815", "Content": "I have stayed in many cities around the world during Christmas time and have to say service is typically lacking, no matter how fabulous the hotel.

Since I have pets, my first go-to hotel was a Kimpton. And let me start by saying this: most hotels say they are pet-friendly, meaning they allow your pets for an extra charge, non-refundable deposit, along with a list of rules of what you can and cannot do, like leave them alone in the room. The Kimpton is such a refreshing change from all of that. They welcome pets with open arms, no extra charges, no rules. As it was explained to me at the hosted wine/cocktail hour nightly in the lobby, is that the hotel is family friendly, including the fur kids in the family. The concierge also told me that if I had meetings or had to leave my dog in the room, to let her know so she could arrange for someone to come and walk her. Seriously. So refreshing. Am scratching my head reading the reviews about how this is not a good location. Having lived in NY for years and know the city well, I am more than familiar with the landscape, I booked this particular Kimpton because of the area. If you are hemming and hawing about what location is best for your visit, I have to say that this is a great one. The hotel is on the northern tip of the Chelsea neighborhood, a hop skip and jump from Herald Square, Macy's and the great shopping along 34th. It's also about 10 blocks from Times Square, 5 blocks to the Empire State building. There is a major subway stop 3 blocks from the hotel, where you can catch a number of trains that will take you anywhere you want to go...down to Soho and the World Trade Center, and uptown to Central Park and Rockefeller Center. If you walk down 6th Ave 20 blocks you're in the village. AND it's practically around the corner from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden, if you have plans to take a train anywhere, and MSG if you're here for a sporting event or concert. True, this hotel is not in the middle of a famous authentic NYC neighborhood, but the pay off is that you can get anywhere fast and easy. Check in was easy and quick. Booked the lowest level King room, and it was a typical small NY hotel room. After settling in, I realized the heat and a/c was not working and the room was getting colder. The maintenance man was there within a few minutes and I left him working on the problem. I went out for dinner, and they left me a note telling me they had to change my room since the problem couldn't be fixed, and then upgraded me to a suite at no charge, for my 'troubles'. Now *that* is how you take care of your guests. The rooms are very nice. Current without being too trendy, and stylish without sacrificing comfort. The bed was very comfortable. One of the nights I stayed happened to be my birthday. When I was checking in and showed my photo ID, the woman at the front desk noticed and wished me a Happy Birthday. Well, on my birthday, they sent me a bottle of champagne along with strawberries and two cupcakes, all complimentary along with a handwritten note saying they hoped I was enjoying my stay while things were getting worked out at my home. The hosted complimentary wine/cocktail hour is also a good bonus. It was so nice to come back to the hotel exhausted after a busy day to get treated to wine and nice conversation.

Location nice especially if you want to branch out from the Central Park -Times Square areas. This is just a short 3-4 minute walk to Macy's Herald Square and subway. Walking back and forth to Times Square is doable but it would be a long trek. Maybe walk there and return by subway or cab. Arrival: The bellman was on watch and collected our bags from the car upon arrival. The hotel desk staff was helpful and offered to send someone out to purchase a neck pillow for me. I didn't take them up on it but the offer to buy the pillow was thoughtful and above the call of duty. To the room: The hotel is a little dark from lobby and into the rooms. It's decorated in warm dark colors and also dimmed lighting used. Those damn new lightbulbs are awful. Our rooms appeared well kept, clean, even the remotes looked clean. Over all, they need more light shed in the sitting room, bedroom and bathroom. I am not a fan of feeling like I'm in a bar all the time. The one bedroom premier suite seemed a little cramped but had a large marble bathroom with, hallelujah, plenty of counter space and storage. A full size tub with a separate large shower with both a rain head and a regular shower head. It made up for the slightly cramped suite. I have to remind myself that it is NYC and spaciousness isn't easy to find at any price. The sitting room has a chair and a small sized sofa with a flat screen television (tv in br also) with a real door separating the sitting area from the bedroom. But there is a slight feeling that you are dodging furniture to move around more so if both people try to move simultaneously. One double doored closet is provided in each of the two rooms with a motion sensor light in each. The bedroom is snug fitting as well, it's a more than a little cramped if two people are trying to maneuver at the same time. Sound: Here is where i get really critical. I don't live in a city or even a town. I'm accustomed to quiet and it is difficult for me to sleep in the city. As long as it's a constant hum i'm not too troubled but I always ask for the quiet room. The front desk clerk didn't take this to heart. This hotel sits next to a plaza that is part of the hotel property and it is made available to the general public. First blush, that is great!! However, they allow skateboarders. Okay during the day and early evening, fine. However the skateboarders are there at night, late night to 1AM maybe later. The clerk put us plaza side on the 6th floor which one would think would be the quiet side of the hotel. It sounded like people wheeling suitcases over cobblestones and echoed between the canyon of the two buildings. You could hear their voices, but is was the wheel noise that did me in. The staff was amazingly accommodating and understanding. They insisted they were wrong to put us in a 6th floor room and moved us to the 20th floor the next day. They explained they make the plaza public, but I think they did ask the skateboarders to leave that night. I wasn't thrilled about changing rooms but did so for the sleep. However, even on the 20th floor while dozing at around midnight the next night.... here come the skateboarders again. Even on the 20th floor you can hear them drop the board, roll across the concrete, and then hear them land on every jump. It wasn't as loud as the 6th floor room but it made it slightly difficult to get to sleep. When you're paying 6-700 for a room ... So to sum up, NYC has a lot of hotels. While this is a good one because of lighting, and noise on the plaza I would probably find another place unless I wanted to be near Macy's, Penn Station, or Market Square Arena.

The view did not disappoint: a very large (by NY hotel standards) corner room with an entire wall of windows that felt like you could almost reach out and touch the Empire State Bldg.

I found most of the front desk staff to be polite but just going through the motions when it came to service...there seemed to be a generally disengaged attitude. Despite my calls about the room not having been cleaned, no one bothered to mention until my last night (and there was no operational instruction or literature, either) that the maid service/privacy light system on the door was somehow left on when I checked in and stayed on the whole time. My daily newspaper never arrived once during my stay, even after I called twice to let them know. On my last night, a bottle of wine and some cheese straws were delivered with a note of apology from the manager, which was a nice gesture and acknowledgement of the service issues. It's a very convenient location to many Manhattan attractions, and the small, in-house spa and its staff is comfortable and welcoming for a facial or massage at the end of a day of shopping and sightseeing.

Water pressure could be a little better, but nothing that would stop me from coming back! and I always love that I have my favorite snacks waiting for me when I get in my room...Kimpton In Touch is great for that! The bar and restaurant is full of energy. Great lounge seating up there as well. It's a nice place to meet someone for a drink...when I'm by myself, I love going downstairs in the lobby for wine hour! Seriously, where else can you get a glass of complimentary wine every day! And complimentary coffee in the morning on your way out the door! Love it! The location is wonderful too...depending if you have business in midtown or downtown, you are in the right place...it's a straight shot up 6th into midtown and a quick turn back on 7th to head to downtown. Starbucks next door, shopping and plenty of restaurants in walking distance and if you need a taxi, the bellman are fantastic (and so friendly as well!) I really can't say enough about this hotel. When I walk in, I always feel like I'm coming home.

The room is a little small but from what I understand about New York this is the standard and it is was only the two enough and it was nice and cozy. The bathroom was modern and spacious this would be the one spot that we had issue. I am not sure if this is a standard for NYC as well but the water pressure in the shower was sooooo weak. I am someone that loves a hot powerful shower in the morning so I would have loved more pressure. As many of the other reviewers have written the beds are awesome and so incredibly comfortable and my request for feather pillows was accommodated. We didn't eat at Bar Basque but I heard other guests talking about and they had good things to say. If you want a good casual place nearby I would suggest Hill Country Chicken by Madison Square Park.

A few easy walking blocks to the Empire State Building and to Times Square and to Penn Station, our party of 4 loved the location. For those who want to do some shopping, there are numerous wholesale jewelry and purse stores (that will in fact sell to the general public) surrounding the hotel. Staff were professional, friendly, and efficient. We booked through SniqueAway and are disappointed that we were not able to take advantage of the free parking coupon offered on TripAdvisor (found only after our return home). Valet Parking for an SUV will cost you $65/day, which according to the staff is what all the hotels charge. Check for the free parking special on TripAdvisor by going to the Eventi website. Quiet hotel but you may want to choose a room as high up as possible. We were on the 15th floor and both our parties were disturbed throughout the night and early morning hours. The first night there were skateboarders using the courtyard area below. On the Sat. evening it was the pounding music from Bar Basque below, which lasted till about 4am. I used ear plugs but the thumping sound could not be obliterated. Enjoyed the wine tasting hour in the early evening and the coffee availability in the mornings down in the lobby. Fruit-infused water was always available also. Nice touch. Bathrooms are roomy, beds are comfy, great reading light at bedside, and very clean. One thing we noticed was how difficult it was to catch a cab outside the hotel. Not sure why this is. On a couple of occasions we gave up and hopped the subway rather than wait for a taxi to get hailed down. Acquaint yourself with how the \"gypsy cabs\" operate. You can usually get one hailed down but make sure you negotiate your price, otherwise you will undoubtedly get overcharged. The hotel staff will educate you if you are like us and unfamiliar with the operations of these cabs. Pets stay free! Check out the website on what they can offer for your pet. We only encountered 1 small dog so it isn't as though the place is over-run with animals. Take time to find the HighLine (walking distance from the hotel) and stroll along its path.

OK, small inconvenience. Later that evening when we returned after the event that brought us to NYC, we turned on the TV and the sound was uncontrollable, ranging from silent to so loud it would disturb the neighbors. We reported it the next morning, and an engineer was dispatched to fix it. The sound then worked, but now picture reception was sketchy. After check-in, we noticed when we got to our room that the key folder indicated we were staying for one night, so we called the front desk and reconfirmed that it was two nights. However, when we returned to our room the second day, the keys wouldn't work--presumably because they had been programmed for a one-night reservation. So we had to go back to the desk to get our keys reprogrammed. Also, the elevators seem inadequate for the building--we always had a long wait, and the cars were always crowded. Sometimes we would have to wait for a second or third car. Again, no big problems, just a series of niggly annoyances. The hotel is in a great location, especially if you're an Amtrak traveler to Penn Station. Our cozy corner room had an extremely comfortable king bed, and the room was well designed with a fabulous, large bathroom.

Allow me to describe why: 1) The staff at the Eventi was both very courteous and friendly. I had alerted them in advance that I would be arriving from Montreal to celebrate my girlfriend's b-day. When we arrived at the front desk, Omar wished my girlfriend a happy birthday before we even exchanged one word. Omar, you are the best. Your timing couldn't have been better! Second, on that same evening, we were greeted in our room by a gentleman who brought two champagne glasses, a box of chocolates, and a nice bottle of bubbly. No, not the cheap kind either. Did I mention that he also brought a beautifully enveloped letter with b-day wishes? Needless to say, this was extremely appreciated. Finally, Omar was kind enough to upgrade us to the 22nd floor overlooking the city...absolute bliss. 2) The hotel's amenities were top-notch (Etro soaps, gels, and hair products; nice gym facilities with the latest cardio machines) as was the complementary wine hour on the terrace, the latter which is on the 5th floor, beautifully furnished and giving gorgeous views of the city (incl. Empire State Bldg). Hipness factor indeed. 3) Location: The hotel is centrally located and every cool neighborhood is easily accessible by foot or subway (on 28th Street). I hope that potential travelers will find this review useful. I will no doubt return to a Kimpton hotel and urge others to do so. You will not regret it!

I stayed at the Eventi based on a family recommendation and followed up with reading the reviews here. I had a huge concern over the bed bug issues associated with many of the hotels in NYC. for this trip. I had narrowed my choice to either the Four Seasons or the Eventi. I choose the Eventi because of the reviews, and the slight cost difference, as I knew I was pretty much only going to be at the hotel to sleep and change clothing, This was a mother-daughter shopping trip. So the good about the Eventi: valet parking was great, hotel staff was wonderful, both in accommodating our needs, booking theater tickets, recommendations, etc. Parking was free with our rate. The ok: neighborhood was just ok at best. The room, ahhh the room--not what I expected. First, when we entered the room I was really taken back by how beat up our room looked. Chipped and nicked furniture, dingy curtains (they had that greasy feel curtains get when dirty). For a hotel just over a year old, the room was not in great shape. Upon opening the mini bar to place a drink in, we found an old carton of milk, obviously someone bought and left. And when we went to use the bathroom, there were still magazines on the floor in the potty room. I immediately called the front desk, and they did move us. But it did take a little bit better than an hour to make the move. I was pretty annoyed as we had plans to meet someone at a certain time, but wanted to get settled in the room and put away some items that I needed to place securely in our room safe. I was just about to check out (had already called the Four Season who had the availability), when they came and moved us. They did apologize and sent a bottle of wine to the room with a nice note. Booked an executive one bedroom suite--small and VERY DARK. They went way too far in the atmosphere department, and in the evening you can't see a thing in the room. Also, I would have expected their suites to be a bit higher up in the building. The bathroom was ok, potty in a separate room, but the shower is open, so while the bathroom is fine for couples, it isn't great for ladies traveling together. They saw we had three in our party, yet I still had to call downstairs to have them make the sleeper sofa. The second night, when returned to the room late, I expected that it would have been pulled out and ready for us, however it wasn't and we just moved all the pillows from the sofa ourselves and pulled out the bed. Perhaps I expect too much, but for almost $1350 for two nights, I do expect a bit more.(Had I choose to stay at the Four Seasons, the difference would have been another additional $475 for the two nights--wondering if I should have just went with that option) As I said the staff was great, but the rest was ok at best.

If you really need cell service while in your room, I would recommend asking at the front desk for a room that has a good signal.

We arrived early and stowed our luggage while we went and explored the city, I found the staff to be very welcoming and accommodating. Eventi, certainly lives up to its 4-star boutique hotel rating with one of the most sumptuous and seductively inviting lobby and common areas I have ever seen in a hotel. Modern, chic, unique, and most importantly functional. When we returned a bit early from exploring we were happy to find that our room was ready an hour early. The attendant gave us a brief orientation to Kimpton properties; the free happy hour, Saturday nightclub (free entrance, front of the line for guests) and hotel amenities which was nice. We had a King room on the 10th floor with floor to ceiling windows looking out over Ave of the Americas. There was ample controls in the room to control the dimness of the lights, it was perfect for us but I would imagine some older or hard of seeing guests might think the rooms to be a tad dark. The rooms were slightly above average in size for Manhattan though equally luxurious and modern, with high thread count sheets, soft mattress cover, and thick comfortable duvets. There was a wall-mounted flat screen TV with more channels than typically offered, in particular LOGO a nod to the chain's gay friendliness and HBO. There was the free internet with Kimpton intouch. Eventi had a nice workout room with fresh fruit, complimentary towels, built-in cardio TV, and lots of clean functional equipment. By far the nicest hotel gym I have ever come across. However, the cardio equipment is placed in front of those floor to ceiling windows, and under BRIGHT fluorescent lighting which makes it super hot while working out. The room is air-conditioned but they may want to consider fans pointing at the cardio equipment that guests can use if needed. Staff was friendly but not overbearing. Provided some good brunch recommendations nearby. Complimentary happy hour was to die for. Nice selection of sangria, wine, and beer served in the lobby for an hour. Hotel was walking distance 5 min to subway and Penn Station. Maybe 10 minutes to Times Square ,15 to the theater district. 5 minutes in the other direction got you to the heart of gay Chelsea, with bars, cafes, and boutiques. Property was very safe obviously, first night when returning at a late hour despite the lobby still being buzzing they requested to see our room keys to make sure we were guests. Recognized me the second night so didn't bother which was cool. The only nitpicking I can do is that the iHome clock radio and charger on the nightstand didn't work. Small detail but significant when the hotel sets the bar as high as Eventi does. I was okay with the $0.49 charge per page to print however I thought $6.95 for 15 minutes on the computer in the business center was a bit exorbitant. Eventi has a minibar in the room, which is great, but stuffs it full of their own overpriced products. Therefore there is little to no room for water and things you bring in yourself. Lastly, I heard, MUCH, more road noise from the 10th floor than I would have expected in a hotel this new. Same goes for the shudder of the air-conditioning switching on and off through the night. Neither of these prevented me from sleeping but they were noticeable. I would certainly return, and the hotel wasn't a bad value even without the coupon.

The washroom was a nice marble floored and tiled room. The only issue was that the floor was quite slippery. Due to the design of the shower, which is open to the rest of the bathroom, water tends to get pretty much all over the bathroom if you are a messy showerer! The rooms were clean beds were well appointed with nice linens, double curtains, individual climate control (a little noisy) and the lighting was variable and well done. Otherwise everything worked, and there were nice italian bath products provided. All the basic amenities were provided, including robes and a generous closet, safe and fridge. There is nowhere other than the bed and one chair to sit, so this definitely isn't a room to be hanging out in, but New York is not a place to hang out in your hotel room anyway! The location at 6th ave and 35th street is a few blocks from Penn Station and not far from any subway or bus. Shopping is limited around the area but since it's Manhattan nothing is very far away. The FoodParc restaurant on the ground floor is very handy and has a great variety of different types of cuisine at reasonable prices. There are lots of other food options in the area. The in hotel Spanish BarBasque restaurant is excellent as well. One of the best in hotel restaurants that we have experienced. There was a summer prix fixe menu on when we were there in August which was excellent value. Some may find the prices high, but the food was delicious and well prepared with decent portion sizes.

We wanted nice views, and we got to stay on the 21st floor. One really useful feature for new parents- don't take my word on it, but I think the rooms might have some noise control.

I'd never stayed at a Kimpton hotel, but now I am a convert. The Eventi was, by and large, the best hotel experience I've had in NYC. I was booked in a King room, but was upgraded to a City-view King Deluxe Room at no charge. My view from the 16th floor was beautiful, with the Empire State Building looking magnificent from my floor-to-ceiling windows. The room was modern, but not cold. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the overstuffed pillows allowed me to sleep peacefully. The marble-floored bathroom was large, and the dual shower heads were an extra treat. The room was only about 300 sq. feet, which is larger than most NYC rooms. However, it never felt cramped. Every person with whom I had contact was friendly and professional. I've met some rude workers in some NYC hotels, but the staff at the Eventi went out of their way to make me feel welcome. The hotel has a free wine \"happy hour\" every day outside on their lovely 5th-floor terrace. While I only was able to attend once, the staff was friendly, and I met some nice guests while sipping wine and taking in the lovely view. If I'm going to quibble, the central-air conditioner was a bit loud in the room. When it was off, the room was so quiet that I never would have known I was in New York City. There was a mistake regarding the honor bar on my bill as I checked out, but when I mentioned it to the front desk, it was rectified immediately without question.

There was also a quasi-fast food place called FoodParc right next door (I think affiliated with the hotel) that was fantastic for breakfast (great quality food at a reasonable price) and always got things started for us everyday. Only down side was the lack of a pool (which is understandable I guess) but there was no sauna/steam room or anything like that which would have been great after a long day at the museums! The fitness center was small but pretty good (enough free weights and cardio to get a good workout if you were so inclined). The bar of the hotel is on the second floor (Bar Basque) which is a pretty pumping club on the weekends. It is not the kind of old-school bar in the lobby that some people might be used to.

The beds were a bit soft how ever your so tired from walking at the end of the night you seem to pass out any ways. Mini fridge was stocked with drinks kinda pricey, there are lots of vendors outside that sell drinks for less. We got a view of the Empire State building which was a bonus. We did hear a bit of noise at night but nothing to crazy just a bit of honking. You do get free coffee/tea during the morning at the lobby and wine during the evening.

Must of took us about 15mins max to walk to Times square. So much to see and look at so it was a good choice of location. There is a hope on hope off city tour I believe its just a bit under $50 which is a good deal you get it for the whole day and there are multi stops and pick ups. We did a tour of the Central Park VIA those bike guys. The thing is it cost $95 for an hour and its just a tour around the park we got to stop off a few times and take pics but you dont see much. But if your lazy its worth it, the park is way to huge to walk on its own in a day. If you are driving, its such a short distance from the Lincoln Tunnel so you don't have to experience all the crazy NY driving. How ever valet parking is $50 a night. We did have a little confusion and didn't get our valet slip. Because of all the trouble we had to go to the garage and speak to the attendant there after 30 mins of sorting things out making sure we weren't lying and it was our car. But when checking out the valet staff recognized us and apologize for all the confusion and took a night off our bill which was extremely kind of him. Didn't expect that coming.

We went for lunch and for a walk in Central Park, grabbed some Broadway show tickets and headed back to the hotel to check in and freshen up for the night.

Check in took a bit longer than expected, they had someone inspecting the room to ensure it was clean and do final checks. Arriving at 5pm we thought this would have been completed...no big deal. The suite was perfect, a nice sitting area with separate bedroom and a great big bathroom with separate tub and open shower with dual shower heads, the rain shower head was quite nice!

Decided to stay at Eventi as we have used Kimpton hotels before (great service and one of very few to have a LGBT policy). Very smart city hotel and perfect location for exploring Manhattan. Room was excellent, comfortable and without fault. What I love about Kimpton hotels (as well as the excellent service and zero attitude) are the simple yet thoughtful things, like having a iron/board and an umbrella in your room (sadly it rained for most of the time we were there). The wine hour and morning coffee at reception were also welcomed. The one thing that let us down is the bar. This hotel features an uber-modern bar/restaurant rather than a traditional hotel bar and it's not IMHO particularly 'accessible' for the hotels guests. The first evening we arrived, we sat down to relax at the bar and ordered a glass of wine but were told that the seating was reserved after 10pm , so we only had about 30 minutes before we would have to 'move on'. I felt a bit disappointed, particularly as we'd only just arrived from London, being tired, we didn't want to venture out of the hotel but had to retreat to our room instead. Not particularly welcoming and no mention of this was made by reception. On another occasion, we headed to the bar only to find it closed for a private function. On our last day, we had an evening flight back to London so we had to vacate our room at midday. Whilst reception were happy to look after our bags (they weren't able to provide a late check out) we had to walk the streets of Manhattan for a couple of hours, but we kept ourselves entertained. Mid afternoon it was raining heavily so we thought we'd head back to the hotel to have a drink in the bar for a hour or two before heading off to JFK. Problem: the bar doesn't open until 4pm - great! So we had to make use of the FoodParc where we at least managed to get a beer (eventually. Good luck trying to use FoodParc, a very modern but odd concept. we eventually worked out what we were supposed to do * see below *). Then we found a couple of chairs on the third floor to sit on until it was time to go to the airport. The good thing about Kimpton is that they serve you well when you want help, otherwise they generally leave you alone. There's no pretentiousness, just quality service however whilst I understand that some people prefer a more utilitarian approach, I wouldn't mind a little more warmth and feeling that my hotel was more than just 'a base'. (note for all Europeans, there aren't many bars in the area so don't expect any kind of cafe culture that we are used to, it kinda makes you feel like you're an alcoholic \"where can I get a drink around here?\") PS. FoodParc - to save you looking like a complete idiot (like we did) here's what its about. FoodParc is an eat/drink zone with a few different eateries/kitchens/counters/zones whatever you wanna call them (3Bs, Fornetti, Red Farm Stand, The Press and BeerParc) all with different menus. It's confusing because it's not clear quite what you do or where you order. You'll see banks of computer touch screens but no instructions on what to do. So: Go up to a touch screen - they have the menus for all the eateries. Browse the menus and choose what you want to eat/drink (a bit like shopping online). Your order can include items from ANY of the eateries (as I found out after I had ordered! At first it looks like you only have the option to get items from one menu, but if you continue, you will get the opportunity to add items from the other menus) You swipe your credit card Computer gives you a printed receipt with an order number Check TV screens above your head for order progress When it's ready, go and collect your order from the appropriate 'vendor' Take a seat and eat (there's a load of raked seating out of sight at the rear) (For those of you in the UK, think Argos!)", "Date": "June 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auburn, CA", "Title": "\u201cThe same every time...Great\u201d", "Author": "RMTCA", "ReviewID": "UR112502968", "Content": "This is not an inexpensive hotel but it continues to provide an excellent stay.

The bath amenities were more than the typical trial size and they supplied, body wash, shampoo, conditioner and body lotion. The closet, although fairly small had everything we needed including a safe, 2 bathrobes and a suitcase stand.

I stumbled upon a great deal at the Eventi on accident and went ahead and booked figuring I could cancel if plans changed. Thankfully, they did not and I was able to experience the best hotel I\u2019ve stayed at in NYC. My first suggestion is to sign up for their loyalty program, InTouch. Its free, they don\u2019t crowd your inbox with emails and they send you promotions and discount offers. As an InTouch member, one of the staff members emailed me 2 days prior to my stay to welcome me as well as provide me with some information that might be useful during my stay. Upon arrival, the front desk had a handwritten welcome note for me from a member of the concierge. Check in was quick and painless and Jocelyn was lovely. She quickly went over the features of the hotel as well as acknowledging me as an InTouch member. Another big benefit to being an InTouch member, the \u201cRaid the Minibar\u201d credit you get, $15 in NYC. I didn\u2019t think that would go very far, but I managed to get 2 bags of chips, a bag of gummy bears and a king size Snickers with my credit. I was very pleased and surprised to see I had been upgraded to a high room floor with a beautiful view of the Empire State Building. The room was somewhat small, as 90% of them are in NYC, but the hotel does offer suites for those looking for more space. The bathroom, on the other hand, was huge and offered plenty of space to spread out your toiletries. The bed was incredibly comfortable and had a few different types of pillows to choose from. There was a nice sized area for a laptop and space to lay out anything you may have brought. In the closet I found ample hangers as well as shelving space to store clothing and luggage. They provided 2 bathrobes that could be used during my stay as well as an umbrella that I could borrow if the weather turned. The best part of the room is the floor to ceiling windows that offer a panoramic view. I\u2019m sure the views are wonderful even if you\u2019re not in a city view room. I\u2019ve read some complaints about having to show your room key at night prior to getting on the elevator. I have no problem with this and welcome any additional security measure a hotel takes. The security guard was very nice and remembered me throughout the duration of my stay. The evening wine hour is a nice touch, and apparently a signature of all Kimpton hotels, which featured a red and white wine as well as Sangria. They give you a very generous glass and don\u2019t mind if you take it up to your room. They also have a complimentary coffee and tea service in the morning. Unfortunately, I never woke up early enough to partake. The room was very quiet and I never had any trouble with noise. There\u2019s a button you can press before you go to sleep that alerts housekeeping that you\u2019re not ready. I never had anyone knock on my door and disturb me; instead the one day I left after housekeeping had stopped by, they left a note advising me to let the front desk know I was ready to have my room cleaned. I also had the NY Times delivered to my door daily and it was always there when I woke up, even on the weekend. The only negative about the room was the air conditioning. It has an \u201ceco mode\u201d option, but I could never get my room cooler than 80 degrees. I didn\u2019t say anything, and it\u2019s very likely there\u2019s an easy fix for this. I also was never sweating to death either, so I brushed it off as no big deal. The location is away from the insane noise and hustle and bustle of Times Square, but still closes enough to walk if you please. Otherwise there are major subway lines a block over. The hotel is also very near Harold Square and the giant Macy\u2019s store. The best part was how close it is to Penn Station. I had flown in from Newark and was very happy to see I wouldn\u2019t have to drag my luggage on an off the subway once I got off my train. I didn\u2019t get a chance to eat at Bar Basque or partake in room service, but I will say that FoodParc is a fun place to stop for lunch and offers numerous food options. They also now have BeerParc for and afternoon treat. Check out was quick and easy as well and they had no problem storing my luggage for me until my later flight.

We also got a good impression from reading reviews, and we found a relatively good price online (booking.com). We booked their least expensive king bed room, but when we arrived they offered to give us an upgrade to a room on the 20th floor so that we would get a view of the Empire State Building. We accepted, of course, and it turned out that our room was as good as we could have hoped for. We had a room on the north-eastern corner with a view towards the Empire State. The bed was soft and nice, and the room was very quiet and modern. Coffee was available in the lobby every morning, and there was wine available at 5pm every day (we did not try the wine because we were out and about almost all the time). The hotel offers breakfast and other meals in its restaurant, and has spa services available. We used neither. If you join their free loyalty program InTouch, you can get free in-room wireless internet and Newspapers delivered to the room. The wireless connection was stable and good enough for our use (sporadic PDA/cell phone). Room cleanliness was superb, apart from the top shelf of the closet, which was a bit dusty. Although this is a pet friendly hotel, we did not see any sign of dog hairs or smell in our room. During the work week we hardly saw any pets in the hotel, but in the weekend there were some dog owners around. All we met were friendly, though, with small dogs. During the day in the weekend we could hear some dogs in nearby rooms missing their owners, but this was not loud enough to be irritating. We did not notice any noise during the nights. Room A/C was functioning well. Adjustable without being too loud. Bathroom was rather big for New York, with sink, big shower (although with some weird controls), and normal amenities (body wash, shampoo, body lotion, etc.). Plenty of towels. The room also had a free in-room safe and snacks/drinks available for purchase in the minibar, as well as stockings and bathrobes (though a bit expensive). The staff was very friendly to us. We stored our luggage for a few hours on the day of departure without problems, and the doormen got us a taxi when we needed one. Reception staff was welcoming. At night we were sometimes asked for our room card before entering the elevator, which was perfectly OK as a security measure. Negatives: - We missed hangers for jackets near the door. - Not too much space for storing suitcases, although probably at least as good as other hotels in NYC. - Bed comforter was just tucked in between two bedsheets, so it easily got detached from the sheets during the night.

Said it was closed due to in-climate weather. It wasn't raining at all and the skies were clear and the shot would have been beautiful. All I needed to do was get on the other side of the glass for pictorial aesthetics. He said there was nothing he could do as his supervisor told him to close it. It seems to me with the wonderful service at this hotel, that he could have at least made a call allowing me to get to the other side of the door (with him standing right by me) to take the picture.. REALLY irked me. I was in the hotel business for 15 years (with Cendant) and expected more of a Kimpton hotel. I will say that Dewayne at the front desk was probably the most apt and friendly concierge I have ever encountered. Too bad your security guard did not have customer service in mind. He could have at least called someone to get a \"no\" for a special request rather than be rude to me and, in essence, flex his muscles. Someone should talk to him about customer service.

The housekeeping manager came to the room and confirmed the smell of smoke and was puzzled by the business card and the room key - the business card appeared to be for an employee of the hotel chain: he took these away to investigate. I asked to change room and was moved to another room a few floors higher.

The room was an okay size (for Manhattan), new, clean and had a lovely large shower room. However, when I arrived to check in there was a long wait and the guy who checked me in had a serious attitude problem. It was like he had a script of what he wanted to go through with me and when I asked a question or interrupted him, he was annoyed by this. He made me feel really unwelcome. A guy came up to the desk while I was there to complain because his key card wasn\u2019t working (and apparently this was the second time he had been up to his room and had to come back down again) and the guy at the desk pretty much ignored him except to say that he was serving me and he would have to wait. I appreciate he was trying to be fair to me but he was really rude and just didn\u2019t deal with the situation well. So anyway, I got up to my room and was ready to hit the minibar as I just wanted to flake on the bed and have a beer, but it was locked with a key and when I turned it \u2013 the thing broke off in the lock. I called guest services and was told someone would be up. Nobody came. I called them back to ask and they said there was a delay getting the engineer, so I asked if a beer could be sent up. No beer came. I called back to chase them up and eventually my beer came. But by this time I was pretty annoyed. So by next morning, no engineer had come and I had also realised there was no coffee machine in my room, so I had to call them up before I left for the day to ask them to ensure I could get in my minibar and that a coffee machine was in my room by the end of the day. It was dealt with that day, but I really could have done without the hassle. A couple of other things like this happened during my stay (of 5 nights). In brief: My coffee machine was not serviced (coffee was not replenished and cups weren\u2019t cleaned after first day of use), so I had to raise call up about that. I got up to my room one day to find my keycard wouldn\u2019t let me in and when I went all the way back down (I was on the 21st flr) I got the same rude check in guy again who (by now I realised is obviously fed up of dealing with this issue) abruptly asked for my photo ID so he could reprogramme it and was visibly annoyed that I couldn\u2019t give him any because it was locked in my room(!). Anyway, aside from these things my stay was good. When I complained about something it was eventually dealt with. I got my beer on the first night credited to my bill because of the issue I had.

Finally on the last day right before checkout we mentioned to the front desk about how we really would have liked a coffee maker and he said oh, we can bring one up for you. How would we know we could get a coffee maker \u2013 there was no sign in the room? There was a sign saying we could get a curling iron or toothbrush, but nothing about a coffee maker. And, we could not have called for one if we wanted to because guess what \u2013 our phone did not work for the entire stay. We brought this up to the front desk and they sent someone up who said he would have to do some major work and would come back the next day, but he never did. And we did not have the energy to futz with it when we were there to enjoy the city. One other thing that we really missed was having a concierge \u2013 especially in New York City. The front desk folks seemed put out if you asked for a restaurant recommendation. They did not have a book of menus or other materials that would have helped us plan our days. Also, due to a glitch in the reservation system, you have to make two separate reservations is there is a sale going on for a portion of our stay. Thus, our room keys did not work after the first night and we had to get them reprogrammed. On the plus side, the bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. The floors to ceiling windows were nice. The complimentary internet for Kimpton in Touch Members is a must. We did have one beer, one coke, and 1 bag of pretzels with the \u201craid the mini bar\u201d $15 coupon for In Touch members. We were only able to enjoy the wine hour one night out of four since it was only offered from 5pm to 6pm. We arrived on the first night right after it closed and thought they might have offered us a glass of wine since we just missed it but even though we mentioned it, they said come back tomorrow. I think a two hour time period would offer more of an opportunity to enjoy a glass depending on your schedule, or simply have a bottle in the room since the lobby is so small there really is not a lot of space to drink it. Overall, we had a nice time at the Eventi Hotel despite the little inconveniences but would most likely stay elsewhere next time.", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cDesigned to disappoint....\u201d", "Author": "Registered_Traveler", "ReviewID": "UR103524083", "Content": "I am a big fan of the Kimpton chain. Because of that, I came to Eventi with high expectations. While this is a fine hotel in a great location, it really misses the mark in a lot of little ways that add up in a frustrating whole. Specifically, there appears to be no thought of the guest in the design of the hotel. For example, want to turn on the light by your bed? Spend five minutes searching for a switch and call down to the desk to be told that there is a quarter-inch micro rocker switch placed directly where nobody can see it. I have decades of lamp experience, this is my first time being baffled. Want to empty your sink? Spend five minutes searching around and under the sink and call down to the front desk to be told the way to release the stopper that housecleaning left plugged is to reach through the water to press in the trap. Want light in your closet?Read the directions to wave your hand to trip it. Too bad that you can only read the directions with the light on. Have a black wall? Let's stick a black wall switch on it at an unfamiliar height. Nobody will ever find it! Want your room cleaned? Turns out that the button on the wall next to the closet which shows somebody sleeping should be turned off. Maybe the hotel wants to provoke us to challenge everything we thought comfortable in hotel/lighting/plumbing design? Perhaps the thing I found most disappointing was the shower. While it is pretty to have only half sectioned off with a glass wall, when you have low water pressure and at best lukewarm water, you spend the whole time shivering where the water is not hitting. Incredibly, the shower which has one handle below the other, has a bottom handle so long it can only go 90 of the 180 degrees it was designed to go and bumps into the handle above. Is every shower like the one in room 2315? Add to all of these little nits the fact that at the end of every single 10 minute ride down to the lobby to get a cup of coffee over three days, I found the hotel had run out of coffee and I had to wait while they ran their way too small thermos someplace to be refilled. While the lobby is very nice, whoever created the coffee service area did not leave a space for people to add milk/sugar to their coffee off on the side. The result is a line of people waiting for every person in front to finish doctoring their coffee before clearing the space for someone else to get coffee. Again, this is not a bad hotel. It is just a lot of bad design decisions that add up to a disappointment. Definitely no match for other Kimptons I've visited!", "Date": "April 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at the Eventi\u201d", "Author": "socon1217", "ReviewID": "UR102893710", "Content": "I'll concur with many of the reviews posted here and say that the Eventi really is a find!

The room is a wee bit dark, but floor to ceiling windows allow you to open the drapes for plenty of natural light to come in. And what a view of the Empire State Building from the room! Location is its only (very slight) problem. At 30th and 6th, it's pretty close to Madison Square Garden and Macy's, and that's about it. There is very little in the area. The good news is that there are plenty of subway stops very nearby, allowing you to be elsewhere in Manhattan in a matter of minutes.

The beds are the equal best I have ever slept in anywhere in the world. Definitely on the softer side, but not the sort that collapse in the middle. Another plus was the great big windows that are all double glazed so outside noise was kept to an absolute minimum. Didn't even here the regular Ambulance or FDNYC vehicles going along 6th Ave. It was also great to be able to drop back in during the day for a 'freshen-up' and to drop off the shopping. Free Coffee in the mornings from the Lobby was a bonus as was the complimentary wine in the early evening. There is also an undercover parking garage around the corner if you have to bring your car into NYC! Downside? None really except that the rooms don't have a lot of storage space.

My friend believes nobody can have worst luck than this so bare with me and draw your own conclusions. It started with the reservation. We needed to extend our stay an extra day so a month before the stay date, I sent an email which remained ignored ,2 weeks to stay date, I resent another and I had to get on a tag phone with our NYGF (New York gift Show) reservation agent and the Kimpton agent.. Took 90 minutes to sort things out. WE finally show up. The room is the wrong one. We had asked for a corner room and we got a tiny 1 king. There is no way this is 300 Sq ft... we measured it under 250ft. On the 4th day we will get the right one... tic-toc-tic-toc While the check-in staff was Kimpton nice and efficient things weren't going our way. While on the 22nd floor, we can hear all the sounds of the street and many fire engines over the course of the first two nights. I call for a shoe shine with instruction to have shoes returned at 8AM . They were found at 11 AM when I had already left. At 3:00 AM ( ok I will give them a break) my wife needs water for her medication and we realize thAT WE DON'T have the mini-bar key. No big deal, we calll the front desk, so we doze off. 30 minutes later, my wife complains she really wants the water. I call down and within another 15 minutes two diferent bellhops show up with different keys...Intersting hotels where tow bell hops are tied up at 3AM... Are they hopping to it? The following day I come back with a client to watch a sporting event before dinner. AT 4PM the rooms wasn't made. I called downstairs to let them know so we scramble to find a bar to watch the game... No big deal,,, but things add up. While the view is very nice, the bathroom has no shelf space. There is nowhere to put your toiletries. The water pressure on the 22 floor leaves something to be as quick as the 3 elevators that serve the whole 24 floor hotels. Not a place to be in a rush. . Finally we have put up the sound up on the TV because we have been privy to too many conversations of our next door neighbors.

We went out for the afternoon and when we returned around 6:00pm, we opened our hotel room door and were met with rose petals lavishly strewn on the carpets and the bed, a bottle of champagne chilling in a bucket, strawberries with chocolates, and a hand-written note from the hotel manager. Apparently when Eventi's reservationists ask, \"Are you celebrating a special occasion?\", they actually pay attention! Eventi's careful attention to its guests and its obvious desire to please their customers created a very romantic atmosphere! The room was appointed beautifully. Both the bedding and the pillows were luxurious and made us not want to leave!

We had a City View Deluxe King Room on the 14th Floor with a good view of the Empire State Building. The room, which was very clean, comfortable and quiet, was as big as could be expected for New York City, although lacking in closet space. The bathroom was very nice; it had a two headed shower which was much appreciated. The staff were friendly and helpful The location is a mixed bag - close to nothing, but convenient to everything. It is near Penn Station and within easy walking distance to Times Square and within moderate walking distance to Central Park and the museums nearby. Some criticism is, however, in order. First, I was surprised that at about 10:00 a.m. one morning, a note was slipped under the door telling us that because our do not disturb light was on when housekeeping came by, we would have to notify the front desk if we wanted our room cleaned. I felt like my mother was chiding me for oversleeping. At any other hotel, housekeeping simply would have come by later. Second, I see no reason why, at a first rate hotel in New York City, the restaurant, or at least the bar, should not be open through the afternoon. It is offputting to be told, rather bursquely, at 3:45 p.m. that \"We don't start serving until 4.\" And I see no reason that the bar should not remain open after midnight on weeknights. If one goes to the opera or theatre on a weeknight and wants a drink at the lounge when returning to the hotel, one is out of luck, especially considering there are no decent bars nearby. Come on folks - this is not the Shady Rest Hotel in Hooterville. New York is the city that never sleeps, after all. Finally, we twice went to breakfast in the restaurant. Both times, the wait for food was way too long, even though the second time we were the only ones in the restaurant. Also, breakfast was served in an admittedly nice atrium area which, however, had marble tables which were cold and sucked the heat out of the food, which was barely warm to begin with because it took so long arriving.

This is kinda long I wanted to explain my low rating. I travel frequently in the US and Europe - spent about 45 nights in hotels over the last 12 months. Eventi has a lot going for it but you should consider my experiences as you weigh your hotel options. I agree with many of the positive points mentioned in other reviews. However, if you have any allergy problems, want to eat in the hotel, or are fans of crisp service and follow through read on. For those of you who have a life and don\u2019t want to read all this, the bottom line for those with allergies is: Eventi (as many Kimpton Hotels) are pet friendly. If you are allergic to pets ask to be on a pet free floor (they have three); and, if you are allergic to feathers (or more accurately the dust mites that live in feathered bedding) ask to have the bedding changed. Or stay in a more allergic person friendly hotel. I booked three rooms (my sister, my daughter, me) for three nights in October. When we checked in my sister mentioned she had seen that Eventi was pet friendly. My daughter, my sister and I are all allergic to cats and some dogs so we asked if we could have rooms that had not been occupied by pets. The front desk person checking us in was very helpful and said that was easy to do. After I had been in my room a couple of hours I noticed I was feeling a little itchy and congested. I checked with the front desk and they assured me I was on a pet free floor. We went out for the evening and came back late. Next morning I woke up very congested, had a blocked ear (which I\u2019ve never had) and had to run to CVS for relief. Chatted with helpful front desk guy about what could be bothering me. Turns out the comforter and many of the pillows are feathered. Bingo - although I am not usually bothered by feathered pillows that seemed like the case here. This is apparently common enough that they quickly dispatched housekeeping to swap out the feather containing bedding with non allergenic material. Seemed to work for me as I didn't have any more significant allergy problems (though wasn\u2019t completely back to normal). This room allergy problem is the first I've had in many years in a hotel though I do usually ask for foam pillows. I should also add that my sister and my daughter have allergy problems occasionally but didn\u2019t have any problems at Eventi. Other than the allergy issues the rooms are nice. Two nits: the HVAC makes a loud rumble when it cycles on and off (may vary by room, didn't bother my sister) and the room lighting leaves dark areas (the obvious location for a suitcase on luggage rack is quite dark at night so I had to use my flashlight to find things.) So that\u2019s the allergy thing, here\u2019s the service thing(s): When we checked in the desk clerk told us about the dining options including that the Bar Basque restaurant had just opened a week earlier for breakfast and dinner and encouraged us to try it. On our last night we were going to the opera and decided to try Bar Basque - I love Spanish food and we thought eating in the hotel would minimize the risk of being late for the opera. (I had to talk my sister into it because she had a bad experience at breakfast there.) When we got off the elevator at the restaurant we were offered a glass of wine off a tray. Didn't take much to figure out the restaurant was hosting a private function and was closed to hotel quests. We had not been notified (how about a sign by the lobby elevators or in the elevators???) (and why do you close a restaurant you just opened??). So we had to scramble to find another option for diner. On our way out the door the friendly doorman asked how we were doing and we told him we were unhappy that the restaurant was closed and we weren't notified in advance. He apologized and offered us a bottle of wine. We said thanks but we needed dinner not wine. He asked us to wait while he went in back of the front desk. After a few minutes (we almost left as we were feeling pressure to eat) he introduced us to the front desk manager who asked how he could help us. Things went downhill from there. Didn't the doorman tell him our problem? We had already spent too much time on this and needed to find dinner. The manager basically indicated the whole thing was our fault as there had been a letter in our room informing us that the restaurant would be closed (I had not seen it, my sister didn\u2019t get one). He was unhelpful so we just walked out the door. The door man apparently thought the manager was going to do something more than offer a bottle of wine as he asked us what happened. I told him: we got a weak apology and an explanation of how we had screwed up! We weren\u2019t trolling for comps, we needed dinner and he wasn\u2019t helpful. OK, so now I\u2019m at the point where only insomniacs are reading this. Anyway, the next day the front desk manager approached me and acknowledged that things had not gone well the night before. He asked how he could make it up to us. I said a sincere apology would help and he did apologize. He said he wanted to do something for us and asked us what he could do. I didn\u2019t have any ideas and he didn't offer up any. When I checked out I asked to speak the hotel manager. (This is putting me to sleep, is that insomniac still reading?) I told him that I had three rooms for three days, wasn\u2019t leaving a happy customer and wanted him to know why. He (Bert?) was very professional, listened well, asked the right questions, and sincerely apologized. He said Eventi wanted us to give them another try.

Although the manager was nice when we finally got to speak to her, the desk staff was rude. They messed up on a spa booking, the restaurant is exorbitantly priced for lousy service, and a desk staff recommended a diner that was 6-8 blocks walk away that ended up being closed with nothing else around to go to. When we complained, we got an apology, but no comps - no bottle of wine sent up to the room, no offer to discount our room even though check in was so late, etc. Also, the location of this hotel is fine if you don't mind walking (which we don't), but it is definitely not very close to much other than Penn Station.

Nice bathroom with large shower and rain shower head. Nice toiletries from etro. It was quiet and nice There is no lobby bar but there is a restaurant somewhere on the property. There is a fitness center and a business center. Next to hotel is a place called foodparc. I think it is owned by the hotel but you can't charge to your room. It's like a gourmet food courtl I has Asian food from there for lunch and it was the most disgusting thing that Ive ever eaten in NYC ( I'm not picky).

It was the business portion of my trip and I had my golden retriever with me as I traveled to the Hamptons afterward for pleasure. The hotel is located very centrally although the immediate area isn't very nice in the evening (especially for dog walking alone and NO grass nearby!). The bellhop and doormen were so kind, always greeting the dog, remembering his name, etc. As with any Kimpton, the happy hour is a nice touch and much appreciated. We had a one bedroom suite that was a pretty good size for NY and we were impressed with the oversized toiletries. (And we feel like we got a great deal on Jetsetter). Unfortunately, 4 weeks after our stay we were still having problems relating to the charges incurred during our stay. My colleague checked in early and used her personal card so that she could get into the room early. When I arrived, I gave them the business card and asked that all charges be put on this card, NOT the colleague's card. There seemed to be no issue. However, upon returning home, we realized that one night of parking had been charged to my colleague's card. No big deal, the company reimbursed her. But THREE WEEKS LATER, she was charged an additional $300 - for parking and other incidentals. She immediately called and the gentleman in accounting told her he needed her to put the problem in writing and he would correct it. She put it in writing that day, I authorized the charges to be charged to the business card, and we never heard back from him. At this point, as these were unforeseen charges and it was a debit/visa, she transferred funds between her accounts in order to cover it and not incur bank fees. We never heard back from the accountant she spoke to so we called the desk and asked to speak to a Manager. After several voicemails, we finally reached a front office manager that could assist us. I filled out the card authorization for the correct card, faxed it back immediately, and she sent an attachment with the new charges and said, since it was after business hours, the credit would go through by the next business day. It took over 5 days for the credit to come through after we reached someone that could process it immediately. Needless to say, this was a frustrating process. Also upon reviewing our bill(s) we found a $223 laundry charge that was not ours. That charge was credited back without question, but it made us realize that in our years of not having trouble we weren't being diligent enough. While the issues with billing were finally resolved, it left a poor impression of this hotel. To have charges show up three weeks after the stay, and incorrect, and to have the burden of them charged to the wrong card (a debit card), and requiring the cardholder to transfer funds, etc, is ridiculous and annoying.

The room was on the 19th floor facing back( little to no noise from outside, just one occasion when other hotel guests in the corridor woke us up at 4 a.m) and was decorated in a contemporary elegant feel with subdued, relaxing browns. The beds were very comfortable and the view from the floor- to- ceiling windows pleasant for those who enjoy urban landscapes, as we do.The bathroom was a particular pleasure, and it was devine to step out of the marble walk-in shower into one of the robes provided. All of the staff we encountered were extremely friendly. We too were conspicuously tourists but did not experience any of the coldness that one reviewer has complained of. On the contrary, I found that despite the Eventi being an upmarket hotel, we never felt out of place. A special mention to Kirk,who helped us with our bags and to the ex-Yugoslavian waiter ( I'm sorry to say that I didn't note his name) who made our 'solitary' dining room experience feel very cosy and intimate .The hotel restaurant is not in its fully operational form as yet, but we had a very good meal there and were glad to have the place all to (f)ourselves. We only made the complimentary 5 p.m wine-tasting once in our 5 night stay, and unfortunately the weather was not good enough for us to sit out on the lovely 5th floor terrace that we'd checked out on arrival. It is obviously a very appreciable touch and seems to be popular with many hotel guests. Finally, as Kimpton in Touch members, we took advantage of the free in-room wi-fi to Skype home to France, which was most appreciated, instead of having to shout into a public payphone over the street noise. To sum up, this is an extremely comfortable, relatively well-placed hotel ( we used the 28th street station the most) for which we paid considerably lower prices than the rack rate. If you can get a decent price, then do not hesitate an instant, and if you are not/do not mind paying the full price, it's a great hotel too.

Like all Kimptons, Eventi exudes class, quality and attention to detail. The lobby, while a bit narrow (it's New York, everything is tight) is impressive and very clean. The staff greets you with a friendly smile and has none of the pretentious arrogance of an Ian Schrager place. We stayed in a suite and loved it. A gorgeous view of the Empire State Building, with a lovely sitting room to relax and watch TV. The bathroom was ample and had a fantastic shower. Again, first-class and super clean, like you expect from a Kimpton. The hotel is quite large but never felt that way. It's designed like a boutique with an air of easy, stylish comfort. There's a lovely outside lounge on the 5th floor that we visited but never had the time to enjoy. The official hotel restaurant isn't opening until the fall so we didn't dine at the temporary one, although it looked fine. The hotel's location is very convenient, if not in the in the most attractive neighborhood (OK, truth is this block of 6th Ave. is butt ugly). You can easily catch the subway to anywhere in Manhattan and it's an easy walk to Chelsea, Broadway, 5th. Ave., 7th Ave, and Park Ave. Lots of restaurants within a few blocks and Penn Station is right around the corner. If we had any complaint,--and it's minor--room service could have been a bit quicker. The hotel was less than half full during our stay but it seemed to take at least 15 minutes for something like ice to be brought up. Nonetheless, staff was attentive and friendly. Rare in New York. Would I recommend Eventi? Absolutely. It's a great hotel, and although new, showed few, if any newbie hiccups. It's rooms are upscale, clean, ample, and extremely comfortable. And reasonably priced!

I was excited about staying there for months, and really excited after it opened and I saw the great reviews on Tripadvisor. But, this hotel disappointed me in nearly every way. I'll list my pros first - which are few. The rooms are clean and new. The carpet still feels very plushy beneath your tired feet and the bathroom is immaculate. The location of the hotel is also very good. Although it is not right next to all of the tourist attractions, it was a short walk to the garment district, Times Square, or the Empire State building. It also had numerous subway stops close by, with practically any subway train you'd ever need to take at one of those subway stops. I never felt like the location was dangerous or scary (as previous reviewers mentioned) and we were out on the streets at all hours. So A+ for location. Now onto the cons. The hotel felt too trendy to me. It was always so dark. The elevators were especially dark and it was hard to see the buttons. I'm all for new looks, but this place was so trendy I could see it needing a complete overhaul in 5 years because it will look so dated at that time. Check-in was smooth at the hotel, they got us into our room around 1pm (which is earlier than the normal check-in time). However, the room they put us in was on the south side of the building. I specifically asked for a quiet room. 10 minutes after being in that room I couldn't take it anymore because there was construction outside the window and the noise was a constant beep beep beep. Not something I want to listen to on my vacation or when I'm trying to sleep in the morning. I called and asked if we could be moved, they said that construction was on all sides of the hotel and they could move us up 2 floors to the 11th floor and maybe the noise wouldn't carry as much. So we took that room. It was smaller and didn't have a sofa chair in it like the other room did. But, this new room was on the East side of the hotel facing 6th Ave and the Empire State building. That side of the hotel didn't have any construction, so I don't know why the person on the phone told me construction was on all sides of the hotel. I was happy that the new room was much quieter - we only had to hear noise from the traffic below instead of construction noise. When we checked in we said Kimpton's secret word of the month that we saw on their facebook page and they said they would be sending a gift up to our room. It took hours for it (a bottle of white wine, and we don't even like white wine) to arrive. We called twice to ask about it. I think it got messed up because of the room switch, but nonetheless this was annoying and a shadow of what was to come in the next few days (slow service) Also when we checked in I made sure to tell them that we had two separate reservations for our stay. One for the first three nights and another for the last night. They said they would take care of everything and combine the reservations. Well, that didn't happen. The day that the first reservation ended they locked us out of our room and we had to walk all the way back downstairs and wait in a line to get it figured out. And when we checked out after our final reservation they only gave us our receipt for the last night there. Not the first three nights and the last night. They messed up the bill with the mini bar too. I still never got the receipt for the first reservation, so who knows if they charged us correctly. I didn't like how they put the receipt in an envelope and called up the next guest in line. I didn't even get a chance to review the bill at all before they were helping someone else. Everyone at the front desk was really snotty. I didn't meet a single person who was friendly. They all seemed very fake and I felt like they had to force their kindness. Cons about the room - the sink was clogged the whole time we were there. It wouldn't drain ever and would fill up with water quickly. The shower was confusing to use. They should put instructions in there. The water never got very hot either. The biggest con for me was the bed. I've known in the past that the Kimpton chain is very pet friendly. But I don't think that means I should have to deal with the remnants from the pets. And during this stay I did. Our bed smelled like wet dog the whole time. I noticed it right away the first night when I snuggled under the blankets. The comforter is what smelled like wet dog. Everyday I had them change the sheets hoping that would eradicate the smell, but some wet dog in a previous stay must have slept on the comforter and soaked through the sheets. Gross. I know some people are obsessed with their dogs, but not everyone is a dog lover and I don't think it's fair that I should have to sleep in that stench. Kimpton, you should clean your comforters too after dogs are in the rooms, not just the sheets on top of the comforters. Imagine if someone was severely allergic to a dog. They could have been taking a trip to the hospital if they were staying in the room we were in. The air conditioning or vent in our room was also extremely noisy. It sounded broken. It wasn't making this noise all the time, only every 5 minutes or so, but it would last a few minutes. Someone needs to check that out because I don't think that loud buzzing noise is normal. The mini bar service was crap. As a Kimpton in-touch member we got a $15 voucher for the mini bar. The sign in the room said it would be replenished daily. It was not replenished daily at all during our stay. We had to call multiple times to ask them to bring up single items. It sometimes took over 2 hours for them to bring the items up. One time it took a whole afternoon. They never ever brought the items up to us in less than an hour. Also, after the third day there they took the mini bar list from our room and so we didn't know how much anything cost after that. I think they overcharged us on our bill too. They charged us for food from one of the times when we called and asked them to bring up an item. During that time they never actually dropped the item off at our room because they took so long to stop by and by the time they did we had the do not disturb sign on and were getting ready for bed. I don't actually know how much we were charged though because like I said they never ever gave us the official bill for our whole stay, just our last night there which didn't have the mini bar charges or our first three nights on it at all. Lastly, I didn't think the concierge was particularly helpful. We called one night to ask for a few restaurant recommendations for a particular type of food. He told us the name of one restaurant. I didn't quite understand the name when he first said it so I asked him to repeat it and then he was all short with me. I felt that he could have been a little more friendly or suggested a few restaurants or told us what was good about that particular one he suggested. Also, one day when I called to ask if there was free internet and printing in the business center the concierge said yes. We left our room early to go down there and print off tickets for an event. However, the internet was not free at all. In fact, they wanted us to pay $6.95 for 15 minutes of internet! Insane! Plus 49 cents for one B&W page printed or even more for 1 color page. I felt like the concierge wasted my time that night and was very mad that we weren't able to print off our tickets. We just ended up not doing that event because of that. The hotel staff should learn more about their hotel before they tell their guests incorrect facts. It's funny because after all of this happened I recalled a previous stay I had at a Kimpton in Boston where they had also said internet was free and it ended up not being free at all. Overall, I was disappointed mostly with the service and the staff at this hotel. The rooms themselves were nice and new, despite the problems with the construction noise, AC noise, stinky blankets, and clogged sinks. I would stay here again if I could get the pre-opening rate again. That rate was worth it for this hotel in NYC (although I would still consider that pre-opening rate very expensive if it were any other city). However, I am hesitant to recommend this hotel if you have to pay the normal rates that they are now charging, which are over double what I paid. I don't think it is worth it at those rates. At those rates I would expect a very high level of service and that is not what we received at all. Maybe other guests who look like business travelers or who are older will receive better care. But as a younger guest who looked like a typical tourist, I found that I didn't receive any special treatment at this hotel. I rate this hotel average. Because that is what I think the hotel will become overtime and that is what my experience was. Right now the other reviews are bloated since it's a new hotel. But I think it will eventually fall into the average category for NYC hotels, especially if they keep up the level of service and unfriendliness that they currently have.", "Date": "August 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stratford, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cWould stay again\u201d", "Author": "JBUDAI", "ReviewID": "UR74534225", "Content": "Loved the wine reception on the roof.

We chose this hotel because it is brand new, and also because we usually enjoy Kimpton hotels. What was surprising about this hotel was that it felt more like a condo building than a hotel, and not just because there are about thirty floors of apartments above the hotel floors. The apartment feel starts at the lobby which is very stylish but small. There is a cool looking sitting area in the corner, but it is not the type of lobby where guests will just hang out. There is nothing else on this level so you move on. A couple of levels up is the Caf\u00e9 at Eventi. This was the only restaurant available at the hotel at the time of our stay. Also during the time of our stay there was work still being done on this floor, so we are not sure how the final look will turn out, but our impression was that the caf\u00e9 was going to have a bland grey design. We had breakfast here each morning and it was pretty good. You can order off the menu or have the buffet. There will be more restaurants opening up in the fall. On the fifth floor is a \u201cscreening room\u201d and outdoor terrace. This was where the cocktail hour was held each night. We especially enjoyed the outdoor terrace which has several nice and interesting seating areas and a great view of the city including the Empire State building. We stayed in an executive one bedroom suite which consisted of two medium sized rooms. The d\u00e9cor included dark hardwood floors, modern furniture and muted colors. Some might find the suite a little on the dark side. The bathroom was very nice and large. It featured white marble, two sinks, rain shower, Jacuzzi tub, and separate water closet. Our only complaint about the room was the lack of useful drawer space, and an automatic closet light that did not work very well and was not very effective. In general the hotel is located in a very convenient area. You can walk to some great areas of the city like the \u201cMeatpacking District\u201d, and the Flatiron District.\u201d Midtown is close by, and Madison Square Garden and Herald Square are very close, in fact they may be too close for some guests. The immediate area around the hotel is not that interesting and an area that most guests may just walk through on their way to someplace else. We enjoyed our time at this hotel, especially because it is brand new and has a nice clean modern look.

Frilly people note -- this is not the place for you (and in frilly, I mean french provencial, and lace, and yellow, and all that). My room was one sleek machine, with one detail after another that made me want to steal the idea for home. The staff was incredibly nice. If you have a view of the East Side with floor to ceiling windows, you may not want to leave the room. The Veranda (large outdoor space looking east/south) will become a big draw for locals when the liquor gets up and running (likewise, hotel-food, etc). For God's Sake, don't use the mini-bar (for which, incorrectly, there is no price list). Walk south down Sixth to 27th, make a sharp right and there's a liquor store. (That advice goes for any hotel in terms of liquor, unless you're having the cocktail in a great space, then it's worth \"renting\" that spot for the price of the drink). Be prepared -- even on a high floor, you will still hear that NYC nighttime noise (I had the window open) -- the radios, the garbage trucks, music, all the sounds of the city -- it's just the way it is, don't complain. Now if you're hellbent on staying in Times Square and eating at TGIFridays and shopping at the Gap here, I wonder why you're even coming to New York City. The Eventi is in a real neighborhood -- one that can be a little rough around the edges as it's just coming into its prime, but it's New York City. If you're a woman by herself out on the street late at night, you'll want to keep your wits about you (that's not to scare you off of \"Upper\" Chelsea or the Flower District in any way), remember: don't be pulling a map out to see where you are, walk quickly with a purpose, don't wait for the \"Walk\" light, and keep moving no matter who calls out to you (there, now you're a New Yorker).In reality, you'll be safer at the Eventi than in Times Square (seriously, you don't want to be up there with all of those \"tourists\" with their maps do you? no, i didn't think so) and accosted much less frequently. It's very difficult to get beat up or mugged in NYC these days (which is kinda bad in a way, but that's a whole other story). If you're looking to be dazzled by right outside shopping at the Eventi, forget it. But at 29th and Sixth in NYC, you can walk wherever you want to go (whether it's the theater district, the Flatiron lower fifth shopping, to Madison Park and Union Square, Chelsea (wear sensible shoes and the west Chelsea art district (10th/11th between 24th and 27th, wear sensible shoes and walk there -- really, you can do it), Gramercy Park, really anywhere you may want to go is close by). And if it's a haul to Soho or to Central Park (which it would be walking), simply use the closest subway (the NRW at 28th and Broadway -- note there are often two sides for subway entrances, an uptown and a downtown, unless it's a very major stop) which will take you anywhere you want or need to go. (Non-NYers, be prepared but have to swipe repeatedly with your subway card -- it's annoying but still your best value. And don't forget you've got two hours to use the transfer (the card knows), but transfers can't be subway to subway, only subway to bus, bus to different bus, or bus to subway).", "Date": "July 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cPlease keep it the way it is!\u201d", "Author": "call_me_a_cab", "ReviewID": "UR69095278", "Content": "The locale of Hotel Eventi is a little too far uptown for us (6th Avenue between 29th & 30th Street), but we first tried it for its soft opening rates, and now we have re-booked for our next long weekend in NYC, because it\u2019s that good. The first thing that caught my smile was they let us check in early. Thank you! Our room was on the 21st floor, with knockout views. Huge bathroom, with room to put all our stuff. Great modern shower, with no annoying tub or shower curtain. I think they have tubs in the hotel, so if that\u2019s what you want, make sure to let them know.

The hotel is located at 30th & 6th which is not an area I've stayed in before, and isn't that convenient for me frankly as most of my meetings are generally in mid-town but what it lacked in convenience it definitely made up for in quality - plus as an added bonus it is right near Korea-town where I had one of the best Korean meals I've ever tasted (and that includes several trips to Seoul!). There is also a subway very close to the hotel which meant midtown was literally minutes away.

There was a large flat screen LG tv in the room and a chair with a small reading lamp attached which could be handy at night if you did not want to disturb others. There were outlets on both bedside tables, on the main desk and in the bathroom which was great as it can often be difficult to find just one free outlet in a room!

I never once had an issue with any outside traffic noises from my 8th floor room. The subway was an easy 2 block walk. We arrived at the hotel at around noon and the room was ready. Now the negative; Prior to booking any hotel, I will spend weeks if not months researching for the perfect hotel for what I need on the particular trip that I am taking. Prior to booking this hotel, I spent many weeks researching hotels in NYC to seek out rooms with 2 QUEEN BEDS. I hate pull out sofas and 2 days before my arrival, guess what happens, I received a call stating that they over booked the 2 queen bedrooms and that they were going to up-grade us to a 1 bedroom with a pull out sofa for free, which was something that I did not care for. Free is good, pull out sofas, Bad. LOL Or they were going to let me have 2 rooms with King beds for an additional $75.00 a night. Other words, because THEY screwed up, the only way that I was going to get 2 real beds to sleep on, was for me to pay for it. In all my years of traveling, this was the first time that a company told me that I was going to have to pay for their mistake. I choose the 1 bedroom suite. I was not going to spend more money for their error. Am I an isolated case or is this something that Kimpton does on a regular basis? I don't know the answer to that. Do I recommend the Eventi? Yes I do. It was a beautiful hotel, at a great location with a friendly staff. Once I arrived and got settled, I did enjoy the room. Will I ever again stay at a Kimpton Hotel?

For more serious shoppers, Macy's and a range of other fashion stores are an easy 5 minute walk up 6th Ave. Kimpton hotels are always well maintained and the house staff do a great job of making your room feel fresh and new every day. As a new hotel, the Eventi makes an even bigger impression if you like a hotel that is clean and organised. The facilities are also very impressive. There is a well equipped gym, a day spa and large outdoor balcony area that guests can share on the 5th floor with a nice view down 6th Ave. Every evening, the 5-6pm complimentary wine event makes great use of the lobby, creating a pleasant social atmosphere where guests can mingle and chat with fellow travellers.

The hotel has a really nice terrace on the 5 floor but as of now, there is no service out there. The hotel lacks a place to have a drink. No bar yet. I'm sure this is in the works. They do have a sort of happy hour each day in the lobby, from 5 till 6 they serve free wine to all guests. In the morning, it's coffee. This seemed very popular with guests. A nice touch with Kimpton hotels is that high speed internet is free for members of their loyalty program, and you get a $15 mini bar credit. Nice touches. The one thing that REALLY stood out for us was the service. Everyone was fantastic.

While not as polished as the Palomar in Philadelphia \u2013 Eventi had only been open a few weeks \u2013 it was still a decent choice and worth another visit. Located at Sixth and 30th, it was located between the bustle of Times Square and the neighborhoods of lower Manhattan, not far from the PATH station and the 33rd Street subway stop (although I continue to find the New York subway system to be unnecessarily confusing).

The lobby was small, although nicely done, and their evening wine hour was pleasant, if not a little crowded. They have a delightful veranda on the fifth floor where you can relax outside and listen to the sounds of the city below you, but I was disappointed when they closed it at 11:00 p.m. \u2013 we had hoped to end the evening with a drink out there. The fitness room was also on the fifth floor and struck me as very small for a hotel of this size; it had only about 8 machines. The hotel\u2019s sole ice machine was also on the fifth floor. Our room was on the sixteenth floor. It was small \u2013 this is New York, after all \u2013 and well appointed. The bathroom was nicely done with a lot of marble and a huge shower with a teak stool in case you wanted to sit your shower out (although there was no bathtub if you want to soak after a long day of walking around). It had lights on dimmers for late at night, but the dimmed lights just went out after about an hour, so they were not much help. Towels were thick and adequate. The room had floor-to-ceiling windows looking over the west side (it was a \u201cCity View\u201d room). Lighting was good (dimmers again), but I especially liked the goose-necked reading lights on either side of the bed and on the chair. There was a small desk crammed in under the flat-panel high-definition television: it would not be an ideal work station, but we weren\u2019t there on business. The mini bar was well stocked and typically expensive. The radio was a good one and had hookups for both iPods and MP3 players. The bed was firm and comfortable, and the pillows were a delight. There was a standard hotel safe in the closet, which I always appreciate, and one of the two telephones was wireless. The room had no \u201cDo not disturb\u201d sign, and it took me a minute to determine that there was a light switch by the door that changed the color of the room number sign as a signal to the housekeeping staff. The room had more issues than I would expect for a new hotel. The mini bar did not lock \u2013 the key was useless \u2013 and the bathroom sink was slow in draining. The room was also supposed to have two bathrobes and there was only one: I had to call the front desk to make sure we weren\u2019t charged when they discovered that one was missing.

I found the hotel a month or two ago before it opened and emailed a Kimpton representative for information several times. From that point I was provided outstanding service. I received a great preview rate, but realized what a great deal it was after our stay considering what an awesome experience it was. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we received exceptional service. Staff: The staff at this hotel is incredibly cognizant of their surroundings at all times. Not once did we have to get the door ourselves. We were greeted by every staff member each time we came and went, and they would not allow us to carry our own luggage or bags if we came back with them. Every single staff member at this hotel was friendly, attentive, courteous, and answered all questions. I was truly impressed by all of them. The hotel: The lobby is amazing and very comfortable to just lounge in. Coffee (very good) and tea is always complimentary in the mornings, and there is the typical Kimpton wine reception from 5-6pm daily, which was great. On the 5th floor there is a roof deck that wraps around most of the building. It was so beautiful and the views were great. There are also nice common areas on the 2nd and 3rd floors, which are very nice. The hotel is gorgeous. The room: Our room was amazing. When we arrived at the hotel our first day we were checking in at 9:30am. We did not expect to be able to check in that early. The front desk staff person advised us they had none of our King Rooms available, so she gave us a complimentary upgrade to a City view King Room. I was so grateful. That was incredible! The room had floor to ceiling windows with the most AMAZING view. The bed was incredibly comfortable. We actually slept in every day because we couldn\u2019t get out of it. There are electrical outlets everywhere to charge all your gadgets. They are actually on nightstands and the desk, so you don\u2019t have to plug them in a wall out of the way. Nice touch! We loved the all-marble bathroom. The shower is beautiful with two different nozzle options, a seat, and great bath products from Etro.
