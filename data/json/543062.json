Having booked in online with no refund, it was either laugh or cry. Fortunately we have a sense of humour. There was a strange smell when we entered our room. It was only when my wife entered the bathroom and closed the door that we sussed it. A dog had eaten the bathroom. I\u2019ll say that again. A dog had eaten the bathroom. At some point, a dog had been locked in the bathroom. It had tried to eat its way out, tearing great chunks from the door-fame, the plaster on the wall and scratching the paint from the bathroom door. See the pics if you do not believe me. This may be the same dog who\u2019s hairs were coating the curtains and plastered on the window itself, or it may have been another dog. Whichever dog it was, it was probably trying to launch itself at the colony of buzzards who live in the back lot next door. We counted eighty plus one morning. The back lot belongs to El Tenampa Mexican restaurant. Every morning the staff walk down the back lot and empty bins of food slops into open dumpsters. The buzzards live in the dumpsters and perch on he trees and lamp posts all around the Rodeway Inn like something out of a Harry Potter film. See pics if you do not believe me. The tile floor went way beyond dirty. It was slippery with grease and God knows what sort of filth. The fridge was knackered, yellow and made a clunking noise. The microwave was burned on the front door and something orange had burned itself onto the interior. The sink leaked so they put a plastic bowl on the floor. The bath plug did not work so they fixed it. And left us a spanner so we could fix it ourselves if the problem recurred. The window mounted air-con was installed in the 1960\u2019s then it got into a fight with Jean Claude Van Damme and it lost. The swimming pool was a nest of wind-blown rubbish, some of which came from the vultures camp next door. Insects were less of a problem due to the lizards and long black snakes who live in the rubbish strewn \u2018garden\u2019 surrounding the pool. Truly, this place is a nature lovers paradise. If you love vultures, snakes and lizards. I could go on\u2026. But West Irlo Bronson Memorial Highway is packed with decent budget motels from as little as $178 a week and I am sure they are fine. They would really have to work at it to be worse than the Rodeway Inn.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "detroit", "Title": "\u201cBeware Of The Vultures!\u201d", "Author": "tanya c", "ReviewID": "UR127560556", "Content": "Ok pulled in the parking lot, and was leary at first glance.

Also awkward was that there was a Mexican gentleman wearing a wife-beater undershirt and boxer shorts, doing all of his laundry in the OUTDOOR washer/dryer units. Looked like he was doing a month's worth of laundry. And then there's the pool. You might want to take a handful of antibiotics BEFORE you get in the pool, because you will surely need them later. Also of comedic value was this: in the lobby, they have a little area in the corner designated as the \"Internet Station\". It consisted of an old Packard Bell computer from around 1994, small, old-school tube monitor, and a bunch of cables that looked like one of those rubber-band balls. And none of it even worked.

Stay Away!\u201d", "Author": "la-gski", "ReviewID": "UR20106374", "Content": "To avoid any confusion- this review is for the Rodeway Inn at 4559 W Irlo Bronson Mem Hwy- Knowing there is more than one Rodeway in Kissimmee, when I contacted the Hotel, my first inquiry was if this was the same Rodeway Inn we had previously stayed at in June. Upon giving Victoria a name, she verified our address on file, confirming this was indeed the same hotel. I preceded to book two rooms for two nights each and for that reason, Victoria offered us the \"Coupon Rate\" of $29.95 per night, instead of the \"regular $37 rate.\" (this was greatly appreciated, as we were not travelling to Kissimmee for fun and lesiure, but to attend funeral services and our funds were extremely limited due to this unexpected event) Upon arrival at the blue and white Roadway Inn on Rt. 192, where we stayed in June, we are told we have no reservations. After a few phone calls made by the clerk, she tells us our reservations are at the OTHER Rodeway Inn. Since some of the family was staying at the Howard Johnson next door, we had even more reason to want to stay at THIS hotel. Major confusion and disappointment. I am allowed to phone the OTHER Rodeway, in an attempt to cancel those reservations and just settle for paying the higher rate here. The \"Acting General Manager\" informs me that we will be charged for one night for each reservation, as they have a 48 hour cancellation policy- which Victoria neglected to tell me about. So, we are now forced to go to the OTHER Rodeway. As we pulled into the parking lot, I was overcome with this feeling of unease. This building resembled a crack-shack. This building looked unfit for rats to occupy. We went from the clean, neat, big blue and white Rodeway, to the rundown, dilapitated shanty that looked like something uprooted straight out of slums of Tijuana. I was very short with the \"Acting GM\" Tom Boyle, stating to him exactly what his new employee said to me on the telephone the night before. Oddly enough, Mr. Acting GM could find no record of us ever staying in this Rodeway Inn previously. No, he will not waive the charge to cancel our second reservation. (our other party gave up and went to the Howard Johnson) BUT offered to cancel our second night. We are now left with no choice but to register in this dump. (Also note that during this time in the closet- sized lobby, there was what I assume to be a member of the staff hanging around dressed in what appeared to be some type of pajama outfit, shorts and a midriff top, mumbling loudly) Our debit card is swiped, for our now one-night stay. I inquire about security at the hotel. \"Yes, there is security 24 hrs a day\" replies Mr. Acting GM. Let's clarify this a little more- 'security' at this Rodeway Inn means nothing more than a staff member, not a security guard, just an all-around-do-everything-employee. At this point, I feel an overnight stay here may just terrorize my children. Now, here's the kicker... Mr Acting GM now passes a piece of paper over the desk that requires a signature. This paper shows the charge to our debit card of $63!! \"Room rate and tax\" says Mr Acting GM. Informing him that Victoria quoted me a rate of $29.95, the Coupon Rate, I get in response \"Did you read the coupon? Do you have the coupon?\" (Did he miss the part where I said I spoke with Victoria on the telephone and she offered this rate? how would I have read a coupon?) His apologies were empty, pretentious and hollow at best. Asking for an address to write to the Owner of this property, I am told I can just send it to the hotel--- I'd be willing to bet my last dollar that the owner would never see my letter. We left this hotel after tossing the paper back to Mr. Acting GM and being screamed at by the Pajama Lady- my ear is still hurting. Going to just settle at the Howard Johnson. But alas... our debit card declines, and a quick call to the bank tells us there is a pending charge of $250.

I arrived at the Rodeway Inn Saturday morning which was easy to get to from the airport but when I turned into the parking lot and saw what it actually looks like not the touched up photoshop images you see online I didn't even want to stop. You get unsettling feeling about your safety as soon as you look at the place. I went in with my wife to check in and grab the Orlando brochures. The person who checked us in was very nice but tough to understand because of her broken english. The breakfast area is opposite of the check-in counter just turn around after you check in and your at the breakfast table. It is a tiny room with three little square tables, folding chairs, a microwave and coffee maker which doesn't looked like it worked at all. We went straight to the room after checking in which was the first room at the top of the stairs which was supposed to be newly renovated. The door is barely held on the hinges, and the door handle and lock were flimsy. When I opened the door the first thing I got was a punch in the face with a strong odor, my wife and I best describe it as a mix of smoke, damp cellar, & pesticide. The odor was very strong I wasn't going to breathe that in never mind let my kids. The carpet was pulled up at the door and it was dirty and damp. The night stand between the beds was all marked up with cigarette burns. We pulled the covers back off the beds and although they were made one had hair on it. The bathroom was so small you do have to get in the tub to close the door. The toilet seat was all discolored (very nasty) the shower curtain was all full of mold and the dome light cover was half full of bugs. The sink which is outside the bathroom also had hairs in it. I got everyone out and headed just a few miles up the road to hotel plaza and rented a beautiful room at the Best Western, which was walking distance from downtown Disney and about 4 miles from WDW. I dropped off all my luggage in my new hotel and went right back to the Rodeway Inn and checked out. There was a different lady at the counter this time which spoke much better English and was also very nice, the first lady that checked me in did walk by while I was checking out and she had her hands full of laundry so I don't know if the people who check you in and out also do the laundry? When Leaving I tried going all the way around the hotel just to get a glimpse at the pool but I never did see a pool if there was one it was very well hidden and you can't go around the back because it's a dead end there are other businesses back there it looks like the back of a restaurant not a pleasant view, and to put the icing on the cake the Stop sign in the parking lot on your way out is all hand painted red and the word stop was painted on freehand in white. This place is an absolute dump avoid it all all costs. You don't travel all the way down to Florida to stay at a place like this the streets in Florida are much cleaner than the Rodeway. Avoid! Avoid!

Hotel address: 4559 Irlo Bronson Mem. Hwy, Kissimmee, FL Photo number 1 is the door. The gold lock on top of the handle would not work, it was missing a piece. The lock below the handle also did not work. When we went to sleep I pushed the table and chairs up to the door. Photo number 2 Two double beds. You will noticed that I brought my own pillows. The room looks like it was freshly painted and the furniture looked rather new, but you will be surprised when you see the blankets. Photo number 3 is the photo of the blanket on one of the beds. Notice the huge stains. Both beds had blankets with these huge stains. Photo number 4 is the bathroom. If you needed the use the restroom you will need to keep the door open. You couldn\u2019t sit on the toilet and close the door. Photo number 5 is a photo of a bathroom towel. It\u2019s hard to see it in this photo, but if you look closely you will see a long black hair on this bathroom towel. I have short red hair. Pros: Friendly staff Price (I used my reward points) Pool (both pros and cons) Freshly Painted Cons: Location, it behind a restaurant. We were using the pool and there were two restaurant employees outside smoking straying at use. Pool area had trash all around, patio furniture broken Door security locks doesn\u2019t work Filthy blankets (and bring your own pillows too) Can\u2019t close bathroom door if you are sitting on the toilet you will need to first get in the tub and then you can close the door. Hotel website shows a photo and says that all rooms has a refrigerators and a microwaves. Our room did not have a microwave. Took 20 mintues to check in, there was only one person infornt of me.", "Date": "June 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cBring a translator\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4691915", "Content": "The service at this hotel was horrendious!
