Location is ideal if you are tourist but not so much if you are traveling for business. I booked and paid for upgrade but they did not upgrade. A couple in line in front of me got an upgrade without paying for it. Does not make any sense. I think I got a standard room which was not ready till the evening and no appology for the inconvinience. I booked for a smoking room and they said all smoking rooms are booked. Again no appology. I was too tired from the long flight in morning and long work day so did not bother putting a fight. But I would not recommend this hotel as there are lots of better hotels for few dollars more.", "Date": "Dec 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR755945015", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "gbpatel76"}, {"Content": "Good hotel       The room", "Date": "Dec 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR317296380", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Jellyb133"}, {"Content": "\"two thumbs up\" clean hotel, walking distance to the mtr exit,to bus station,to fa yuen st or the so called sneakers street, to the ladies market and to the temple street. from the airport you can take Bus A21 for only 33hkd, you can reach the hotel in 45 minutes.", "Date": "Nov 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR536574752", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "bsa1123"}, {"Content": "Cityview- Great hotel in Kowloon Stayed at the Cityview on 13th November on the way back from the UK to Oz. Chose as a result of reviews on this website and I am glad to say that we were not disappointed.Caught the Airport Express to Kowloon stattion which was a seamless experience. They then have free shuttles to the hotels (K6 shuttle for the Cityview), ours took about 10 minutes to get to the Cityview. Although we arrived at 9am they were able to get a room for us by 9.50am including the cot we had pre-booked.Our room was on the 20th floor and was extremely spacious with a queen and single bed. It was nicely furnished and modern and the bathroom was more than OK. Bed was like a wooden board but apparantly this is the way in Hong Kong. Certainly didn'y stop us from sleeping well during the evening.The rest of the hotel that we saw inc lobby, lifts, and corridors was all of a high standard and all were in keeping of a above average hotel. Location was great in Kowloon just off the bustling Nathan Road. The ladies market is just a 5 minute walk away and Yam Ta Tei (?) MTR station is literally a 50m walk. If you feel up to it the harbour is only a 30 minute walk down NathanRoad. I can verify this as we did it with a 7 month old infant in a stroller at 7pm!!! Made it to the Avenue of Stars in time for the light show on the buildings around the harbour. All in all I would definitely recommend the hotel for a stopover or for a much longer stay.", "Date": "Nov 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR714004549", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "carington"}, {"Content": "Inexpensive for Hong Kong It was our first time in Hong Kong. I was shocked with the hotel prices, and then we found The Citiview, a combination of a great location, comfortable rooms at a great price. The rooms are OK, nothing great about them. I would say very basic, but indeed a great value. We stayed 3 people in a little suite; 2 single beds in a room, and a couch in an additional room for less than US$200/night.None of the home keeping staff speak English, only the associates in the front desk. The hotel has a great gym compared with most hotels. Well, I understand it used to be a YMCA.The hotel is very close to Women market (great bargains), half a block from the subway, and close to many small restaurants. It has a shuttle that connects you to the Airport Express train.The best kept secret is a Laundromat located right in front of the hotel, which charges HK$35 to wash and fold 7 pounds of clothes, when the hotel would charge you about HK$20 to wash a pair of socks.I would definitely stay in this hotel again", "Date": "Nov 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR273505351", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "ArchieHawaii"}, {"Content": "Loved It!

It is definately really easy to get to the hotel from the airport, thanks to the MTR system (Airport Express train) and the free shuttle bus system which drops you off outside the front door of the hotel. Everything is really well signposted and even the 'greenest' of travellers won't have any problems.The lobby of the hotel is quite modern and very well maintained which is a nice surprise, given the surrounding area that you see in the shuttle bus (not flash but very typical). The reception staff were exceptionally friendly and very helpful. We had booked a non-smoking room with a rollaway bed for our toddler son. They explained that this would be sorted out but that the room was on a smoking floor. Once informed that this wouldnt be any good due to his asthma, they immediately upgraded us to a bigger room on a completely non-smoking floor. Very nicely handled.The room itself was a bit tired (especially in the hallways leading to the room) but it was large, clean and tidy and well maintained overall. The bathrooms were in a definate need of refurbishment but given the state of many others within the same price bracket, it wasn't too bad.Nathan Rd, the MTR station, Ladies Market are all literally just around the corner, and there is a 7-Eleven across the street which is also really handy. Be aware that their room service closes at 11pm which is a bit of a nuisence, especially with body-clock issues and food cravings at 1am after a trip from London! To counter this, if you go up Nathan Rd (ie away from the harbour), a McDonalds is across the road about 200m away. Really handy, especially for little people who love french fries! :-)Overall this hotel is a great place to crash if you just want somewhere that is safe, clean and tidy and easy to get to after travelling. There is a pool in the recreation centre next door which is also handy for the jetlag. I'd definately stay here again in transit and possibly for a few days as a stop-over if you want to spend your money in sightseeing rather than flash accomodation.", "Date": "Oct 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR130350400", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "3Kiwiflyers"}, {"Content": "A lovely stay at the Cityview       Room 1615 - 1615 - The living room sofa-cum-bed", "Date": "Oct 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR464998631", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "RajibDas"}, {"Content": "Small, but good location We've never stayed in Hong Kong before, so used a combination of price hunting using wotif.com + reviews from tripadvisor to help us find a place to stay. We switched to the Cityview from another similar hotel as this hotel was just around the corner from the MTR + convenient for walking to the Kowloon shops. Although not in Hong Kong proper, the location was close enough to the markets and shops we enjoyed visiting.Although it's named Cityview, there are reminders that this used to be a YMCA all over the place, from the embossed towels in the rooms, to the etching designs in the elevators, the tilework on the floors, and the design of the doors. The room was small, but I'm informed that this is typical for Hong Kong. Showerhead definitely wasn't made for us tall folks, but the place was generally very clean, bright, and well presented. Staff were attentive. Didn't use the wifi, there was a HKD$100/24 hour charge that didn't seem worth it.Added bonus was access to the (surprise!) YMCA fitness center next door, which had a lap pool (very full of children) and a functional weight room with a combination of free weights, machines, and cardio equipment.", "Date": "Oct 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR353296400", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "jojufa"}, {"Content": "CityView - a pleasure! This was my third visit to Hong Kong and each time i have stayed at different hotels. The City View used to be the YMCA International but has recently changed names and upgraded. The rooms at the City View are larger than other hotels i have paid more for in Hong Kong and much more modern and tidy. Upon arrival we were immediately upgraded to a premier suite with no extra costs, this lasted for our entire 5 night stay. As soon as we arrived the conicerge took our luggage and put it in our room on the 18th floor. The reception staff were very welcoming and helpful and assisted to our every need. Room service is not expensive at this hotel, we paid around $15 AUS for a main course. The location is superb, located in Tsim She Tsui it is a 5 minute walk to the ladies market (popular mostly at night) and a MTR stop is less than 100m walk away. there is a 7/11 store across the road and a Wellcome supermarket a couple hundred metres away.

My friend and I are low-maintenance guests and had minimal contact with the staff, but the people at the front desk were very approachable and welcoming. We requested for an early check-in which they allowed.The superior twin-room is pretty basic, but has more than enough space for 2 people. The size is very good for a hotel in Hong Kong. The bathroom is small, though, but it is alright if you are not particular about bathroom size. The hotel website said the room did not have an in-room safe, but I was pleasantly surprised to find out that there was in fact a safe in our room. The hotel was recently renovated, and my friend who is an architect said she could tell this is true by the clean walls, carpet, headboard, sheets, etc.The hotel's location is good in that it is only 1 block away from Nathan Road. If you take exit A2 from the Yau Ma Tei station, you will end up at the 7-11 across the hotel. Which reminds me, money changers and local teahouses are nearby. P.S.You can save yourself some money by taking the bus A21 from the airport. That is if you don't have too much luggage. Get off at Stop no. 9 (Man Ming Lane). It is only about a 1 minute walk to the hotel.", "Date": "Oct 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR581235741", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "catF1"}, {"Content": "Nice location Stayed at the hotel for 3 nights. The hotel's location is superb. The Yau Ma Tei MTR is only about 2-3 mins walk away. Tsimshatsui station is only 2 stops away. There were 3 of us sharing a room and we were automatically upgraded to the suite. The superior suite has no view but it was clean and tidy and there was a bathtub. The bell boy and concierge gave good advice when asked about the places of interest. The Front Manager could be more helpful but she directed us immediately to the concierge before we could even finish asking the question. The Ladies Street market, sports street, electronic and IT street, etc is just a 5 mins walk. There are many restaurant outlets nearby that one can eat steamboat, dim sum, goose rice, desserts, curry fish balls, etc easily even late at night. The shops open till about 11 pm at night so you can really shop to your heart's content.
