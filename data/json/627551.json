We were only on the second floor, but the view was still good. The room and hotel were super clean (yes, the nice ladies cleaning the rooms will definitely move your stuff, but that didn't bother us). We were in a smaller room, but for such a big city - I found it met my expectations. I've definitely stayed in smaller rooms in big cities and this size room suited us fine. The location, as mentioned, is excellent if you want to see all the main sites. When I was searching for a hotel, I remember thinking - how can all these hotels have exactly the same reviews \"great location, great breakfast, wonderful hosts?\" This area has pretty much been converted to a boutique hotel district, so it's probably all true. That said, I failed to walk by a hotel I wished I had booked instead. The owner isn't like all butterflies and roses and rainbows and hugs for hospitality. I think it's unlikely you'll leave with a new best friend forever, unless you really connect. He's super professional, though, and will happily and graciously help with questions and will allow plenty of time to do so. He gave us some great advice. Moreover, he's the sort of host where if you have a problem that needs 1,000 phone calls in Turkish, I think you could hardly do better. I saw him solving a couple problems like that for other guests. I read some of the older, not-as-happy reviews and it seems like they've made real adjustments to criticisms. They seem to now have a high chair, for instance, for babies at breakfast. And, black-out curtains. And, a little meat at breakfast. I think that speaks for their hospitality and responsiveness. Breakfast - any one who complains about it has high, strange expectations. It was a feast of freshly prepared Turkish dishes and plenty of more Western options like cereal, bagels and crepes. There were like 40 choices. We were there six days and definitely didn't try everything. I'd love to wake up every morning to a breakfast like this. I'm back now - and I'll probably either have cream of wheat or a donut this morning, but wish I could go up to a beautiful terrace and have a huge, wonderful breakfast that will keep me full for most of the day. They work hard at it and I definitely appreciated the spread. The only thing that was a little not perfect was a little bit of smoke smell some days. I'm not certain, but it seemed the culture and manners of Istanbul generally were to not ask you to do something and if you were discourteous to do it anyway, then they were generally too polite to react. The guards in museums were super relaxed as compared to America. The few things they ask for in mosques weren't followed in front of mosque staff and no one said anything. And, this hotel is supposed to be 100% smoke free, but someone at some point definitely decided to smoke. I think it happens intermittently. We didn't complain, so I'm not sure how that would have played out. But, I totally blame it on the guest and not the hotel. If you've read all the reviews and done your research and want to know if all the good things are true: they are. This is a good hotel. We had a great rate and I thought we made the very best choice for us for this trip. Istanbul is wonderful and not scary, not dangerous. People are nice, with a good sense of humor. It's a great vacation spot with plenty of historical treasures. One small note: the restaurant up the street about a block on the right (sort of the closest restaurant not affiliated with a hotel) was the worst meal we had, although not bad.

The owners were so attentive to our every need from airport transportation, tour recommendations, insights into the culture and ensuring an early buffet breakfast prior to the tour departures. Having stayed at many hotels in the past, this was my first experience to a boutique hotel and the city. I certainly would return to the Hotel Ada for any future visit. Beds are comfortable and the room spotless. Breakfast has more options than you'd expect with savory and sweet dishes at your disposal with both Turkish and Western coffee and tea. I appreciated the attention to detail and the high tech security features in the room. All the guests we spoke to enjoyed their experiences like us and we swapped stories on the recommended tourist attractions.

Our stay originally was for 4 nights (but thanks to a United Airlines snafu that delayed us 22 hours), we were able to stay only 3. The owners were extremely hospitable about our delay resulted in many emails, etc. about transportation, etc. Fortunately we were picked us, and that was a bonus as it would have been hard to find on one's own. We had an upgraded room which presented a fine view overlooking the mosque. While we were there, however, it poured and poured and rain seeped in around our windows. Not a problem for us, but my heart went out to the owners. Seems like the problem is the flashing around the roof and windows, not an easy (and cheap) thing to fix on a tall old building. Various power outages during our stay, but not confined to the hotel but to Istanbul/Sultanhamet in general. Staying here reminded me more of staying in B&B or with a family friend than a traditional hotel. The bedroom included a hot tub (which neither of us used), and the bathroom was small but clean and functional. If you come expecting the amenities of a Fairmont or even a Hilton or Sheraton, you are likely to be disappointed. Easy walking distance to major sites (Blue Mosque, Tokapai Palace, Grand Bazaar), etc. and easy access to streetcar that provides access to other parts of Istanbul. We thought the breakfast was very nice...no, it was not the huge spread that big hotels provide, but a very nice assortment of Turkish dishes, coupled with quiches, crepes, that would appeal to others. The view from the roomtop breakfast area was astounding. What was equally enjoyable were the other guests who were staying here -- a couple from Australia, an American living in Africa, etc. Lots of diversity, which is always great. We not only enjoyed the owners, but the sisters who served the breakfast! We were much enjoyed our stay here and would return.

It is very clean, smoke-free, modern and is equipped with an elevator. There is a computer in the lobby reserved for guests, as well as free Wi-Fi. A printer is also available for boarding passes. We had arranged for the hotel to have us picked up at the airport. While the greeter was there, the driver did not arrive until approximately 15 minutes later. We were tired after a full day of travelling and wondered if it was a sign of things to come. At the hotel, the host and hostess first appeared reserved, but it did not take us long to discover how helpful they were and genuinely interested in our comfort. Our hostess checked us in and gave us some information about the city and the hotel as well as a tour of our room. We had reserved a standard room, but the hotel had upgraded us to a seaview room, with a jacuzzi tub. Although the room was smaller than we expected, it had all the conveniencess one could ask for: a phone with direct international access, in room safe, flat screen TV, real wine glasses, tea/coffee making facilities with real cups, etc. The linen was of good quality, with nice, plush towels. The bathroom was modern with a great shower, and very clean. The breakfast is buffet-style and taken up on the 5th floor terrasse (which is winterized!), with a beautiful view of the Marmara Sea and the cuppola of the \"little mosque\". It is plentiful and delicious, with a large enough selection that even after a four-night stay we were not bored with the food. We were even able to help ourselves to some juice, cereals, yogurt, etc. before our 7:00 am departure on our last day. The two young ladies who help with the preparation and service are very friendly and helpful, without hovering.

Our Hosts, Havva and Dogan Sumengen were exceptionally gracious and accommodating during our entire stay. We (my husband and I and our 23 year old daughter) stayed four nights on arrival to Istanbul and were upgraded from the interconnecting triple (no views) to two separate king rooms, both with sea views. We then left Istanbul to explore other areas of Turkey and returned to the ADA for our last two nights in Turkey. Once again we were upgraded, this time to a king suite and an adjoining king room - again both with sea views. In all cases the rooms were immaculate, (this coming from a very germophobic person) the bathrooms spotless and modern with great showers, and the king beds were very comfortable. We did not need to request a wake up call because each morning between 0600 and 0630 there was the call to prayer that came from a mosque that is situated very close to the hotel. What a way to experience the amazing culture of Istanbul!! Every morning a delicious breakfast was served in a room on the fourth floor that had floor to ceiling windows with an incredible view of the sea of Marmara. Breakfast was so filling that we never felt the need to eat lunch. In the summer this room opens up to a delightful terrace for 'al fresco' dining. As mentioned, the ADA is very close to all of the major attractions of Istanbul and most of the time we were able to walk to our destinations. Walking is a great way to see, smell, and really experience this fabulous city. In a few cases we hopped on the metro which is also close to the ADA and very easy to navigate. In the evenings, when we were too exhausted to walk to dinner, Dogan called a taxi for us and alerted us to the amount we should pay the driver- which was always very reasonable. We all enjoyed our stay at the ADA and will definitely return for another stay next time we visit Turkey. And by the way, January is a great month to visit if you are prepared for the occasional rainy day and somewhat chilly weather.

It is an architectural gem and its basic design is reflected in the Haghia Sofia itself. The nearby mosque (The Sokollu Mehmet Pasa Mosque) will wake you with its loudspeaker call to prayer, but that will happen just about anywhere you stay in Istanbul, so don't be put off.

I found the price particularly attractive so I booked it. After the one night I decided to cancel my reservations at the other hotel and just stay there. I loved the sea view from the window. I stayed in 401, I think. Although the room was a little small there is another room right next to it that is much larger and has the same great view.

On arrival we were met at the Istanbul airport with no hassle and taken to the Ada Hotel, where he changed our money so we were able to dump our luggage in our room (very clean and comfortable with complimentary water and soft drinks) and go shopping immediately! Here I must make mention of the fact that the Ada is within walking distance of the Grand Bazaar, the Blue Mosque and Haggia Sophia and is right in the heart of the Old Istanbul. Regarding looking after his guests, this man is an expert \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he booked and organized transport to a kebab restaurant, pointed us in the right direction for a day trip to the Black Sea, organized and booked our transport to and hotel accommodation (lovely!) in Cappadocia and Ephesus as well as three excellent day tours, AND phoned us along the way to find out if everything was to our liking and if we were okay. Oh wow! Long live \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the godfather\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd! On our return to Istanbul before flying home, we were upgraded to a luxury suite. When we asked to have our final meal at a fish restaurant, he booked it for us and sorted out the transport. Next day he organized the free shuttle to the airport, helped us with our luggage and waved goodbye. This man may be a chemical engineer and ex lecturer at the University of Ankara, but he certainly knows his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stuff\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the hotel trade!!

It was one of the few things that went right about the whole experience of having our wedding in Istanbul. We stayed in three other hotels across the country, and this was by far the best. Here's what we loved: - The service! The owner was the friendliest, most helpful person we met in all of Turkey (we found most people we encountered were rude or indifferent...service is not a strong point in the country). We got married on a boat on the Bosphorous, and the owner made sure we had a honeymoon-type experience at his hotel. He even upgraded us to a bigger room for free two nights and paid for our tux/wedding dress to be pressed as a \"gift.\" Remarkable! He recommended a great fish restaurant as well. The two women who clean the rooms work extremely hard. They might seem grumpy at first, but they are very sweet. Just flash them a smile. One of them even hugged and kissed me on the cheek when we were leaving. They do a tremendous job at cleaning the rooms, too. They'll fold your clothes and put in a bunch of other personal touches. The owner's wife was very sweet as well, and if you come up a little late for breakfast she will get you something even if they've already cleared everything away. - The location:Just minutes from all the top sites. And, just as importantly, a short walk to the main tram that will get you to Taksim Square. Additionally, there are tons of restaurants and bars within a 5-10 minute walk. Word of warning: The cab drivers have NO IDEA where they are going half the time. Everyone in our wedding party had numerous difficulties with cabs. They have a particularly hard time finding the Ada. So carry a printout with the name, address and phone number of the hotel (although even with that they will still drive around for an extra 20 minutes trying to find the place). Once you get the lay of the land you can walk easily everywhere in the Old Quarter and beyond. - The rooftop patio. Oh, man. We will miss sitting up there for breakfast and a late-night drink. Great view, very relaxing and amazingly quiet at night. You can just stare out to the water and over the city and not hear a peep for most of the nights. Excellent. - The food: They only serve breakfast here, but it is an amazing spread. I have no idea what half of it is, but it's all pretty good. It does get a little repetitive (we were there for seven nights) but you can always find something (egg dishes, hot meats, etc). The chicken nuggets are an odd choice, yet for some reason I got one every morning. As for the rooms, we felt they were a little hit-or-miss. The panoramic seaview rooms look bigger on the website than they are in reality. You are essentially paying a lot more for the view and the bathtub near the window compared with the budget suite. That's fine, but the rooms are smaller than the ones on the bottom floors/basement. We found the room pretty tight, but we eventually upgraded to the Ottoman Suite and that was really nice and spacious. Highly recommended, if you can afford it. If not, the budget suite is a good option. Some of our friends stayed in these rooms on the lower levels and they were similar in size to the Ottoman Suite and very cool on hot days. Not having a view is not a huge deal, as the rooftop patio is always accessible. In general, you can't really go wrong here, it just depends on your needs and budget. Another note: the morning prayer will wake you up no matter which room you're staying in, as there are about six speakers on a mosque right near the hotel. But that is part of the experience! One general tip: Be careful when someone tells you how far things are from the area (except for places in Sultanhamet). We were told numerous times by several people that it only takes 10 minutes in a cab to get to Taksim Square. We had to go back and forth every day, and it only took 10 minutes once. Times ranged from 20 minutes to 45 minutes to a disaster of a night (rehearsal dinner) in which it took almost two hours in terrible traffic! We were very late for the dinner and almost missed it entirely. We were told it would only take 15-20 minutes in traffic. So be careful when planning. It takes about 45 minutes total on the tram (including walking to the station and transferring at Kabatash Port), but it's extremely reliable. Feel safe in booking this hotel.

The service at this hotel was excellent; rooms are cleaned daily, fresh towels daily, bottled water provided, along with wine glasses, coffee, tea, and all sorts of excellent little touches. The breakfast was amazing! Jenna, Mya, and Nina, along with the owner's wife, Mrs Sumengen, create a breakfast to delight a sultan! The variety and the freshness of everything on offer was really impressive. The owners, Mr and Mrs Sumengen, were gracious and caring hosts; we felt very welcome, and very well taken care of. The hotel and area felt exceedingly safe. In fact, I felt safer in Istanbul than in my home city. We met friends of ours in Istanbu,l who were at a hotel not far from ours. Their hotel was only ok; and they envied our choice of the Ada, (and our incredible breakfast!). Here are some excerpts from my travel diary: July 15th: Woke very early in the dark to the sound of a very beautiful chanting with a soft chorus that steadily grew stronger, which was this morning's mezzin ( call to prayer). I got up, and opened the windows wide, and looked out at the mineret and the mosque; there was a beautiful golden full moon right over the mosque. Beautiful Istanbul. Lights from the the boats on the sea of Marmara. Beautiful, beautiful Istanbul. Outside of our window is the Sukulla Mehmet Pasha Mosque, and an ancient ruin of a Byzantine church with an old and overgrown garden that is filled with birds that we hear every morning. The mourning doves are especially lovely. The air is filled with bird song. We have large windows that open inward, and the sea breezes waft into our room. We sleep very well here. Last night as we were coming back to the hotel, a man walking down the cobblestone street was carrying a huge silver tray that was piled high with pastries and breads and buns, still warm from baking. \"Madame, Madame'\" he called to me. I bought a delicious bun filled with melting feta cheese for 2 lira. The bazaars are fun. The shop keepers call out to me as I pass, \" You can spend your money here Madame: I have beautiful things to show you; come and have tea and see my shop; welcome; over here...\" . They are charming, and mostly mischievous, and full of fun. I laugh and thank them and say no. They bow and say, \" you are very kind \", or call out, \" where are you from\", or say, \"you are breaking my heart\", with a hand on their chest, a bow, and laughing eyes. I think this is the best holiday we've ever had. This hotel was certainly the right move! This is the first time I've ever realized how the right hotel can add so much to your experience of your trip. We should have found a hotel like this when we were in Paris! So, in closing this review, I wish to say: Istanbul, this most ancient city, is full of gracious, warm, and charming people.

On one end of my trip I always stay at a favorite hotel of mine, but sometimes try a new hotel at the other end. This was the case with the Ada Hotel and I chose it primarily based on reviews on Tripadvisor. My take on the hotel is a bit different from the other reviews that I have read. It seems to me that most of those reviewers are first time visitors to Istanbul and many of the things that they praise so highly are really fairly standard features for all of the small family run hotels in Sultanahmet -- breakfast terrace with amazing views, nice breakfast spread, small but comfortable rooms, friendly and hospitable staff. I would be severely disappointed if I *didn't* find those features in an Istanbul hotel. That said, the Ada Hotel does have a larger than usual selection of breakfast items, all very tasty. Dr. and Mrs. Sumengen are indeed very knowledgeable about Istanbul and able to provide visitors with useful information, but they assume that every is a first time visitor and provided brochures and suggestions that I really didn't need. But there were a few things which kept me from being as positive about the hotel as other reviewers. One is location -- as a previous review mentioned, taxi drivers can't find the hotel, and even when they do (with phone instructions from the owner), they can't actually get there if there is heavy traffic. I had to get out of my taxi and scout out the location of the hotel, then carry two bags and a carry-on up two steep blocks to the hotel. Another problem was the wifi -- it worked fine the first night, but never did on subsequent days. There were several different wifi networks for the hotel, but they would disappear and reappear, seemingly at random. The last issue is the air conditioning. Like many of the smaller hotels in Turkey, there is an AC unit in each room, but the units themselves are fixed to not allow the guest to set the temperature below a certain point. At the Ada Hotel, that point was too warm for me, as I prefer to sleep in a cool room. In May it was acceptable, but I imagine that in August it would be a different situation. In summary, I would say that the Ada Hotel is a very good hotel, but not really an outstanding one.", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kingston, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLove to go back\u201d", "Author": "Trader48", "ReviewID": "UR110931243", "Content": "My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at the Ada Hotel, Istanbul in early May, 2011, and I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Istanbul.

The room is well equipped with water, coffee making facilities and fridge. And the bottled water is reasonably priced.

The hotel is very close to a lot of the \"must sees\" and thus a great location for seeing Istanbul. The neighborhood itself does not have a lot of restaurants or places to eat, but this is not a problem. The hotel will recommend restaurants for you - we went with their recommendations for a fish restaurant one night. The fish restaurant was ok - nothing outstanding. But we eat a lot of fish and are probably quite difficult to please. So my recommendation would be to be very explicit in your requirements and budgets when getting the hotel to recommend a place. When we were checking out, we were asked if we could pay in cash. (We did the check out the evening around 23.00 prior to our departure since we were leaving very early in the morning.) We were offered a free transfer to the airport if we settled the account in cash. I don\u00c2\u00b4t find that appropriate. If the hotel prefers cash payment they should have stated so in advance and not expect us to wander out at night to find an ATM and walk around with huge amounts of cash... Also, withdrawing cash on our credit card abroad is quite costly (more than the free transport...) When we declined the offer, we were able to pay using our credit card.

We felt Ada Hotel gave the best value, confirming TripAdvisor rankings. We stayed in room 201 (Euro 89 per night on cash basis), a sea view room. Staying for three nights qualified us for free airport pickup. A driver was waiting at the airport with a sign with our name on it, and we were checked in and shown to our room at about 9:30 a.m. which was most welcome after a 13-hour flight. Location Excellent for main tourist attractions and near both the Divanyolu Street (Amedros Cafe, Faros Hotel Resto, Pasha Cafe, Adonin, Khorasane, Istanbul Enjoyer) and Akbiyik Street (Turquoise, Rumist, En La Luna, Kathisma Cafe) high-ranking TripAdvisor member restaurants. Walking distance to post office, tram stops, Hippodrome, Ayasofya, Blue Mosque, Grand Bazaar, Cistern. Closest tram stop is Sultanahmet. Quiet enjoyment Quiet street. Sometimes vehicles labor up the hill or from the second floor we could hear voices of people walking on the street below. The higher the room, less the noise. Can hear neighbor noise only when in the bathroom (had a family with baby next door). We would call this a quiet hotel. Internet access A laptop computer was available free in lobby, but we didn't need to use it. We were able to use wi-fi with our Linux computer in the room during all three days. The speed was medium fast. The Windows computer wouldn't connect. Wi-fi in the room was the best of the three hotels (in the other two it was non-existent). View The view from the second floor room included about 25 degrees of the Sea of Marmara split by an abandoned minaret of a mosque (see photo). Views are better on higher floors. Room comfort Heat was available in radiators whenever we wanted to turn them on. Elevator went to all floors including rooftop. Room was neat with clean carpet on floor (see photo), everything worked well. The room had electrical sockets at many convenient places including both sides of the bed. We never used the jacuzzi in the room, and we never used the free phone in the lobby that calls direct to the US and Canada. The refrigerator was cold, and Ada Hotel sold water and drinks at the same price as in the supermarket. There were facilities for making coffee and tea. After we used the first bottle of water, we had to buy water at the Dia supermarket. Maid didn't add soap during the 3 days we were there. Dr. Dogan explained the procedure for turning on the cable TV. There were news channels in English. The room key was the most sophisticated of any of the keys we saw in Istanbul. Hospitality Dr. Dogan's attentiveness must be a key portion of the hotel's popularity. He and his wife stay in a room adjoining the lobby, so he appears to be available 24 hours a day, like a concerned parent. He is eager to help in any way, and his recommendations for restaurants (Grup Saray and Sultanahmet Koftecesi) and his directions were very good. He gave us a map of Istanbul (from Cemberlitas Turkish Bath) that was better than any other we had found. He drew maps and made sure we understood his directions. He explained how to use the tram and how to buy an akbil, or device that you can load with Turkish Lira credits for transportation. He made reservations for us to eat dinner in the Maiden's Tower and gave us clear transportation directions for reaching it. We got around quite easily after learning from him. We asked to buy one postcard from the collection on his wall, and he just gave it to us free. Breakfast On rooftop. Good view of Sea of Marmara. Delicacies offered every morning including more expensive items such as dried figs and baklava, halvi, hard boiled eggs, juice from cartons, fresh fruit, cereal, bread and cakes. One of the better breakfasts we encountered.

The whirlpool in the room is a perfect touch and very relaxing. The rooms I booked - the cheapest ones - are not large (but good size for European hotel rooms) but have everything you need and even a whirlpool tub and room to set out suitcases. There is also a minibar with great prices on bottled water and a safe and color TV with some English channels. There is great wifi free in the whole hotel and a free laptop to use in the lobby! The shower is nice and strong with plenty of hot water. Everything was very clean and the breakfast was very tasty. My only suggestion for improvement would be hotplates or warmers for some of the items at breakfast. They had wonderful homemade items and some would have tasted better warm (maybe they do this in the summer when they are busier because January is a slow time in Istanbul). Since I like egg-type dishes warm, after a couple of days I made toast and had the boiled eggs and they were very good. They have a wide variety of items - fruit, yogurt, baklava, egg dishes, breads, boiled eggs, juices, milk, etc. The location is perfect for a short walk to the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, Topkaki Palace, Grand Bazaar and the waterfront. Dr. Dogan will give you directions everywhere. If you want to go out on the water - do it yourself. He offers you tours but if you ask, he will tell you how to take the ferry with the locals and it is super cheap and runs frequently - it's a great way to get out on the water and from one land mass to the other. The metro is also cheap if you go far but everything in Sultanahment is within walking distance. He also directed us to a great local restaurant with good food at a reasonable cost - he even called to see if they were open since it was January and some places were not. January is a great time to visit because hotels are cheaper and Istanbul doesn't get extremely cold. It's not warm but very decent. And bargain in the Grand Bazaar - in January they are willing to make very good deals because there are not very many tourists - the ceramics are my favorite thing to buy in the world and they have great shopping!!

We were met at the airport, even though our flight arrived late. Note that the hotel does not take you back to the airport on departure - they recommend a shuttle bus for 10 lira. As I has only an overnight bag I took the tram/metro to the airport, which took about an hour (probably quicker than the bus), and cost only 3 lira. Our room was spacious and clean and had a nice view, although the bath in the bedroom is a little bizarre. On the minus side, I didn't find the proprietor particularly helpful. After a little research we managed to find better restaurants than he could recommend. His recommendations on things to do seemed oriented to packaged tours, and he even recommended a carpet store (although he didn't push this). The windows in our room let in water when it rained, and room service never replaced the toilet paper (we had to ask). Breakfast was OK, but not great. The hot dishes seemed to be re-heated, limited fruit juice, and I didn't even see any yoghurt, although maybe I missed it, as you would think it a breakfast standard. The terrace was certainly a nice place to have breakfast. However if you have an early flight you are out of luck, as breakfast doesn't start until 8.30. It is also impossible to walk up to the 5th floor for breakfast - there were no stairs so the tiny lift is the only option. Getting out in a fire would be tricky too, as one stair well was littered with cleaning equipment, and the ground floor door was blocked by the proprietor's desk. However there is another unobstructed stair well running down from the 3rd floor. Two more positives: the free internet in the lobby was handy, and we were grateful for the umbrellas as it rained most days. Overall, the Ada was fine, but no better than many other places.

She certainly loved people to enjoy her food. Each morning on our short walk to the tram, we passed the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia. The proximity to these fabulous sights was not marred by heavy traffic noise, which I did hear other travellers staying in other hotels in the vicinity complain of.

In a city where so many people are always trying to sell you something, you have no idea how good this can feel after a day of dealing with endless \"business men\" trying to sell you carpets, and waiters trying to lure you into their restaurants. The low key relaxed friendliness of Dr. Dogan and his wife is a wonderful relief at the end of a long day. The hotel has an excellent location close to most major sites in Istanbul. In addition, it borders an interesting neighborhood (in the opposite direction from all the tourist sites) where artisans work and live and you can get a glimpse of the real Istanbul while climbing the city's hills and enjoying the views. To my surprise there were several beautiful Armenian (I think) churches in the same area that don't get mentioned in the tourist brochures but that provide an interesting contrast to the world of Islam. The breakfast is on the rooftop and the food and views are superb. Our room was a little small but the space was excellently laid out with room to put all of our belongings -- something that I often miss in smaller hotels. Everything is spotless. I've noted that some reviewers complain of rooms in the basement, etc. Well, you can check the web site and request a room with a view (as I did) if this is a concern. We had exactly the room and the view that we requested. In fact, when we returned to the hotel at the end of our trip, Dr. Dogan thoughtfully gave us the same room again -- it was like coming home. The other complaint I've seen from some reviews concerns noise. It is true that there is a mosque near the hotel and the call to prayer is very early in the morning. I wasn't bothered by this, but if it's an issue for you, you should bring earplugs. And, by the way, if you're visiting other places in Turkey, you should be aware that there's almost always a mosque nearby. It is a Moslem country after all.

The basement rooms have those little windows at the top of the walls facing the street that are subject to the loud noise of every passing car and walkerby. To think that we stayed at this hotel for the views - And then to be put into the basement to have a view of people's ankles as they walked by. VERY disappointing. The owner should be more clear in his descriptions of the rooms in talking and on the internet and then heavily discount these rooms in the basement.

Istanbul is really a great city, to me it is the greatest, and staying in Ada made it more enjoyable. (NB it is a small boutique hotel not a huge one) I grade each item alone as follows: The management and Staff: 10/5 (it is not a mistake, I give it double the full mark) Dr. Dogan, the owner and the manager of the hotel, is really a great person and he made our stay wonderful. He was greatlly helpful in every thing. Whenever we needed anything he was there to help, from things we needed for our stay in the hotel to guidance about the city, he even brought us a taxi when we needed one, and when e discovered that the cab driver tricked us he called the taxi company to bring us our money back. I want to say thanks a lot Dr. Dogan. Thank you from all my heart. I am sure you won't find a more friendly and helpful owner ever. The hotel actually is like the house of Dr. Dogan, and he is there to help, he and his great family 24/7 The Location: 5/5 (I also wanted to give it more than the full mark but then I will be doing this to every thing making it pointless) The location is also outstanding it is close to all you need in Istanbul. It is very close to the main attractions in Istanbul, has a sea view, and is close to the tram station. Imagine that at the end of your day you pass by hagia sofia and the blue mosque, then you end up at a room with a sea view. it is actually almost a dream came true. The only thing that some people might not like is that it is in a small street and not on the main road. the closeness to the tram is really important to point out. Due to the closeness to the tram we were able to go to almost every where, even the places that were far from sultanahmet, where ada is located, in a really comfortable and fast way The Room: 5/5 We stayed in Room 401. It is a room with a sea view (the view includes a historical Ottoman mosque and some Byzantium ruins) and Jacuzzi, and it couldn't be better. The room was really spacious with a huge and a comfortable bed, a large storage area, a great jacuzzi and a great bathroom and shower. In order to understand how nice the room was, all I need is to describe how we spent our day there, We woke up at a sea view drank up a cup of tea, then we went to the breakfast terrace, then we went out, enjoyed Istanbul to it's full extent, then came back and spent some relaxing time in the jacuzzi then went to bed a slept like babies before enjoying the next day and so on. to put it short, room 401 was perfect, nothing less The breakfast: 3.5/5 (the only thing that doesn't get the full mark) The breakfast was great, but lacked variance. It is not a fancy hotel breakfast, it is just like home breakfast. I don't say the food was bad, on the contrary it was delicious and all what you need was there, but don\\t dream of a large table with different kinds of food from all areas. and also a disadvantage is that all the days were the same. To put it short, you will like the food, but not as much as you will like everything about ada. But to make it clear, the breakfast terrace is breath-taking like that of the room and even more Others: 5/5 Everything else was great, the high speed internet, which is free, fast and working 24 hours. I used to download a disney movie every day, I started it before I left in the morning and when I came back at night it was completed. There was complementary tea bags and everything else was great.

Mr. Sumengen and his family were very helpful and friendly. I read a few reviews of people who were not satisfied, and moved to a hotel uptown or to one of the major hotels. I think this is because of the star rate. You should not compare the hotels in the old city to the famous hotels. There is a difference in the star rating. In the old city are all the major tourist attractions, you won't find any hotels from the famous hotel chains. I approve of that, that's how the old city remains it's authentic character. If that's not what you are looking for, I would advice you to move to the European site, there you will find the famous hotels, the atmosphere and the appearance equal to any big city in the world.

The Ada is on a relatively quiet side street (very close to two other hotels, the Stone and the Daphne) but within a five to ten minute walk of almost every major tourist attraction! We stayed at the Ada for five nights in September 2008 and then for a final night after our \"blue cruise\" in the Aegean. At first glance, the lobby of the hotel seems a bit more like a guesthouse -- very simple and homey -- but the rooms were exceptionally lovely and spacious and (from what we saw of other hotels) unusually comfortable at that price range for Istanbul. Our first room was 401 -- a good-sized jacuzzi room with a large bed and a gorgeous view of the Sea of Marmara and nearby mosque. There's a wide window ledge on which I would stretch out enjoying the view (it was almost like having a terrace), and the room was nicely but simply furnished with a sofa to stretch out on, too, and attractive hardwood floors. Each day the cleanliness of the room was unsurpassed -- it was the cleanest hotel room I've ever been in, with everything sparkling. The jacuzzi was welcome after a day of sightseeing (sometimes just to soak my tired feet!) and the bed was extremely comfortable, with soft and pristine linens. The room also had a mini-refrigerator stocked with bottled water, soft drinks, and beer, and quiet and very effective air-conditioning. ( We learned that Dr. Sumengen can also provide wine, although it's not kept in the rooms.) After we returned from our Blue Cruise, Dr. Sumengen upgraded us to a jacuzzi suite (Room 203) for our one remaining night. This room was even more lovely, and was extra spacious -- almost palatial, with a microwave, mini-refrigerator, cutlery and dishes, furnished with lovely rugs and a very comfortable sofa and chairs as well as a large and comfy bed. Throughout both stays, we looked forward to our breakfasts on the fifth floor sea-view terrace-- with fresh peaches, grapes, melon and (on some days) fresh figs, an assortments of breads, two kinds of cheese, and cereals, yogurt, tomatoes, olives, halvah, honey, butter, tea, brewed coffee, etc. We would sit and watch the boats and the birds soaring overhead (a similar view to the one in both of our rooms.) The warmth and hospitality of Dr. and Mrs. Sumengen were also unsurpassed, and the young woman who assisted at breakfast and cleaning was kind and attentive to our needs. (During our earlier stay there was also a helpful young man who assisted us in printing out our boarding passes for our flight to Bodrum.) We used the free internet, used our ATT calling card to make calls to the States from the room at no extra charge, and will definitely stay at the Ada if we come to Istanbul again!

So the room didn't have a lot of light and one could hear the noise of the air conditional systems during the whole night in spite of the closed windows. However, it didn't prevent us from falling asleep. The room appeared quite small for three of us because of the size of the beds: there were huge. The double bed was enough for four people and the single was like a double. Those left very litte space for movement. Moreover, the bathroom had a transparent door, located just in front of the single bed. Everything could be seen in detail, which was not very charming, especially for my partner, who shared the room with a friend of mine. There was a small kitchenette beside the room with tea coffee making facilities.

They also provide a coffee maker which they refill with water every day (they advise not to use the tap water) as well as tea bags and instant coffee. The hotel is about 2 blocks away from all of the big sites in Sultanahment (Hippodrome, Blue Mosque, Haghia Sophia) and about 4 blocks from the Sultanahmet tram station. You should have no trouble getting there -- we always had taxis drop us near the Haghia Sophia and we'd walk back ourselves. It's very convenient. Unfortunately, I got food poisoning on our last day, but Dogan was kind enough to translate all of my symptoms into Turkish so we could better communicate with the pharmacist. By the way, there's a pharmacy just around the corner, which came in extremely handy! We also had an inconvenient flight time for our departure -- we left the hotel at 3:00 a.m., but he arranged for a car service for us, and even had a small breakfast waiting when we came down to the lobby. Can't say enough great things about this place. I would definitely stay here again in a heartbeat and highly suggest you do, too!", "Date": "April 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "california", "Title": "\u201ca little jewel in the old town\u201d", "Author": "blownaway11", "ReviewID": "UR8866152", "Content": "we just spent 5 days in Istanbul, in the ADA Hotel: what a great place!! The owner and his wife are fluent in English, very friendly and helpful: we were picked up at the airport and they arranged for trips and taxis. We had an enormous room with a splendid view of the Sea of Marmara, a jacuzzi, a little kitchen area and a very modern bathroom; also the hotel is eco-friendly in that electricity use is controlled with automatic lights and room keys. Breakfast is breathtaking: it is served on the top floor on a terrace with a ripping view of the Sea and is very generous. The hotel is right in Old Town Istanbul, steps away from the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia and Topkapi Palace, very convenient, and what an ambiance!", "Date": "September 24, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ada Hotel Istanbul", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d627551-Reviews-Ada_Hotel_Istanbul-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$169 - $517*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Sehit Mehmetpasa Yokusu Sokak No:30</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Sultanahmet</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34122</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "627551", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/67/f4/e5/suite-with-jacuzzi-and.jpg"}}
