As you walk into the hotel it does look 4star, nice decor, however the big paintings are awfull , looks like a raw canvas! The reception staff , came across as being a bit zombie -fied, no expression of joy whatsoever !! Our room was claustrophobic, no tea or coffee making facilities or fridge, even thou we were told that there would be , by the travel agency. When I rang reception I was told that these facilities do not come in a standard room, if it's a 4 star, you think it would be standard throughout! Air conditioning was not working, as according to reception its not hot enough yet, we only had the joy of warm air or hot!! Hence the windows were opened at night and suffered the traffic noise. Breakfast very basic , hot food was Luke warm and on my last day the beans were so cold , seemed like they just took them out of the can. However the plus points are that the shower was amazing , sadly on one day the hotel had no water, and it was dribbling from the tap, we showered in the evening! The toiletries were not bad. Location - for the beach is excellent , if you want to stay away from the hustle bustle it's good as the hotel is not far from the Metro, 10 min walk. The pizza restaurant next door Is good and staff friendly - Hotel reception staff should pop in and take notes!! I wouldn't return to this hotel and as we got into our taxi to go to the Airport I did have the impulse to run out with a thick black marker and scribble 2 stars out!!!", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cDo Not stay here\u201d", "Author": "Joe G", "ReviewID": "UR128448508", "Content": "My gf and I spent 4 days/nights here in April '12.

The room itself can be described as an IKEA room display after a weekend of people testing everything out- nice at first glance, but falling apart. The bed creaked loudly at every movement. The closet was so shallow that hangers only fit in sideways. I tried to use the A/C only to learn that they don't turn it on for the building until May. The window was difficult to use- until it stopped working completely. Perhaps most incredible was the bathrrom. The shower (no tub) had glass where only one shower door would normally go.

I have choosed the email booking without PRE-Payment two months in advance with a good hotel room rate. Once arrived in the hotel (with my other collegues) we were shocked by the fact that they insist us to pay straing the full amount for the 5 days in advance.

LOCATION The hotel is in a moder area but far away from everything. Good for the beach but far away from tube stations or shopping areas. CURTESY Apart for the room visit by ourself, let me add another point. Due to flight strike, we were forced to stay one day longer in Barcellona. The hotel did not help at all and more that ever they increased the additional night of 40%. I did not appreciated. In addition, every time we went to the desk asking for help WE had clear feeling that we were not appreciated as customers. One day a member of our team left his Tshirt on top of the bed and unfortunatly the cleaning lady during the sheet changes took the Tshirt and dirty sheets with her. We ask several time to check where the Tshirt was. After insisting, at the reception desk a person went in back door and come back with the shirt in his hands. Not very professional. We did not expect to clean the Tshirt but at least to give us back in a bag or a Tshirt folder. Defenitly bad manner for a 4 stars hotel. In term of hotel, rooms are nice and clean.

The hotel was a stone's throw from the beach, which was handy to relax at after a hard day's touring around the city. The Metro line Selva de Mar is excellent for Barceloneta and Jaume 1 on L4. The L4 Metro is short walk from the hotel with the opportunity to take a 'coffee amb lei' or granizados on the way to or from the Metro station. If you get the chance then go into town on the tramlink. The Selva de Mar tram stop is situated just up from the Metro stations Selva de Mar. It's a nice trip into town on the surface. The tram treminates just above the Vila Olimpica marina so it's a decent walk into Las Ramblas or a short walk to the marina and then along along the coastline. On the hotel itself there is little to say, it's a four star, it's average, the bar isn't always staffed, the rooms are on the small side. Our shower rail in our shower had been installed upside down and needed to to be re-fixed the top end being very loose. As the rail was on uspside down, the shower head didn't fit into the holder. Not a major issue but annoying. It is meant to be fancy but as usual the lack of attention to maintenance and to the detail lets it down. The hotel offers beach towels if you want to go to the beach but demand a 10\u20ac deposit - cash! It can't be put onto the room (they have your credit card details from check-in!). It's not clear that a cash deposit is required and it's not so handy being told if you're not carrying cash to the beach. The staff are professional if a little perfunctory.

Overall, our experience was decent. The staff was always very professional and helpful. The breakfast buffet was the best one we encountered (except for the scrambled eggs, but I discovered NO one can get the eggs right in Spain/Italy for some reason). But the cost was too much. We could have eaten at a cafe around the corner for a lot cheaper. The room itself was very very small. The bed took up most of the room. But it was clean and tidy, decorated in modern, minimalist decor. The bathroom was quite nice. Nice green marble. Big shower, yet with no door or curtain, so the floor tended to get wet outside the shower. The bathroom amenities were great. You got shampoo, conditioner, soap, as well as a razor and a travel toothbrush and paste, and a little vanity pack. And lots of fluffy white towels. We couldn't find a safe. Don't recall a mini bar either, but I never use them so I don't really look. There was free wifi with a strong connection in the lobby. Oh and they didn't tell us how to turn on the lights in our room! You need to put your door card in a slot before the lights work. When my boyfriend went down to inquire about it, he heard a staff member telling another guest how to do it. Perhaps they should have mentioned that to foreign tourists? Or have a sign or something in the room? The location is both good and bad, I suppose. Good in that it's in a quiet - almost dead - neighbourhood. And I felt safe there. Bad in that it is many long blocks to walk to the metro to get to the city centre area. Also, being in a non-touristy area, language barrier certainly was an issue. Though the hotel staff all seemed to speak decent English, which was nice. It would have been nice to have an english TV channel or two. CNN, BBC, something? Just be warned, we took a short cab ride to the cruise ship port and the guy manually tacked on a 6.50 euro charge at the very end (we only had 2 bags). When we asked him about it, he responded in Spanish. How can we argue with that?? I don't know if we would return to this hotel.

The immediate vicinity had a few restaurants and bars and although not the bustling nightlife of the city centre, the area offered a number of choices for places to visit at night when we wanted to relax. In addition I had read reviews that rooms looking onto the dual carriageway area would be noisy. I am personally used to sleeping in silence and needed to sleep with the window open during my stay and can safely say that I was not affected by any noise from the dual carriageway. In fact, you can't really tell it is there since it is sunken below and embankment. Although the hotel is a considerable distance from the city centre, it is convenient for the night bus routes, and is only a short walk (five to ten minutes) from both the nearest metro and the tram stop. The quality of service in the hotel I felt was perfectly adequate; for my limited Spanish, all staff were friendly and went out of their way to assist me in locating some lost baggage thanks to my airline. My only criticism is that the wooden (laminate) flooring had quite obviously worn where furniture had been moved around by either guests or maids for cleaning and a much needed shower head in the men's changing room within the gym area was in need of repair.

Very clean and safe to take even at night. - There is a Bus Turistico stop right around the corner from the hotel which is very important as you can use this to go into town if you have your ticket.

But the A1 bus ( 4.05 euro per person) runs from Placa Catalunya to the airport. You have to take the metro the rest of the way for like 1.30 euro each. You can thank me later. Seriously. - Hotel reception staff are cool as ice. Reception? what reception? they dont receive you - they just kinda stand there. Not welcoming at all. And I am not picky at all. Not courteous. Seem to be bothered to be doing their jobs. smiles are free. - Hotel staff tried to sell us a \"discount booklet\" for 3 euro when we asked them about the tickets for the Bus Turistico. People, do not be fooled, these coupons are free when you buy your ticket on the bus. What a scam they tried to pull!! my wife sniffed them out. Next time, you tell them you know they are ripping u off!! - Hotel is out of the city Centre.

Good luck keeping your free water cold. or anything else really. - Breakfast was nice but costs 14 euro per person. no way senor! go to cafe firenze around the corner.

The room was clean and modern, with very comfortable beds. The bathroom was fine too, with a powerful modern shower. As stated by previous guests, the free mineral water is a real plus, and there are also two computers with free internet beside reception, with usage capped at 20 mins per person. All the staff we encountered were friendly and efficient. Our rate did not include breakfast (this is 14 Euros per person) but there is a cafe/bakery around the corner which sells a mixture of breads/croissants for very reasonable rates. Clearly this hotel is not in the very centre of Barcelona, however Selva de Mar metro is less than 10 mins walk, and from here it is only 6 stops from Jaume I station which is right in the centre of the city. Also, the official \"Bus Turistic\" stop is less than 100 metres from the hotel. The area around the Maritim is quite modern, with the large Diagonal Mar shopping centre only 5 mins walk away if this is your thing (there is a huge supermarket here, along with a Zara, Springfield, and a Hello Kitty shop!) We didn't feel at all unsafe walking back to the hotel late at night. Barcelona itself was excellent, you could easily spend a week here if you are a museum/culture buff. We took the train ourselves to Montserrat (line R5 from Espanya) - this costs around 20 Euros per person including the rack railway ticket to the top of the hill. The journey takes just over an hour. I would highly recommend this trip - the views were stunning. We also took an organised excursion with Rabbies tours to the Pyrenees, this involved a stop in the old town of Vic, and then taking the rack railway from Queralbs to the top at Vall de Nuria. I would give the tour 7/10 - I enjoyed the trip to the top, and our guide Rodrigo was excellent, however I didn't feel the itinerary posted on Rabbies website was entirely accurate - it mentions a multitude of activities you can do at Nuria - however none of these were possible because of snow and don't seem to open for a few weeks yet. Other points - even if Barca aren't at home you can go and see Espanyol play at home as we did (tickets from 25 euros). We also did the Barca tour which was good - just buy your tickets on the day at the stadium (17 Euros).

The property is located on the sea front, which wasn't particularly handy in January, but I can say that at this time of year, this location is especially quiet. If you are worried that it's going to be difficult to get to the main attractions, please don't be. It's an easy 10-minute walk to the nearest metro, then 6 or 7 stops to the centre, perhaps a single change and another couple of stops depending on where you're headed. Onto the hotel itself: it has a clean, modern feel to it. The reception staff were friendly enough. The ground floor is all open-plan, the bar round the back of the reception area, and the dining area separated from the lobby and bar by a large arty screen. There's a computer area and national and international newspapers between the entrance and the dining area. I like booking hotels with gyms, and although the gym here was not state-of-the-art, it was passable, with a decent treadmill, multigym and loose weights. I thought the stereo in there was a nice touch, but unfortunately it was broken. I was a little distressed at the lack of minibar in the room, although a positive quirk of the Front Maritim is the presence of fridges packed full of bottles of free still and sparkling mineral water positioned at the end of each corridor! This was a lovely touch. It's a bit weird these days for business-oriented hotels in major cities not to have wireless internet availability. They must have invested in cable internet socket installations just before Wifi took off, and they are stubbonly insistent on getting their money's worth. If you don't have a cable with you, you can buy them from reception for \u20ac5. Breakfast was OK, but there was no hot option. I was grateful that they had a flexible attitude to my leaving the car in their garage for no extra charge for a few hours after I had checked out. Good on them. I'd definitely stay here again, and would recommend it for like-minded business travellers.

The location is a bit distant, about 10 minutes walk to the metro station from where it takes about 15 minutes to reach the center of Barcelona. However, we got a very cheap price for this hotel so we decided to book. There is a beach nearby (5 minutes walk) with all services: toilets, shower, kiosks selling food and beverages. Also there is a big shopping center about 10 minutes walk away. There are not much restaurants in this area and especially not good ones - they are selling some cheap, frozen food made in the microwave so you have to go somewhere else for a dinner. The hotel is new, very clean with nice interior design and the rooms are comfortable. The room was a perfect size for us but there should have been more space to clothes for example - we don't want to keep our staff in the bags if we stay in a hotel for a week or more. The bathroom was very nice and there were shampoo, soap, shower caps and so on. There is no lock in the bathroom door which might bother someone. We stayed in a non-smoking floor but our neighbours seemed to be having some kind of a noisy party and they started smoking in their room. All the smoke came to our room as the air conditioning is probably desingned for non-smoking purposes. I complained about this to the staff and they promised to take care of it. We didn't notice any smoke after that night so I guess the staff took care of it. The breakfast was great: toasts, pastries, cheese, ham, vegetables, eggs, bagon, coffee/tea/hot chocolate, juice, fruits and so on. Some mornings there were too much people at the same time so we had to wait about 15 minutes to get a table. Also some mornings the staff had difficulties in responding the amount of people - coffee, tea and milk run out as well as coffee cups and plates. So people had to wait over 15 minutes to get cups and coffee... We also had a lunch at the hotel one day which was a mistake. I had some fish which was accidentally left raw and was awful, like a chewing gum. I only ate the side dish and complained about this to the waiter. He said that he would speak with the chef and then came back with our bill - with no discount of the fish which I wasn't able to eat as it wasn't properly cooked! I told him that I expect a compensation and he replied that the chef had tasted the fish and found it perfect. After arguing with me for a while he asked his superior from the reception to join the conversation and we continued this argumentation as I wasn't willing to pay for the food. Finally the boss promised that I would get the meal for free - after I had told him that I didn't want to continue arguing anymore and promised to pay for the food.

The metro is the best way to get around in my opinion. It was a 5-10 min walk from the hotel and it takes you along the coast to any of the resorts and then into the city. We found Barcelona expensive, especially on the beach resorts though it seems to be much cheaper in the city, even on the Ramblas. Eat at the Barri Gotic, it's atmospheric and authentic.

Ok the rooms are quite small, but who goes to Barcelona to spend time in their bedroom?!? The fantastic shower, regular maid service and free water were all enough to counter this very slight negative. Also found that free Internet usage in the Hotel's lobby was a great way to plan the holiday - where to eat, drink and dance! We found the location to be very relaxing; once you find the local Metro stop - a 10 minute walk to \"Selva de Mar\", the City is your Oyster! A mere 10-15 minute journey and you are in the heart of Barcelona, but it's nice to leave that all behind at the end of an evening and return to the safe and quiet area of the Front Maritim. Literally a 5 minute taxi journey or even a 20 minute stroll from the very cool \"Ciutadella Villa Olimpica\" where the fantastic \"Hotel Arts\" is situated - cannot recommend highly enough the stunning Arola restaurant, where the finest Tapas are served! The beaches of Nova Mar Bella and Barceloneta are a short stroll from the Hotel (5 mins) and are very clean; the Service in the beach cafes does leave a little bit to be desired though, it has to be said - just make sure you aren't ever in a rush! We booked through Expedia (\u00a3500/\u20ac729 for 2 weeks) and have since recommended the Front Maritim to other family members.", "Date": "April 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hampshire, England, UK", "Title": "\u201cBad Service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4830093", "Content": "We recently stayed at this hotel from 9 March through 14 March. When you arrive for breakfast, the assistant should tell you that you have to pay for breakfast \u2013 we did not know this. Breakfast is an astounding 25 Euros! The room service is, to be blunt, terrible. Every morning I ordered a very simple item, tea with milk. The tea would be cold and there would be no milk. One morning I got coffee. The delay between calling and receiving the tea could be anything up to 20 minutes. The room service staff were unfriendly and rude when delivering the tea. I believe the room service staff are the same as those serving at the bar and in the restaurant. They are rude, slamming items down on tables. Requesting toasted bread seemed to be a major issue during breakfast, as though you had asked them for a 3 course meal. They do not smile. They act as though they are the client and you are the staff. In the evening there is one bar man. He is never there when you want him. You have to wait ages as he is doing other jobs/roles. They all need customer service education. What is the point of these staff dealing with clients when they do not like them, or even pretend to do so? I also think the hotel needs more staff. My main area of complaint is room service and the service in the bar/restaurant. Service badly needs attention. Other than that the hotel is well maintained, especially the room cleaning and housekeeping.

Buffet breakfast was lovely, a very good selection of hot & cold. Free internet use in the library just off the reception, great for checking emails!! The hotel is about 20 mins. walk from the Olympic Port, lovely stroll down the seafront with great restaurants and bars. We found it much better staying just a little outside the city, very relaxing and refreshing! It only costs around 6 eur for a taxi right into the middle of anywhere in the city or the metro is just around the corner. Very safe area with a fantastic shopping mall 5 mins walk away.

We thought the breakfast was excellent well well above average!!! the rooms on the smallish side no balcony's,but hey how long are you in them! Great walk in shower plenty of room for two.! Rooms could do with some soundproofing though as we could hear when next door came back just putting there key in the door!! so I'm pretty damn sure they could hear us...!! Barcelona just a great place loads going on I found the locals very helpful most times but did get the impression they not too keen on the british! (even less to the very loud brash americans!) They would be horrified of the behaviour you find in other spanish resorts! This is'nt that type of place it is very cosmopolitan and coupley, soooo many places to eat and drink a bit pricey though.. I hired a car from the airport which I am glad of cost wise if you are doing your own transfers we met another couple who paid 48 euros from the licenced yellow and black cabs from outside the airport. You do see a hell of a lot more with your own transport if you want to sightsee in the day, but it is a bit stressful driving around there as everything is on a one way system and everywhere starts to look the same after a bit but is fine once you get your bearings..At nightime we walked upto the port olympic 30min walkalong the promenade where you will see some dodgy nakedness along the way(by dodgy I only mean all shapes and sizes!) The port is just a fantastic place really nice clean harbour loads of bars/restaurants and a very safe feeling place which I really liked, to get a cab back to the hotel from the port only 6 euros and there are thousands of taxi's do make sure you have the address of the hotel they dont have a clue if you just use the name, and from the fabulous las ramblas 10 euros each way. The absolutely beautiful font magica where freddie mercury sang barcelona when they had the olympics is an absolute must we went at 10 o'clock and we both felt the wow facter it was our best night,(Dont bother in the day the water is switched off the show is 8till midnight) All in all I cant wait to go back to barcelona in the future,would stay at this hotel again it was a goodbase with a fab breakfast,but would want to hire the car again as it is a bit of treck to places or a lot of taxi fares to get about or a hike to the metro, I saw the place much more of a couples holiday and would'nt of liked to have gone with two small children although there are things there, but if you are looking for a family holiday stick to tenerife,majorca etc there is so much more available to familys there..

During the hot summertime, when your too hot to keep walking and sightseeing ,THIS is the best location to stay: right at the beach. Nova Mar Bella is the most attractive beach in Barcelona, though it can be quit crowded..it is not as crowded as the Bogatell and Barceloneta area. The beach is suprisingly clean and in the night it is nice and romantic to have a picnic at the beach..just as the locals do. Jus get some nice calamares, wine and bread in the around the corner supermercado and enjoy eating, drinking and staring at the stares at night, maybe even take a swim. And after the picnic you just have a seat in the nearest beachbar...too hot in the inner city anyway. The brakfast is excellent, the staf friendly...the cleaning of the rooms just perfect..the mini bar with free bottled waters and apples are just a nice service. During SUMMER I would definitely take this hotel again.But during winter/spring tome I probably take a hotel in the city centre since it IS kind of a drag with the metro. However..the subway is only 10 minutes walking from the hotel... Next to the hotel is an asian restaurant but the service there completely ---- . Don't advice that unless you really have to (which is probably often the case). And around the hotel there's not much to go to, so like i said...a good hotel for summertime where you at least have a sit at the many beachclubs that are quit active. However..this is probably an area in the making...a lot of projects so in 3 years or so things probably be changed I miss the hotel and the wonderful beach allready...also the excellent breakfast!!", "Date": "August 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cMixed Opinion\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3493798", "Content": "Me and my girlfriend recently came back from a four night stay at the Hotel Front Maratim (18/05 - 22/05). The hotel was not my first choice (or even in my top 10) as we were there purely for sightseeing but because of the availablity in the city we ended up here. Whilst this hotel is within touching distance of what is a better than average \"city beach\" this hotel is in the business quarter and subsequently has a lot of conference related guests and if I am totally honest it is too far out from the Gothic/Diagonal/Marina area of the city and after a hard days sight seeing it is a real hassle to get back to the hotel for a laydown. The nearest Metro stop is \"Selva del Mar\" about 8 minutes walk from the hotel, then its about another 10 minutes direct on the tube into the Gothic quarter (Jaume I Metro). A taxi from the marina at about midnight was never more than 8 eruros. The hotel itself is very clean and the rooms are average sized, we had a queen sized bed which was massive and took up half of the room. The bathroom/shower room was nicely finished. One important thing I would say is make sure you check that breakfast is included with your room rate, we booked a typical double via Expedia and breakfast wasnt included and we ende up paying 11 euros each for what was a very poor breakfast. ********* Whilst this has nothing to do with the hotel I feel I should say that we were mugged leaving Selva del Mar metro and had a bag containg money and a passport stollen by locals. Yes we were using the metro after midnight but still, be careful, when we went to the embassy to get a new passport there were 5 other people in there at the same time all of whome had been robbed. My recommendation would be not to use the Metro after about 11, taxi's are pretty cheap and there's loads of them about.", "Date": "May 23, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "GBB Hotel Front Maritim", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d228621-Reviews-GBB_Hotel_Front_Maritim-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$92 - $182*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Paseo Garcia Faria 69</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08019</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "228621", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/9f/f1/9ff188713070d6819fb32833d3635c093large.jpg"}}
