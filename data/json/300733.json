The air-conditioning was also appreciated--temperatures were a little warmer than usual for my mid-September visit. The only relatively minor quibble I had during my stay was that the \"king\" bed I had appeared to actually be two sets of box springs and mattresses pushed together (one sheet covering) that tended to push apart at night.

I usually stay around the Bastille area since there are plenty of places to grab a beer and good choice of restaurants. My usual Ibis, Paris Bastille Opera, was full so stayed here. The hotel is typical of the Ibis hotels, average to small size room, basic, too much white pebbledash in the corridors but good value and clean. This hotel has a carpark with just 9 spaces that must be booked in advance. On this occasion it was full. The Bastille Opera has a much larger one where I have not had any problems parking. I managed to park on the street after a little circling and since it was a Sunday parking was free and overnight was free as per usual. Didn't have breakfast here since there are plenty of places nearby. Didn't eat here either. Pointless with a decent choice nearby. I would stay here again, if you definately need a secure carpark, use the Bastille Opera Ibis 5 mins away instead.", "Date": "September 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cWell located, small but nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "AM&AP", "ReviewID": "UR8442193", "Content": "I booked this hotel directly from the Ibis website, and saw that the parking had to be reserved directly with the hotel. But no e-mail address was given, so I had to call them directly. This was a slight annoyance - especially as the first time I called, the line was dropped (for other reasons I had to call the hotel other times, and on each first call, the line is dropped - I don't know why, but it's very annoying). The rooms were small, but I've never had a big hotel room in Paris. Clean, bright, and comfertable. The hotel has a nice little terrace where you can have breakfast (I didn't have the hotel breakfast - I knew a nicer cafe close by for half the price) or stop for a beer in the evening before going out for dinner. It's in a nice (ordinary life, ordinary people) area. 5 minute walk to the metro. 10 minute walk to Pl de la Bastille. All in all, I have no complaints. Except the price of the parking. At 14EUR per night, it's a little expensive. Maybe not expensive for Paris, but I got the feeling of being ripped off having to pay that much.", "Date": "August 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Iowa", "Title": "\u201cGood for the night\u201d", "Author": "mom2074", "ReviewID": "UR7953721", "Content": "We needed an overnight stay in Paris while en route to London.

There's no minibar, but there's a nice enough bar in the foyer area. However, you're in Paris so go try the local wine bars and brasseries.
