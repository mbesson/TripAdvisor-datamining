Oh bliss there are no open drains here. The legian pub across the way has nice food. Lovely palm and frangipani surroundings, with many bungalows of different vintage and price scattered amongst beautifully kept grounds. We mostly chilled by the medium sized pool and met several travellers who stayed there often. It is right next to both the padma and four seasons (good food if a touch expensive), bigger players who charge a hell of a lot more for funkier if sterile trappings. Mostly the staff were aimiable but the pool bar was defunct and the staff in the open breakfast area beside the pool seemed a little lax and annoyed. There is an absolute breakfast nazi in residence, so tread carefully over the coffee thermos. We preferred to eat elsewhere with good reason. Not great customer service I'm afraid, and not just because of the language barrier. Agreed it's very dark and quiet, your room needs more light. The administration desk is just plain scary, especially if you arrive at night. There is something quite strange at play here. Maybe they are just too busy but you will get wide smiles from the ground staff.Pay the extra for an updated room with outdoor shower and aircon. for they are the best. Under no circumstances agree to a day trip, there will be pressure to do so. All in all a splendid strange, clean, tropical place to enjoy.", "Date": "Oct 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR373456016", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "ambochick"}, {"Content": "Amazing Grounds, Functional Room We (two young Western male travelers) needed a place to stay during the run-up to the Idul Fitri holidays for one night. We were given their most standard room, a large first-floor tiled room with two single beds, a fan, and hot water.The room wasn't much to look at, but the price was right for such a high season and on short notice-- just under $30/night. One specific complaint-- bad wiring meant no light in the bathroom, had to leave the door open to see what I was doing.", "Date": "Oct 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR190598505", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "indohotel"}, {"Content": "Paradise We didn't book any accommodation in advance when we went to Bali and i'm glad, because we wouldn't have found this place otherwise.The gardens are beautiful so we spent about 3 weeks just relaxing by the pool instead of exploring the island! We were on a budget so we went for one of the cheaper rooms but it was still really impressive, with marble floors and a four poster bed. We even had an open roofed bathroom, and i had romantic visions of relaxing in the bath at night watching the stars but in actual fact it meant our bathroom became a jungle at night with all manner of insects and animals making an entrance. Terrifying at first but funny once i got used to it.The staff were all very friendly, but then again, who isn't in Bali.We loved staying at the Three Brothers and i will definitely stay there again if i'm ever fortunate enough to go back to Bali.", "Date": "Sep 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR235950942", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "SkippyBob"}, {"Content": "beautiful garden! This place has the most stunning and peaceful garden, which makes up for the room. considering i had the cheapest bungalow on offer, i couldn't expect a lot, but the one thing i will warn you about is the bed. it felt like the mattress was stuffed with hard newspaper. truly! indents in the bum area and back area were already set for you which made for an uncomfy sleep.mosquito nets are provided.the bath/shower area was quite pretty, but the shower is hand held, and not always a lot of hot water available.the cute restaurant where breakfast is served every morning is lovely. order the black rice with coconut and banana!the pool wasn't too special-but the garden IS! unfortunately they have one of those poor monkeys in a cage right in the middle of it which is a bit depressing. if you don't agree with this, remember to tell them.", "Date": "Aug 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR457970120", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "billybluegum"}, {"Content": "My favourite       Kuta Beaches", "Date": "Aug 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR564300731", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Simonvw"}, {"Content": "Tranquil Setting       3 brothers", "Date": "Jul 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR373886582", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "beachbummmGoldCoast"}, {"Content": "Fantastic value for money We stayed at Three Brothers Bungalows for 10 nights in June with our 11 year old son and just loved it. We had booked a deluxe suite through their website. Everything went smoothly. The deluxe suite is huge, brand new and comes with an open air bathroom. Toilet, bathtub and sink are under a roof whereas the shower is in the walled-in garden under a blooming frangipani tree. You can shower under the stars, just wonderful. Our room was bright and airy with a supersilent air-con unit. We had asked for an extra bed which in fact was just a matress on the floor. There are different sized and styled bungalows scattered throughout the huge and lovely garden. The pool is clean and nice-sized. There are two restaurants which mainly serve breakfast, one on Jln Werkudara and the other in the middle of the garden. It is just 5 minutes walk to the beach (in front of the Bali Padma) and 5 minutes through the garden and a small lane to Jln Legian. Breakfast is rather simple, but you can order a la carte from the menu. The only thing which bothered me was that only they were stingy with coffee and tea. There was only one cup included with breakfast and the unfortunate ones who hadn't noticed this fact were scolded by the waitress. But I would definitely return to Three Brothers Bungalows", "Date": "Jul 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR846417917", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "istana"}, {"Content": "Awesome!!
