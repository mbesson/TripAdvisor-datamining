This was our second trip to Rome this year, having stayed in the Golden Tulip Bellambriana in February. Hotel 207 far exceeded our expectations after reading less than positive reviews on Trip Advisor. I am glad to say we found all of them to be unfounded. We were greeted by a very friendly lady (can't for the life of me remember her name) who knew exactly who we were, checked us in and gave us a map of places of interest and places to avoid. We were then given a breakfast menu, choice of hot drink, juice and croissant which was delivered to our room every morning by one of the two friendly members of staff. We opted for the small room with balcony as we were on a budget. We expected to find a small single bed, as was advertised, but found a good sized double. The room itself was quite small, but still had a bedside table, dresser and wardrobe...and to be honest if you need a big hotel room to sit about in, in Rome, your missing out on a wealth of beauty that's just on your doorstep. Which is literally what you get with 207. St. Peters Square and the Vatican are a 5 minute stroll away, and for everything else the ottoviano metro stop is about a minute away, easily spotted from the balcony. There didn't seem to be any staff about after about 8 o clock, but in my opinion this just added to the feeling of being at home in Rome. I had read reports of the noise from the street and metro being unbearable, however the markets are closed up and gone by 9pm, not sure what time they start at as I always slept through their arrival-noise, when the doors were closed, was not a problem. You could occasionally hear the metro but unless you're as fussy a sleeper as say, the princess and the pea, the noise will not bother you. I cannot praise or recommend this place enough, we've been home for about a fortnight and I'm homesick for it...cannot wait to go back!", "Date": "October 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel with a wonderful location with very friendly staff.\u201d", "Author": "knoxy777", "ReviewID": "UR82590926", "Content": "I stayed there with my girlfriend at the end of september 2010 and decided to opt for a room with a balcony even though we were told the room would be small with a tiny bed.

The hotel is very very clean, probably the cleanest place I have stayed, and the staff are extemely helpful and friendly-we didnt have any problems with language either as their English was good! We were seved breakfast in bed every day and had a choice of times for it to be delivered.

It was all clean and the great thing was that it was close to the Vatican and within walking distance of what we wanted to see. We also got the bus to go to the colloseum and other places. We didnt notice the noise at all and anyway, who wouldnt want to be serenaded by the local market stall owner who saw us sitting on the balcony having a vino! There were larger rooms available but without a balcony. It was a small (pardon the pun) price to pay to be able to use this at night and in the early morning which is the only time we were really in the room (who wants to watch TV when you are in Rome!). For breakfast we just did what the locals did and had a coffee and a pastry standing up at the little shop just a few doors away from the hotel (the owner was very accomodating with our lack of Italian but we did try!). In regard to the front desk there was a small problem with the language barrier but they did try thier best and were very polite if a little reserved.

We left early - our choice. I will start this off by saying we are level headed people, who travel a lot. We know what level of service to expect when staying at a hotel. This review is being written in a very level-headed mindset. My purpose is to warn other travellers. When you need something at this hotel - be prepared to potentially fend for yourselves - seriously. Our experience was we only saw a staff member when we were checking in (we booked 2 nights, and were around at 'normal' hours). No other staff was to be found anywhere - and NO WAY to get a hold of them. This ended-up being a major inconvenience for us. Our first issue - day 1 in the room - we ran out of toilet paper and actually had to go out to a store and buy our own. No staff to be found anywhere. This set the tone for what was to come next........ We were told that the hotel could help us book transportation to the Airport, and were counting on them for their help. Our flight was leaving very early (before the metro even started), and we needed their help to arrange for a taxi to arrive at 4am for us. Seeing as we did not see anyone to help - we left the night before, as there were still taxis on the street, and we knew there was no risk of making our flight. This was our choice - but should NOT have been necessary. If you're running a business - have someone there to help your clients (or at least a number we could call to request help). Making a long story short - we spent the night at the Airport, and still paid for our room. When I contacted Priceline.com to help resolve this issue they assured me that 207 Inn would contact me directly. They never did. All I wanted was for this to be fair - maybe half of my money back for the night before seeing as we technically 'had the room'. 207 Inn - I assure you - the next time we return to Rome we will NOT be staying again. You have a nice hotel, but that is being wasted by your lack of customer service.

We left the \u201chotel\u201d after 5 days although we had to pay for the full ten days of our planned stay - and that\u2019s why we left: We really need a quiet room for the night after a buzzling day out in Rome and the Comfort Inn claimed to have \u201csoundproof\u201d windows. Rubbish! They have simple thermo-isolated windows with almost no sound-blocking function and all rooms go to the main street so you have no alternative. The Via J. Cesare is a very frequented street with a permanent street market so you might expect to be \u201csoundproofed\u201d until midnight at least. Do not be disappointed anyway: If it\u2019s not the street noise that keeps you awake, it\u2019s the underground that goes right under the building. The metro ends at midnight and starts again at 5 am. But do not expect to have 5 hours of continuous sleep. There are eight or so waste containers just in front of the \u201chotel\u201d and garbage collection is every night at 3 am for half an hour. Believe it or not they really come every night (at least during the five nights we spent). This is for the noise but it is not the end of our complaints list. One evening we had no warm water because the boiler was down. They do not serve their own breakfast but you get a voucher for a cup of coffee and one piece of pastry at a neighbouring bar \u2013 if you get it. Only at one out of five mornings there was a person at the reception desk. No voucher no breakfast. Good strategy to save money. At least the bar is very good and not too expensive. There were a lot of smaller annoyances such as: new towels only every second day (do not expect that they are dry the next day), no depositing opportunity in the bathroom, tiny TV with only one English channel (BBC world which drops out during rain), no telephone, small beds, very restricted English skills of the staff (although they try to be helpfull) etc..
