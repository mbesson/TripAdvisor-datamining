Check-in was quick. Knowledgable, attentive operations manager, Kent Chan, gave us a good map highlighting the area, and suite 305 was an exceptionally clean, large modern one bedroom with full bath and kitchen! Discovered through Tourism Vancouver's website, the special seasonal rate was $119, certainly a bargain at this location! A cab ride from downtown is about $10, and transit is two blocks away. The park trails lead a short distance to the renowned seawall and English Bay beach, and there are tennis courts, a shopping area, community centre, ethnic restaurants and exceptional 4* dining establishments nearby.

We were interested in the Katherine Hepburn penthouse with rooftop deck and vistas so will look further into that for our next trip. Our suite, though lovely, faced an inner courtyard of sorts, quite near the controlled entrance, which could get a bit noisy at night with the rather loud voice system, however with windows closed this wasn't a problem.

We already knew that it was an older apartment block, so that did not come as a surprise. Any negatives due to this were definitely outweighed by the plusses \u2013 namely friendliness of the staff, its location, and size of apartment. I would say though that the windows really do need replacing \u2013 in our suite we were unable to close them fully. The kitchen had everything one needed to cook a meal \u2013 the full oven was very useful and the dishwasher much appreciated. The housekeeping staff kept the apartment clean, and they too were very friendly. As our stay at Rosellen was at the start of a 3 week holiday we really appreciated being able to use the laundry at the end of the week. Washing powder is available from reception in reasonable size packets so you don\u2019t have to buy the huge boxes on sale in the supermarket! Located only a few minutes walk from Stanley Park, in a quiet leafy street, restaurants, banks and supermarkets are close by (about a 7 minute walk), on Denman Street. You can also catch buses to Downtown from there, and they are pretty frequent. If you prefer to use foot power then Canada Place is a 25-30 minute walk away. English Bay beach is a 10 -15 minute walk from the hotel. We ate in most of the time in the evenings, but we did splash out on a visit to the Fish House in Stanley Park \u2013 expensive but well worth it, and the service was excellent. Reception staff were extremely helpful, and when we had a problem with the bathroom washbasin it was fixed the same day. We had more or less given up on being able to visit Victoria and the Buchardt Gardens on a day trip without spending a fortune or getting up incredibly early, but the staff researched our options, discussed them with us and booked our preferred option for us. Taking a sea-plane for the outward journey, and returning by ferry worked well for us (sea-planes leave every 15 minutes from the dock which is within walking distance, so there is a good choice of flight times), giving us plenty of time to explore Victoria before catching the coach (already booked) to the Buchardt Gardens, where we had 2\u00bd hours to look around before picking up the coach again for the onward trip to the ferry terminal. Being from the UK we Brits do love our cup of tea in bed in the mornings, so an apartment such as that at Rosellen Suites suited us very nicely. Our next two weeks were spent on a Cruise and Land Tour to and in Alaska, but boy did we miss our little kitchen at Rosellen and our morning cup of tea in bed, not to mention in the 4* pre-cruise hotel, where there was only a $30 breakfast on offer! We would certainly recommend Rosellen to other travellers \u2013 don\u2019t go there expecting a modern glamorous hotel and you won\u2019t be disappointed. Instead enjoy the friendly helpfulness of the staff and the large, comfortable suites in a lovely area of Vancouver.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reston, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cTerrific hotel and staff, we definitely want to return.\u201d", "Author": "Jim H", "ReviewID": "UR117673127", "Content": "My wife, son and I just returned from spending a week at the Rosellen Suites and found nothing to complain about and everything to praise.

Our suite had no problems and was quite comfortable and clean, with a nice view of the mountains as well.

We did finally get into our room - it has not received any updating since 1970 and there were stains on the carpet. Needless to say we called and made arrangements to leave the next morning.

Our room is at #108 first floor. I think this is probabely the worst unit in the whole building. The bathrom is next to the corridor, the bedrooms are next to the street, the kitchen is next to the entrance of garage. Two bedroom, eough bed for five of us. The room is at the small side, kitchen is small but equipped with everything we need. I am very dissapointed with bathroom, two bedroom suite with only one bathroom, and very small and run down. When we were there, the next door building is ding the remodeling, it was very noisy. When I booked hotel, we didn't expect to rent a car, so I didn't reserve a parking spot. But we had rented a car as a last minute decision, though the front desk is closed, but with a few phone calls I was still able to get hold of someone to arrange the parking space. The house keeping comes twice a week, it was fine with us. The location is very nice, just a few blocks away from a busy street, with shops and restaurant, very convenient. Stanley park is just a short stroll away. When we check out the last day, we were able to store the baggage at the front desk for half a day, and was able to print our boarding pass in the front desk. Overall stay is pleasant. But I will try a different hotel in the same area next time.", "Date": "August 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alberta", "Title": "\u201cThe Rosellen Suites, Great place to stay!!!!\u201d", "Author": "golfwidowAlberta", "ReviewID": "UR17390426", "Content": "We recenty spent 4 nights at the Rosellen Suites with family and friends that came over from England.

After visiting W. Vancouver last summer, i wanted a location close to Stanley Park so that we could stroll to and enjoy exploring the park and its amenities with the kids. The neighborhood for the building is great and well kept. Neighbors are friendly and its just two easy blocks to the shops and resturants on Denman. The foyer of the hotel has a easy worn charm. The manager was a nice enough gentelman. The room #107 was on the ground floor with the living room window facing the alley. Not the best location I thought. The 2 bd unit was quite warm and i was surprised to find no central AC in the living room but the two bedrooms had a unit each, retrofitted into the glass windows. The kitchen was smaller than i expected. and there was just a single full bath. Overall, everything was old and a bit worn but clean. I doubted the two small AC units would cool the living room judging from their recessed locations and i was correct. I left the units on all through the stay and when we got back after an afternoon of exploration and wandering along the English Bay waterfront, the living room was still quite warm and still slightly less that comfortable. The following morning, we went a block and stepped into Stanley Park with the intent of walking to the aquarium that was located in the park and we found the pedestrian trail along Lost lagoon. The day was warm and sunny and the edge of the lagoon was sprinkled with sleeping ducks and geese. The willows provided a speckeled shade from time to time and the walk was thoroughly enjoyable. The Vancouver Aquarium turned out to be quite interesting. My 7 5 and two year old boys enjoyed every display. My personal favorite was the Amazon exhibit. After the aquarium we wandered along the waterfront and then back up Denman street to the hotel. A nice day's activity. Notable was the lack of maid service when we returned that evening . Then to find out that maid service was every other day, which is ok but not preferable with 3 kids. Day two didnt improve the cooling situation. The living room area was small but with the lack of cooling seemed a bit opressive. The kids didnt notice , just the adults. Next morning we awoke to discover that one of the cars was broken into..one of four cars vandalized, in the secure underground parking garage. ! what a downer. The manager was apologetic and equally well-prepared with vacuum cleaners, plastic , tape and phone numbers to log a case with the local Police for insurance claims. I was quite disappointed that at the end of it all, the sense of safety of personal possessions was lost. Glad we didnt leave valuabls in the van . My reccomendation- for the price, stay in a hotel wth better security. Its not worth it to have your car damaged and items stolen during a weekender at this hotel in Vancouver.", "Date": "May 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "alberta", "Title": "\u201cLike your own apt in the west end\u201d", "Author": "lauriedrumheller", "ReviewID": "UR15234758", "Content": "Clean apt. in a great neighbourhood.

Could use a fresh coat of paint in the kitchen but the outstanding location next to Stanley Park and Denman Street more than make up for it. The bed was very comfortable. The parking area out back, that many other TripAdvisor members have talked about, looks a bit dodgy but is fine if you are familiar with the West End. We had no problems. Hands down, best Japanese food we've ever had outside of Japan, is a couple blocks away at Kingyo Izakaya on Denman Street.

Located next to Stanly park in a beautiful leafy neighbourhood, we felt very safe at night walking to the restaurants & shops just a few blocks away, the location is perfect. The best thing was the apartment we had 106 - was very roomy - two bedrooms , two bathrooms, a lounge room, dining room & full kitchen, all spotllessly clean & very comfortable beds. Traveling with a family of five we found many other places more much more expensive & cramped with no cooking facilities let alone a dining room as well. Yes the decor is a bit older,but not at all run down or shabby & we felt it was tasteful & suited the era the street was built in. The lift was a bit slow as mentioned but it did the job, (at least they have a lift )& such a small inconvenience for all the other wonderful attributes. Parking is also limited but booking ahead there was no problem. Jean in the office was so helpful & answered our constant questions with a smile every time. He also recommended a seafood restaurant only a few blocks away over looking the water \"The Boathouse\" It was sensational for seafood, would have to go down as one of the best Seafood meals ever & I have had a few across Europe, Asia USA & Australia! Also Worth visiting was the Stanley Park Aquarium, again I have seen quite a few . It is better than Sea World SanDeigo, & as good as Great Barrier Reef Australia .It is up there with the best. I booked our entire trip 20 different hotel/appartments solely using trip advisor for a family of 3 teenagers , 2 adults & 2 elderly grandparents (not easy to please every one) & we had fantastic accomodation the whole way with only one exception & we can't say we weren't warned by trip advisor (it had very mixed reviews.)
