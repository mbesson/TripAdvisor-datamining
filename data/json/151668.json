The whole setting is what makes this place special. It was built in 1858 as a coffee plantation house and during the last three decades it's being operated as a parador or bed and breakfast. It's currently operated by the municipality. The staff in general is very kind. The service is nice; the food is what you would find at any puertorrican middle class home. Home style food. Generous portions. Don't expect food cooked by a chef; it's cooked by local women, that cook the same way they cook to their families. Nothing fancy at all but with very nice flavor. The rooms are not in top condition aesthetically speaking but are very clean. They have cable TV. I went with a group that took the whole place for us, and had a blast there.

Some of the reviews are years old--we stayed late May 2011 and the beautiful old place had been recently repainted and looked great. The food wasn't fabulous--the food in P.R. runs to fatty and fried everywhere you go--but the people were nice and the room we had--#19--was wonderful. Yes, the tiles were chipped and the water was tepid--but honestly, the building is 165 years old so we didn't expect a Marriott Courtyard. The big bonus is that you're in the middle of a rain forest, and our room, which had windows on two sides, made us feel as if we were sleeping right in the jungle. It was magical. We loved the wraparound porches, the river-water pool, the hammocks, the wonderful Old World atmosphere. We would absolutely stay here again and ask for Room 19. (Huge comfortable bed.) And for the reviewers who complained that they don't speak English? Come on, really??? It's the mountain area of P.R.--they don't HAVE to learn English.

The balcony off our room was a great place to sit and read, sipping drinks, and listening to the birds and coquis. Our room was no-frills, old but clean.

So we drove all the way to Hacienda Gripinas, when we arrive there was no one at the Lobby/Front Desk, but we got a note with our names on it, that told us where our rooms where and the keys where left on the front desk, so we pick them up and walk all the way to the rooms, only to find one clean room out of three. The second and third room where all messy with used towels hanging on chairs, the bed seem like it has been used hours before, some cups of wine where also at the second room. The third room did not have any lights, only one lamp seems to work. So we went down to the lobby and found the only three people working at the Restaurant. We told to a man who seems to be some kind of manager and told what we just found at our rooms. He was very surprise like us and gave us two new rooms. We went to the rooms, and we found that we didn\u2019t have TV/Cable nothing (though they gave us the tv controls) so for us the TV where just ornaments.

Jayuya is the probably the most isolated town in Puerto Rico. No one speaks English (again if you do research you will know this- only 30% of Puerto Ricans speak fluent English), it has a revolutionary history (1950 they declared a short lived independence). You will be 4000 feet above sea level. There will be mosquitoes, lizards, wild dogs, and roaming chickens. Instead of riding bikes, the kids ride horses, yet they seem to wear all the up to date clothing. The ride there will be one of the most scenic and windy you have ever witnessed. If this kind of stuff interests you as it does me, you will love it. It was a great escape from the resorts at the Rio Grande and the hustle and bustle of San Juan. For $130/night two people get fed dinner and breakfast (average), but that is a steal even if they are feeding you dog food. For the best experience ask for room number 5 as it has the largest balcony. The beds are somewhat uncomfortable and there is no hot water, but this does not take away from the relaxing nature of the hacienda. Bring a book, some bug spray and relax in the nice wooden rockers on the main 30 ft balcony (that has spectacular views of the mountains). Relaxation is the key here. It does seem that the hacienda has deteriorated a bit since the town has taken over, but it still has great charm, and if you have a small Spanish phrase book you will be fine. When you go into \"town\" check out the rock with Taino paintings, the beautiful river where you can swim, the Taino museum the recreated mayors house (if you don't speak Spanish ask for Omar, he has basic comprehension of English and will love to tell you/rant about the history of the town. He will also offer you tours on horses and ATVs for discount prices compared to the more touristy areas around San Juan. If you do decide to come here, please do not cheat yourself out of driving straight from San Juan. The roads are clearly marked and you cannot get lost. This drive was remarkable and something that can only be understood by those who have done it. It is not dangerous at all (my girlfriend was freaking out the whole time before the trip, but was not scared at all when we were finally doing the drive). Just stay around 20/mph, honk around sharp turns and keep the camera on for amazing pictures. Do not go south to Ponce and then up! Do not go come here with children, as they will kill themselves with boredom and/or they might ruin an otherwise peaceful experience for other travelers.

Some strange practices such as no answering machine on phone, so if someone not in the office (which happens frequently) you can't leave a message but have to keep calling back until someone answers. Another oddity: Has a gorgeous huge lower pool, fed by a natural stream. But as my friend discovered, once in the pool it can be extremely hard to get out because all the rungs lower than the water level are broken off. By design there is over 20\" between the water and the pool lip, so just heaving yourself over the lip is not an option for a middle aged woman. She eventually got out and mentioned the problem to a groundskeeper. He laughed and said yes, it was hard to get out-- even he had problems sometimes (!) These oddities might be explained by the fact that the municipality took it over 3 years ago for back taxes after the company that owned it went bankrupt. The hotel provides absolutely no information about what to do in the area, which is a shame because there are a lot of great hikes, museums, and activities in the area.

The rooms need better quality furniture and bed covers; pillows should be better. In my opinion Jayuya have some of the best coffee plantations in Puerto Rico and the hotel is not taking full advantage of this fact.. There is no special coffee mystique at the hotel (just regular drip coffee). The hotel could have an expresso or coffee bar with a fancy italian expresso machine, local coffee for sale, and have a coffee plantation excursion (as a consortium with local growers like Hacienda Don Pedro) including coffee tasting. Great locations such as Kona with their coffee in the big Island of Hawaii, Napa Valley with is wineries, and others are extreme examples of how to create a sound bussiness taking advantage of the production of good quality products. In the Central mountains of Puerto Rico, such an example could be created (\" Puerto Rico Coffee Trail\").

Orlando at the front desk could not have been more accommodating.

When we went into town and asked people on the street for directions or for the nearby sights, they would stop and very enthusiastically tell you what you needed to know and then they would ask you if you visited this or that other place in Jayuya, and they would tell you what the site meant to them and give you directions on how to get there. Very nice, friendly and decent people. More so here than at other places we have visited. So, my advice to you is treat people with respect and you'll have a far better time. Like others have recommended, I also advise to get here from Ponce (Route 10) even if you come from San Juan.

No need to turn on the A/C. We had problems the first night, the bed!!!! It was in really bad shape!!! You could feel the holes and the springs because it was really worn out.

Next morning we asked to be changed. we were moved at once to room #5 and given a discount for the night. The room was perfect, it was right next to the beautifull antique lobby, it had an antique decor with stone floors and furniture, the room even had a great spacious wooden balcony looking over the pool and the mountains, the balcony has a table, 2 chairs and a little hammock, there was even a bird nest of this native bird that sang every morning.

All the food is well proportioned, and the staff is really accomodating.

My husband talked to him for a while and was quite puzzeld when he was asked how much each of us weighed. In short ,offered us a 2 hour tour for 50 dollars, which we considered ok. He picked us up at the front of the hotel in a shabby jeep which felt it would fall appart any minute, we drove for maybe 10 minutes and arrived at a wooden shack wich he claimed was his home. From there we would start the ride into a coffee plantation. What we saw next was shameful, 2 rather small horses in bad shape were being prep for the ride. They looked kind of skinny and tired, no wonder they asked our weight, these horses would not been able to carry a common overweight person.It was also strange that this man who was our tour gide had two 14 year olds tending the horses and made them come on the tour with us by foot. At first I was skeptical but they all insisted that it was ok and that they did this tour everyday. We started the ride going up a really steep hill, the horses breathing became so heavy that for a moment I thought they would colapse, the two boys went up by foot, while all the time the guide To\u00f1ito followed us in his jeep. We were led into this beautifu plantation, here we were explained about the the history of jayuya, the local traditions and the process of puertorican coffee harvest we were also taken to a lovely stream where we rested for a while and headed for an anciet indian burial ground. The place was lovely but I kept being distracted beause my horse was famished and kept on going off course to eat the grass. One of the boys (Miguel) was really sweet and asked me a lot of questions, I asked if he gets payed for what he does, he said no, he just did it for fun. On the way down the horses were so tired I decided to give it a break so I decended on foot, I even got a taste of some bananas right off the tree, and some water directly from the stream, it was totally safe. Once we got back to the hotel I commented to the desk about the condition of the tour, their response was just quick reply \"oh well, we really dont own the tour, we just recomend them\". So much for safety and quality concern. Besides that our stay was ok, I would return for a weekend, maybe just for a night but not more than 2. If you have kids, skip this place, there is no activities at all execpt for the pool which is small and the water is always cold because it comes directly from the mountains, no nightlife whatsoever, and town is really boring.You need a car to go to all the fun places like the Indian ceremonial park which was great. If you are looking for peace and quiet, love nature and are not looking for any luxuries this place might be good for you.", "Date": "July 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cA Treat of a Mountain Retreat\u201d", "Author": "HuaMulan", "ReviewID": "UR7279121", "Content": "After the bustle of San Juan and its over-priced lodging options, my husband and I rented a car to see the heart of Puerto Rico. Nestled amid the highest mountains on the island and at the end of several twisting, narrow, cliff-hanging roads, we came to rest at Hacienda Gripinas outside the village of Jayuya. The hacienda was originally a prosperous coffee plantation and has retained the flavor and atmosphere of another era. We had a choice of two rooms and opted for one on the main floor, just off the dining area, a reading lounge, and main balcony. Our room opened onto its own balcony that overlooked a swimming pool with views of the mountains. Had the hacienda been busy, the location of this room next to public areas would have been less than ideal, but at most, there were two other couples that weekday night. Lulled by the wind and the sounds of coqui, we could easily pretend that we had this beautiful, quiet place all to ourselves. Our stay included both dinner and breakfast with many tasty menu options and ample portions. Miguel, our receptionist, host and waiter, was courteous and attentive - including finding an extra blanket for the cool mountain night. My only complaint was the erratic water temperature when I wanted a hot shower. It took a long long time running the water before it became hot and a short short time before it went cold again. At the mid-week price of $109 for room, dinner, and breakfast, Hacienda Gripinas is a budget traveler's dream.

It\u2019s definitely off the beaten path, a good two-hour drive from San Juan, the last 45 minutes through narrow, twisty mountain roads. Armed with a good map, however, we found it easily and never had to call for directions. Our room was furnished with the basics, and included satellite TV and a heater/AC unit. I mention the heater because the nighttime mountain air goes down to the mid-60s in January and we came \u201cthisclose\u201d to turning it on. The room had vents permanently open to the outside near the ceiling and it got pretty chilly around bedtime. I was concerned that with the vents open to the outside, we might also find some crawly critters in the room, but this fear proved to be unfounded. Based on this parador\u2019s website, I was also expecting to get a poor night\u2019s sleep because of the coqui frogs and early-morning roosters. Although I did vaguely hear a rooster at 3 a.m., neither the frogs nor the roosters were enough to keep me from sleeping quite well. The mattress seemed thin and hard, but my husband and I both remarked to each other that we awoke the next morning without the usual aches and pains us 40-somethings are prone to have. Some previous reports have noted there was no hot water \u2013 there is, you just have to let it run for a long time before the hot water actually shows up. Hacienda Gripinas is a restored older building, without the amenities of a modern hotel...expectations must be adjusted accordingly. Unfortunately, our time was short at Gripinas and we didn\u2019t get to fully appreciate all the grounds have to offer. There are two pools, although only one seemed to be cleaned for daily use. There are also many places around to the hotel to sit and talk or read a book. The food was good, local Puerto Rican cuisine. The room rate includes dinner and breakfast, excluding any beverages. Our entire bill for the full experience including room, taxes, meals and a couple of rounds of Medalla beers that we had with dinner and juice with breakfast was $130. A bargain, I\u2019d say! Offsite, the town of Jayuya offers a couple of \u201cmust sees\u201d. The Cemi museum offers a glimpse into the area\u2019s archeological finds from the indigenous Taino culture. What we really enjoyed, however, was the Cultural Center next door to the museum. It is staffed by artists who volunteer their time with the goal of exposing both the local community and outside visitors to the indigenous history and culture. We happened to come by as they were getting ready to eat some lunch and rather than ignoring us or asking us to come back later, they insisted we join them for bite to eat. The artists also sell their wares at the Cultural Center \u2013 a great place to pick up some true \u201cmade in Puerto Rico\u201d souvenirs. A bit further down the road, we found the Caf\u00e9 Tres Picachos, a coffee farm and processing facility. This was exactly what my husband was looking for, and we purchased over 20 lbs. of excellent Puerto Rican coffee at a bargain price. My only regret with our experience is that we didn\u2019t give ourselves more time to enjoy the \u201cR&R\u201d opportunities Hacienda Gripinas has to offer.", "Date": "February 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sonoma, California", "Title": "\u201cHacienda Gripinas was a great experience\u201d", "Author": "humanone", "ReviewID": "UR5379932", "Content": "Hacienda Gripinas is not a luxury hotel nor a resort, which is why it is so wonderful.

I had read that you did not need air conditioning because there were fans and you could keep the windows open and get the cool mountain air. In fact the fans did not work and you were compelled to use the air conditioning. The restaurant is very good.
