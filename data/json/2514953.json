We used the steam room and pool in the basement (a must), dined at the restaurant which is fantastic and visited the bar which is equally charming. L'Hotel has a great history which is also part of the appeal. The main benefit of a small hotel is the lack of guests, breakfast was often taken with just the two of us in the dining room and this definitely added to the experience.

Specifically at St Germain des Pr\u00e8s. So we found this small boutique hotel with a One-Michelin star restaurant and the additional charm of being the place where Oscar Wilde died in 1900. Location Absolutely perfect. Right in the middle of St Germain, within walking distance from dozens of bistros, bars, restaurants and other amazing places, we were very pleased with this neighborhood. The area is very well served from the subway and it is easy to go from there to any other place in Paris. Also, it is so close to the Louvre that you can walk (and I definitely recommend this) from the hotel to the museum, and then head to Champs-Elys\u00e9es to finally reach the Arc de Triomphe. It's really special! The street (Rue de Beux Arts) is packed with art gallerys (and you probably are going to see yourself standing in the street admiring some of the nice paintings) and is often taken by the fine arts students that go to the bars nearby to have a drink. For us, it was an amazing setting! Service (Concierge, Food, Cleaning, Internet) L'H\u00f4tel has a good set of services: great breakfast (not usually included in the fare), rooms are pretty clean and neat and free internet. Here, I have one drawback: concierge services. We asked the man at the reception to see if we could get Opera tickets. We were a little disappointed because it took one day for him to get the information that we actually missed the Opera we wanted to see. Besides that, we were recommended a lousy restaurant at the only night we asked him for any recommendations. We expected a lot more on concierge services for a 4-star hotel. Apparently, they also have a special pool at the top level which we could not enjoy due to time restrictions. Rooms (Size, Decoration) Rooms are small. But do not expect large rooms in Paris. So, if you compare to other hotels in the city, L'H\u00f4tel rooms have a good size. Beds are comfortable and big. We went during the fall so air conditioning was ok. I guess that in the summer it could get hot in the rooms (but it's really just guessing). Bathrooms are actually big and comfortable. Bath products are amazing and they sell it at the reception. There is one last thing about the rooms: decoration. The hotel is actually what was once a 1800s house. And one of its charms is exactly this. Point is, the decoration of the place is supposed to remember you of that time. It means that room ornaments have kind of a baroque style and can be too dark and heavy for some people. So, if you don't like this kind of decoration, maybe it is not the place for you. Finally, L'H\u00f4tel was a really good experience and we would definitely recommend the place. Just make sure you like the style and enjoy.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut Yankee", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding\u201d", "Author": "alipeach", "ReviewID": "UR118811006", "Content": "This hotel was everything promised.

The last one is exceptionally good and useful after long walks around Paris :) The only uncomfortable thing is the size of the room, which you, actually, don\u2019t notice until the second or third day (so for those going on weekends it might be ok).

He was very helpful. His manager not so helpful. Our one niggle was that our trip was paid for by my in laws but they would not accept their card details. They also wanted payment on check in. I wonder whether they treat everyone like that? We felt a little like we were treated as would-be hustlers! But we put that to one side and enjoyed our stay.

Loved the experience of this famous spot, but it was very pricey and has its limitations, so I must conclude that I would not stay here again, tho I would recommend it and am glad we tried it. Made for a perfect girls getaway.

We were apprehensive about ordering breakfast in our room having read previous negative comments, but we found nothing to complain about. The patisserie was fresh, and looked to have been from the local Paul, and the rest of the meal was wonderful. We didn't get a chance to use the hamman pool due to our schedule. I consoled myself with the idea that it probably would have been freezing anyway, only to discover it was a perfect temperature when visiting on the way out. The bar was intimate, with some of the best whiskey and cocktails I've had for a long time. Best of all, the service is wonderful - reason enough to come back. We took at look at one of the mignon suites before we left to see how this would compare for a less luxurious trip. Whilst on the small side, they were nowhere near as small as indicated in previous reviews, and more than comparable value with other Parisian establishments.

I can deal with character over comfort. L'Hotel is a lot of hype and not a great choice if you want a charming boutique hotel in Paris. I stayed there after reading recommendations for L'Hotel in countless travel magazines and after reading reviews on TripAdvisor. I ignored the reviews of people complaining of dirty drapes and uncomfortable beds. I figured they were picky travelers not interested in the charm of boutique hotels. I was wrong. I left L'Hotel after one night. The bed was hard and uncomfortable. I know they say the beds aren't great in France but I've stayed in other Paris hotels and they are FAR better. There is no air conditioning - I traveled in July and this was unbearable. The drapes were torn, the wallpaper was peeling off the wall, the upholstery was dusty and dirty. This is far from charming - it's neglect. The furniture was uncomfortable, the bathrooms old. The rooms are around $700 US a night. For that price, I ended up moving to a Deluxe room at Le Bristol for the same price. I couldn't believe the difference! Great bed, air conditioning, and still charming! The only good things about L'Hotel are the staff and the location. The staff was wonderful, friendly and helpful. The location is great. For a left bank hotel I prefer Relais Christine. Great location, great staff, comfy, clean and many rooms come with your own garden patio - the breakfast room is a stone cellar...so French and charming! The rooms have a somewhat modern decor but the beds are comfortable, the rooms are quiet and romantic. If you really want to stay here - I do recommend renting an hour in the cellar pool for two. It was very romantic and I am happy we stayed for one night for this unique experience. In summary, L'Hotel is a neat hotel to VISIT and have a drink in the legendary bar.

The first time we stayed in the slightly larger Bijou room, but this category was booked out so we plumped for the smallest room category, Mignon, for our second stay last month. I had my reservations that the Mignon room may be too small, but it turned out to be perfectly large enough for our needs. Each room is decorated differently, and despite being smaller, we actually preferred the room we were assigned this time than the previous one. We also found the general maintenance of the hotel had improved a lot from our first visit (without losing its charm). The feel was therefore more luxurious and we loved it even more this time round. The great location of the hotel has been commented upon many times, so I shan't repeat it here. But it is worth specifically mentioning the good and friendly front desk service (often the factor which lets so many parisian \"boutique\" hotels down)! Just one comment I hope the hotel management will bear in mind though. We planned a special meal at the one Michelin-starred restaurant at the hotel and I had informed the hotel when booking that one of the guests is vegetarian. I was told the chef will accommodate this off-menu, which we appreciated. I know Paris isn't exactly a vegetarian-friendly city, but as it turned out, the veggie main course was really rather disappointing. As Arpege has shown, vegetarian dishes can be exciting, unusual and delicious (salt encased beet!) - perhaps the chef could include just one vegetarian main course on the menu to show he or she has considered the needs of his vegetarian guests? Finally, I noticed L'hotel is owned by the same British hotel group who owns the Cowley Manor in the UK, as the toiletries (fab) and even the butter which came with our breakfast had Cowley Manor branding on it. I hope British imported products won't start over-running the hotel as the distinctive parisian left-bank feel of L'hotel is surely the key to its success.

One or other of us has got to go.\u201d \u2014 Oscar Wilde (1854-1900), at H\u00f4tel d\u2019Alsace, a pension house, now simply L\u2019H\u00f4tel The wallpaper did not go; Oscar Wilde did. We spent five nights in the very room where Wilde spent his last years, following his release from a two-year term of imprisonment at Reading Gaol. And then Wilde passed into eternity from this very room. The wall covering of Room No. 16 is based on illustrations and descriptions of Wilde\u2019s dining room in London. Peacocks strut and preen on tooled and heavily impasto green leather of the upper half of the walls. Some of these showy birds appear to kiss; because these are peacocks only, the nod to \u201cthe love that dare not speak its name\u201d is well understood. Heavy wood furniture, marble-topped tables (one with a large flat-screen TV on it), brass lamps combine to give the feel of an English gentleman\u2019s club. Any hotel accommodation is put to the test by how well you sleep. The comfortable mattress passes this test with flying colors. The small, planted terrace is an excellent spot to enjoyed breakfast, courtesy of L\u2019H\u00f4tel\u2019s room service, each morning. At 18 euros per serving, it is possible to split the ample breakfast of croissants, baguettes, jams, cereal, coffee, orange juice, milk, and yogurt and still be satisfied. Room #16 faces north; it does not get too warm, even during a warm Parisian summer, and the air conditioning worked just fine. For a warm-weather stay, I would suggest reserving one of the north-facing, rear rooms (numbers 14, 16, 24, 26, 34, 36, 44, 46) to avoid the heat of the sun and the heat reflected from the buildings across the street. With only 20-accommodations, L\u2019H\u00f4tel is a boutique hotel. It is a pricey treat; but it is worth it. Mick Jagger, Johnny Depp, and Keanu Reeves have been among the celebrities who have thought so as well. L\u2019Hotel rightfully trades on its historical association with Oscar Wilde. Photographs of the late 19th century wit and playwright and letters written by him to friends hang framed in the lobby; his likeness decorates the heavy brass key fob, as well as a plaque outside the front door. In the late 19th century the establishment was called H\u00f4tel l\u2019Alsace, where the author of \u201cThe Importance of Being Ernest\u201d left an unpaid bill exceeding 26,000 francs. Letters to Wilde asking him to settle his tab are framed and displayed over the writing desk in Room #16. The public areas are sumptuously decorated in a style that brings the Second Empire to mind. With plush green and red velvets, trims of gold tassels, pedestal tables with black marble tops, brass wall sconces, cameo medallions, striped wallpaper edged with classical scene borders one might expect Empress Eug\u00e8nie to walk through the door. A publicly available 21st century computer tucked in a corner of the lobby does not even intrude on the illusion of time. Designer Jacques Garcia is the man responsible for this over-the-top fantasy d\u00e9cor. After a refreshing, hour\u2019s dip in the basement pool (quite a rarity in these small, Left Bank buildings) and a stop in the steam room you can slip into the plush bathrobe and slippers that come with each room. You will need to reserve the use of this spa at the front desk; massages, by reservation too, are also available. The complementary bath gel, bath oil, shampoo and conditioner are quite nice. The staff, all young, attractive and friendly, is very attentive. I had reserved the room directly with the hotel because I wanted to be certain that we booked \u201cla chambre Oscar Wilde,\u201d therefore I was in touch with the hotel regularly. My e-mails were always answered promptly, including my request that L\u2019H\u00f4tel reserve us a table for diner at Le Jules Verne, the restaurant in the Eiffel Tower. L\u2019H\u00f4tel does have its own restaurant, rated one star by Michelin. We would have eaten there but it had closed for the very sane traditional French summer month-long break on the very day we arrived. L\u2019H\u00f4tel is ideally situated in the middle of the 6th arrondissement on Rue des Beaux-Arts, and much of Paris stands within easy walking distance.
