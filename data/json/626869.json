The hotel's beach club is just a block away. At night they have this amazing fire show with dancers. We couldn't sleep the two nights we stayed there, the first room - a suite - faces the 5th Ave so the noise is constant, and to make it worse the a/c unit and ceiling fans did their part with the noise as well. Next morning we switched to a smaller room in the back, and at night the noise was even worst from the clubs down the back street. We had to ask for extra towels, which weren't delivered but were waiting at the security booth for us to go for them, because in both rooms half of the water in the shower goes in the drain, the other half goes outside: there's no door in the shower. The products available in the bathroom (shampoo, lotion, and bath gel) are really good.

Our room was not clean (huge dust bunnies on the floor and on the fans, the sheets had stains on them, and it seemed like the shower had not been cleaned from the previous guest). The cupboards were all crooked and everything else was majorly outdated. We didn't trust the hotel staff - no smiles as we passed them by, just a nod usually, just overall unfriendly and questionable. It rained our 2nd night there, and water came pouring in the front door - we had to put a towel in front of the door crack. Our bathroom also had water constantly on the floor due to the shower - no matter how we turned the shower head, water got out of the shower and pooled on the bathroom floor. We called the front desk 3 times during our stay, each time with no answer. Just a completely disappointing experience.

We loved the beaches last year so decided to spend a day lounging on one of their chairs while we drank some of the best pina coladas in the area. Most of the beach area has been washed away so the view is not the same. The biggest complain though is their staff members. While having a quick dip in the water, my camera disappeared from my zippered beach bag. We alerted the staff and manager who indicated their staff members are checked before and after shifts. One specific staff kept on hovering around us and just prior to swimming had asked if I wanted him to take pictures of me. Once the camera disappeared so did he for at least 30mins. The family of 4 lounging right next to my lounger didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. I provided the manager and staff with a money offer that I didn't think the theif was able to turn down but sadly I returned home without my treasured item. They were kind enough to alert the tourist police to attend my location to what I believed was to take a report. These \"tourist\" police spoke no word of english. Granted I am in their country and I should learn the language but being the \"tourist\" police you'd think a pre-requisite should be they too know how to speak another language. They took some minor information and directed me to walk approx 4 blocks to file another report with another person who didn't speak English.

Only us and another couple were staying overnight, so as we made our way up and down 5th, we would check out the hotel rates of various places. We chose Blue Parrot on 5th and were very pleased. The rate for each room (one was a King, the other two Queens) was about $65/room. This rate included a nice/simple breakfast which consisted of a fresh fluit place and toast out on the beach. It also included the cover for the Blue Parrot club that night as well as beach chairs the next day. The room was cute. Older, but with a modern touch. LOVED it. The shower is in the room and only separated by a cement wall, so if you are just friends it could be a bit awkward for the lack of privacy. I was with my hubby and could care less. The bed was hard, but slept wonderfully. Room amenities included two small bottles of water, shampoo, soap - the usual. I think there also was a coffee machine, but we don't use it so I don't pay that much attention. Noise from the club could be an issue. I opted to stay in that night while the others went to the clubs. Yes, I could hear the music, but it definately didn't keep me up at all. I'd have no problem staying here again, or recommending it to anyone else. In that recommendation, I would be sure to mention that noise could be a problem but for us it wasn't.

Upon checking in, I was immediately wary because the reception area was pretty seedy: stuffy little room, tiny desk staffed by clueless employee, large refrigerated unit selling snicker bars and red bull, plus it was dirty. After procuring the key, I walked into the room and stood in shock for a minute, then walked back to the reception area to inquire where I could find an Internet cafe. I was going to find somewhere else to stay. First, the rooms are TINY. We had 3 girls staying in a room with 2 double beds, and after setting down each of our suitcases onto the available floor space, there was no where else to move. There are no dressers or drawers to store your things. The only storage available is an itty-bitty closet with 3 shelves and 3 hangers. lol. Yeah, right! Second, and most shocking, there was no private bathroom. The only thing with a door was the toilet placed in the corner next the closet, which was inside a tiny little room (i.e. it would hold a water heater and not much else). The shower was in the opposite corner behind the door, and was constructed with a partial (80%) wall that opened up to a walk-in shower. In other words, no door-no privacy. Unless you wanted to undress/dress inside the shower, you had to strip down in the middle of the room first. The sink was so shallow we spilled water everywhere whenever it was turned on; however, that wasn't the worst of it! The sink and countertop were a built-in on the wall opposite the beds, and in the tiny room we found ourselves in that meant that we could wash our faces a mere 3' from where we (and our friends) were sleeping. Soooo not conducive to allowing anyone privacy whilst getting ready nor sleep while another person takes care of hygiene. The best part of the shower arrangement, is that in the heat and humidity that makes up the Mexican climate, the added steam from the open-air shower made the room reek of mildew and mold. The hotel did its best to disguise the stench by installing a self-timed air refresher that squirt a blast of something called \"Refreshing Apple\" every 10 minutes. It didn't work, and we shut it off so that we could sleep without the disruption. After surveying these first two haunting points, we sat down to discuss our options. WOW! The beds were beyond acceptable. Through the comforter, I could feel the circular shape of each spring pushing against me. Inside the bed later that night, I tossed and turned trying to find a position that didn't cause pain from the springs pushing into my ribs, hips, shoulders, etc. Management needs to wise up to the invention of the mattress pad! We also had some unwelcome visitors in our beds that (only) night. We all woke up with a handful of bug bites on our bodies. As if sleep weren't elusive enough that night, our room was located on the first floor. We were a few feet away from the restaurant that fills the common area. Luckily for the guests, the restaurant rarely sees patrons, but that didn't stop the staff from making their own noise. At 2am when the restaurant shut down, we heard the racket of plates, flatware, and glasses being put away. The staff shouted instructions and conversation to each other from across the room, and turned up the tunes to keep themselves entertained. I finally nodded off around 4am with earplugs wedged into my ears trying to stifle out the sounds from their stereo. Unfortunately, the Blue Parrot has a hefty penalty for late cancellations. If we were to walk out, we would have still been require to pay 50% of our total bill. Fortunately, the Blue Parrot had another property called the Blue Parrot Suites. We were forced to pay double our original rate ($190 to $380) in order to find comfort, but we were so relieved that we took the room and ran the next morning. I did try to work with the manager to right the penalty that we were now shouldering. She did provide a small discount on our new room, but I really think that they could have done more.

We loved everything about the town so much, however, that we wanted to stay closer in our next trip. Below is everything we LOVED about our stay at Blue Parrot 5th Ave in Playa: 1)LOCATION! You walk out the front door and are literally among a sea of amazing bars, restaurants, shopping and 1 block off the gorgeous beach. The food everywhere is incredible, ranging from authentic mexican to fine italian and pizza joints. No matter what you're in the mood for, it's right outside your door... from thatched roof cantinas with swings at the bar, to swanky lounges to wine bars and beach clubs with DJs spinning lounge/house. The shopping is also unreal. I need not say more! 2) You get to use all the ammenities of the older sister hotel (Blue Parrot Beach Club) a block away right on the beach including the lounge chairs and towels, beachside service to the restaurants, free breakfast in the oceanside palapa, internet cafe, etc. This has to be the most beautiful ocean in all of Mexico. 3) The room! It's very modern with gorgeous marble floors, a red light that illuminates the shower area and plenty of storage including night stands, a closet and safe. 4)Playasia. The hotel retaurant is completely ambient with theatrical lighting, waterways and palapa huts. It's a French/Asian fusion style restaurant with excellent sushi. We had our engagement dinner in a private tree-house style table. It was so romatic! In Playa you won't find the typical Hilton or Sheraton. You'll either find the huge, all inclusive hotels mostly off the main drag in Playacar (a 50 peso, 10 minute cab ride) or the boutique hotels right in the middle of the action. f you're looking for the full service pools, bellmen at your becon call, and everything all on site, you probably want to look into an all inclusive in Playacar. If you want to experience the amazing ambiance, exciting beaches, food, drinks, shopping and fun Playa del Carmen has to offer, I'd definitely stay in town and at Blue Parrot 5th ave!", "Date": "January 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "kansas city", "Title": "\u201cwonderful stay!\u201d", "Author": "nikidosland", "ReviewID": "UR8232662", "Content": "I stayed at a neighboring hotel (posada mariposa) for 2 days prior to my stay at the blue parrot. It was about 15.00 less but horrible! I walked by the blue parrot and saw a promotional sign and a vacancy. I asked to see a room and was blown away! For 15.00 more dollars I went up about 3 stars! The room was super clean with modern furniture and decorations. Bottles of water were provided as well as tea light candles for relaxation. The bed was equally as comfortable as a bed at a resort. The location was fabulous. A block from the beach and right on 5th ave. Although it was right on 5th ave I heard no noise at night. A security gaurd is present at night and I felt incredibly safe which was important since I am female and was traveling alone. The only negatives is that the room didn't have a fridge and that the reception didn't open until 9 which caused me a bit of a problem with checking out in time to make my bus to the airport.", "Date": "July 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago, il", "Title": "\u201cStayed longer.

We decided on the 17th to stay one more night at the Blue Parrot and moved from the Suites to the 5th Ave. location to save some $$$. We were upgraded to the Suite for the same price as the deal they were on the studios. The suite at the 5th ave. location is wonderful. It was clean, quiet, has excellent a/c, mini bar, nice sitting/living area, spacious, comfy bed, etc. There was nothing bad about this room! The staff was wonderful as they had been all along (I'd been working with the Blue Parrot on a regular basis since Oct. 2006). I love the Blue Parrot. My advice is not to listen to the bad reviews! I was getting worried about having our wedding here after reading the bad reviews, but now I know that those were just a few angry people. Most people complain, not praise. Our wedding went wonderful at the Blue Parrot. The staff bent over backwards for us and our guests. An amazing time was had by all. I kept hearing over and over that it was the best wedding our guests had been to, that was a beautiful wedding, that everyone had a great time, etc. We also stayed at the Suites for 5 nights and give the suites a 5 also. We had 3 guests who stayed at the 5th ave. and had no complaints.

However, we came to really appreciate the Blue Parrot for several reasons: Convenience of a massage while enjoying an ocean view and ocean breezes with the sound of the waves. (Wonderful masseuse. Her name is Martina. Do get a massage as soon as you can. You will want a second. My massage was one of the best that I have ever had.) Quick, easy one block walk just one door down and around the corner to their beach access, the Blue Parrot Beach Club. Clean rest room at their beach. The location is mid Fifth Avenue location and is ideal for strolling Fifth Avenue and taking in the many restraurants and shops and making quick stops back and forth to our room. Fun, friendly, hard working staff catering to our beverage and food orders. Complimentary umbrellas, lounge chairs and beach towels available. We chose to tip well each day. Complimentary continental breakfasts on the deck with an ocean view with option to order from the menu. Entrance, shared by their restaurant, was attractive. Each time I opend our door in the morning I saw nothing but live green trees and plants. Air-conditioner muffled the evening music from the clubs on Fifth Ave and beach area. Room towels were a good quality and most linens seemed new. Clean linens and towels each day! Good bathroom ventilation. A safe in the room. Friendly staff. We toured the Blue Parrot Suites which are lovely, but I think if we return to Playa, I would still still stay at the Blue Parrot Fifth Ave. A few things we thought needed improvement: The room had only one towel rack and hook so towels had to be hung together. No hooks for long garments. Daily complimentary water was not provided. Only two keys were availlable so for the two days when we had an extra guest, we had to share keys.

The courtyard is beautiful and we saw many tourists poking their heads in wishing that they stayed here. The rooms are refreshingly simple, nice high ceilings and a cool red-light in the shower. On the whole, we thought this hotel was a good place to stay. However, they had high holiday rates for our last few days (about $200+ per night) which is really outrageous. For those prices, I'd rather be at the much cooler Basico or Deseo across the street. The woman in the office in the morning was very helpful and very nice, but the man in the office in the afternoon seemed really bothered by simple questions. When I had a billing inquiry, he quipped about how a Belizean tourist ripped him off last week. Not really my problem and he never even answered my question. The woman in the morning straightened everything out beautifully. The bed springs could be felt through the mattress, which made for some rotten sleep. Relatively quite for 5th Avenue in Playa, which tends to be noisy. Continental Breakfast on the beach was included and very decent, but they couldn't provide us with any drinking water- unless we paid extra. When you're already paying the rates here, a little bit of water would go a long way to making the stay better.
