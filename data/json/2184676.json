On this occasion we stayed for 6 nights. The hotel is a large conference hotel, but manages to cater very well for both leisure and conference guests at the same time. The hotel is also exceptionally child friendly, but not overly so, so you won't be confronted by hoards of screaming children. The hotel is not far from Ku'damm but avoids the noise and hustle and bustle of that area. It's also not too far to Potsdamer Platz - a pleasant 25-30 minute stroll alongside the river. The hotel overlooks the river and Tiergarten area at the back and our room was exceptionally quiet and peaceful. We had some issues during our previous stay, and after contacting the hotel directly, was personally assured they'd be fixed this time, and they were. This hotel offers amazing customer service - something that is lacking from many hotels these days, especially those belonging to the larger chains. Well done Intercontinental. We stayed in a suite with access to the club lounge. The room itself was spacious with a separate bedroom and living room (which also had a wall bed which could be used as needed). Fresh fruit and water were refreshed daily. As were the sweets and snacks provided for our 3 year old daughter. Another nice touch was a colouring book and pencils for kids, and the offer of turning any of the drawings into postcards by the guest services team. We didn't try this but what a wonderful idea to keep the kids entertained! As other reviewers have mentioned, the selection of TV channels is very good, and the hotel were able to arrange for a DVD player in the room so our daughter could watch her favourite DVD. The club lounge is fantastic - a haven of peace. The selection of food and drinks throughout the day was excellent and service by the lounge staff was attentive. There is free internet access via the business desk/ computer at the side of the lounge. It is well worth staying in a room with access to the club lounge. We have used club lounges in a number of hotels across the world and found those in the Far/ Middle East to be the best, but Intercontinental Berlin is just as good. All in all, I can thoroughly recommend this hotel - it's well run, clean,comfortable, excellent value for money and has some of the best staff in any hotel we've stayed in.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam", "Title": "\u201cSwimming pool & spa closed for renovation\u201d", "Author": "belle1112", "ReviewID": "UR127715674", "Content": "Lovely hotel, good breakfast, attentive staff but beware the pool and spa are closed due to renovation.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stuttgart, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "bongoblog", "ReviewID": "UR127689409", "Content": "I have just spent 5 nights here over Easter and wish I was still there! I have stayed here a number of times and never really think of staying anywhere else. I asked to be in the Westwing as I like the decor and room layout better than the other. I had a suite with a view over the Zoo and Kaiser Willhelm memorial church. It comes with 3 tvs which have a great number of programmes inc 8 or more in English. There is now a free wifi connection, low speed for an hour or faster with payment,.fine for checking emails. Happily toiletries have returned to Elemis. I had room service breakfast most mornings and it was delivered on time and was very good,apart from the little dried out croissants! Also had a room service burger which was good and much better than previously. On the friday night I wanted something quick to eat and went in the Greek restaurant opposite, it was pretty bad and just a waste of money, so the time I had room service and was much happier. At all times the staff were friendly and helpful(as usual here) My one surprise was that the lit glass bookshelves had dust that I could write in, maybe housekeeping need some glasses(room917) Otherwise everything was kept spotless. I like the location next to the green of the Zoo and the Tiergarten but only a few mins from KaDeWe and if you want to go to Mitte there are taxis and busses at the door.

Being a Platinum Ambassador I was upgraded to a Delluxe Room on the 7th floor which had a good view of Berlin.

Only slight issue was that most of the places we wanted to visit were not a walking distance away do we used taxis a lot - although the public transport from the hotel is really good. Paid a supplement for Club Lounge access which was money well spent. As well as a great breakfast, they also have a buffets lunch and dinner with warm canap\u00e9s in the evening. I was particularly impressed with the choice of spirits and champagne in the Club Lounge open bar which is open from 6-10pm. They also have an iPad which can be used for guests in the club lounge which I thought is a really nice touch. After seeing the sights and sounds of Berlin I returned to my room to find my complimentary bottle of water and fruit bowl with a wide selection of fruited, along with a welcome letter and box of choiclates. When reading the letter I was pleasantly surprised to find that the in room mini bar was complimentary (I think this comes part of the Lounge Access - which made it all the more worth the supplement).

We booked a Deluxe Room after reviewing the various rooms on the English web site of the hotel. I was misled into thinking a Deluxe Room was a Club Room - don't be fooled! On discovering that breakfast wasn't included, I asked the receptionist what the difference was between a standard and a deluxe room. All she could tell me was that there was a bit more space, and a coffee maker. I believe the standard room has a coffee make actually, so apparently all you get is a sofa. My advice would be to stick with the standard room. The hotel itself is pleasantly opulent with a delightful and extensive bar area. The spa was closed for our stay, and we were told we could have complimentary use of the one at the nearby Hotel Pullman. But at minus 8, we weren't inclined to trip across the road in not very much! We didn't feel like spending 30 Euros each on breakfast, so we took the bus to Ku'damm and ate there. Many cafes sell a good German breakfast (egg, rolls, hams, salamis, cheese, jam, coffee etc) for 8.50 Euros. Likewise the prices at the bar were a bit eye-watering: 10.50 for an Irish Coffee and 8.50 for a pot of camomile tea. However, no-one books a 5 star hotel and expects cheap prices, and the real problem with this hotel as that a bus or taxi is needed for every trip - especially in the very cold winter weather. Ku'damm is 15 mins away, but it is a trudge, not a delightful walk. Potsdamer Platz is 10 mins on the bus in the other direction. Having said that, the bus does go every 10 minutes, so it's not exactly a hardship, but it is worth saying that this hotel is too expensive for someone not on business to be a captive in, and therefore make sure you buy a tourist ticket for the BVG (we bought the 72 hour Welcome Card). The service was good and when we needed the feather bedding and pillows changed for hypoallergenic ones, it happened quickly and without fuss. We were told in good time that our water would be turned off for an hour in the early morning. The room itself was not overly large, despite its alleged 'deluxe' nature. There was a nespresso machine, which was a nice touch, but only three capsules to put in it. The bed was queen size, when I think king would have been more appropriate. The flat screen TV was against the wall, and couldn't be fully pointed at the bed. And it was *warm*. The temperature control was permanently on 24 degrees. It was all a bit ... underwhelming.

The room we were assigned was standard sized (had 2 seats but not a separate area) and overlooked the main road (even though we had asked for a quiet room on our reservation).

Housekeeping \u2013 I can only describe this as sloppy. Bedlinen was not changed frequently (our daughter\u2019s bedding wasn\u2019t changed in 7 days). Housekeeping had a tendency to leave the dirty glasses without cleaning them and didn\u2019t always replenish the complimentary tea/ coffee. Turndown service was minimal (remove blanket from bed and that was it!) Bathroom layout \u2013 the room we were in had a shower over the bath with a very small screen so it was difficult to shower without soaking the bathroom floor.

It is a huge hotel very well situated. A 5 minutes walk from \"Ku'damm\", Tiergarten and Ged\u00e4chtniskirche. 7 minutes to Bahnhof Zoo, where you can catch the bus X9 to Tegel airport or many other trains to reach every spot in Berlin. A taxi from or to Tegel airport never cost me more than 20\u20ac and when I arrived in Sch\u00f6nefeld I took the S-Bahn train to Bahnhof Zoo. Just in front of the hotel there's the bus 200 which will take you within 10 minutes to other places of downtown Berlin like Unter den Linden, Potzdamer Platz and Friedrichstrasse. Checkin and checkout are always very professional, without any hassle and besides the capacity of the hotel there's rarely queuing...Whenever you pay for Ambassador membership for InterContinental Hotels they always (at least in my case) upgrade you to the next higher category. And to get a deluxe room with them is just great. It's very spacious, recently renovated and very modern. King Size Bed, Seating area, Flat screen TV, great lighting options, espresso coffee/tea maker, I-pod docking station, huge bath room with separated shower cabin and bath tub. Also discover their spa area, which is just beautiful with pool and sauna. Internet is 20\u20ac for 24 h in the room and works very well (cable)...they also have deals if you stay a week. One hour of free wireless connection is offered to each guest in the lobby which is a good thing when you are not on a business trip and just want to check your mail. Furthermore I just can recommend Marlene Bar for drinks. At anytime of the day it is nice to sit in this huge bar and just watch the people. On weekends they have a great brunch in their L.A. Caf\u00e9 for 30\u20ac with loads of food and sparkling wine (yep, no champagne if I remember right). Another plus is their room service which I used during every stay. They just manage to deliver delicious food, which is not so often the case with room service. Once I had dinner at Hugo's, which is their luxury restaurant on the 14th floor, and it's a class of its own, which I can highly recommend if you have something to celebrate or just love gorgeous food.

The hotel is situated in a wonderful area of what was West Berlin and you can walk to many sites or grab a U-Bahn (Berlin..like New York..is not a city that you can see just by walking...too disperesed). This hotel has spruced up since my last visit and result is upgraded amenities in the rooms and a bit more of the 21stC in the lobby..without losing the quirky and wonderful architectural uniqueness of its past. The staff is top notch from the moment you are welcomes to the hotel until the moment you check out. Breakfast, room service, special needs...effortless and stress-free as a Hotel of this caliber should be. We were upgraded to a suite the second night but honestly, this is the first Intercontinetal I've stayed in for a while where the standards were a very nice size. This is one of the reasons I like this hotel. Everyone is treated with importance and given what should be 'the Intercontinetal experience'. Bathrooms were large and modern with amenities from L'Occitane. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've experienced in Europe since staying at the 'Le Grand' in Paris a few months ago (and I've back to France several times between that trip and this one to Berlin). The rooms are modern but with an emphasis on bridging the gap between certain 'classic high-end' furinishings like the tons of closets and the lovely walnut dresser that I wanted to take home. I received free wi-fi in my room and a bottle of water each day being in 'Priority Club' The room (standard and the Suite) were just a 5* oasis of luxe and calm after a busy day. Of course the wonderful lobby bar that serves some wonderful unknown French champagnes by the glass and the restaurant for breakfast are also in the luxe category. Wonderful breakfast that was included in our price and it an abudance of choices ..truly..I skipped lunch after I ate a bit too much the first morning. (German sausages are the best in the world and you'll have your choice here at breakfast). We never had time to dine at the hotel as we were visiting friends and also part of a convention. Lastly...Hotel prices in Berlin in the 5*/4*+luxe category are pretty stiff!

I probably get an older looking room even though I am a Platinum Mamber of IHG because I always request smoking. Smokers are having a harder and harder time finding a place, not that I blame the hotels. I myself do not like a smoking room that is not aired out before I get there. That said the mattresses here are the best and the bathrooms are really the best I have ever encountered especially if you have a friend with you. The tub is quite roomy and separate from the shower. Toilet even is seperated by a door so its all quite nice. THe location of this place is a favorite for me. You can walk to Kurfurstendam, The Zoo, a major train station (all in about 15 minutes). Breakfasts here are better than the average 4-5 star hotel and compare favorably with any breakfast in Berlin. If smokers could get a room with a balcony or a remodelled room I would always stay here when visiting Berlin. Note when I say the smoking rooms are dated they are by no means ugly or worn out. THe style of the furniture is just a bit older and the TVs are not modern flat screens. They are still nicely appointed rooms with good blackout drapes and the same great bathrooms. The service at the desk is also always efficient and friendly and the rooms are clean. The piano bar is busy if there is a convention but then those are people looking to talk to other conventioneers, its not a popular hangout for locals or to strike up a conversation with anybody outside your party. So unless there is a convention(which is frequent by the way) the place is rather quiet. One of my only gripes is that Internet access from the room is too expensive. I mean its ridiculous that I get free internet from dozens of coffee shops where I spend 5$ but I can easily spend 1500$ for 10-12 days at a Hotel and then be charged an extra 20$/day for the internet in the room.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel Nice Location\u201d", "Author": "Nusiax", "ReviewID": "UR117860527", "Content": "Just came from a long weekend in Berlin, We stayed at the IC Berlin.

Although a bit apprehensive at first, we had a wonderful surprise awaiting us when we arrived. The apprehension is due to the fact that we travel extensively across the globe and stay with IHG hotels. Our latest experiences with InterContinentals, with the exception of Prague and Dubai, has left us with a sense of frustration. Service levels are not consistent and the fact that we are Royal Ambassadors with their frequent traveller programme has left much to be desired. This hotel, however, made up for it all. Upon check-in we were immediately recognised for our membership level and received the two-room upgrade, gift in room, welcome letter and the other amenities that we had missed in so many other hotels. The staff were wonderful; professional, very helpful, efficient and friendly. The 2-room suite on the 7th floor in the renovated building, with views over the Tiergarten and the Ged\u00e4chtniskirche (not visible now because of extensive renovations), was lovely. Fresh, modern, very clean and comfortable. The bathroom was very nice with the tub, large sink area and the walk-in shower with the rainshower head and side shower (both with plenty of hot water and pressure). Everything worked well in the room, with our only quirk being that the thermostat in the room was very limited. Settings were either \"Off\" or \"Cool\", which meant it would not get very cold in the room during the warm weather we had during our stay. We had access to their Club Lounge, which was very nice. This is where we had our breakfast every morning and in the evening we enjoyed a light dinner from the buffet that was on offer. A large offer was to be had in the way of soup, breads, salads, snacks and other canap\u00e9s. For those that wished something more, you were able to order meals from their in room dining, which was very nice as well. There was a full bar, too, which had everything imaginable and was constantly being refilled and cleaned. The entire lounge was also a great place to relax, watch TV, listen to music on the private headphones, use the iPad on offer (WiFi was free) or use the iMac & printer also on offer. Here the staff was also very friendly and helpful. The actual hotel location is fantastic. It is 5 minutes by foot from the Kuf\u00fcrstendamm and bus 200 stops in front of the hotel. This bus route goes to the main sights in East Berlin and to West Berlin. For those wanting to go north or south of the city, just a block or two away is where you catch bus 100. Tip: buy a day ticket for \u20ac 6.30 and use these buses and the metros to see the city; avoid the tourist buses as they are crowded and not necessarily cheap, as we discovered. For getting to/from the airport, bus X09 stops at the Tiergarten station, just 10 mins away, or take a taxi for the 10 km journey (approx. \u20ac 15). One aspect about the location that we really appreciated is that the Budapester Stra\u00dfe is a very calm street yet the frenzy of Berlin is a few minutes away. Shoppes such as KaDeWe are also in the general vicinity, together with some good restaurants and pubs in the Sch\u00f6neberg district.

We used both, but not the upmarket restaurant on the top floor. The hotel has two towers of rooms. We were lucky on a quiet weekend in August to be upgraded to a suite on the 10th floor : 1013. It was one of the best rooms I have experienced anywhere. The two beds were comfortable to sleep on. There was iron and ironing board which we used, though we struggled to understand the capsule coffee maker (a brand I had not seen elsewhere). Bottled water came every day as did large bar of chocolate on two. The bathroom had heated floor. We liked the walk-in powerful shower though why the toilet had a glass door puzzled us. The breakfast buffet was extensive, as befits a luxury hotel. We liked particularly the banana juice, fruits, cheeses and breads but we could have expanded our waistlines with many sugary or cooked dishes. Expresso coffee was available on request. There is a 15m pool on the ground floor of the east tower. To get to it from the west tower (where we were) required a lengthy journey along a second floor balcony obscured from ground floor reception. Pool was a delight to swim in. It was open from 0600 but little used by anyone else that we saw during our stay. We had dinner in the cafe area on the Saturday night. It had a bitsy barbecue. Not good value though the food was ok. Two areas for improvement: 1. We were supposed to be offered a newspaper. We were not. When I queried on Sunday, I was told they had no English papers on Sundays! On Monday, on request. i could get only Int Herald Tribune. Reception seemed unaware of download print on demand newspaper service offered by other IHG hotels. 2. The business centre charges \u20ac1.50 per 5 mins - \u20ac18 an hour to use the internet!!! A little humble cafe next door had a public laptop and asked \u20ac1 for 30 mins so I did most work there. We paid \u20ac138 per night inc breakfast; superb value for what we got. Near the Kurfurstendamm we saw a Crowne Plaza (another IHG hotel). We went into the lobby to use the toilet. The area looked rather rundown and in need of a makeover. By contrast the Pullman (an Accor Group hotel) opposite the Intercontinental felt clean and welcoming. The area is NOT good for alternative eating places.

I am stil l looking for significant suggestions for enhancements and am having a hard time ! The premises looked fully renovated - rooms and conference center. Since it was a Dorint hotel until very recently I guess it was renovated by InterContinental. The hall is impressively large with cosy areas to rest. The bar is very welcoming. There are various areas to sit and enjoy including winter gardens (smoking area - one could regret but smokers really appreciate to be welcome somewhere confortable for once). The bedroom looked brand new. There are 2 buildings. With it seems different room decorations. My room was not huge but on the 10th floor with a great view to Berlin (Tiergarten, Brandbruger Gate, etc.) . The decoration was minimal and modern. I have seen other rooms of more classic and warmer tone decoration. Bedding : very good. Just I have a problem with the narrow duvets of northern countries. Closets : I was very surprised to find absolutely no drawers in my room, only hanging space. First time ever I have to leave my folded cloths and miscellaneaous in my luggage. There ... I have my \"complaint\" ;-) (unless it was hidden and I did not find it ?! Bathroom: nothing was missing (bathrobe, slippers, amenities). And I appreciated the kettle (coffee and tea). Breakfast : great variety and good quality ( includes freshly cooked omelettes). I would recommend trying the hot chocolate, presented in a very 'design' manner - and I was told very good. Cuisine: I am not sure if the hotel catered for our conference buffets, I guess it did and I found them of very good quality (it does not happen so often). I was a bit disappointed though by the room service (Asparagus soup and asparagus/shrimp chinese style) which did not meet my expextations. The location is great for touring, near Tiergarten, the Zoo, etc. A hop on-hop off CityTour bus can be caught 5 minutes away. In every function (room service, reception, bar, breakfast, room service, even luggage room) I found the staff very professional , efficient and helpful. Which is probably not easy when welcoming 400+ conferencers. That would be where my first compliment goes. In conclusion: I am only sorry I could not enjoy the hotel more and try the spa. The swimming pool looks great on pictures.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Thessaloniki, Greece", "Title": "\u201c5 star\u201d", "Author": "sakis1969", "ReviewID": "UR114781612", "Content": "a 5 star hotel as you want to be..... excellend room,very professional stuff,perfect breakfast ,quiet and has good gym. it's cloose to market but not close to center of berlin.... it's near by the zoo but you have to take the bus to go to brademburg gate ,check point charlie and domme or unter den linden rd. your stay there will be elegand and luxurious", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Royal Tunbridge Wells, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cHigh standard of food.

The sleeping rooms were one of the nicest I've ever stayed in. Ample closet and storage space, large bathroom with a shower and tub, good-sized sleeping room, and super-comfy bed. The furnishings were modern, but not overly trendy and the room was divided in a way that made it quite spacious. The conference rooms were pretty standard, but the service was impeccable. And the food - numerous colleagues commented on how good the food was for breakfast and lunch. Not just your good ol' rubber chicken, but lots of fresh, healthy choices - even ample vegetarian options! The location was decent enough as well. When I was able to get a few hours to duck out of the hotel for a walk and some shopping, the main shopping street (Tauentzienstrasse) was only a ten minute walk away, which came in handy when I realized I forgot my shoes for a dinner event!
