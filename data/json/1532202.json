We were a family of 4, two adults and two teenagers. The stay was very good. We took the Novotel family package that allows getting 2 rooms at a reduced price. The hotel location is excellent. Not in the crowded middle of town, but yet very close to a metro station (line 1) with very easy access to all city attractions. The rooms looked new and clean. We stayed at the 7th floor, and besides the fact that in the mornings the elevators tend to be very crowded and the wait to go down tends to get long, we were happy with our rooms. The breakfast buffet was excellent! It includes real coffee machines, an omelet cook that will cook your omelet of choice, and the jewel of the crown fresh breads and pastries just out of the over, The baguettes and croissants are as good as the ones in France and other prime Europe locations. To top it off, kids under 16 eat free so that the cost is very reasonable also. The pool at the roof the hotel seems very nice. It was too cold to experience but I am sure that in summer the pool is a significant attraction. Opposite of the hotel is a big shopping center with a huge supermarket. We used it a lot for some of our lunch and dinners. Overall a very good experience.

There is a small gym and pool on the roof which is pretty good but sadly despite our best intentions we didn't have time to use. Too much sightseeing and sleeping to do!

However, there might be one occasion during my trip that I would like the hotel breakfast. Not at \u20ac18 though, particularly for a buffet (i.e. making my breakfast myself). No actual glasses or cups provided, just paper cups for tea and plastic cups wrapped in plastic wrapping for water, which is a waste of plastic. So, 7 out of 10 which I am rounding to 4 out of 5!

I love the location - it's close enough to the main sights (4 metro stops on the L1 line to Catalunya - no transfers) and from there you can walk down La Ramblas or walk north along Passeig de Gracia to visit Casa Battlo and/or Casa Mila. I also walked to Sagrada Familia from the hotel one morning - it took approx. 20 mins. There is a shopping mall right across the street but there's not a lot of shops there...I went there to pick up necessities and some snacks/drinks at the large supermarket and there was also a Japanese buffet restuarant that was a bargain - 8.95 Euros for lunch during the weekdays and approx. 13 Euros for dinner. As for the hotel, I found it very clean and modern. My room was on the 18th floor. It must be soundproof as I barely heard a pin drop outside the door. The bathroom was very spacious. Only complaint was the lack of a shower door so it everytime you took a shower, the floor was wet but that was easily fixed by asking for an extra bath towel to mop up the excess water. Lots of counter room to put all your various toiletries. The pull-out couch was very uncomfortable though...I woke up every hour my first night as my back and neck was aching so much but I think I got used to it because I didn't have any aches and pains after that. The usual amenities were provided such as a safe, flat screen tv, kettle with tea and coffee, etc. One thing I should mention is that lack of wi-fi connection...it is free but the connection was bad and the signal kept on dropping..sometimes you can get in, sometimes not...it was very frustrating...it could be due to the fact that I was on the 18th floor which is the second highest floor.

It is about 200m from the Glories Metro Stop and a few steps from one of the most beautiful buildings \u2018Torre Agbar\u2019. The hotel is also walking distance from another of Barcelona\u2019s most famous landmarks \u2018La Sagrada Familia\u2019. The rooms in the hotel are excellent. Every requirement is catered to. The views from the rooms in higher floors are excellent. You can see much of the city from the top. There is an outdoor pool on the terrace; but only usable during summer months. There is also a fitness center on the roof. From the hotel you can get about anywhere to the city to see the important landmarks. There is also a direct tram to the beach right in front of the hotel. The area around the hotel is much safer than most of the other parts of the city and it is OK to come back late at night too. The hotel has a nice bar and also a restaurant. The restaurant food is quite tasty and generous in portions. The only thing I did not like was that you had to wait to be seated even though there were hardly a couple of people in the restaurant. Even then, since I was a solo traveler, I was shown to a small two-person table which was relatively small to keep all my stuff and also have the food. I would have preferred sitting at a larger table, given the fact that there were very few people in the restaurant. One other thing was that the waiters at the restaurant were in a constant hurry and as soon I finished one course they were clearing the plates and then bringing the next course. As soon as I finished my food too, they brought me the bill and I guess expected me to clear out. The reception staffs were much more efficient and helped in choosing the best places to visit via convenient means of transport. There is free wifi at the hotel but it is not very good. It breaks every time you move from a spot and is not even consistent throughout your room. You have to choose a place to sit and use it and can\u2019t use it in motion. Although there is excellent coverage throughout the lobby. It even breaks inside the restaurant. And you need to reenter your username and password again each time which is a pain. One advice also mentioned in your room is Barcelona is not a very safe city. It is prudent to use the safe in the room or at the front desk to store your important documents like Passport and also money, etc while out sightseeing. People try to rob you by distracting you by staining your jacket or shirt and while you are cleaning it off, your valuables vanish.

The metro station is just down the street a very short walk. Our room was on the sixth floor with a view of the Tower Agbar (just down the street) and the Sagrada Familia (which we were able to walk to about 3/4 mile). The room was clean but the carpet had been burned in one spot (probably an iron) and needed to be replaced. It did not impact the room but it was unsightly. The room had a sofa, queen sized bed, work desk, digital safe, minibar with items for purchase (it had enough room to hold our wine as well). There is also a water kettle and instant coffee and tea in the room. Housekeeping was excellent and kept the room clean. Note there is no ice machine (typical for Europe but the bar will provide ice if you want to traipse down to the lobby). The hotel will store bags for those like us that arrive early. There is no charge for this service. The lobby was very attractive and quite busy at most times. Lots of airline crews stay here even though it is about a 30-35 minute ride at least to the airport. Our taxi from airport to hotel cost around E35 as I recall. We did not use the hotel dining room but it looked quite nice. The rooftop terrace offers great views and has a pool which we did not use as it was too cool for swimming. There are several places to sit here as well. The exercise center is also on this level and had a nice selection of equipment. Right across the street is a large shopping center that has a Starbucks and several places to eat. The restaurant right on the entrance to the center is quite good and reasonably priced. It is called Canas y Tapas. There are also several places to get pastries in the mornings to take back to the hotel. Do not expect to walk over to Starbucks for a latte early in the morning - they do not open until 10am!

The staff was very friendly and helpful throughout. There are only two downsides worth mentioning and neither bothered us very much. First, the hotel is a bit out of the center and the immediate area does not have \"obvious\" tourist attractions. Having said that, there are ameliorating circumstances: 1) a mall right across the street where you can conveniently get some groceries, snacks, or a piece of clothing you forgot to pack, 2) a metro station two blocks away from which you can get to the heart of Barcelona in about 5 stops, 3) a half dozen new office/university buildings in the immediate vicinity which architecture mavens would definitely find interesting.

The bar is the highlight area of the hotel: colourfull and spacious seats that really suit young people best. The lady in the bar that worked the evening shift during our stay, should be commended as \"employee of the month\".

Although the location of the hotel was excellent for travel to Montmelo for the Formula 1 track (Clot train station is a 5 minute walk from the hotel), it was too far from any of the sights of Barcelona. Therefore we needed to take a taxi whenever we wanted to go to the central city sights or the beach. Another drawback was that the taxis only took 4 passengers and there were 5 of us so we either had to take 2 taxis or wait/book a 7 seater. On the upside, the Metro in Barcelona is excellent, cheap, user friendly and reliable. Buy a T10 card for about 7 Euros for 10 trips anywhere on the Metro and can be used across the whole family! Bargain! The hotel rooms were ok - not what I would classify a 4 star as they are basic (no shower cap, body lotion, iron or ironing board, no choice of pillow type). Also one side of the hotel faces an office block so no view at all. Reception area very nice and modern, with a childrens play area and xbox. The breakfast was really nice, loads of choice, fried eggs, pastries, nespresso coffee machine, and even some spanish breakfast items. Fitness centre was lovely, on top of the building with fab views, great sun trap, a gym, lounge area and pool. Receptionists service could have been better. They didn't have a clue about the F1 race that weekend and didn't offer assistance to find out for us. We had to get on the web to find out where the station was in order to travel there and luckily it was only a 5-10 min walk away. Then on the Saturday evening we noticed some very helpful leaflets on the reception desk detailing the different types of options for travel to the racetrack! Bit late we thought. Our flight home was at 10pm therefore we asked for a late checkout but they were not even interested in finding out for us. The concierge asked a colleague and his response was \"No No!\" in a very abrupt way, even though we noticed in our room information that family rooms could check out at 5pm. All in all, nice hotel facilities if you like basic rooms, good breakfast but dont mind being away from all the sights and sounds and buzz that is Barcelona.

Safe to say, we were not disappointed in the least. The hotel was really easy to find from the metro (which is really close by - like a 2 minute walk), and you can see it by looking for the building that resembles London's Gerkin (it;s right next to it). Across from the hotel is actually a shopping complex, which ranges from restaraunts, clothes, computer shops and supermarket (Carre Four). There is plenty here, and worth looking around, though it tends to house the bigger shops - H&M, Zara, Sub-Way etc. Check-in was very easy, and there is a very modern and swanky bar area that you can sit in as well. The receptionists also recommended us going to the top floor - you can get some amazing photos from the terrace, where you can actually see the tops of the Sagrada Familia. It's also worth coming here in the evening to get some unique photos of Barcelona. The rooms are absolutely lovely with a big flat screen tv, and plenty of English channels. The bathroom was also big and clean, though we did find it odd that there was no lock! The only tiny problem we had was that we asked to have our tea selection refilled after this was forgotten by the maid (who cleans daily), and this was actually forgotten by the receptionists. Upon asking again, the different receptionist apologised profusely and fixed this straight away. Like I said, it was a minor problem. The hotel, whilst not in the direct city centre, is very close to the metro, and it takes about 10 mins (or less depending on where you go) to get to the city centre and the main sites. If you've used the Underground in London, you'll be fine with the Metro. At check out, the manager also offered to look after our bags if we wanted to do some last minute sight-seeing, though we didn't take this up.

Luckily I had enough spare credit and after 2 days of argueing I reluctantly repaid (claimed it back once home and Accor managed to trace original payment) My concern was what would have happened if I hadnt had the spare credit was with 8 adults and 4 children we would have been stuck in Barca with no where to stay so please please confirm with hotel prior to travelling that you have actually paid.

Or so we thought. We had stayed previously at Novotel in the City of London and had a wonderfully quiet and relaxing overnight stay. The rooms standards were so much higher than the old room stock and the mattress, pillow and bedding offerings were fantsastic. Barcelona City was the opposite! Having booked we contacted the hotel by emailto understand a little bit more about how to get to the location. No real help was provided except they copied the confusing information form the internet that we had already seen. We email the hotel 3 days before our outbound flight to ask about early check in and late check out. They only responded after a reminder email on the evening before the flight and expecting us to pay 50% of the rate for the early arrival and 50% of the late stay. A real rip off. We flew at 0625! At check in we were 'told' that we need to sign a security form that was not in English and the receptionsit who wore a badge showing that she spoke English - though couldnt - could not explain what this was for. Apparently it is a police requirement though heaven knows why they cant have a translated version of it to assist guests who dont usually sign without understanding a legal document. This hotel boasts free high speed wifi internet in the room though this wasnt working and the external 'support' department were unavailable to resolve the issues. SO Room 1 had no internet and no bath. Room 2 had no internet and a broken sink Room 3 - this is when we started to take pictures - was apparently a suite, had no internet, smelt of damp and had a big leak coming through the bathroom ceiling Room 4 had no internet and the aircon was broken. This room also had 'fudge' stains to the toilet floor, a broken bath mixer tap, electrical lighting cabling hanging from the bathroom mirror and 'residue' stains to the toilet walls. Look at our pictures. Ironically at check out they did not suggest a discount of any kind until I impressed on the front office manager that we would not be paying the full bill. I thought this was a real cheek. There were 2 things to praise though. Again the bedding and mattress. The best I have found anywhere and the breakfast offering. Though noone paid any attenion to any of the guests needs at breakfest the offering was great. Surprisingly i paid the only compliment at check out to the breakfast offering and it was immediately refunded! It strike us that this hotel is very badly run, most staff (a couple were really lovely) have an appauling attitude, the general manager was always 'unavailable' and there is a noticable absence of any satisfactory maintenance program. Couple this with the rather arrogant suggestion that you would pay an extra 50% of a daily rate to stay and extra 2 hours it surely means a place to avoid....................... Shame really because if this hotel have the managers it needed, the right attitude and the honesty to respect its guests it could be a great place to stay. Our advice, unless you want an argument, attitude, lack of attention and a restless stay, your money it better spent elsewhere. Enjoy Barcelona!

We just returned from our short stay at Novotel Barcelona City and I would like to bring to your attention our dissatisfactory experience. Upon our late night arrival, we were greeted by a kind gentleman at front desk. He acknowledged our anniversary and that our room had a nice view of the city. When we arrived to our room on the 17th floor our door would not open, we had to go back down and request assistance to which someone from the engineering dept. assisted with the jammed door. In preparation for bed after a long day of travel, we noticed the bathroom sink drain was clogged and left a dirty residue. We did not report this immediately; we just wanted to go to bed. In the morning beginning at 9am and every thirty minutes thereafter, our slumber was interrupted by housekeeping barging into our room twice without knocking . We put the Do Not Disturb sign on the door and the third and fourth time they did knock before invading. By then we decided to get up and leave to allow your housekeeping to clean as our patience (and housekeeping's) were running thin. In the rush, we did not report our clogged sink which remained clogged for the rest of the day. After a long day of touring the city, we returned from our ventures and requested a late check out. The late check out was kindly granted until 2:00pm. We enjoyed our early morning site-seeing and returned to our hotel room at 1:30pm for a quick shower and to retrieve our things. A housekeeper greeted us in our room with \u201cYou were supposed to check out today.\u201d I explained to her we had a late check out at 2:00pm. She left all her things in our room and left to investigate this herself. Waiting for her to return, we ended up removing her cleaning trolley from our room to shut the door. Promptly at 2:04pm as we were about to leave feeling angry and agitated from the constant interruptions during our anniversary weekend, we were once again summoned to the door by your housekeeping staff requesting our departure. The sink remained clogged. A minor problem such as a clogged sink, a jammed door, or an accidental invasion by housekeeping is unfortunately quite common when traveling, however we resided in your hotel for less than 48 hours and we experienced all of this problems, the last being of highest severity. The likelihood that we will recommend a Novotel property after our weekend is extremely unlikely. I hope to hear a response from management in regards to our weekend stay. Residing in North America, I've heard of this hotel chain before and from online reviews I expected more from Novotel; not only do we read these reviews, we also contribute our own.

The views from the pool are great too, you can see pretty much all of the city and the sea. The area around the hotel is very modern and alot of development is going on so there is building work going on, although this didn't impact on us at all. The downsides are the service is a little disapointing, we had to keep asking for things like an extra pillow (several calls and trips to reception) and on our last day we had to que for 20 minutes to get breakfast (prior to this they had two area's for breakfast on the ground floor and lower ground) but for some reason they closed the lower one on our last day.

I love this city as it is so full of life and so much to see. My most recent stay was June 2010 with my extended family of 10 including children ages 10-14. We stayed here 4 days prior to going on a cruise. Barcelona is a city that seems to fill all of its rooms on the weekends so if you are planning a trip to Barcelona on the weekend, I'd reserve your hotel well in advance. The Novotel Barcelona City is a fairly new hotel in a good location. There is an older mall across the street with average restaurants, Starbucks and a grocery store (lower level with dept store upper level). The entire area is being renovated. The metro is 2 blocks-there is major road construction @ Glories on the way to metro. There is a bus stop across from hotel. I ate an evening meal at the hotel restaurant which was quite good and reasonably priced. Breakfast was expensive so I elected to eat at the mall. Rooms were clean & beds comfortable. There is an enclosed pool on top floor with a nice city view which the children enjoyed. The service at this hotel is below average for a business hotel. Novotel usually has fairly good business hotels but this one lacked the expected service. Check in and out was slow and the staff seemed very confused. Even though the staff spoke English, I felt that they really didn't understand what I was saying. There were many different nationalities and I got the impression that they didn't understand each other either. Maybe because this hotel just opened, but there seemed to be a noticible problem with the service and with employees knowing their jobs. The rates were good and this was one of the few hotels that had family rooms that could accommodate our large party near the city center. The other hotel we stayed in was the Hilton Diagonal Mar which was also a very nice hotel but further away from the city center near the beach.

While breakfast was included in our rate it was quite frankly, a joke. The staff on arrival were very dis-organised and on one morning had to line up for 20 minutes just to be seated! We thought this was because the hotel was very busy and there were not enough tables, but once we did get into the dining area a number of tables were empty or just not cleared which reflected poorly managed and trained staff in clearing the tables and the staff in seating the guests. Once we did get seated there was no offer of tea or coffee and on most occasions had to request it myself. The food also was very average. On check in we were offered no information either about the hotel facilities or Barcelona itself, the reception staff equally seemed very badly managed and trained, this included most nights returning to the hotel and not even being greeted by reception staff (some of which preferred to stand next to the main door smoking) Don't they realise how bad this looks for your hotel? At the time we stayed and as it is a Novotel feature they were offering great rates for families and children so this resulted in lots of children!

Also, the breakfast is avoidable.", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Halifax, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay, love this hotel\u201d", "Author": "dartmouthgirl", "ReviewID": "UR67532242", "Content": "We spent two great nights at the Novotel Barcelona City in June, before embarking on a cruise. The hotel just opened in March/10 so there weren't many reviewes when we booked but we got a great rate. What a wonderfully pleasant surprise. The hotel is positioned as a business hotel, but is quite family-friendly. We had a triple room: a queen-sized bed plus fold-out couch for our daughter who is six. Breakfast at the bar was 3 euros for a coffee and pastry. Free internet in the lobby + free wireless in the room (slow, but free). Best feature: an incredible rooftop pool and bar with stunning views over Barcelona. Incredible. The pool wasn't listed on the hotel website when we booked, so perhaps it's new. The room had English TV channels, a minbar and great tub. Location is great: on the Avenida Diagonal within 3 minutes walk of the Glories subway station. It's also across the street from a tram stop AND a shopping mall. There's a Carrefour grocery store in the mall: great place to grab a baguette and bottle of wine.", "Date": "June 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel, very family friendly\u201d", "Author": "Pat-DL", "ReviewID": "UR66791380", "Content": "Spent 3 nights in hotel, 2 adults and 2 kids (11 & 9) in a family room. Found it difficult to get hotel in Barcelona that would easily cater for 2+2 in one room and was very happy with the Novotel city. Second bed was a sofa fold-out that was fine for the kids. Room was very comfortable and quiet - the power shower was brilliant! . Breakfast was excellent - lots of choice of pastries, fruit, and a cook to do eggs whatever ever way you wanted. We ate dinner in the restaurant one night and found it to be Top Rate, and much better vakue than the places we ate at La Ramblas. Close to the restaurant is a little playroom with a few toys for young kids and a couple of X-boxes for the older ones - small touch but kept ours happy while we finished our meal. Is a new hotel, which has pros and cons - very clean, top floor looks great though pool wasn't open till end May. Some of the staff a bit clueless, but all were good natured and helpful. Main hiccup was when we got stuck in the lift for 10 mins, but help was at hand quickly and of course the cultural hotspots of Barcelina were forgotten when our kids phoned home - \"we got stuck in a lift!\" seems to be the highlight of the trip for them. Location is beside the Torre Agbar (Gherkin tower) which meant it is easily located from pretty much anywh isere in the city. We got a taxi direct from Barca airport which cost \u20ac35 (\u20ac10 of which was for 3 bags). It is a 5 min walk from Glories metro station, where we never had to wait more than 3 minutes to catch a train. Across the road from a large shopping centre with plenty of shops and restaurants. Quieter location than La Ramblas, no sense of atmosphere around the streets (and less chance of pockets picked). Overall, delighted with the hotel - would definitely stay there again next time, whether on our own or with the kids.", "Date": "June 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fuengirola, Spain", "Title": "\u201cGood Stay...\u201d", "Author": "Narathip", "ReviewID": "UR66475719", "Content": "It's one of the new nice clean and smart 4 stars hotels in Barcelona.

They also have a nice restaurant serving breakfast, lunch and dinner for the reasonable price and just opposite the hotel is a big shopping centre and supermarket which is really convenient.
