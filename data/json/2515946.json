This hotel was perfectly located for us, and very reasonably priced with the free parking (we had a rental car.) We had a handicap sticker and parked literally beside the check in desk door. It was so convenient in every way. Upon arrival we walked a couple of blocks and had dinner at Cioppino's where we had reservations. Lots of restaurants within walking distance. We stayed in the suite with 2 Queen beds in the main area, and a King bed in a separate bedroom. It only had 1 bathroom, but that was not a problem with 12 and 8 year olds plus grandpa that get baths at night. That allowed the other 3 of us to shower in the morning. The room was MUCH nicer than what I pictured. It was VERY clean and the mattresses were pure white (I always check.) No street noise like I thought, very quiet. No free breakfast was the only thing I did not like. We paid quite a bit to eat breakfast in the mornings at different restaurants. (Oh, loved Hollywood Cafe for breakfast, lots of fresh fruit! Also ate at Pat's Cafe, which was also delicious. Great fruit in my oatmeal. Not cheap though for a family of 6) A free breakfast would have been appreciated, like most hotels we stayed at during this 2 week trip starting at Seattle and ending at Phoenix (Grand Canyon.) San Francisco was 5 days into this vacation. We walked to the trolley, maybe 2 blocks, early in the morning (8:45 maybe?)BEFORE breakfast. The trolley was almost empty at that end of the line and were able to get outside seats. We rode the Powell -Mason line clear to the end, then had to get off the trolley to get in line to ride it back. On the way back it was much more crowded and had people standing in front of us inside. We bought the all day pass from the conductor after we were on board, but shouldn't have. We only rode it that one time back and forth. The lines were just too long later in the day to ride again. We also walked from the Columbus Motor Inn to the Alcatraz ferry. We had to stop a couple of times for dad to rest, but it was OK taking it slowly for grandpa. If your phone has a GPS app, use it to walk.

The free parking enables those that rent a car to get out of town to see some of the scenic attractions up the coast such as Muir Woods and Point Reyes and not have to worry about the cost and near impossibility of finding a parking space upon your return. The rooms are fairly spacious and clean although there are no decorations to speak of to spruce the place up. There is a large screen TV in the room which is nice but the picture is not in HD if that is something you care about. And the clock radio has a CD player built in.

We attempted to make reservations about 5 weeks prior to our arrival but their website said that they were booked and no rooms were available.

Same experience here - I called them and got the room that we needed. Checkin was very easy and the parking was FREE. We later learned just how rare this is in SF. We were given room #201, which faced Columbus Ave. We had a view of the street but it was not noisy at night. The bathroom overlooked the lane and side door of Bimbo's 365; a nightclub with quite a history. Again, not noisy at night. The room itself was not what I would call fancy, but who cares. It was clean and it was within easy walking distance of Fisherman's Wharf, cable cars, and Lombard St. On our first night we asked the front desk clerk for a good Chinese restaurant in the area and he recommeded Brandy Ho's about 8 blocks down Columbus Ave. We went there and it was fabulous (another review). We found that there were plenty of dining options in the area but decided to stop by Trader Joe's to pick up some random items like bottled water and some snacks that we could carry with us. The Columbus Motor Inn served as a great base of operations while we explored all of the attractions in the area: Fisherman's Wharf, Alcatraz, the Embarcadero, AT&T Park, the Golden Gate Bridge, Lombard St. We walked to all but the Golden Gate and AT&T Park. (Took ferry to Alcatraz obviously but the location to get on the ferry is fairly close to the hotel). We found the hotel to be secure and we never saw any questionable types hanging around. After exploring the area we discovered that the Columbus Motor Inn was pretty much on par with any of the other hotels in the Fisherman's Wharf area. Most of them are fairly small with no frills. The thing that sets this hotel apart is the free parking and location. It is fairly equidistant to most of the attractions. I understand that people have varying expectations when they stay at a hotel. We usually stay at Marriotts, Sheratons, or Hyatts so we weren't sure about the place before checking in.

I didn't use the car the whole vacation, but I think they have less parkingspaces than rooms. Anyway, I think it's a five minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf and about a 10-15 minute walk to Pier 33 for the Alcatraz Cruise. Walk down one block and then you're already at Lombard Street. Takes about a few minutes to climb up to the most crookedest part of the street and gives a nice few of North Beach. The cable car is one block to the east. One way ride costs you 5 dollar, all day pass 13 dollars. This will get you onto Union Square and Market Street in no time. I wouldn't recommend walking all the way to there, the cablecar is so much easier. Rooms were big enough, I loved the big TV and liked the in-room safe. We requested a room on Columbus Ave, but got one on the side. No problem. Didn't had any noise problems, could sleep without any problem.

Even if we were going to drive around, it's still in a great spot. Get a map at the office if you don't have one. So, if you're looking for the $450 night 'luxury' experience this is not for you.

The first night we arrived in SF we stayed in a 3rd floor room and asked for a \"quiet room.\" It was quiet alright. Looked out on an alley but believe me the silence was bliss after a flight from the East Coast and then a jam-packed afternoon exploring San Francisco. We then headed to Point Reyes and came back to the city on Saturday to meet up with friends. This time we had another 3rd floor room with a view. We worried because the nightclub next door (Bimbo's) was open and playing music that was reverberating but we fell asleep quickly after a busy day showing our friends around SF. After that we found out that Bimbo's is only open on a sporadic basis so no more noise. The view was wonderful--Coit Tower, TransAmerica building, and on and on. The free parking was a definite plus as others have stated. In fact I had considered a Westin (I think it was) where the rates were comparable but then noted that the parking fees were $50 per night! Plus rolling out of the hotel into North Beach was fantastic as this is one of the nicer sections of San Francisco. Many mentioned Mama's and Pat's for breakfast and I'm sure they're good but why not try some of the local cafes near Washington Square? Cafe Grecco comes to mind and there is a local chain called \"La Boulange\" which has wonderful granola and yoghurt, oatmeal, egg dishes, and of course pastries. We tried different ones every day and had fabulous coffee, pastries, egg dishes, you name it all good! We didn't use the transportation system much (have in the past and it is fantastic) but since it was just my husband, myself, my friend, and her son's 20 something girlfriend we walked easily to China Town. Fisherman's Wharf is rarely a place we go anymore but since this was my friend's first visit we walked down there and it was literally 3 blocks down Columbus. My husband and I also booked a tour called \"Taste of the City\" that was fabulous. We visited the fortune cookie factory in China Town, a tea-tasting shop, they were booked solid (the tour company) and therefore couldn't get us into the dim sum places so they got a local restaurant (Louis') to open up and they served us three large bowls filled with chow mein, sweet and sour pork, and fried rice--excellent. Thd gentleman with the restaurant served us some tea he grew on a mountainside in China! Our guide stayed with us long after the tour was supposed to be over and we had pizza in North Beach (Cinecetta I think) and enjoyed conversing with a group from Sweden and a young woman from Germany. As to the rooms: big room, flat screen tvs, in-room safe, bathroom and sink separated which makes it easier to get ready in the a.m., spotlessly clean, but I agree with an earlier reviewer that it would be nice if they had more pillows, ours seemed to be mini-sized!

I wanted something that was clean, close to the wharf/Pier 39, reasonably priced, safe, free parking, and free internet. Well, this hotel fits the bill. The room was super clean and had a very nice large TV on the wall. The hotel is enclosed so the only way anyone can get in is via the lobby elevator/stairs. One of the cable car routes is just around the corner from the hotel on Taylor. Also, the the walk to the wharf is only about 4 blocks down the street(I would recommend going down Taylor as well for this. There is also a great breakfast place, Pat's, on Taylor which is only about a two minute walk from the hotel. This is probably the c losest you can get to the wharf and still stay at a really nice place but not pay an outrageous price. We did not move our car the entire time. You can walk to the wharf/ Pier 39. YOu can take the cable car from the wharf to Union Square and come back again(however it is 5 dollars per person one way but it is a lot of fun and worth the money) Then if you want to go some place else, the bus lines ( which are cheap) are right down the street from the hotel. They have free internet via wire and wireless. I had no problem connecting with my laptop. The front desk staff is super helpful and will be happy to direct you. The only negative thing is that there is not breakfast, no fridge, or microwave,. But, you can request a microwave for 5 dollars per day from what I understand. There is a Safeway, Trader Joes, and Walgreens downt the street. It is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel, maybe even less if you walk fast. OUr room was right over Columbus which is a busy street. But, I had earplugs and did not hear a thing. However, the front desk staff seem very reasonable and would be willing to move you. If you are concerned about street noise, I would ask for a room near the back of the hotel when you make reservations. AND, don't let the BIMBOS sign next to the hotel scare you. This is a nightclub which holds all kids of private parties and events. Althought the name concerend me, I did not witness anything concerning. You can google the name and see fthe place for yourself and upcoming events. . I do have an 11 year old son and was a bit put off by the name, but that was all. . All in all, it is a place I will stay again and would highly recommened it to others. Oh yes, the directions from the hotel site state to turn down Houston once you are on Columbus. I have no idea where this is. Once you turn onto Columbus and see the hotel sign, the garage entrance is right there. Just turn in a find a spot. There are two levels of parking.

Even though there are two floors of parking, it was rather limited. When I asked the manager about this, he said they generally only run out of parking if there is an event. Should they run out of room, you can double park your car in the lot and they will move it into a spot when one becomes available. Fortunately, I always had a spot. If you need to take a cab, they run very frequently and I never had a problem getting one. The rooms were quite large (even if we didn't get a room with a balcony) and clean. The flat screen TV was nice as well. The mattresses could have been a bit firmer in my opinion, but I like very firm mattresses. They do have wi-fi service, however, I found it to be a bit weak with my iTouch at times.

We stayed at the Columbus for one night, and we couldn't have been happier! The location is IDEAL - better than staying at the Warf and at a much better rate. You can not beat the free parking either. You are a couple blocks from the \"crookedest street\" and Fisherman's Warf. You can grab the cable cars right at the corner or walk two blocks towards FW and grab it at the end/begining of the line. The area is perfectly safe and we never felt nervous while walking around in the evening. One thing to note, however, the nightclub next door is now open again (some people here had previously stated it was closed). We had a room on the third floor on the corner right next to the the club and you could hear the music slightly through the walls. I don't think there would be any problem if you got any of the other rooms facing the street and not the corner room or if you were staying during the week instead of over the weekend like us. Though our room was right in front of the elevators, we never heard a peep from any of the others staying in the hotel. The rooms are VERY clean and nicer then I expected! We loved the layout of the room! Though we didn't have a balcony, we had half a wall of windows that opened and a great little table/chairs to sit and watch the day go by. The beds were comfortable, the bathroom a nice size, and the shower had good water pressure. We would certainly stay here again. The staff was very helpful and polite. NOTE: You may be tempted to ask for a room away from the road, but I wouldn't do so. You're stuck (1) with not view facing the building next door and (2) You're stuck right next to the nightclub - certainly not more quiet then the street during the weekend. The traffic noise was minimal and wouldn't bother the average sleeper. Besides, it's not a huge interstate highway passing by the hotel anyway. Just a regular city street. Fisherman's Warf: This is a very touristy location and not the cute little warf you might imagine or remember from days gone by. Certainly take a stroll down to it to at least check out the sealions basking on the platforms, but I wouldn't recommend eating there unless you just want something basic. Instead, China Town and Little Italy is close by and offers a much better selection and quality of food. Cable Car: Purchase a day pass instead of simply a one-way or round trip ticket. The day pass only costs a couple dollars more and it allows you to jump on and off when you want for the whole day.", "Date": "July 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cAverage Rooms but Great Location with Parking Included\u201d", "Author": "inneyp", "ReviewID": "UR33925423", "Content": "The two highlights of this inn are location and parking.

Room 313. Stay in the back of building, it is super quiet. The room had a king bed in the main room with a flat screen TV and a queen bed in the second room with it's own flat screen TV & phone. Bathroom is regular size, nice shower pressure and plenty of towels. Bring your own shampoo/conditioner and shower gel. Only shampoo is supplied.The motel photos on the Columbus website do not do it justice. Rooms are much nicer and updated. Apparently the housekeepers are sisters and have been working there for 28 years. They are clean freaks ! Everything is immaculate. I loved all of the space and my husband son and I had plenty of privacy and space to chill out after a long day of sightseeing. The other guests were very quiet and respectful, not like when I have stayed at large Hyatt Hotels and there is always so much hallway commotion at the large chains, not a problem here. For once I did not have to watch Sponge Bob all night and could watch my own TV shows, very cool. Eat at Pat's Cafe around the corner, very cute and very good food. Did not like Joanies Diner too much. Noah at the front desk is the most knowledgable of all of the staff. He is there on weekdays. The weekend guys are nice, but don't know too much about restaurants. Parking is easy and FREE! Spaces a bit small, but there were always enough parking spots. They have a 2 level garage.

Trader Joes, In N Out, Cost Plus, Cable Car, Barnes & Noble are a few blocks away.CA Academy of Sciences, too crowded to enjoy, go to the Exploritorium instead. Ok, about the biking accross Golden Gate Bridge - the bike shops down play the difficulty level. The bike path is not identified well at all. I would not recommend for child under 10 or an adult not fairly fit. It is quite a trek to get there, about 4 hilly miles and then once you are on the bridge, it is very noisy and stressfull with all of the cars etc.. Better to drive and park nearby and then walk on bridge and take a few photos. When I saw the nieghboring hotels (Hilton, Sheraton, Marriot, Holiday Inn) I realized what an insane bargain this is.

San Francisco can be a little difficult to navigate but it wouldn\u2019t put me off having a car. After visiting, we are glad we picked this location and prefer it over Union Square area which we visited both during the day and in the evening. If your main aim is shopping, Union Square may be more to your taste and Yerba Buena gardens area with the SOMA (well worth a visit) was lovely but the homeless situation is rather depressing (yes, I know it\u2019s a part of every city but we were quite saddened by the sheer numbers here). We did find the wharf a bit tacky but enjoyed seeing the sea lions and it was an easy walk to the Alcatraz boat and to Fort Mason (there is a lovely park and community garden there). Italian North Beach is very close by and the cable car stops just around the corner and runs until well after midnight. We bought a 3-day pass for the cable cars, which also allowed unlimited transport on the buses and trams for $18 each \u2013 we thought this was good value considering a single one-way ride on a cable car costs an expensive $5 each. The hotel has covered parking and although there didn\u2019t appear to be many spaces, the lot was never completely full. Access to the lobby is from the parking area and check in was quick and straightforward \u2013 there are maps available on the desk which are very useful and also give bus routes to some of the attractions you may want to visit \u2013 such as Golden Gate park which was fabulous (and the bridge of course). When making a reservation on the hotel website, we requested a room facing the street on the third floor but this floor was undergoing renovation so we were on the second story. Ice and cold drinks machine were available. The room was clean and a decent size, the bed and pillows were comfortable. There is a large flat screen TV together with coffee making facilities. There is no breakfast, but there are places nearby \u2013 unlike the previous review, we didn\u2019t have a good experience with Pat\u2019s Caf\u00e9 (almost cold potatoes and bland, soggy omelette) but that\u2019s subjective. There is a bowl of apples in the lobby in the mornings that may be enough for you to last for a couple of hours (we tend to get a bit tired of eating out for every meal when on holiday anyway and often just have either breakfast or lunch).

At first glance, we were somewhat dubious as the external appearance of the hotel belies the interior. It is an older style typical motor inn, the lobby is on the street level and very small and one enters the elevator through the lobby virtually off the street. However, don't let appearances deceive you! We had previously booked a King room on the 3rd floor at the back of the hotel, away from the ice machine, as suggested by a previous visitor and had no complaints whatsoever -- the room, although not luxurious, was larger than normal, very clean, and the halls were also very clean. It was particularly convenient that the bathroom sink was located outside the shower/toilet room which allowed both of us to get ready at the same time every day. Although the room looked out on a side street over a nightclub, we were never bothered by noise at night. Also, the price was extremely reasonable for San Francisco -- $122.00/night. The location is excellent for Fisherman's Wharf (about five blocks walking) and just around the corner is the end of the line for the Mason Powell cable car line which allowed us to travel all over where the cable cars run in the city -- there is a ticket booth right there too to buy visitors' passes which we strongly recommend -- we paid $18.00 each for a 3 day visitors pass allowing us unlimited travel on the cable cars, buses and subway (although we didn't use the subway) -- a great deal when you consider it costs $5.00 for a one way ride on the cable car! There is a #30 bus stop right outside the door also. There didn't seem to be many places to eat close by but that didn't bother us too much as we were usually out and about the city most days. The Inn does rent out small refrigerators for an additional $5.00 per day (which we took advantage of) so we were able to keep staples on hand for continental breakfasts in the mornings and snacks at night. Although we didn't have a car, there is free parking available at the Inn - a real bargain when you consider some hotels in SF charge $35.00 to $40.00/day!

Secondly, the location was ideal. It is literally a 5 minute walk to Fishermans walk and all the attractions in that area and only a 2 minute walk to the cable car terminus making it really easy to get downtown or elsewhere in the city. The reception staff were really helpful and always ready and willing to give advice to us first time visitors to the city. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable and for the price I cannot fault the hotel at all. For curry lovers there is an excellent Indian restaurant right across the street but plenty of other eating options within a short walk. We were only there for 3 nights so had to pick what we wanted to see and do but the 2 highlights of our visit were the Alcatraz trip which was an unforgettable experience and a bike ride across the Golden Gate Bridge. Picking the bikes up near to Fishermans Wharf, it was a gentle mostly flat ride to the bridge and an easy downhill ride on the other side to Sausilito where we caught the ferry back.

The motel is near the trolley line and with a toddler, was well situated by the Pier - we went every night to watch the sea lions and to ride the carousel. Also we were able to go back for naps as we were close to lots of tourist things. After a few days the tackiness (sorry!) of the wharf started to get to us, but for a toddler it was good, and entertaining. I'd highly recommend the Musee Mecanique on the wharf - doesn't look like much, but my daughter had a great time dropping quarters into the old fashioned arcade theatres and watching the puppets etc dance.

The reviews seemed good as well. We have three children and most hotels do not allow 5 people per room.

It was $189 a night including parking. I honestly wasn't expecting too much, but was pleasantly surprised. Noah checked us in. He was very helpful with any and all questions and the ones he was unsure of he hopped on the computer and found the answer for me. The elevator was out for our stay - but it was okay. We were on the first floor and the bell hop carried all of our bags to the room. They even delivered a roll away bed. We were shocked at how large the room was, especially for San Francisco standards. It had a large room with two double beds and a table and chairs. There was a second room with a door that had a queen bed and enough room for the roll-away. We had plenty of room to move about and bed times were very easy having a door to close. I was also impressed with the cleanliness. I always push the bed up against the wall since I have a little one sleeping in bed with me. Normally I am rather disgusted at what accumulates under the bed that rarely gets cleaned. This time - it was spotless - made me very happy. The decor is a bit dated, but it really reminds me of \"grandma's house\". The lights, the wallpaper, etc. reminds me of going into my grandmas dining room/living room area. The bathroom is nothing to write home about - but it had good water pressure and HOT water. The location was great. A very easy two block walk to the cable car stop on Taylor & Bay, bus stop right outside to catch the #30 to the Exploritorium and an easy walk to the Cannery, Fisherman's Wharf and not bad walk to Chinatown.

We requested a high floor room and were allocated Room 215 which faced Columbus Avenue and was located on the 2nd floor at the very end of a long corridor. At first I was apprehensive about having a room facing Columbus Avenue as I am a light sleeper and have read past reviews about the traffic noise but I was not kept awake by the street noises at all, however, as we were there from a Friday night to a Monday morning, the traffic noise may be different on a weekday. We found the Suite to be very clean and it was great to have individual air conditioning units in each room. When we woke each morning we put the air conditioners on and the rooms quickly heated up. (We found it a bit chilly in the mornings) Sure, the furniture is not ultra chic and of modern design, however there was plenty of drawers and wardrobes if you wanted to unpack. All the furniture was a dark timber, almost antique design and was not shabby at all. The queen bed was located in a seperate room from the two doubles which allowed privacy. The bathroom was clean and free of mould etc with the shower located over the bath and toilet located in same room. The water pressure of the showe was fantastic and we did not find the shower head too low at all as previously reported and husband is 6' 2'' tall. It was good to have a large vanity and basin located just outside the bathroom with a hairdryer. There is a very large ice machine on each floor located next to the elevators. It might be wise to not get a room near this area as the ice machine was really really noisy all the time. It seemed to be constantly churning over the ice and sounded like it was about to take off into orbit it was so noisy !! We did go to Pat's Cafe once for breakfast which is located in a nearby side street but we found the menu very limited and a bit expensive. We then discovered a Cafe on Columbus Ave, heading 3 blocks towards Fishermans Wharf & across the road from The Holiday Inn. The Diner/Cafe (sorry can't remember the name) had alot more variety with very good prices and with alot locals dining there also. Located next to the Diner was an Internet Coffee Shop, we used the internet here to pre-checkin for our flight on Southwest Airlines and they also printed the Boarding passes for 50cents per page. The Columbus Inn was a fantastic find in a great location for a truely great price and we easily walked to Fishermans Wharf, Lombard Street and to the Pier which the ferry for Alcatraz tours leaves from and we caught the bus which leaves outside the hotel to Union Square and then caught the Cable Car back. I had originally booked a hotel in Union Square but then changed my mind and booked the Columbus Motor Inn mainly for the great price and for the additional bedroom and I was so glad that we didn't stay at Union Square as my husband and 2 teenage sons were not at all interested at shopping at all so I was glad we settled for a hotel that was close to Fishermans Wharf and the attractions that are in that area,. When I pointed out to them the hotel that I had originally booked at Union Square they were all so relieved that I made the accommodation change to the Columbus and so was I. We also could not fault the professionalism of the Front Desk staff who were always ready to provide information and maps of the area. We also arrived 3 hours earlier than check-in time and our room was ready which was really nice after a long 13 hour flight from Australia. Our stay at the Columbus Motor Inn was made purely from reading the reviews on Tripadvisor and we were not dissapointed at all.

Since we had never been to SF before, I first had to decide what neighborhood, which I did by reading books and going to various websites. North Beach sounded fantastic, so then I struggled with whether to pay more to be *right in* North Beach or pay much less to stay at the Columbus Motor Inn *near* North Beach. I finally settled on the Columbus, and I am very happy I did. Not only did we pay less than half what we would have elsewhere, but the hotel was perfectly located, in between NB and Fisherman's Wharf, with a bus stop right out front, a nice big, comfortable, clean room with free internet (both wireless and plug-in), and our room had a balcony with a view of both Coit Tower and the Transamerica Pyramid. Initially I had requested a back room, away from the side of the hotel which is nearest Bimbo's club, thinking it would be quieter. When we got there no such room was available, but we were told we could ask for a different room in the morning. By then, though, we had decided our fears of noise had been groundless and we loved our room and didn't want to move. The room was huge, with a well-stocked coffee maker (the coffee wasn't half bad for what it was), a separate sink area and bathroom with tub shower. I loved standing on the balcony in the morning to check the weather and watch everyone walking down the street. I felt like the neighborhood was perfectly safe and pleasant to walk in, and often walked to and from North Beach and Fisherman's Wharf, including at night (I am a 30-something female). Although I am used to urban areas, having lived in both NYC and DC, I don't think anyone would have a problem with this neighborhood. As I mentioned, Bimbo's club is next door, but despite its name it's a pretty upscale club (go to their website and you'll see what I mean). One night there was actually some kind of benefit concer there, and elegantly gowned and tuxedoed people were emerging from Mercedeses and limos. The desk staff were always friendly, and were happy to let us leave our stuff there all day on our last day (we were catching the red-eye flight that night). Book through their website, and you'll get the best prices. My advice would be to stay here, get a MUNI passport when you first arrive (ours were $24 each for 7 days and covered bus, streetcar and cable car, allowing us to hop on and off at will), and have a wonderful time in San Francisco.

Friends had warned that Columbus Ave might be dirty and noisy but based on the reviews on trip advisor.com, I thought I'd give it a chance. I'm glad I did! This hotel really is a find. It is very clean, the beds are excellent quality (very important to me), there is free wireless connection in the room (great if you can take your laptop with you to check things out during your visit) and our room was very quiet. I can't verify that all the rooms are equally quiet because it is a busy street but I was never conscious of it being very noisy even in the lobby. We requested a third floor, back room and got it. The lobby is situated so they have very controlled access to the rooms and I never felt unsafe--at the hotel or on Columbus Ave. This may not be of interest to many but to my son, the most important hotel criteria is that it have cable tv (we don't have it at home) and this hotel did have it. And of course the free car park is a wonderful benefit if you drove, as we did. In addition to it being a clean, safe and quiet, it is located superbly well for sightseeing. We could easily walk to the Wharf, North Beach restaurants, and even Chinatown. We took the Hyde Street cable car (go early in the morning like 9'ish to avoid the long lines) up Russian Hill and walked down Lombard right back to the hotel. We had our car with us and drove to the Golden Gate and Muir Woods--an easy drive from this hotel's location. Although there was not any printed materials in the room listing nearby restaurants, shops, etc., the staff at the front desk were helpful and friendly with all our questions concerning restaurants, directions, bus rides (great bus stops right outside hotel) and provided helpful maps. My only advice/caution would be that we felt the breakfast choices were a little limited. One day we went up to Mama's Cafe on Washington Square (it opens at 8 and we got there at 7:50 and were fifth in line) and were disappointed in it. The long lines don't allow for a leisurely breakfast and while the food was certainly good, I wasn't up for paying almost $30 for breakfast for the two of us every day. We did a bit better at Pat's Cafe which is just across the street virtually from the Columbus--slightly better prices, similar food though a bit more limited in choices and not terribly efficient service but very friendly and neighborhood-y. However, next time, I would definitely take up the Columbus on their offer to put a fridge in our room for $5/day and then go down the street two blocks and get Trader Joe's and Starbuck's items for breakfast in the room. I should add Italian pastries to that as we also found some really delish pastries a few blocks up on Columbus. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. The only down side is that there is no room service and the only reason that mattered was that my son had a 24 hour tummy bug the first 24 hours and I was having to drag him with me so that I could get something to eat.

I also didn't like that they \"recycle\" their towels. They ask if you will use your towels more than once in order to cut down on laundry, and when you need a new one put the old one on the floor.

The location is great, close to everything. You can walk to all types of public transportation (including the cable cars) and this gives you access to the city and all the shopping, restaurants & culture you can ask for. The neighborhood is safe, even after dark and the entrance to the rooms is from interior corridors, so it's very secure. There's even a grocery store just a few blocks away (along with a post office AND a drug store) so anything you might need is very close. You can walk to Pier 39, Fisherman's Wharf, great North Beach restaurants and Cafes and China Town. It's about a block to the Powell-Mason cable car and a few blocks further to the Hyde Street line. You have good access to virtually the whole city from here. We used Muni to get to Golden Gate Park with no problem. Our room was large, and being on the back of the building, had a great view of Coit Tower and the Transamerica Pyramid-nice to look at both day and night. It was extremely quiet, being in such a busy area & was not noisy, despite a club next door AND the fact that it was fleet week and town was full. Staff was very helpful. The only thing I can possibly complain of was that we could have used a little more vacuuming (or a little more agressive vacuuming). Overall, it's a clean, safe, well located place to be and it's a real bargain for the area. If you NEED the pool and the room service, stay some where else for double or triple a night what you'll pay here.

(Mother, grandmother, three kids and me) We had a seperate bedroom but were still all together. The rooms are nice and spacious.

Within a few blocks are great Italian restaurants and Pat's Cafe around the corner makes a great omellette. We parked the car in the FREE parking garage attached to the hotel. We bought a 3 day MUNI pass and used public transportation to go where ever we wanted. We had a standard 2 double bed room on the third floor that was quite spacious.
