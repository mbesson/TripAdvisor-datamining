From the moment we pulled our car up to the door we experienced nothing but the most helpful and friendly service from all of the staff at Hotel Nelligan. We were looking for a peaceful few nights with days spent meandering through Old Montreal and we definitely found just that! We stayed in a Superior Room with a king size bed that was, honestly, the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. The rooms are large, luxurious and beautiful with original exposed brick walls, lovely furniture and huge windows overlooking the cobble stoned streets of Rue Sainte Paul. Night time in Old Montreal means many club hoppers on the street below, which could get rather loud at times, but nothing that a little light music on the stereo could not dull out. Our bathroom came with an extra large whirl pool tub and spacious glassed in shower, both of which were lovely and a nice touch. We had our birthday dinner at the hotel's restaurant called Verses. While the food was really very tasty, we found our server to be a bit snobbish and seemed to be a bit put out that he was, in fact, our server. Other staff that delivered our food, etc., were far more kind and professional. We only had dinner at Verses the one time, largely because of this particular server, who never seemed to leave the restaurant. As we were being somewhat indulgent, we ordered breakfast to our room each morning and were wonderfully surprised by the quality and quantity received at such a reasonable price. We lucked out during our stay as the staff decided to open the terrace bar on the roof, as the weather turned so unseasonably warm and while it was certainly nice to sit and have a drink on the terrace, the location became quickly packed with line-ups for tables. The poor staff were running like crazy to keep up and having difficulty keeping supplies on stocked, so the service was really slow, although understandably so. If you are looking for a luxurious night or two away from the daily grind I would highly recommend you pamper yourself at the Hotel Nelligan in Old Montreal!", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jersey City, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cA gem in the old city with top notch service\u201d", "Author": "TheSupers", "ReviewID": "UR126511515", "Content": "My husband and I returned last week from a three night stay at this wonderful hotel.

The Bad: - When I travel on business, a simple requirement is the ability to use WiFi access in my room. Failing that, the ability to hook my laptop up to the wired connection. Imagine my surprise when I check in, unpack, plug in my laptop and find that the WiFi code and service doesn't work. At all. I call the front desk a number of times, they tell me it is working fine. It isn't. They then send up two members of the housekeeping staff, neither of whom had a good command of English or French it would seem, to fix it. They basically fart around trying to plug a cord in to my laptop. Still nothing. This continued for 20 minutes. Still no service. Finally something happens and my Internet flickers to life. They leave. It konks out again. \"No internet service available\". I call the front desk who tell me it is working. No, it isn't. Guess who comes back? The housekeeping staff who walk in, speak to each other in Spanish, shrug and leave. Fail. The breakfast was gross.

But the main issue was that the heating system is very noisy. It sounds like they have a thermopump or something like that. It's very annoying, and tiring, to hear that all the time in your room. Also, even though I had a brick wall in my room, I could hear very well what was going on in the next room. Not very pleasant. The decoration was very nice and I understand that my room was a 'petite suite' so they probably really wanted to make it look like it has a living room area BUT I think there were too many pieces of furniture, it was just quite crowded. One more thing, and I never thought I would ever comment on that in all my life as I have never encountered that ever, at the hotel or in anyone's home, the toilet seat was extremely uncomfortable!!! It sounds silly, I agree, but I've just never sat on that kind of seat before! So beware of room 402. I think the actual toilet may be crooked which could explain the weird angle of the seat... I don't know... but very unpleasant. There is a nice stereo system in the room and it was on when I arrived, that's a nice touch. Staff was friendly but had trouble explaining the bill the following morning. I ordered breakfast. Very ordinary. Very expensive. And awful coffee. I don't normally complain much but for a room in a hotel that has high standards, it was disappointing. I can be very happy at a Holiday Inn because I know what to expect. In this case, I definitely expected more. Great chocolate on the pillow. Honest staff (I had left my wallet and my camera on the table, didn't get stolen). Of course, very nice location.

We found this jewel on another website and we received considerable savings for booking a superior king room. After 45 minutes of driving around Old Montreal, thanks to a Google map malfunction, we finally just stopped and called the hotel and we were within a block of the target. Parking will be valet, unless you want to walk an incredible amount of time with all the narrow streets of Old Montreal with which to deal. Everything and every person at Hotel Nelligan has an old world charm, not found in chain hotels of late. Nothing was left unaccommodating. I left my iPad in the car and an attendant took me down to the car, chatting all the way about things to do in Old Montreal. We buried our car for 3 days and spent it walking around the neighborhood. Easy and fun to do, but wear solid shoe, the cobblestones are a bit rough in places. The room was rustic brick through out the hotel. A nice touch for a New Yorker. An exceptional touch was a dinner reservation at Verses, 514-788-4000, the internationally known restaurant at the hotel. We made a reservation on the early side since we were early after the 4 hour drive from the Catskills in New York. Roxanne said she would leave us a confirmation for 7:00. After a little walk and some moules frites and pate' we arrived back to find a hand-written confirmation under our door. Nice touch, Hotel Nelligan! Our dinner at Versus was long and comfy in the wide circular booth. The wine cellar was nicely done, encased in glass and visible throughout the restaurant. Do not expect New York City table rotation times, however. Pan-seared foie gras was a tad cool, but still succulent. A special cantelope soup was cold and refreshing. The braised rabbit with papardelle was enjoyed a second night, and after the first night we had to ask who Nelligan was, as huge Andy Warhol type colorful prints were everywhere in the hotel. Bold and quizzical. Nelligan was a francophone poet from Quebec and died in 1941. I have no clue what francophone poet is, I have to admit. We received two complimentary drinks on arrival and the 5th floor mezzanine is quite the party space! We enjoyed the quiet in the lobby bar, however the mezzanine has a nice view of the harbor upstairs. Do check it out. Spend some time walking Old Montreal to the Bonsecours Market, pick up a genuine Tilley Canadian hat, and enjoy the SPF 50 protection for the rest of the day. There are many galleries, and the Notre Dame Cathedral are well within walking distance. Visit the birthplace of Montreal(1642) at Place Royal, Many sidewalk cafe's line Saint-Paul Ouest, and it was pleasant and remindful of Paris in look/feel. Montreal was on the expensive side, even for New Yorker's. The exchange rate to USD is about 95 cents as of August, 2011, so not a great bargain destination. We had been talking about Montreal and after three days we would go back in a minute! Hotel Nelligan is modern design, has free Wi-Fi, and the only real negative was a strange bathtub that required a balancing act to keep both feet flat. Not designed for two, but manageable for one.

And are we glad we did! It is in the perfect location: Vieux-Montreal, right on Rue Saint-Paul. Just a few blocks from both Place Jacques Cartier and the waterfront, and within easy walking distance of a plethora of dining, shops and attractions. AND within easy walking distance of three different Metro stations (although Place D'Armes is the closest). Our room was a junior suite on the fifth floor, and it was amazing. VERY roomy, yet charming and cozy at the same time (the gas fireplace may have had something to do with that!). Even though the hotel's rooftop lounge/restaurant is also on the fifth floor, noise was not an issue due to the room's configuration (there was a small sort of anteroom between the door from the hall and the actual room space). The room had a fantastic view of the waterfront, and--as the weather was mild-- we had the windows open frequently. The room also overlooked a narrow alley, but that was no problem for us... it was actually kind of romantic. (Every morning a boulangerie truck would pull up below our window, delivering freshly-baked bread and pastries to the hotel restaurant; so every morning we were pleasantly awakened by the wonderfull aroma of fresh baked goods... fantastic!) Our room also had a jacuzzi tub; invaluable due to all of the walking and biking we did every day! There was also am ATM literally steps from our room; how convenient is THAT? The staff at the Hotel Nelligan was wonderful: warm and accomodating (and no one made fun of my terrible French). The concierge, Maud, was especially terrific. As I said, this was our first trip to Montreal, and Maud patiently answered all of our questions and always got us pointed in the right direction. I do have one very, very minor quibble. While this may have been the most comfortable hotel bed i have EVER slept in, the pillows were far too soft for my taste; I prefer much firmer pillows. My wife, however, thought they were just fine.

Reserved a petite suite hoping it would be a suite, but on the smaller side. It turned out to be an unimpressive dim room with an balcony that looks down the centre of the building viewing other similar balconies. The carpet was ugly blue/black/grey, the furniture was of cheap quality, the magnified makeup mirror was installed upside down, and they're were dozens of dead bugs in the hanging light fixture over the bed...yuck! We just couldn't endure this ugly room and asked to be moved to another room. The new room was of a decent size and what we expected a petite suite to look like. It had no view and faced a vacant building, had nice exposed brick, a fireplace, but the desk furniture and other bits were of the same ilk as the original room. Who installs the lights in these bathrooms...again the lights on either side of the bathroom sink were DIM. Trust me Hotel Nelligan, ladies do not want to put makeup on in dim lights and your bedrooms and bathrooms are dim! Left our window open and we're awakened by the garbage pickup around 7:00 as we were at the back of the building on a laneway. Other than the garbage truck the room was a quiet room. The hotel terrace is lovely and we enjoyed drinks there one afternoon. However, ordered a bowl of nuts and were charged $11.00... basically for peanuts. Never been charged for nuts before and complained to the server, and Martin the manager came over to discuss the situation and removed the cost of the nuts. We were not given the food menu so that's why we were surprised when we were billed for the nuts. My husband and his business associate enjoyed a terrace lunch one afternoon. The next day we dined there again, and the chicken brochette I ordered were warmed up and the accompanying vegetables cold. This dish was not freshly prepared, and so I wasn't impressed, but at this point could not be bothered to complain again and left it. The breakfasts are $15.00 + tax per person and is continental or menu ordered. Both were very good. The breakfast staff were courteous and helpful. Had no desire to dine at Verses their restaurant after the poor lunch, so dined off premises. This hotel is located on a corner and when driving up you park the car across the road and the valet attendant drives it around the corner to an underground lot.. Seems awkward but worked out. The front desk staff were great.

Our host in Montreal suggested the hotel and our meetings were held within the hotel. I simply could not have been more pleased. This hotel is located in a part of town called \"Old Montreal.\" The name really says it all. It was quaint and felt so authentic to the French Canadian culture. The streets were narrow and cobblestone. The hotels and stores were all boutique style. One of the nicest surprises came upon entering the hotel. It is unassuming at the entrance but you walk into a grand environment. The staff was friendly and attentive despite my arrival after midnight. My room... it was breath taking. I reserved the petite suite and the bathroom was simply to die for with a rain shower and deep soaking tub. The sitting area in the room was appropriately spaced from the bedding area for guest. The bed was large with luxirous linen. The best part of the room was the architecture. The halls leading to the room were winding and not your usual closet hallway that you find in some hotels. The interior of the room had a great deal of stone and brick work which I loved. I am going to try and post pictures if I can figure out how to do that. I just couldn't have been more pleased with the hotel. A colleagued mentioned that he asked to be moved to the \"back\" of the hotel to avoid some of the noise from the streets. I was already in the back so I never noticed this. He was very pleased with how quickly he was accomodated. He was told to simply back his belongings and the next time he passed the front desk they gave him a new key and let him know that his stuff had been moved there. The location was perfect as you could see some of the best Montreal has to offer within short walking distance. There were nice eateries and dessert bars as well as a wide variety of art galleries and architectrual delights around every corner. I plan to return soon with my beau for a trip of leisure.

Saint Paul is also one block away from the port where you can find lots of outdoor cafes and ice-cream shops. There are two metro stops nearby if you are inclined to venture into Downtown \u00e2\u20ac\u201c otherwise a taxi to the Downtown core is Can 10$. And because Saint Paul is a major street, taxis zip by the hotel frequently at all hours. But this is about Nelligan \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the King Jr suite (#428) was well-located away from the hotel bar/courtyard (atrium) and the elevator\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 so noise was never a problem.

Nelligan offers all the amenities of the larger chain hotels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fluffy bathrobes and towels, spa, mini bar - but with a cozy boutique atmosphere. One caveat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there is no ice machine available\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but a simple call down to reception and a valet appears with ice bucket in tow. If you have an idle moment, Hotel Nelligan has an attached boutique in the lobby with elegant clothes and accessories \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at reasonable prices.

The location was quite convenient, just a 12-15 minute walk to the convention center. I made my reservation through American Express Travel, they offered a discounted price that turned out to be cheaper than staying in the official hotels associated with the conference. Our reservation was for the room type: \"Loft Suite with 1 King Bed.\" The hotel staff was very courteous and made great recommendations for restaurants. The building is old, like historic, but internally has been redone. Our room was quite big.. the decor was very stylish and the wall had this cool exposed brick. Our room overlooked the tiny street. Generally it was quiet in our 5 days there..but one night there was a loud party in the bar across the street and we could hear it -- but otherwise no major noise issues. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was very roomy, clean, stylish and sleek. One MAJOR plus to this hotel -- Free Wifi! Finally, a high end hotel that includes wireless internet in their complimentary service. The neighborhood is great. Really gives you a feel for the unique place that Old Montreal is. Every morning we walked up the street to our favorite restaurant we discovered there \"Olive et Gourmando\"... great breakfast and lunch items on their menu. When we walked to the convention center, we passed by the beautiful Notre Dame cathedral on the way. We would catch the Metro from the convention center whenever we needed to take the subway to other parts of Montreal. Overall it was a great stay.

We had to keep asking for coffee , something which did not occur in the past when we used to help ourselves to our beverages. In fairness, we have been going to the Nelligan for years and years and certain things DO change but we are not big fans of things you pay for just not being available.

We received a complimentary evening cocktail, which was fun to start off the evening. We would have liked to have our dinner at the in-house Versus restaurant as the menu looked delicious, but they were booked solid. I suggest reserving in advance, especially for weekends. We were not disappointed in the great filet mignon dinners we enjoyed at The Keg Steakhouse a few blocks away on rue St-Paul. We later returned to our room to find chocolates on our pillows and a plate of chocolate covered strawberries and a nice note, a sweet surprise from the Hotel for our special occasion stay. (Thank you Nelligan!) For the lows, I did find the bathroom and jacuzzi were basically only lightly wiped over and could use a good scrubbing. Also, a dimmer would be nice in the bathroom for a more romantic bath. I did bring along some tealite candles which were great around the tub. Unfortunately the toilet is really close, squeezed in between the tub and the wall. The glassed-in shower is huge and there is lots of hot water and pressure. There is a gas fireplace in the room that gives but a small pilot-light flame when clicked on with a remote. I was hoping for a bigger 'fire' to savor a glass of wine in front of. The king bed was amazing to say the least. Veeeerrrrry comfortable. There was a bit of noise from the streets below in the wee hours, but nothing that hindered our sleep. Access to the windows is cumbersome. There are very heavy blinds that need to be pulled all the way up to the top with mere 'strings' before you can open the windows. The blinds are fairly old and battered from all the attempts to open the windows. We attempted to use the CD player, but it did not play well. It was most likely very dirty and we removed our CD promptly and did not touch it again. The breakfast buffet was really good with something for everyone ... coffee, tea, juice, baked goods, bagels, cheeses & cold meats, fresh fruits, cereal and more.

We had a drink in the lobby on two occasions - very pleasant atmosphere to watch the comings and goings of people. The night we arrived we went to Mechant Boeuf Bar-Brasserie and having arrived late on a busy Saturday there was no problem in seating us. Our waiter, Chris, was friendly and professional and we had a divine dinner of oysters, foie gras, sea bass and the hangar steak. I would say we experienced great service from the staff. Especially because one day we noticed a big hole in the car bumper and when we called the hotel to tell them, initially I was told there was no manager available until the next day. I asked if a manager could call us that day, worried that we wouldn't hear back from anyone and anticipated a battle between us and the hotel. What happened was absolutely the pinnacle of amazing customer service; when my husband called, he was told the valet had mentioned something about the car and they'd like to have it fixed before we left. Wow. No argument? No denying responsibility? That gave me such peace of mind to enjoy the rest of our time at the hotel. The car was fixed and delivered as promised. Also, anytime we called for housekeeping for a luggage holder and a plunger (which you will need at this hotel for some reason) they arrived within minutes.

It's a shame that the quality of the service doesn't match the amenities. The staff just don't have the right attitude...and don't hesitate to say \"no\" or ignore an opportunity to make a bad situation better. Case in point: I separately asked two of the staff members if they have the cord I could use to play my iPod on the mini stereo (the cord that sticks in to your iPod's headphone jack) and they both just said no. This is a $5 cord that they should have in every room...the stereo seems pointless otherwise. And if they were out of them for whatever reason...why not go get one? That's the kind of service I would expect from a $250/night boutique hotel. Second example...I went in to check out the breakfast buffet and a woman greeted me asking if I had my coupon. I said I remember seeing a coupon with my room key envelope but I didn't bring it. She asked if I could go back to my room and get it...so I did..up and down a few flights of stairs..and when I gave it to her...she said \"sorry, wrong coupon...the buffet will be $17\".

From the moment we were greeted by friendly and extremely helpful and efficient check-in staff to the time the porter put our bags in the car to the airport, we were very well looked after. The hotel itself is in the old town a little way away from the main commercial and financial district. This might be inconvenient if you are travelling on business. However on the plus side it is located in the narrow cobbled streets of old Montreal, just behand the magnificent Notre Dame Basillica, and close to about 20 bars and restaurants. The hotel itself is a converted old building. The conversion has been carried out to a high standard with a very impressive 5 storey atrium being the centre-piece immediately behind reception. This serves as a lounge bar and is where continental breakfast is served. We had reserved a Superior Room and were delighted with it. It was of good size, well furnished with a large comfortable bed. The bathroom was traditional in design but with very modern fittings and a good power-shower. The view of the adjoining shabbly building next door was not great, but it is a city hotel and not much time will be spent sitting looking out of the window. The house-keeping is really impressive. Towels were changed twice daily. The evening turn out included chocolates on the pillars, a quick tidy up and the room left in subdued lighting with classical music playing on the in-room sound system. Very relaxing when you returned from a hard evening a nearby restaurant! We had dinner in the bistro one evening. We found it a bit noisy with a Sports Bar feel. The food however was quite good and the service very good. We had a light lunch in the main restaurant on the day we left. The food was extremely good and the service impeccible. A further feature of the hotel is the rooftop bar.

The chief concern was that it was so nice my partner and I really didn't want to leave during our four night stay. The bathroom, as noted, is fantastic. The main room is well furnished and had artsy touches that my partner seemed to enjoy. The courtyard view is pleasant; I imagine a window to the outside, if one is available, would be much better. The bedding is very nice, the turn down service is spoiling, and I was pleased that the room is sufficiently dark (and quiet!) at night. And while it's neither here nor there, I'm amazed that Montreal has such a wonderful classical station; much better than what I'm used to stateside, and fantastic when getting ready to falling asleep. Location is superb. You're where you want to be, here. Most attractions are within walking distance. The complementary wine service is very nice. The wine, actually, isn't that bad. If you do decide on the Nelligan, it's worth cashing in your coupons. Service as far as our wine was pretty unfriendly; the bartender was interested in clients who were paying, which I understand, but rubbed me the wrong way as we were pleasant, well dressed, and borderline obnoxious tippers. Service at the front desk gets average marks. Check in was quick and painless. The valet was prompt, although I believe I only accessed my car once during the trip (forgot to take up with me the engagement ring I'd hidden, apparently from myself). When I asked for dining recommendations, or directions, I found the reception somewhat frosty and certainly unhelpful. Check out was similarly quick and painless. We didn't end up getting engaged here (although we did about a month later), as non-Nelligan parts of our trip were unexpectedly unfriendly. I think in part because we are young and obviously American tourists, our experiences may have been atypical. We were not well received when dining; conversing in English or French didn't seem to make a difference. Driving is somewhat frustrating and confusing, even with a passing knowledge of French (be warned that near everything is in French, and GPS is your friend; check if extra charges are associated with its use if American). After giving up on driving, we opted for a taxi, and our taxi driver after reciting Hail Mary's and Our Father's on his rosary proceeded to tailgate the car in front of us until at the next light things devolved into a shouting match with choice words my mother used only when very upset, a few lights following their passenger was spitting through the car windows on our driver and throwing her ice scraper (here I had to laugh), until at the next light there was a fist fight between our taxi driver and the two BMW occupants. I suppose the good news is that the police arrive quickly and taxi ride was free, but I didn't find the Quebecois in my limited experience to be very pleasant. My partner was also quite upset after the incident, which was going to be the night I popped the question. Our massages were quite good at Spa Diva, and I heartily recommend splurging, even better as a couples' treat. I have to say, albeit with limited experience, that was the best massage I've ever received. By the end I was ready to propose to the masseuse, not my now wife. All in all it was a good experience; I can't hold unstable taxi drivers against the Nelligan or give them credit for religion reaffirming masseuses. Overall I'd rate the Nelligan a four. The room itself is truly a five, but the service was at times cold and for the price and the much credited hype on TA, I admit I had expected a little more.

As others have mentioned the lobby is often quite crowded - there were corporate events every day we were there - and we often had to wait to ask for assistance. Then there was the laundry that we sent out to be done a full day before we were to leave. There is supposed to be same day turn around but when we called in the evening to see why it hadn't been delivered yet they said they hadn't actually sent it out - even though we left it before the time required - and if we hadn't called and made them send back up our dirty clothes they would have sent them out not even noticing that we were leaving the next day. Then to top it all off we asked the concierge to confirm a reservation for us at a restaurant since we didn't have a phone and were on our way out of the hotel - instead when we showed up the next night for dinner they said the hotel had actually cancelled our reservation (it turned out ok but it could have been a disaster). Don't get me wrong - the location is very good, the rooms are beautiful and I did find the bath products to be of high quality. Maybe if we had stayed in one of the cheaper rooms I would be less annoyed. But if you're looking for a luxury experience I don't think this is the place to go. I have stayed at a number of luxury hotels over the past several years and this didn't measure up - even though the price did. I was deciding between the Nelligan and the St. James and I think next time I would stay at the St. James even though it's more out of the way.", "Date": "July 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201ca faded NOISY glory\u201d", "Author": "reasal", "ReviewID": "UR34467221", "Content": "A very attractive boutique hotel with large attractively furnished ( although a bit battered now)rooms bathrooms have jaccusis etc if you like that sort of thing.

We decided to stay at Hotel Nelligan as it was a boutique hotel in old Montreal, looked nice and the reviews were good. My husband called the hotel directly to book our room and mentioned that we were celebrating our anniversary so we wanted a nice room and he selected a new suite. When we arrived no mention was made of the anniversary which was fine but as far as customer service, this would have been an excellent opportunity for the hotel to acknowledge the occasion. We were shown to our room and it appeared very nice, modern, spacious and new with beautiful windows opening to the main street below. We noticed a bad smell so we opened the windows and hoped it would dissipate. I went to check out the bathroom and noticed (sorry for the graphic visual) the toilet had not been flushed an there was evidence of where the smell was coming from.. I turned away and flushed the toilet hoping to dismiss the event both physically and from my mind but was somewhat disturbed. Unfortunately the offense did not go away and was still visible. At this time my husband decided that this was not acceptable of course and called down to the front desk to report the complaint. The hotel staff were very dismissive and told us they would take us to another room but did not apologize or seem concerned, embarrassed, appalled... We were shown another room, smaller and with only one small window facing an alley. We told them that we wanted a room of at least the same caliber if not an upgrade given the circumstances. We were very polite and did not want to make a big deal of the event . We were then shown another room in the old section of the hotel which was nice but not nearly as nice as the first. and the furniture was dated At this point we just wanted to get settled as we had dinner reservations and it was getting late so we accepted this room. We also were beginning to feel embarrassed that we were appearing too picky. Needless to say, we were not pleased. The room was inferior and the staff unapologetic about the embarrassing situation. This was an opportunity for the hotel to turn a negative customer service event into a positive, I don't know what they teach in Hotel Management School but it seemed like 101 of Customer Service issues to provide us with an upgraded if not equivalent room. One more comment, the breakfast / lounge area is somewhat dated and I have to comment on the music- Lionel Richie and Barry Manillow consistently played ( no offense to those who are fans but- ) not the kind of hip ambience background music you would expect in a boutique hotel in Old Montreal.

The breakfast is a continental breakfast, it's ok, but nothing exciting. It'll fill you up but if you want really good pastries and coffee, I would recommend that you go to Olive and Gourmando's. The wine and cheese reception is even more disappointing. It's a spread of 4 standard cheeses like chedder, muenster, etc and the wine is not very good.

When we were brought to our room and saw the sofa, we asked why it was not pulled out and ready for our kids to sleep on.(it was 10:30 pm) We were told all the linens were on the bed and all we had to do was pull it out. After settling in and giving our kids a snack, we pulled out the bed and it was just a bare mattress. We called down to housekeeping and were told they would be right up with the linens. A half hour later we called down again. Finally, they came up and handed us the linens for us to make the bed ourselves because housekeeping had left for the evening. Is this a luxury hotel? Also, gave us 3 towels for 4 people. Street noise was the WORST I have ever experienced anywhere-EVER! None of us slept. (We've lived in NYC!) When we called to complain the next morning we were told there were no other rooms available. Yet, the website showed availability. Also, no apology for the making the bed debacle the night before. Breakfast is a joke. Each morning we came down and the empty tables were uncleared and filthy. There was very little to eat at the Continental breakfast except the additional $10 omelettes. Small TV is as far as from the bed as possible. It was too far for the remote to reach it. A 2 foot computer wire kept us tethered to the desk. We called down 3 times to ask for a longer wire and were told they had none. They never mentioned nor did anything in all the room literature that they had Wi Fi!! We found this out as we were checking out. Front desk could not tell us approximately how much cab fare to a nearby neighborhood would be. Would it be $10 or $50? They did not know. After taking a bath and then playing in the room, my kids feet were black. The floors were filthy! As were all the shutters in the room. They were coated with 3 inches of dust. There was absolutely nowhere to unpack anything. If you have anything more than a t -shirt and toothbrush- good luck. The entire stay was like a balancing act. We had stacks of stuff piled everywhere. If you tried to put a razor and soap bar in the shower, one would fall to the floor. Phone by the bed would not dial the front desk or anywhere in the hotel, only regular calls. So, if you were in bed and wanted to call for a wake-up call, you would have to get out of bed and use the other phone. It really is a shame because I so wanted to love the hotel. The location is great and the room happened to be so pretty. But, everything about it was sooo inconvenient..

The maps all blurred together, and we had no idea what was a charming street or what was not. With a huge assortment of lodging options, and many with good reviews, it seemed to come down to aesthetics and general location. We prefer modern design (but not cold), so it was an easy choice to avoid the over-the-top antique-ish spots or stark clubby options. In the end we chose the Hotel Nelligan for its location in Vieux Montreal and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s welcoming warm design. We were not disappointed. The neighborhood feels a bit like SOHO in NY, with a touch of Paris tossed in. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mixture of restaurants, bars, galleries and shops. Some tragically touristy, some less so. The charming but touristy Place Jacques Cartier is a few minutes walk, as well as the lovely quays of the old port, city hall, Notre Dame, etc. Overall we were very pleased with the location and the ease with which we were able to walk to other areas, such as downtown, Quartier Latin, Plateau Mont-Royal, Le Village, etc. We never made it on to the Metro as we like to explore by foot, but there seem to be stops a few minutes away. All in all very easy. The hotel- two old 5 story brick buildings connected by a lovely interior atrium. The room was nice. Very warm, cozy and comfortable. There may be potential issues with street noise, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to be aware that this is a small building in a lively and hopping neighborhood. I believe windows are single pane, and this could be an issue for some people. We actually had to change rooms due to a noise problem with the ventilation system (a fluke, I would say), and the staff gave us several options so we got to see some different rooms. It is important to note that they were extremely helpful. The room we ended up with was in the back of the hotel and very quiet. Large and relaxing. The bed was absolutely wonderful. An extremely comfortable king bed with lots of down pillows and a dreamy duvet. Perfect. The bathroom was just ok however. Nice and elegant but nothing special. Tub and shower were fine but unremarkable, and water pressure was just ok. All in all not a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vacation-like\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd shower escape, but certainly not bad at all. (One of the other rooms we saw was a lot smaller, but actually had a modern glass rain shower.) The staff was amazing. Extremely helpful, patient, kind and professional. (They even left us a small box of chocolates to apologize for the ventilation issue). Breakfast was decent and served in the atrium. Yogurts, cereals, pastries, toast, juices, fruit. The usual. Coffee was mediocre however. Well nothing is perfect! There was complimentary afternoon wine and cheese in the atrium as well. Quite a nice touch. We did not try the restaurant for dinner. D\u00c3\u00a9cor was very pleasant. Contemporary but warm and cozy. A bit warn around the edges in spots, but all in all a very nice place. (One small detail- I found the garish modern art paintings in the atrium and lobby to clash terribly with the elegant atmosphere. My guess is that these are temporary as they are for sale.) All in all we were very happy with our choice. We had just com from Hotel 71 in Quebec City, so the standards were high. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say the Nelligan did well. It was also reasonably priced and seemed to be excellent value for the money. Now that we know the city a bit, we might stay there again, but would most likely pick a slightly less touristy spot for our next visit. The Hotel Place d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Armes (owned by the same folks) would probably be high on our list. We liked it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location. Overall we had a terrific time in Montreal. Saw a wonderful exhibition at the Mus\u00c3\u00a9e des Beaux Arts (Yves Saint Laurent), explored interesting neighborhoods, took a fantastic bike ride along with water and out to the Biosphere, and had some terrific dining experiences. Breakfast at St. Viateur Bagel Caf\u00c3\u00a9, and dinner at Schwartz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (a crowded and noisy Jewish deli with great food. It was excellent and well worth the wait in line.)

A Four Star Porch to Vieux Montreal.\u201d", "Author": "HarryfromLA", "ReviewID": "UR18867061", "Content": "Some hotels are meant to be sanctuaries from the world outside. The Hotel Nelligan takes a different approach. After spending one busy Saturday night in August with my ten year old son, I have concluded that the Hotel Nelligan serves as the front porch to the incredibly vibrant neighborhood of Vieux Montreal (Old Montreal). The hotel takes the best of the area\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shopping, dining, art and social scene and welcomes it inside. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to talk about the Hotel Nelligan without talking about Vieux Montreal. We arrived at 8:30 pm on Saturday night which turned out to be the most impossibly chaotic time to be driving a car down the cobblestone streets of Rue Saint-Paul. There were people everywhere. The gridlock reached a climax at the Place Jacques-Cartier where two major pedestrian thoroughfares intersect in a hubbub of street performers, perhaps the continent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most concentrated contingent of caricature artists, and tourists and locals alike. I hail from Los Angeles and I equate it to having two Third Street Promenades crashing into each other. The resulting social melting pot was positively exhilarating. The Hotel Nelligan was a microcosm of this. The hotel takes over several abandoned warehouse buildings and connects them with dramatic spaces, preserving the soaring atriums and a lot of the brickwork that give the place its contemporary yet comfortable character. The entrance along the Rue St. Paul is full of storefronts, with the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Verses Restaurant on one side of the front door and a trendy retail store on the other. Both contribute to the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liveliness. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a plus that the hotel has a two-block buffer between it and the Place Jacques-Cartier, so even though there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of traffic and people around, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not stifling. Activity inside the hotel was bustling throughout our stay, not in a W-esque, clubby, bump-bump-bumping kind of way. The Hotel Nelligan drew a more sophisticated eclectic crowd. Instead of conceiving the public space as a bar, the Hotel Nelligan conceived it as a living room and parlor. As a hotel guest, the proof is in the pudding of the rooms. For the most part, the rooms at the Hotel Nelligan delivered. There were a lot of things that I liked: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The rooms are equipped with an excellent flat screen TV, a souped-up clock radio with I-pod docking station, and a separate stereo system with fairly decent speakers. To cap it off, they even had a list of audio CD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s which I could check out. While the TV should\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been mounted on the wall so that it could give me a little more precious space on the built-in long desk, all in all the place is wired to the max. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The pi\u00c3\u00a8ce de r\u00c3\u00a9sistance is the bathroom, and specifically the shower. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a sucker for rain shower heads with separate hand washers. The shower experience here is awe inspiring. One of the few misses in the room, however, are some of the bathroom finishes. The wall tile is a poor vinyl selection which looks cheap and is installed poorly. I also had trouble finding wall hooks for my towels but did manage to discover several cleverly placed rods. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Under the category of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never seen this in a hotel room before\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the bathrooms came stocked with an Oxia personal oxygen dispenser which looked a lot like a wide-body shaving cream can. For $16.95 (or a lot more if you take the entire canister) I could get an unblemished oxygen whiff. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll admit I was tempted but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t inhale. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 There was attractive, original, geometric, painted artwork above the headboard, or at least artwork which worked hard to avoid looking mass-produced. In addition, a very comfortable fuzzy throw blanket hangs diagonally over the corner of the bed - a gracious extra which was cleverly presented. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 An ATM machine in a corridor off the lobby is particularly convenient for American travelers since there aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a lot of banks immediately nearby. What didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work for me? For one, my first impression when walking into my standard king room was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, this is a little small. Cool, but small. New York or London small.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd An extra foot or two would really make the room a lot more livable, since as it was, there was less than a meter to get around in places. The high ceilings were a saving grace, though, opening up the room quite a bit. Also, I found the rooms way too dark. The poor lighting was exacerbated by one small window and the dark furniture and slate gray/blue/black color scheme \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I really had to work hard when I checked out to make sure I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave something on the floor. Having a dimmer switch would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been welcomed (I admit that I might\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve come away with an entirely different reaction to the mood lighting if I was taking my wife on a romantic urban getaway instead of taking my son to tour Montreal). The lighting problem was even more compounded in the bathroom where the light above the sink just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get bright enough (my wife, had she been there, would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve run to the store and installed her own bulbs). The disconnect was particularly confusing for me since the lobby areas were generally lighter with warmer and a little less ruthlessly modern with organic colors, softer leather finishes and a more eclectic d\u00c3\u00a9cor. My only other comment would be that I found the mattress to be rather hard like a futon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c maybe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal preference, though the pillows and comforter were delightful. I thought the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service level was outstanding. When I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find a parking space in front of the hotel to check in, the valet offered to retrieve my car a few blocks away and repark it. When we checked out and wanted to walk around, they put our bags directly into our car. The free glass of wine for each guest when they check in is a nice touch and it certainly helps to get people into to bar area. Oh, and the complimentary breakfast was also well done, though beneath the elegant presentation, it was a fairly conventional continental breakfast, but the omelet bar for $6 was indeed an added bonus. Having a ten-year old boy with me, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t test out the fine dining restaurant, spa, roof deck or other hotel services (my son did regret not having a pool, but he loved being close to the waterfront). The front desk staff was charming, friendly and helpful. All in all, I really appreciated the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerted effort to reevaluate everything I typically see when I spend the night away from home. There were clever hits and a few misses, but when I go out, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m looking for a transformative experience. For one glorious night in Vieux Montreal, I got that experience and more from the Hotel Nelligan.", "Date": "August 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "NIwoman", "ReviewID": "UR18619173", "Content": "This is a lovely small and very personal hotel in an excellent location with great staff and lovely service.

Clean, spacious, exposed brick, deep stone windows, fireplace, superb king bed, turn down service, robes, thick towels and massive bathroom and double jacuzzi tub Breakfast --served in the amazing atrium--was continental, the pain au chocolat were yummy and the coffe and tea very nice. The nightly wine and cheese were a nice bonus, although the last two nights a little too loud because of a conference group at the hotel The hotel staf were old school throwbacks--we have only had this type of service in Washington DC--holding open doors, supplying umbrellas, quality information and an ever positive attitude We loved Old Montreal--recommend seeing Notre Dame, the walking tour---take the walking tour first, as it includes a return admission to Notre Dame. We rented bikes from Ca Roule--just around the corner---solid bikes and a great way to see Montreal. The Museum of Fine Arts has a nice Moderns collection as well Had dinner at Modavie(recommend for Jazz and quiet romance), Restaurant holder (decent food and good for a loud group) and Boris Bistro (have the duck risotto) We will return to the Nelligan", "Date": "July 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cHotel Nexcellent!\u201d", "Author": "Vivianite", "ReviewID": "UR17121311", "Content": "No doubt about it, this is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in.

The room my daughter and I shared was exceptionally large, beautifully appointed, and immaculate. I'm a sucker for exposed brick walls. They add warmth and a sense of history to interiors---and this is perfectly true at Hotel Nelligan., where the retro feel of the brick walls is balanced by top of the line electronics provided in each room. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, especially the concierge Jeanne LeFebvre, who took care of us with an enthusiasm and competence that were simply outstanding. Continental breakfast, free for guests, consists of delicious bread and pastries, yogurt, cheeses, hardboiled eggs, good coffee, a superb fruit melange, fruit juices, and more. Hot dishes may be ordered from the menu, at additional cost. Though the hotel's two main restaurants get really good reviews, the only other meal we had there was lunch at La Terrasse on the roof, overlooking the city. I had seared salmon salad on a bed of grilled, julienned vegetables---it was simple, fresh, and perfectly prepared. The wait staff and chef were very accommodating to our need to be served quickly so we could catch a taxi to the airport. I'm so happy to have stayed at the Hotel Nelligan.

There really wasn't anything to find fault at. Even the staff was very pleasant which sometimes can be an issue w/ English speakers in this predominantly French part of Canada. As a footnote Nelligan has two sister hotels in the area. Its sister property (Auberge du View Port) stayed there a few years back overlooks the waterfront. Also very nice more cozy than modern. The other sister hotel \"Place D'Armes\" located a little further out across the plaza from the very impressive Notre Dame Basilica. W'll try that next time. Its a historically old building and the closest to the Metro of the three. $17CAN gets you an unlimited 3 day tourist transportation pass. $35 gets you a taxi ride to or from the airport.

We loved Hotel Nelligan. We stayed for three nights last week and had a wonderful time. The welcome for our late night arrival was warm and very efficient. I've never had a faster check-in. Our room was beautiful with the exposed brick and warm decor. Soft music was playing, and chocolates and water were left for turndown service. We requested a room with two double beds (there were 3 of us), and I was very pleasantly surprised by the spaciousness of the room. I had imagined it would be cramped, but quite the contrary. The bathroom as well was very roomy. The mini-bar was very well stocked, with good quality beverages, reasonable prices, and as a prior reviewer noted, large bottles. There were lots of pillows for the beds, a beautiful full size desk, a mini-stereo, bathrobes, slippers, nice toiletries, a full size good quality blow-dryer, an ironing board, safe, and even an umbrella! I loved the bed and the warm fluffy duvet. As another reviewer mentioned, I was surprised how quiet the room was. It was often quite lively out on the street or in the hotel in the evening...our room overlooked the street and was on top of the hotel bar. But inside our room, it was completely quiet. Amazing. In the morning, I was happy to see the National Post - Canada's true national paper :) outside our door. There were some lesser papers downstairs! Breakfast was lovely. Fabulous coffee, muesli, all-bran, some other cereal, orange & grapefruit juice, plain yogourt, cottage cheese, gigantic bowl of fresh fruit, hard boiled eggs, mini muffins, croissants, bagels, and bread...all served in the cozy, elegant, spacious,and peaceful surroundings of the atrium. Such a beautiful and relaxing space. The front desk people were unfailingly helpful, giving us maps, directions, suggestions. We were going to visit the InfoTouriste office but found we had no need to. The hotel is an easy one block away from the basilica and three blocks away from the nearest metro station. A block in the other direction takes you to the water and the promenade, and all around you are the streets, shops, and restaurants of Old Montreal. Checkout again was effortless..with a 12 noon checkout time that we appreciated. We did not need to leave for the airport until 3:30, so the staff reserved a cab for us in advance, and held on to our bags for us. I have only two quibbles with the hotel. One is that there was no dressing table in the room. My 18 year old daughter was with us, and we both needed to beautify ourselves at the same time. One of us would be in the bathroom - where there was no vanity, just the elegant wooden shelves, already filled with towels and toiletries, so it was hard to make room for beauty products - we had to juggle them in our hands. In the main room, there was a large full-size mirror, but no spot to set anything down, so we had to hold the products in our hands. Very awkward, and there is a perfect spot for a slim dressing table between the mirror and the closet. The other quibble was with late night snacking. We came back to the hotel very late one night. Room service was already closed (I believe it's 11:30 all nights except Sunday, which is 10:30). This was a Saturday night, probably between 1 and 2 am. We asked at the front desk for a pizza place (we always like to try a local pizza!) and were given a place to try. We had trouble getting through - a busy night? We didn't really have any other suggestions or ideas. The depanneur down the street was already closed, and there was no vending machine, so we resorted to eating the $8.00 almonds and tiny $3.00 chocolate bars in the mini-bar. So, a suggestion to the hotel would be to install a very discreet, very elegant vending machine in an out-of-the way, even secret corner. Even the well-heeled traveler can get a late night attack of the munchies! Until that happens, I would advise other travelers to pick up their snacks ahead of time. There is a little depanneur just down the block, and a few little sandwich/deli/coffee places close by as well. Anyway, those are just little inconveniences. Overall, we had a wonderful time in Montreal, and Hotel Nelligan had much to contribute to the pleasure of our trip. We will definitely return again.", "Date": "April 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Nelligan\u201d", "Author": "45DegreesNorth", "ReviewID": "UR14287621", "Content": "Hotel Neligan is a stylish hotel with a lovely restaurant that has a good local following (I am local, I have been been there to drink and dine in the past). Why did I go there if I am local? To have a mini-getaway with my husband while my son went on a sleepover. It is right around the corner from where I work in Old Montreal. I saw on their website that they had an Experience Montreal special for $308: dinner for two at Verses (restaurant); a wine and cheese from 4-7; one night stay; exceptional continental dinner in the room; two robes and slippers. I went for it! The alcohol is not included in the meal but it was still a bargain. I upgrade by paying $25 more to have a superior room with fireplace and two person jacuzzi - it was worth it. I wanted to bring that jacuzzi home. I will TRY to make this quick: our greeting and check in was very efficient. The room was stylishly decorated, sort of Zen minimalism with mahogany and lush puffy beddings against the features of old Montreal buildings with exposed brick. The bathroom was wonderful with the jacuzzi and large shower. The amenities in the washroom included the usual soaps, etc. - all higher quality - but there was also an 'intimacy kit' with condoms, lubricant etc. for $7.00 and Oxia oxygen canister (just what do people get up to in there!) for around $17. The mini bar was impressively stocked with larger than usual bottles, complete with wine glasses and corkscrew (often have to request this in other hotels). Our view was over the roof of a nearby building and beyond that you could see the water but we could not see much with the falling snow - and we didn't care! We were comfy. There was a machine by the bed that took an ipod, and a very nice stereo system playing music as we came in. They have CDs downstairs that you can use. You will be impressed with the beddings and know that they offer the bedding at reasonable prices (obviously not the ones on your bed!!!) Our meal at Verses was lovely - found the confit on the foie apetizer gras a bit too sweet, but the tuna steak was nicely done. For desert I had the sorbert, hubby had the creme brule which he thought was perfect. The breakfast the next morning was wonderful, much more than the average continental breakfast. Basket of rolls and variety of breads, cheeses, boiled eggs, yogurt, fruit, coffee, juice, I am probably forgetting something, but it was pretty impressive. I could go on an on but I do not think you can go wrong with this hotel. It has a very stylish interior, lovel lobby with an atrium, everything about it is well thought out. From a style point of view it is very design oriented. One thought crossed my mind - someone might be looking at the location of this hotel and the fact that it is not facing the water (I know that when I am booking hotels just being one street off where I want to be sometimes seems like a big deal). This is located on St. Paul, which does not face the water but is a pretty street nonetheless and de la Commune (the street facing the water) is the next street. Don't be put off by that, you will be right around the corner. And they have a beautiful roof terrace open in the summer that you will have a lovely view from - we go there in the summer for lunch sometimes. They make an amazing Lychee martini.

The service was excellent--everyone at the front desk was extremely helpful answering questions, giving directions, making restaurant recommendations and reservations. The hotel is pleasantly decorated, though not particularly stylish. Our room, which was in the newer part of the hotel, was large, as was the bathroom, with a large tub and separate large shower. Everything was very clean, and the housekeeping service during the day was good--the room always looked perfect when we returned from our explorations. Evening turndown service was spotty--a couple of nights we got it and a couple of nights we didn't, but it wasn't such a huge deal. The room was also exceptionally quiet--other than an occasional door closing, we didn't hear another guest at any point when we were in the room. A couple of nights we could hear faint music of a night club, but nothing nearly obtrusive enough to bother us. Though we would have preferred hot options at breakfast, the continental breakfast (included in the price of the room) was quite nice. Excellent fresh muffins, nice bread (and a toaster if you wanted it toasted), fruit, cereal, cheese, hard-boiled eggs. Really very good for a cold continental. Coffee and tea were also very nice. The wine and cheese reception each evening pleasant as well. Our one complaint was that the bed was extremely uncomfortable. The mattress was overly firm (and I even like a firm mattress), and every time either of us moved there was a very noticeable \"squeaking\" sound--not springs or hinges--we couldn't figure out what was actually causing the noise but it seemed to be some combination of the linens and the mattress cover. Whatever it was, it was so loud that it woke us up numerous times during the night, and we are pretty heavy sleepers. The duvet was also extremely heavy--even when we turned the heat down very low we were still too hot during the night. And the pillows are luxuriously plump but so firm that we woke up with sore necks. All in all, we didn't get a good night's sleep the whole time we were there. As for the neighborhood, it was very quiet at the time of year we visited (February), which is perhaps to be expected because it caters mostly to tourists, and not many people visit during the frigid months. However, there are plentiful excellent restaurants within close walking distance. Our favorite in the neighborhood was Chez l'Epicier.

My best friend and I (female, early 30's) planned to spend 3 nights at the Nelligan, and ended up staying 4. Why, you might ask? Well, aside from the fact that the Montreal airport ended up being closed due to snow...we didn't want to leave! LOL We arrived from the airport via taxi (approximately 20 minutes, no traffic) and were immediately thrilled with the hotel's location and lobby. The front desk staff was tremendous -- actually, *all* of the staff were helpful, friendly, and tremendous! The staff can provide wonderful directions and recommendations for shopping, dining, etc. The Nelligan is in a great location. It's walkable to the nearest subway station, a few blocks away from the Notre Dame Basilica (a must-see, by the way!), and walkable to restaurants and quaint shops. Within a few blocks walk to the right (out of the hotel, I'm not sure of the east/west/north/south direction), we found many shops and restaurants. Also, to the \"left out of the hotel\" there are several shops. It's in a safe neighborhood, and in my opinion, ideal for either a couple of friends or a romantic get-away. We checked into our room, and immediately followed a staff recommendation for lunch, right down the street. We went to a little bistro, with friendly, funny waiters. I can't remember the name, but there was a deli counter (to buy meats/cheese and wine) and a tiny bathroom in the corner. The room had 2 double beds, and was comfortably appointed. The bathroom was well-stocked with nice complimentary toiletries (and contraceptives, for purchase). Most importantly, it was clean. There are 2 restaurants within the hotel, and you can get to both without going outside (key in December, mid-snow storm) one steak and the other was seafood/Italian. Both had good food and friendly service. They're both on the \"splurge\" side, but I've seen higher prices at hotels for a meal of far less quality. The breakfast that's included with the room is a good quality: toast/bagels, coffee, fruit, hard boiled eggs, cereals, and pastries. It's servec in the bar area. There is a really cool seating option, these little enclosed private booths. Check out their website; we were able to book a package that included accomodations, a CD, dinner for 2 at the in-house steak restaurant, and a museum/subway pass for less than the cost of a room for 3 nights! Other random information: - Hotel \"decorates\" in several places with pyramids of green apples. It took me 3 days to realize that they weren't plastic. LOL - There was no clock in my hotel room. Use your cell phone. - There was a CD player in the room - I was able to fit my laptop into the in-room safe (always good to know when traveling). - We ordered pizza one night, before we left. We were exhausted, didn't feel like steak or seafood...and just wanted to eat pizza. So, we got a recommendation for a pizza place for \"where the college kids order pizza\", ordered the pizza, and the bellman immediately brought plates with butter.

One of the nice little touches provided by the hotel is the mini-bar, which included actual sized bottles of wine and liquor - at incredibly affordable prices. After my stay in the penthouse, my traveling partners and I consumed both bottles of wine and several of the non-alcoholic beverages and much to our amazement, the charge was around $70. I thought for sure we would pay $50 per bottle of wine - not so. We later joked that the Nelligan is the cheapest place in Montreal to drink. There is also something to be said with regard to the lovely Old World Montreal neighborhood that the hotel is situated in.

The hotel is located in the old part of montreal, near cathedrals, art galleries and the like. Great area for strolling around. The Nelligan is all about style. It has a hip funky vibe that would appeal to well to do twenty and thirty somethings as well as some of the older set. It has an understated but somewhat high end boutique atmosphere. In other words, I wouldn't stay there if I was looking for a bargain hotel just to sleep and shower. I also did not see any children during our stay and I wouldn't think it to be suitable for a family trip. It is, however, the perfect spot for a romantic decadent weekend away for a couple. Much of the appeal is the elegance of the surroundings. We had a standard room with a king sized bed. The room had beautiful quality linens and furniture , a wellstocked bar and fridge, a nice sound system (that will be playing relaxing music when you arrive) and a stylish bathroom (soaker tub, beautiful sink and lighting). All of the accessories were in stylish stainless steel. The hotel had impecable service from all staff. Quick helpful front desk, fast vallet and great bar staff in thier adjoining cocktail bar and rooftop bar. The bar area is perfect for a few decadent martini's before you hit the town or retire for the night (be warned - high prices but with luxery brand names and obvious detailled prep work involved. The cucumber martini was surprisingly delicious and refreshing as was the watermelon mojito.) The rooftop bar had an awesome view and great ambiance. The bars appear to be moderately popular on weekends which do add to the noise factor if your room is facing the interior courtyard in which the bar is located (we didn't find it to be excessive). Food - Breakfast is included in the stay and is quite pleasant for a complimentary continental setup. Fresh pastries and breads, cheeses, boiled eggs, fruit salad and much more and excellent coffee. There are stainless steel trays of green apples everwhere for the taking at the Nelligan which add to the funky vibe of the place. There is also a complimentary wine and cheese social each night also included with the stay, which includes some excellent french cheeses and a decent glass of wine. We found staff happy to replace the cheese tray with fresh if you noticed it getting empty. We didn't try the restaurent service. Overall if you are interested in a hip yet classy place to explore Montreal from and cost is not an issue, you will love the Nelligan.", "Date": "October 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stamford, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cLove the Nelligan\u201d", "Author": "raftingman", "ReviewID": "UR10282237", "Content": "We stayed at the Nelligan twice, once in July 2005 and once in July 2006.

We overheard a business group talking in the bar area after their arrival at the hotel, and everyone in the group was commenting on how nice their room was regardless of location. The experience at the Nelligan is enhanced by a complimentary light breakfast buffet in the morning, and an evening glass of wine with cheese selections. Nothing too fancy, just a basic and a nice touch. There is also a rooftop bar, nice but small gym room, and an internet corner next to the front deck. The location is great, right in the middle of Old Montreal.

The room was huge, bed is extremely comforatable with lots of lighting options for those who read and those who don't, and there was a sizeable desk with a very good internet connection. It also had a great big lit closet with a safe. The bathroom was also big, with a double jaccuzi and glass shower. There was a single sink but a tall wood etagere next to it gave adequate shelf room for two. The continental breakfast was excellent in choice and quality, the wine reception a nice little perk. We were late one night to the wine reception (it ends at 7pm and we got there at 7:30) but we were graciously given our wine anyway. The concierge, Jeanne, was an instant friend and enhanced our stay with help almost daily. She drew directions on maps, recommended great restaurants, and generally made us feel welcomed at all times. The front door staff who retrieved our car multiple times were always good natured and prompt. The hotel seems under constant maintenance: there were often workers painting and fixing, but we were not inconvenienced. Everything in the rooms and the halls were kept clean and in perfect working order. A minor criticism: even though there are plenty of lights in the room and bathrooms, it sometimes felt dark. The high ceilings and brick walls probably contribute to that. The bathroom had a lighted makeup mirror that helped.

The bathroom was plenty big and had a large soaking tub, if that's your thing. Each day we returned to our room to light music from the stereo, replenished supply of bottled water and chocolates. Hungry? There are apples everywhere. Grab one (or two). If they were poisoned, we did not feel the ill effects. We did not dine at the hotel restaurant--looked nice, if not a bit pricey--but there was no shortage of places to eat nearby. A good deal of shopping and and siteseeing in the area too. What more can I say? We did not spend a great deal of time in the room as Montreal is a fabulous city that offers much to do day and night. I nicked the hotel one star simply because it is a little far from the nearest Metro station (thankfully, we did not visit in winter), and I thought it was a touch expensive--but this is true of much of Montreal (and not entirely Nelligan's fault as taxes are steep and the US Dollar is not as strong against CA Dollar as it used to be). We paid $190/night all in.

I based the decision on where to stay from the reviews I read on tripadvisor. The Hotel Nelligan had mostly rave reviews and we definetly wanted to stay in the Old Port section of Montreal. We booked for 4 nights with the plan that if we hated it, we could always switch hotels and go to one of the \"chain\" types in the newer downtown area. WE loved the Nelligan and will be going back. Yes it was pricey (we booked a King Loft Suite) but, we have stayed at some Country Inns that wore far more expensive but, not as nice. First of all the area is perfect, if you want to be in the old area of Montreal. Right near the Basilica, and the Port. Tons of restaurants and quaint cobblestone streets. The Hotel is on St Paul St. which is one of the oldest streets in Old Montreal. Lots of character and great historical architecture. It would be helpful if you have done some research about old Montreal and/or bring a book with you...not many book stores in the Old Port area. The hotel staff was very friendly. I had requested a room that faced St. Paul St. and was very glad I had because they truly were the best rooms. The street facing rooms can be a bit noisy if you leave your windows open. The streets are busy up until 1am. Cars and voices tend to echo from the cobblestone streets up through the stone buildings. Just close your windows at night! The rest of the hotel is very very quiet, in fact, I never heard anything in the halls or in adjacent rooms. I felt as though we were the only ones in the hotel even though it was totally booked. The bathroom was great. Absolutely the BEST shower I have EVER had in a hotel! The 2 person jacuzzi was great...a bit tight for me and hubby...maybe 32 yrs ago we would have fit better! The location of the toilet (probably not an issue if you're 90lbs) and the plastic toilet seat are my ONLY complaint....I can not for the life of me figure out why this hotel has gotten much negative feedback regarding their damn plastic toilet seats, yet the toilet seats remain! Had I been close to a hardware store, I would have been tempted to buy and install a better seat and invite the managment up to my room to try it out! The bed and linens were WONDERFUL, no doubt all their money goes into this area and not the toilet seats which makes sense in the long run! The continental breakfast was an 8 out of 10...not the best I've ever had but surely better than any chain hotel. The fruit was fresh, the food was continuously replenished and food was available till 1030 during the week and 1130 on the weekends. They also provided trays so you could take coffee and or food back to your room. They could have improved it by just offering a few different items. After 4 days I was pretty bored with the selections. We ate at Verses the hotel restaurant one night and even though the service was excellent as was the food, I found it rather stuffy, and overrated. The food was beautifully presented but, I thought it was VERY overpriced for what you got. Just a steak was around $32., and that was without a salad, a starch or veggie! Take a walk about 1/4 a mile down St. Paul St. and try The Keg...great filet mignon..we ate there twice! My husband talked me into a few \"tourist trap\" type activities, and I'm so glad he did. If you want to do the horse/carriage ride then go down near the port and ask for JayPee a female driver who was the nicest and most down to earth person ever and gave us SO much indepth info...she was worth every cent! l.

We stayed in the \"king loft\" and the rooms at the Nelligan are slightly smaller than those at the Place d'Armes, but they do have fireplaces and very nice bathrooms. I think that the family that owns these hotels have a good thing going here. They know what they are doing. Both of the hotels are fantastic and the most seasoned traveller should have no great complaints about either of them. The Place d'Armes has bigger rooms and is a bigger hotel (and what seemed to be a somewhat younger crowd). The Nelligan is better situated on St. Paul Street and has first rate service.

PROS: The rooms are very large, clean and well decorated. There is a lovely terrace bar on the top floor where you can have drinks and view the city. Try their clear sangria- delicious!! Continental breakfast is a choice of cereal, yogurt, cheeses, hard boiled eggs, breads and fresh baked pastries plus coffee, tea and juice. More than enough for getting you ready for the day. Jeanne, the concierge, is very knowledgable. (very minor) CONS: The complimentary evening wine and cheese was disappointing - fresh fruit disappeared within minutes with no refills and the cheese was replaced only after the board was completely bare and someone went to complain. Our room on the 4th floor was under the terrace and we were woken at 8am on Monday morning by the deep rumbling of tables and counters being set out for the terrace above us. Anne- Marie at the front desk was less knowledgeable - sent us to a non-existent gas station and to the worst bar for watching a football game.

The room was large enough to accommodate a sumptuous king-size bed with luxurious down comforter and pillows and still leave the space to move around without knocking down furniture. The bathroom was in the back of the room (not right at the entrance as it is typically in other hotels), and that made it feel more private, more like home. Let me now rave about the size of the bath tub for it was enormous and enormously comfortable: a real soaking tub to relax and rejuvenate. It called for some Provencal soaps and bath oils (sold in a smart little shop further down Rue Saint-Paul). The exposed brick wall added unexpected grace to this elegant abode. Artwork was tastefully understated. The only tiny little minus was that our room overlooked the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s narrow atrium and therefore received no day light or fresh air.

My girlfriend and I made a quick weekend trip into Montreal to visit relatives, and the Hotel Nelligan was the perfect place to stay. The location, of course, is great. Nestled on Rue de St. Paul -- apparently the oldest street in the city -- the Hotel is in the heart of Old Montreal and just a block away from the Notre Dame Cathedral. So there's plenty of boutique shopping (including art galleries and knick-knacks), cafes, and street entertainment (when the weather's good). The Hotel itself gives off a hip and modern aesthetic vibe, but it does not sacrifice comfort. We stayed in a King Atrium overlooking St. Paul street -- it was nicely sized and, most importantly, it had an INCREDIBLY COMFORTABLE BED (akin to the Heavenly beds at the Sheraton chain). The lobby, although not large, has an airy openness. Just past the front desk, the ceiling opens to an atrium that runs up the middle of the building. It's very relaxing to hang out there in the comfortable chairs while enjoying some coffee or wine. The lobby also flows freely into the Verses Bar, which in turn flows into the Verses Restaurant ... And that brings me to the best part -- the connection to Verses, which is highly rated and excellent. The bar serves great cocktails -- various kinds of martinis, mojitos, etc. (I have stopped in there on different trips even when I wasn't staying at the hotel). And the food is innovative and excellent as well. Even as my girlfriend and I were walking around Old Montreal, we kept gravitating back to the hotel for lunch (awesome angus burger) and then drinks. A final note: the service and incidentals were also top-notch. The employees are young, helpful, and speak English (without making you ashamed that you're not speaking French).

The theme of the hotel was literary, with quotes from the poet Emile Nelligan framed on the wall above the fireplace in our room. It was just the perfect tone and setting for a honeymoon and would be ideal if you are planning a romantic break in Montreal. The staff were always friendly and helpful and gave us some great recommendations on where to eat out in the city. The food at breakfast and was very healthy - mainly fruit, yoghurt and cheeses as well as differnt breads - which is a nice contrast to the usual egg and bacon breakfasts offered by mainstream hotels. It was all very fresh and the buffet was replenished regularly. Included in our room price was a complimentary glass of wine and plate of cheese, which you can have either on the roof terrace (another fantastic feature of the hotel!) or down in the hotel bar / library between 5 and 7pm.

One block from the water and museum. Short walking distance to all the old fort sites. Good shopping area and restaurants, too. Beautiful hotel with a center atrium in an old restored building. We were upgraded to a lovely suite with fireplace. Roof bar with views of the river. Free drinks in the evening and a hearty free breakfast.

The Nelligan embodies all the wonders of Montreal -- history, design, and a certain joie de vivre. The hotel is located in Vieux Montreal, the historic center. The area is heavily touristed, yet the Old World feel more than compensates for the sunburned, camera-clicking masses. Plus, the Nelligan is only four or five short blocks to the Place D'Armes station and the metro line will whisk you quickly to the neighborhoods in which Montrealers play (St. Denis, St. Laurent, the Village, Mile End, or Quartier Latin). Our room, I believe it was a superior king, was larger than a New York apartment and contained, in addition to the bed dressed in Frette linens, a pull-out sofa bed, large desk, and table for two. The bathroom, too, was large with a sculpted tub perfect for baths. Although the hotel consists of two historic buildings, you will not be without mod-cons -- ample lighting, high-speed internet access, CD player, and controllable central air conditioning. It's not the Ritz Carlton, but that's the reason to stay here. It's not stuffy or ostentatious. The staff was young, attractive, and -- contrary to what someone else posted -- extraordinarily service-oriented and friendly. There's a good, but slightly-more-expensive-than-it-should-be restaurant downstairs called Versus and, on the rooftop, a terrace with both a city and river view that attracts the suits, hipsters, and tourists alike. I have only three minor caveats: The toiletries were not replenished every day and the water pressure was low. Of course, the flip side of this is that conservation is the rule. Also, someone mentioned that the sanitation trucks may wake you in the morning. It's true; however, they didn't arrive until after 8:00 a.m.. It wasn't bad until they dumped the recycling bin with all the glass bottles. At least, I can take solace in the fact that they do recycle.
