And the price was the best value that we found in Playa by far at $450 pesos for a double without AC, $550 pesos for a double with AC. Since we were there in early March, AC wasn't needed although that would probably be an issue during the summer. That compares with others a minimum of $400 with AC. Furthermore, the nights that we stayed were quiet and there was no problem with noise even during a holiday. The hotel is four blocks from the beach and close to the nightlife. Just remember that at these prices, don't expect a continental breakfast or shampoo. On the other hand, the owner has spared no expense to make this hotel into a hanging garden in the midst of an otherwise rundown neighborhood. The rooms are well kept and the bathrooms functioned excellently. The hotel is cleaned thoroughly every morning. There is a cozy swimming pool and fountains everywhere. There are only three small critiques I want to make. First, the Internet connection was only available in the common areas and was a bit week although they will work well overall so long as your PC has adequate battery power.. The second is that the most room plugs are not designed with grounds. However, ask the thoughtful manager and she will provide you with an extension adapter at no extra charge. Finally, they only provide you two towels. In order to have more, however, all you need do is ask.", "Date": "March 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "vancouver", "Title": "\u201coff the beaten track and quiet\u201d", "Author": "africanomore", "ReviewID": "UR96660743", "Content": "It's my 2nd time staying at this hotel in a year. What I like the most about it is that it's just a few blocks from everything but not in the heart of it, so it's nice & quiet. The rooms are built around a large courtyard with lots of greenery, a few parakeets (caged) and a couple fountains. This gives it a nice, calm, \"oasis in the city\" feel. The only caveat is that because the rooms all face this communal space, if people are partying on one of the room's balconies, you will hear it. And balconies are shared between 2 rooms, which I imagine could be a problem but never has been for me.The rooms are basic (no fridge), but clean and spacious. Lighting is poor, but not really an issue. Don't expect to watch anything on TV other than static. The staff are pretty helpful & friendly too. It was about 40$ a night.", "Date": "February 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cA quiet and charming hotel in a great location.\u201d", "Author": "Hbois", "ReviewID": "UR92737478", "Content": "We stayed there 5 nights.
