The hotel had a breakfast area with waffles and ingredients for egg sandwiches, cereal, fresh fruit, bagels, and pastries.

All of the staff was helpful and friendly, giving answers about the sights and how to get to them.

Breakfast was sufficient, and I'm excited to hear that Choice Hotels is upgrading their free breakfast in July 2012, so it'll be even better. My only issue was parking...just not enough. Their lot is small, and if I'm paying $15/day, I want a guaranteed spot. Luckily, I was able to snag one every time I returned to the hotel.

We had previously stayed at the Holiday Inn Express next door so we were familiar with the location. The hotel is easy enough to get to, and is close to many things, although I'm not sure you would want to walk to any of them. Power Plant might be the one exception, but if you were coming back late I'm not sure about that one. We made it to the hotel early in the afternoon so we could head to dinner prior to the ballgame, and before leaving I asked for advise on taking a cab, or parking near the stadium since no shuttle is available (The Holiday Inn offers a shuttle to the Harbor, and Stadium). And while the girls at the desk were nice, they were unable to help. They also could not guarantee that a parking space that I paid for ($15) would be available when I returned. The room was very nice, but breakfast only being available from 6-9 seemed a little odd, and our floor became very noisy at 8am. We could hear the arrival and departure of the elevator, along with music in another room, girls in the hallway, and the cleaners. I understand some people like to get up and out early, but as we were only returning home it would have been nice to relax with some peace and quiet. That being said, I never did have a problem parking, and the staff was friendly. You will have to drive or take a cab everywhere, but if I could get a similar rate I would likely stay here again.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clearwater, Florida", "Title": "\u201cA Pleasant Stay\u201d", "Author": "pkbw59", "ReviewID": "UR127526554", "Content": "My family was in Baltimore for a dance competition at the Inner Harbor Marriott, and I chose the Sleep Inn based on reviews on TripAdvisor. It offered the best combination of lowest price, close proximity to the competition, and most positive reviews. Traveling with two other families, we all arrived by taxi from the airport prior to the check in time, and having requested early check in, we were at first told there were no rooms ready. I had also modified my booking (through booking.com) weeks before arrival with no apparent problem, but found on checking in that the modification had resulted in a duplicate reservation, at a higher rate than originally booked, and this caused confusion and delay. Mr. Bassiouni repeatedly asked me if I was parking a car (a $15 charge per day) and I said no each time. I had called 4 days before arrival to check on my reservation, and request that all the families in our group could be put on the same floor. This seemed to be a problem too, but ultimately it was worked out. My family's room was quite small compared to the others I saw, but adequate for our needs. It was quiet and clean although there were quite a few spots on the carpet. We did hear neighboring guests some of the time, but mostly it was very quiet. My bed was a bit saggy in the middle and the pillows were very lumpy. I particularly didn't like the bed linens...they were the crispy kind that make a crunchy noise whenever you move. The pillow was like sleeping on a bag of potato chips...I tried all four on my bed and they were all the same, and were rather small too. So I didn't sleep as well as I had hoped, but my other family members did, so not everyone would be bothered by the sheets and pillows. The free breakfast is standard at all the Sleep Inns, not exciting but plenty to fill you up. The breakfast attendant is a nice gentleman and interacts cheerfully with everyone. We were able to walk to the Inner Harbor, although we took taxis when going to the competition. I would not recommend walking around the area after dark. The waterfront is busy and touristy, but the farther away you go the more it's like any big city. There is a church just down the street from the hotel where homeless people gather. They didn't bother us but it can feel a bit insecure to travelers. There is a free Circulator bus that stops very close by that may be helpful for getting around but it doesn't go all the way to the waterfront. The connecting routes are a bit inconvenient, I thought. We also went to Washington D.C. by Amtrak from Penn Station, which is not far, but you would not want to walk there either. The taxi drivers are a bit crazy and everyone drives way over the speed limit, police included. We heard lots of sirens in the city when out and about. The hotel has an affiliated limo service that happened to be there one day, and the driver offered to take us to Penn Station for the same cost as the taxi had the day before. It was a much nicer way to travel! We also used the limo to go to the airport for $35 and it was wonderful. If you ask the hotel can give you his contact information. It's much less than renting a car, and parking is very expensive in the city. Upon check out we found that we had been charged for parking each day, but Mr. Cunningham removed it and was very helpful and pleasant. If we return to Baltimore we would most likely stay at the Sleep Inn again.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orleans, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cHuge, Cavernous, I mean Cavernous Room.

Rejected one place for being really pricy with mixed reviews. Found this. In an old refurbished building, with very, very high ceilings. Not a nice part of town, in spite of proximity to the harbor: street persons asleep on benches virtually outside of the hotel at night. Not threatening, just unsettling when panhandled, which happened to us twice. BUT, the hotel itself was an island of safety: enclosed parking, very attentive staff. Very modern. Dog floor was on floor one. Our room was, as we requested, close to a back (keyed) entrance. Room was as high to ceilings as it was big in other dimensions (also big.) However, when we came in, there was: (1.) a large modern King bed; (2.) a large 30 something inch flat screen HDTV attached to the wall; (3.) one desk chair; in front of (4.) one relatively small desk. That was it. To the right of the bed as one faced that wall was perhaps 130 Ft. squared of nothing except bare carpeted floor. Exec. king, but no refrigerator. etc. I walked to the front desk and asked Glenn (who should get a medal) for a fridge and another chair. No problem, he said. Both came almost immediately -- the fridge from ? and the chair wheeled in from -- yes -- the lobby! Still felt like living in a (VERY) spacious tomb, but it was a bit better. The wife -- who likes things stark and uncluttered -- loved it. The dogs did not care: both small, they get to sleep on the big comfortable King bed anyway. I felt like something out of a sci-fi movie in which my soul was being sucked away by very clean blacks, grays, whites, and nothing. So why did this a \"very good\" rating? Because it was very VERY clean -- sterile. Because the desk service was spectacularly helpful -- thank you, Glenn.

Water pressure was excellent though. As I said, the room was very large. The layout of furniture was odd due to this. The TV was not close enough to the beda for great viewing. No sofa as an alternative though one could have fit. The beds were comfy but the walls were a little thin. We could hear the TV and guests next door easily. The breakfast looked nice - the standard continental with waffles and some hot items. The staff were excellent and very helpful in every way. However, on the day we were to arrive, I tried to call the Front Desk and could not get anyone to answer. I called the national reservations like and they could not contact the hotel either. When I checked in, the Front Desk was unaware that there was any phone problem. Odd again . . . Be aware that you need to pay for parking. The lot was right next to the hotel. For some strange reason, they had very loud music piped outside the entrance. Not sure why but it was annoying. The rate for this hotel easily beat other similar hotels in the area.

Perfect location, only a few blocks from the inner harbor, and very well priced! We waited until the last minute (wanted to check in Sept 10, we bought the hotel Sept 10 in the early morning...) and we had had our sights on the Fairfield Inn but their prices went up to $179 a room. While it may have been nicer there, we got a king size bedroom at the Sleep Inn for $90 the day of check-in! You can't beat that! When we arrived we had no problem finding a parking spot (their spots are a little narrow if you have a bigger car, but we managed) and check in was a breeze. I didn't catch her name, but the woman at the desk was super nice. Our room was on the 2nd floor and it was super cute! I loved the colors (green and white walls, dark brown furniture). It gave the room a very earthy feel. It was a little stuffy when we first got in the room but we cranked up the air conditioning and it was soon very comfortable. Some pros and cons of the hotel Pros: - Great price and great location! The harbor was only a few blocks and we always felt safe. - Super friendly and helpful staff - Parking in their lot was only $15 a night, or there were spots right across the street. This is pretty cheap from other hotels we were seeing. They were super nice too - the next morning we checked out at 10am but they told us we could park there until around 3 or 4 when we came back from the aquarium and it wouldn't be a problem. - Awesome water pressure! And it was one of the only hotels I've stayed at where the floor doesn't get completely soaked after you take a shower... :) - Free continental breakfast! Nothing fancy but it was nice not to have to worry about finding something to eat early in the morning. It's only running until 9am though, so do you do need to wake yourself up in time. Cons: - Short of calling their customer support number, we couldn't get the free wireless internet to work. We tried on our iPhones, our iPad, and our laptop, tried various browsers... nothing! And my fiance is a computer technician, so he tried a million different things but ultimately he gave up. We could see the wireless network but couldn't get it to work =( - We are heavy sleepers so it didn't bother us so much, but like a few other reviews mentioned, the walls are kind of thin in comparison to other places. A few drunk guests came home around 1:30am (we went to bed around 10 because we are lame) but you could hear them perfectly when they were in the hallway (of course, they were also not trying to be quiet!) From our 2nd floor room you could also hear the music playing in the 1st floor lobby if you really strained to listen (it was very faint, but there). But it wasn't horrible by any means. Overall we really enjoyed our stay there and would definitly go back again!

So my expectations were not very high after that. However, everything turned out fine and we were able to get rooms right next to each other once we checked in.

My troubles with this hotel began right away with them promising me things for reserving a block of rooms for my guests and not following through, additionally, many guests had trouble booking rooms due to staff incompetence. In spite of the many problems I had before staying at this hotel, the staff assured me that me and my guests would have a good stay. Sadly, that was far from what we experienced. The hotel is very loud, anytime a door shuts on the same floor or anyone has a tv or music on, you can hear it in your room; none of the shower curtains were long enough to block water from going all over the floors; the parking lot is small and parking is not guaranteed, yet they do not tell you that you will be charged for parking even if you can't find a spot; some guests experienced parts of their rooms falling apart (light fixtures fell from the ceiling); some guests were woken at 12:30 AM to move their cars when they were parked legally in the small lot because cars were blocked in; and multiple guests reserved baby cribs/cots and were told they'd receive them having booked them early but were not given them when they checked in--yet, for some reason, there was a cot available in the room that my husband and I stayed in on our wedding night (I'm not sure who was supposed to be sleeping in that cot or why it was even there...). Yet, the biggest problem I had with the hotel was the attitude I was given at 6:00 AM the morning of my wedding day by a hotel staff member. I was attempting to pay for a parking spot for the hair & make-up women who we hired to help me and my bridesmaids get ready. This staff member had me stand there waiting about 5 minutes after asking to pay for a parking pass, then harassed me about why I had a free room (because it was my WEDDING DAY!), and did not resolve the situation and was exceptionally rude to me, so I paid for street parking instead. I did not have problems with any other staff members throughout my stay (despite numerous previous problems during the planning process) and some staff did respond to the problems we had when friends of mine described the problem I had with the morning staff member. Overall, I urge this staff to take more consideration in what they promise guests and to remember that customer service is probably one of the main things guests will remember. That said, staff at this hotel may want to refrain from using the words \"My pleasure\" after every interaction with a guest, because when a guest has problems with the staff/accommodations/anything, and the staff just repeatedly say \"My pleasure\" it comes off as rude, disrespectful, and completely not genuine. I do not recommend this hotel and I feel terrible for my wedding guests who stayed there and faced problems (which was most of them).

Some were laying down, and appeared to be sleeping in the grass across the street from the hotel.

We like to see places before we send clients to them. This is the 3rd review I've every made on a hotel and it is the first negative one. The hotel is decent - modern and clean with usual Sleep Inn amenities like a decent breakfast. I am not at all picky and look for good value. It is a moderate walk to the Inner Harbor and that walk is fairly safe. However, I spent a rather busy morning working from my room (ok wi fi with your laptop), went to the inner harbor for lunch and came back to rest prior to going out for the evening. There was no rest to be had on the 2nd floor. Several rooms had their doors open and were partying hardy carrying drinks thru the halls and almost screaming at each other. I would have expected security to pick this behavior up and try to contain it (it is a smallish hotel). That did not happen. Went out for the evening and returned at about 1 am and got 1 hour sleep before all hell broke loose in the adjacent (several) rooms and corridor. I know this is the Preakness wkend, but that is no excuse for a hotel openly letting thier property become an all night party for yahoos. We were awaken about 2:30 am with the same nonesense going on. I got dressed, went out to see what was happening and found several rooms with loud parties or arguments going on. Don't really know if these were Preakness folk or not but it was really loud. Went down to the front desk to see if they could do something, but quickly realized that the front desk person was involved with the revelers as was the security guard. I felt that if I said anything I might actually put myself in danger. I must say that the early evening front desk person was very nice, but the night person is a blooming idiot and party person that can not be approached (unless you are one of the chicks from the party crowd). I'm obviously still not asleep at 3:30am and annoyed enough not to sleep much tonight. I have stayed at many Sleep Inns and never had an experience like this. Definitely never again here, nor any of my clients. I cannot believe the good ratings this hotel has received. Giving the benefit of the doubt, I will try to say it was bad timing, but it is sufficient to turn me off to this property. I will suggest to you and my clients, the Fairfield Inn (closer to the Inner Harbor) or even Pier 5, where you can almost equivalent rates if you look carefully (less the breakfast).

The hotel is located right next to the beginning of Interstate 83. It is a little hard to find the first time, driving up. The easiest way coming from the Inner Harbor area on Gay Street was to turn right _immediately_ after passing under Interstate 83. One can also take the last possible right turn after taking the 83 North on-ramp from S President. The hotel sign is a small purple and white sign near the top of the 4 story red brick building. There is a sign at ground level that is hard to see from either approach until you are right there. There is a large lot right next to the hotel that filled up Saturday night but was easy to park in on Thursday when we arrived. Our booking was pre-paid via Hotels.com and included parking but there is a sign posted about a $15/day fee. Check-in is painless. The lobby is contemporary with a striking green, white and wood design and very high ceilings. The elevator lobby has one wall of bare cement that gave it a very interesting accent. The elevator itself is very slow but there is plenty of room for luggage. The room had two queen beds with good linens and comforter. Between beds there is a nightstand with two lamps and a clock. There were 4 feather pillows per bed. Above each headboard were two framed pictures of outdoor scenes (See photo). There is a desk with flat screen TV mounted above and a single desk chair. There is a lot of floor space because there is no other furniture. Ceilings are 10 feet high even in the bathroom. Carpet is a no nonsense commercial grade. The bathroom in our room had a walk in shower and no bath. If you don't need a bathtub, it is quite nice. Hot water was available very quickly, but the control did not have very fine control, so some care is needed to get the temperature right. We heard a couple fighting out in the hallway one night, but we would have heard them in any other hotel I've ever been in. Otherwise, the nights were quiet with very few sounds entering from outside. Street noises could be heard only if the window was open. The black out curtain was very effective keeping out sunlight. Wireless internet was free and simple to start, and the service was consistently fast even with a full hotel. It's unsecured, so I ran my VPN, and had no problems. There is no safe for laptops. Breakfast is OK with omelets one morning as a hot item otherwise, there is instant oatmeal and cook-it-yourself waffles, cold hard-boiled eggs, toast, bagels and cereals, juices, mild and coffee. The breakfast area to the side of the lobby is bright with 4 tables and one long bar. Oddly, there was only one trash receptacle. It is about a 10-15 minute walk to the Aquarium at the Inner Harbor and about 30 minutes to the convention center, so the hotel is pretty conveniently placed. No view, nothing luxurious about the place but with the price we paid, this was a great bargain. I suppose a professional rating service would give it a 3 out of 5 rating because of lack of restaurant, room-service etc, but it's definitely at the head of the line for budget hotels.

My husband and I were going to be in Baltimore for several days of testing at Johns Hopkins Medical Center. After calling several of the hotels on the Johns Hopkins preferred hotel list we chose the Sleep Inn Inner Harbor. There were several things that factored into our choice, one being the close proximity to the hospital and the other being that they offered shuttle service to and from the hospital throughout the day but the main reason we chose the Sleep Inn was the hotel manager Abraham. From our first phone call Abraham bent over backward to accommodate our every need. Even when inclement weather forced us to move up our travel date at the last minute he simply said \"no problem\" and had our room ready and waiting when we arrived a few hours later. He's always out front, never hiding in the office and wants to know everything about your experience and how he can make the hotel a better place for future guests. He's truly is an Innkeeper, the likes of which you just don't find much anymore, especially at a discount chain hotel. From start to finish this property did not disappoint. The hotel has the fresh appeal of a boutique hotel. Beautiful lobby and large spacious guest rooms with comfortable bedding make your stay feel more like a night at a luxury hotel for a third of the price. The shower was always hot and the water pressure amazing. The bathrooms are up to date with granite countertops and great lighting with more than enough room to move around without feeling cramped. It was a great place to come home to at the end of a long day at the hospital. The high speed internet was also one of the fastest I've encountered in a hotel. Totally free and lightning fast -- it will impress. So, if you're a business traveler who needs to work from your room or a social networker catching up on the latest status updates you won't be disappointed. I can't rave enough about the staff. Friendly and helpful doesn't even scratch the surface they truly bent over backward to make sure that we had everything we needed including a replacement fridge long after the maintenance staff should have gone home. No request was too trivial or too outlandish and they were always there with a smile no matter what.

The location is great if you want to be in the Inner Harbor and take advantage off Baltimore's best restaurants, bars, attractions and nightlife. Whenever we come back to Baltimore, this is the only hotel we will stay at. It is one of the reasons our trip to Baltimore was so memorable.", "Date": "January 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Bang for your Buck!\u201d", "Author": "dsmooth84", "ReviewID": "UR94270363", "Content": "I stayed at this Sleep Inn for business in late December.
