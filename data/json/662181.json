Well presented hotel. The pool is obviously still being worked on however there is a nice seating area around it. Rooms are very small and air conditioning doesn't really make much difference to the temperature. Walls are quite thin and we could hear the people in the next room talking until quite late which was a little annoying as we had to be up early to get our flight. Also no shower curtain in bathroom so everything gets quite wet!! Staff were kind and helpful. Did not really see much of the surrounding area but it is mainly residential.

Although we felt safe in the area the hotel is located it wasnt the nicest - although comparing to the centre of Rome, nothing seems to be that nice! Had some nice cafes etc nearby, which meant we could walk around the corner for some breakfast (pastries!), although shame the hotel doesnt offer this as would make things easier and better value for money. Didn't use the swimming as ran out of time so cannot comment on it, although looked clean, but felt cold. The guy running things (the owner) is friendly and speaks good english although the night guy wasn't as good at English and couldnt help over the phone on the first night when we got lost on the first night and for some reason couldn't find our way back to the hotel (our fault though, it's really not difficult to find!)", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201cIt's a very good hotel 15 minutes from the center by metro\u201d", "Author": "gianoulix", "ReviewID": "UR81389388", "Content": "When we arrived there was a men who when he understand that we were from Greece he speak Greek and it was so hostable !!!

Fairly difficult to find but if you follow the instructions on one of the reviews further down, you'll find it. When we first arrived, the hotel 'staff' (an old man and young man and people hanging around most of the time) were fairly hostile. The pool was DISGUSTING. The fridge wasn't plugged in... plugged it in and it didnt work. Then we woke up the next day to drilling and building work going on. I really wanted to leave. However, the following day (we stayed there for 6 nights for our whole Rome stay), the pool had all been cleaned and filled (which was what the work was for), and the old man downstairs was very kind and friendly. The younger man isn't helpful but he was there overnight so didn't really need to speak to him! Very quiet area and away from tourist places (good at night and to get away, but difficult as no one speaks english). Room was very clean and free air-conditioning. No breakfast or option to have breakfast either. Very easy to get to centre of Rome and to find all the sights. Metro is extremely easy to use (16 euros each for a week ticket - very good value). I suggest that you get a guidebook as me and my partner did, which was very helpful to find the sights on the map and to tell a bit about them. Sights to see: Vatican City (we got a tour which was extremely worth it... skipped 2 hours of queuing and was told lots about it = 40 euros each). Colloseum (not really worth the tour - can look around yourself - 15 euros to get in). Next to Colloseum, Foro Romano, which are some amazing ruins. We didn't go on a tour but might be worth finding out about the history... 12 euros, or half price if you have a student card and/or passport to prove your between 16 and 25. Definitely take your student card with you, if you are student. Will save on sights!! The Fontana Di Trevi (Trevi Fountain) is incredible, and this is where the most restaurants and nightlife is for evening. Emanuelle Monument is unbelievable, soooo huge! Make the most of it everyday... go out and explore at night around by the Fountain, etc. Hope this was helpful.

Our opinion is that this is a viable tourist hotel if you understand what you are buying. This hotel is very much a European style hotel, and if you are looking for an American \"holiday inn\" hotel you should be prepared to pay much more in Rome. My thoughts are as follows... Good: The hotel is very stylish. Our party had two rooms, and while decorated differently, both were very modern looking. The pool area, while small, creates a very comfortable environment. Bad: The rooms are tiny. Of course, no more so than most european hotel rooms. Each room had about 4 feet around the (excellent) bed on each side. Good: The location is great, less than a block from the metro line. The hotel is down a short driveway, behind another building, so traffic noise was minimal. Bad: Very idiosyncratic rooms. One room had a tub/shower, but no shower curtain. One had a tiny shower, no bath. One room had no toilet seat. One room's air conditioning went out when the key was removed, the other room's air stayed on. Nothing major, it just gives the impression that a family put the rooms together without a lot of expertise. Good: The neighborhood is great! Dozens of small restaurants, coffee shops, and pizza joints. There are two small groceries within a block. Again, I was worried about this based upon a previous review, but we enjoyed the people and the shops of the neighborhood. No other tourists, so we became known to the locals in the coffee shop, and were greeted on the street by several people we came to know. Bad: The plumbing leaves something to be desired. Plenty of hot water, and good pressure. There is some problem with the toilet siphons, however. When coming back to the rooms there was a faint but noticeable whiff of sewer gas. Good: Staff. Spoke enough english for us to get by, and taught us some Italian. Enjoyed talking to them in the evening. Also, the hotel allowed us to store our bags in the lobby all day before departure. Bad: No cable or sat TV, and we only had 2 or 3over the air TV stations. This is a shame, because I enjoy learning about a country through their news and TV. Good: Quiet rooms. This may be because the other guest were doing as we did, and falling asleep within a couple hours of returning to the room, but we were never bothered by hotel noise. We did meet other guests outside, so I know the hotel was not empty. So- if all you need is a basic room with convenient access to the tourist sites, this hotel will meet your needs. If you want a large room, a big pool, or a resort style experience you will be very disappointed. I'm giving this hotel a relatively high score, based upon our limited requirements. PS: To find the hotel from the metro, walk east (away from the bridge) about one block. Hotel is directly across from the eastern corner of a church. Look for a black metal fence and a drive-way descending down a hill on the right (south) side of the street. The number 892 is on the fence. The hotel entrance is 50 feet down the drive on the right.", "Date": "September 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cOnly average, has alot of work to do\u201d", "Author": "H0tel_Review", "ReviewID": "UR8434362", "Content": "The only good things about this hotel were the air conditioning and the decor of the room was very modern.
