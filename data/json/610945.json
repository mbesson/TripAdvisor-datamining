We started out in Venice, where our hotel was a 45 minute bus ride into the city. We then traveled to Florence. When we arrived in Florence and attempted to figure out how to get to our hotel, a gentleman at hotel reservations informed us it would be yet another LONG trek back and forth. We decided against staying at the hotel we booked, (hotel lido in case anyone is thinking of booking there, is very very far from the city) and we decided to see if we could reserve a room somewhere closer. As we approached hotel reservations again a different man handed us a brochure and began telling us about his little family run hotel, the hotel aldobrandini. He told us the cost as well as showed us some pictures and offered to show us the room and if we didn't like it, we didn't need to stay there. He simply wanted to offer it to us. We had also booked one night at the Grand Hotel Baglioni, which was about a block away from this hotel and when he heard that he couldn't believe we would want to stay at his one star hotel because baglioni was 4 stars. We stayed at this wonderful little hotel and it was probably one of our better experiences..simply because of this wonderful man. The room was simple, with a larger bathroom than most european hotels. there was one review that said the fan didn't work and that the cleanliness was an issue. First of all, we stayed in 2 different rooms at this hotel and there was no fan at all, and the rooms were always cleaned well. yes we slept with the window open one night and yes we got bitten by some misquitos, but you can't really blame the hotel for the bugs getting in. There is a spiral staircase from the check in area to the upper rooms so I would agree that if you have leg/foot/mobility problems you should avoid this hotel. Overall we had an excellent stay and found his little one star to be far better and more comfortable than the grand hotel baglioni which had beds that felt like plywood and more bugs with the window closed! I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is just looking for something simple and friendly with a wonderful atmosphere.", "Date": "Apr 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR656616656", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "claire1524"}, {"Content": "Great stay at Hotel Aldobrandini in Florence On a trip to Italy in October 2007, we stayed in a fantastic hotel in Florence called Hotel Aldobrandini, (degli Aldobrandini 8, tel. [--]. www.hotelaldobrandini.it.) It was listed in the Rick Steves guide for 2007, but omitted in the 2008 edition--not sure why. Located near the Medici Chapels and San Lorenzo Market, we found the location very convenient. The amenities of the hotel are average--small but clean rooms, very quiet. The gem of this hotel is the hotel day manager, Ignazio. He is a delight! He was very welcoming when we arrived, and recommended to us an excellent restaurant very near the hotel (Palle d'Oro, 43-45 Via Sant'Antonino), where we enjoyed the best meals of our trip! Then, then next morning, Ignazio was in the breakfast area, cheerfully delivering our cappucinos during the hotel's streamlined but pleasant complimentary breakfast. Two caveats to this hotel--the street noise is noticeable, and the hotel's super narrow spiral staircase. If you have any issues with stairs or cannot carry your own luggage, ask in advance for a room on the ground floor.", "Date": "Apr 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR787160568", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Oak_Hill_traveler"}, {"Content": "A disappointing accommodation in Florence Our three week holiday in Italy was great except for our short stay in the Aldobrandini Hotel in Florence. Problems we encountered were a rude female receptionist, a humid noisy room with bugs, an ineffective fan, poor cleaning of the room and a lack of toilet paper and soap. When we complained to the manager, he only made excuses and said over and over again that he was sorry. For 70 euros a night, we could have done better.

The hotel is rather basic and the lift was out of order when we arrived so we had to take our luggage up 3 flights of stairs. The young receptionist was polite and courteous despite the late hour. The room was small but very clean and the breakfast is simple but we found it satisfying for the price and the category of this establishment. Also there was a lot of noise during the night from the street outside. We really appreciated the smile and warmth of the owner who served us breakfast. This consisted of a couple of croissants and buns which were fresh and some butter/jam. The coffee and tea came from a dispensing machine and had a queer taste. Overall, I would stay here again since it is central and a port in a storm if you arrive late at night and don't feel like dragging your suitcases about in Florence. However, I don't recommend it for those suffering from claustrophobia (hardly room to swing a cat!) or those who are fussy on the quality of breakfast.", "Date": "Jun 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR256444783", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "jojo589"}, {"Content": "Great location...clean...inexpensive My daughter and I stayed here in March.
