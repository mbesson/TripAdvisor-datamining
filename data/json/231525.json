Took the RENFE train from the airport to passage de gracia station, then metro to Liceu which is only about 5 mins walk from the hotel.

Our room was on the top floor in a corner location: these room have the double sinks and seem to be a bit larger: but the down side of this room was that the only windows were skylights, fixed closed and with opaque glass, and a low level small window about the size and position of a radiator.The room was therefore hot, stuffy and claustrophobic. Our airconditioning did however (thankfully), work. The room was spotlessly clean, and only problem was the shower that went on a cycle of very hot, freezing cold and for a short time just right! We did ask if anything could be done about it....but apparently not. Breakfast is very nice: cooked and cold buffet. Look out for B&B deals when booking. A safe is avaiable, and also luggage can be left secure if needed. All these things makes the stay easier. The location is very enjoyable: near Las Ramblas, the metro, numerous eateries, and within walking distance of the port. Generally we felt safe, however don't be lulled into a false sense of security....one guest had all valuables taken from his rucksack whilst out and about. We had an attempted mugging/pick pocketing in the street outside the hotel, but managed to foil the attempt.

This hotel is in a great location. The room at the hotel was average/small. The shower was literally half a tub, tightly fitted between the toilet and bidet, which made it a bit tricky to get in and out of-and I'm young and athletic. I would have loved to have a balcony... I asked everyday for a balcony, and worked around their random schedules to able them to tap into their computer system to reserve one i.e. 4:40am. I was told then to come back at 12pm after the occupied room's checkout for a balcony. Of course, I return at 12 to be disappointed. The front desk was disorganized and unprofessional since my reservation for the balcony was not honored. It was a waste of my time. Furthermore, I heard this is normal at the H10 hotel from the front desk manager. That many people do not get the rooms they reserved and get turned away at the desk. Which defeats the purpose of a reservation. I rather have not gotten a room and gotten a refund because I stayed down the street at Grand Central Hotel for the latter half of my vacation and it was so much nicer, bigger, with a stunning rooftop pool overlooking the city. I would not recommend this hotel for my business colleagues or really anyone for that matter when I realized how many nicer hotels there are in the same area- that I'm sure can afford to provide a balcony for at least one day of the trip during a two week stay, especially when reserved non-the-less. Most of the highly starred reviews on this hotel had a balcony, it really makes or breaks a trip especially when you are crammed in a tiny room it provides a separate area. So I guess you can try your luck and you might have a different impression. Needless to say I wasn't satisfied with the hotels performance other than the maid service which was fantastic. Also just a fyi- the beds are hard and two people is a full size, there is no alarm clock, no ipod dock, no full size mirror, and the blow dryer barely works.

Highly Recommended\u201d", "Author": "Hoodlum_the_CD", "ReviewID": "UR115987298", "Content": "This was a perfect hotel for our trip to Barcelona, the first stop in our tour of Spain. I was traveling with my wife and three children (aged 10, 12, and 14) and our family friends, a couple with two children (aged 12 and 14). When I travel for work I typically stay in Marriott's, JW Marriott's, Hilton's, Intercontinentals, etc. While the rooms here are predictably smaller given the historic location, I would take this hotel over any of those chains. I would not have traded it for the W or any of the luxury high-rise hotels in Barcelona. The hotel was a 27 Euro cab ride from the airport. We noticed that some cab drivers did not realize you could drive down what look like pedestrian streets to drop you off... so you need to let them know it is ok to do so. It is located right off Las Ramblas in the Barri Gottic. There are plenty of tourists around, as there always are when an area is visually interesting, but do not let that stop you. There are lots of interesting shops (not just tourist shops) and restaurants within walking distance. We spent a great deal of time just hanging out at the Bar del Pi just down the street. I do not honestly see how anyone could complain abou this hotel. The lobby and common areas are very well maintained, the staff was enormously friendly and all spoke perfect English, and the rooms were clean and well appointed. There was an incredible little courtyard area for which pictures cannot do justice, and we spent afternoons there drinking the coffee or cava that the hotel offered with their compliments every day. The hotel is about a mile from the Beach, and it is worth a walk even if you don't go in the water. We did go in the water, but if you really want to go to the beach, do yourself a favor and take the forty-minute train to Sitges... we did, and it was gorgeous... an amazing day trip. The hotel is also very close to the Cathedral. We took in a flea market set up near the Cathedral one day, and any antique fan would have enjoyed the quality and prices of the items offered. Same goes for the antique shops near the hotel. The hotel is not especially close to the Sagrada Familia, but it is not so far that you cannot walk. We walked up Las Ramblas to the upper Ramblas and took a quick right turn to check it out. The area was very safe, and we felt 100% comfortable walking with our children even very late at night (after Midnight). Never once in Barcelona did I ever feel the threat of a pick-pocket or even hear about someone else having any trouble. The warnings we read about on the forums were, in our estimation, VERY exagerated. They reminded me of when we go out to dinner in Atlanta with some of our suburban friends, and they lock the doors whenever they see a homeless person. Paranoia does not make for a relaxing vacation. Anyone who is comfortable in a US city will be even more so in Barcelona. I felt safer or as safe in Barcelona than I do in any major US city... and I travel often for work to downtown areas. Both my wife and the other woman who we were with felt the same. I was back to carrying my wallet in my pocket after the first day, and I was embarressed that I had worried about it to begin with... sort of the way I felt when I showed up with bear bells in Montana.

My room was a 'petite double' which was perfect for one person. There wasnt any external noise to worry about but you could hear the odd door banging and the sound of flushing from the room above, but nothing to worry about. Breakfast was the usual, something for everyone, fruit, cereal, yoghurt, croissants, rolls, cheeses, meats, eggs, toast etc etc. There was complimentary self service coffee and cake during the day if you wanted it, I used to pop back for a cuppa in the afternoon as the hotel was so central it wasnt out of the way at all. I would've liked a cocktail or nightcap when returning at night but the bar closed at 8.30 p.m. although the mini-bar was well stocked, but I like to chat to other guests in a hotel bar when you're travelling solo.

As previously stated, it is in a fantastic location, in the middle of the gothic quater, and was very easy to find. We got the aerobus from the airport, which drops you off in placa catalunya, and was a very straightforward walk down to the hotel, taking approx 10-15 mins. I would definitely recommned using the bus, costing only 5 euro's each way (we could have got a return, but wanted to see how easy the hotel was to find from the bus stop - it was very easy). At the hotel, we were checked in by a friendly chap and offered a complimentary glass of cold cava and nibbles. The room wasn't the best - we should have asked for another, but didn't - it looked out onto a narrow alley and the large window/door seemed to be fixed closed - possibly health and safety?? It was a fairly small room, but was clean and functional. The bathroom was clean and well lit, the shower screen was rather on the small side, so water tended to be all over the floor after using - but wasn't really a major problem. No drink making facilities in the room, (there was minibar) but complimentary tea and coffee and cakes and pastries down near the breakfast room - which we did use on a couple of occasions and was very welcome after a day out sightseeing. Breakfast itself was the standard continental offering, a reasonable choice and certainly enough to keep us going for a good few hours!

So much so that I'm writing my first Tripadvisor review, because I love this site and use the reviews, and had used the reviews of this hotel to determine it was a great place to stay. It was awful on so many levels. We arrived in Barcelona early on a night train from Paris. We had just been engaged in Paris and were ecstatic to see Barcelona. We were at the hotel by 10am, and the front desk manager rudely told us our room wasn't ready and we could come back later. We asked for a time to return and he said \"I don't know.\" We came back around 1pm and were told that our room was still not ready, but that we had really booked the wrong room because it was for students and was 2 beds. We knew that we had booked a standard bed, but we went ahead and agreed to upgrade to the room they recommended simply because they said they were unsure when our small would be ready. When we tried to pay for the room, we were told that we couldn't pay by credit card because it was less than 60 Euro and no one in Barcelona will accept credit card when it is less than 40 Euro. We had just arrived, so we believed him and paid cash, but asked for a receipt. He then asked if we'd like to rent a safe in our room for an additional 2 Euro per day. When we declined he said \"Really? Ok...\" It was the strangest response for the front desk manager to encourage to lock up your belongings in your room. We felt like he was going to steal from us himself after this conversation. When we asked for a tapas restaurant recommendation, the front desk manager pulled out a handful of flyers to insist we get pizza instead. In Barcelona.He would call and we would get a free shot (and he would get a nice kickback I'm sure). He said there were no tapas places close. We walked half a block to Plaza Del Pi and found two great tapas bars. We asked the hotel to call us a cab one night after a terrible experience in a cab from the train station (he basically drove us in circles pretending not to speak English. The cab driver was talking to the front desk when we came downstairs 5 minutes before the time we called the cab for. When we jumped in the cab, the cab driver set the rate at 8 Euro for his wait. We argued with him, and he finally agreed to take it down to 5 Euro for the wait. It should have been reset to 0. When we returned from dinner, we reported the cab driver to the hotel and asked if they would call for us to report the driver. He gave us a card and said we could try but they didn't speak English. Last, the hotel room itself was tiny and the bed and sheets were terrible. Hard, cheap, awful. And the room itself was painfully hot. We woek up at 2am and went downstairs to request a fan and report a problem with the thermostat, but of course, they couldn't help. Do NOT stay at this hotel.

The beds were ok, but after walking all day in Barcelona, there were just find for a restful night. The room had blackout curtains to block out the lights and noises of the city. It was very quiet at night. Occasionally, early in the morning, we heard some trucks and deliveries, but it was really not that bad. (If you are sensitive to noise, simply using some earplugs in the morning would have blocked out any sounds I head. I never travel without them!) There was a restaurant at the hotel, but we usually went to one of the local cafes on the many squares that are seconds from the hotel. Each day, we walked out of the hotel and into the heart of the city. We were very close to Barcelona Cathedral and there were nightly shows in the square next to it. We could walk everywhere! The hotel is close to Las Ramblas and El Raval, but no so close that you have to deal with any of the loud crazyness of of those areas. We were also able to walk to the beach, and to metro stations. Ideal location! The staff spoke English, which was helpful my Spanish stinks, and everyone was very professional, couteous, and helpful. We were given help with directions and given wonderful recommendations for restaurants. We felt safe and comfortable at Raco del Pi. It was a great place to come home to after long days of sightseeing. Word of caution: The only drawback to Barcelona is pickpockets. They are not violent, but they are looking for people that are not paying attention. ( Ladies, bring a purse that zips and wear it close to your body. Men, keeping your cell phone or wallet in your back pocket is just asking for it!) We were not pickpockets, but we were smart about things.

All cafes and restaurants had seating outside which we thought we might miss out on by going in March so we were pleased by this, Many also had the outdoor heaters for al fresco dining in the evening - and many were busy. Great atmosphere. Everyone very friendly and helpful. We did some research before going and decided the cheapest option was to get the Renfe train from the airport. We asked where to get it from at the tourist info booth before exiting the airport. A very short walk through the terminal took us to the small platform where there is a machine to buy tickets. We opted for a T10 ticket for 7.50euro.This gives 10 journeys and can be used on the metro and buses. simply swipe through the machine for yourself then pass to your partner. This is two journeys which lasts about 1 hour or so and will enable you to get off at Sants and jump on the metro to Licieu on La Ramblas. Bingo and all for approx 75p each - much cheaper than a taxi and more fun. You still have 8 journeys left and can get yourself back to the airport aswell. As for pickpockets we were very vigilent and saw no trouble at all. The hotel is perfectly placed and is exactly as described previously. Spotlessly clean and staff willingly to offer advice whenever needed. There was a good mix of guests also. Breakfast buffet was exellent with loads on offer. We had paid extra for B&B knowing full well we would want a leisurely breakfast with more than one cup of coffee and glass of juice each. The restaurant was small and had a nice feel to it. We were pleased although you could grab a smaller breakfast within 10 paces if prefered for around 5-8 euros each. I have to admit we were disappointed with the room. We requested and got a double bed but the room itself was tiny to say the least with a side window onto a brick wall. It felt oppressive and the air con seemed to make it warmer in there so we stopped using it. We had no problem with street noise and it was nice not to hear the busy traffic. I would stay again but would hope for a balcony room at the front. I suppose these are high on everyones wish list though. We travelled via metro and on foot and particularly liked Poble Espanyol and Parc Guell, we took a picnic to Guell and had tapas at one of the nice cafe bars at Poble espanyol. We explored Gracia, Barri Gotic El born etc on foot. We found Beer to be expensive and it cheaper to drink cava sangria or cava by the glass. Also If you fancy sampling a flamenco show we found a short half hour show for 7 euros each right on Placa Raeal- Torontos i think it was called. We ate many tapas and liked Sinatras restaurant just on the side alley near Placa Raeal. Overall Barcelona is a fascinating city with lots on offer. There are hundreds of hotels but this one has to be the best location. Dont be put off by all the graffiti - it is everywhere and is only ever on the shop shutters so is more apparent at night.

I expected it to be noisy late at night and in the small hours but it wasn't. Pleasant room, everything you need in the bathroom. Very friendly staff at reception and in the breakfast room. As other reviewers have said, the breakfast is extremely good - a very wide choice from hot English/American dishes to good quality European style cold meats, cheeses etc, plus breads, cakes, cereals, yoghurt, and a wide variety of fresh fruits. Good coffee too... in fact, great coffee and excellent food everywhere we went in Barcelona during a 5 day trip. Not surprising perhaps when you see the quality of the produce in La Boqueria market. The only downsides were: 1. Our room was very dark - no real natural light but perhaps can't be helped because of the narrow laneways. This may not bother everyone; and 2. More importantly, the beds are just standard double beds which means quite narrow and quite short. I asked at reception and they said all the rooms had the same size beds. I know this isn't pretending to be a 5-star hotel but I do think queen size beds are fairly normal for 4 star hotels these days and there would be enough space for them in this hotel's rooms. Unless you and your partner are two short, very skinny people, you may find it difficult to get a good night's rest. Let me finish on a high note: the welcome glass of prosecco, the availability of apples and bonbons (sweets to the English) at reception and the help-yourself free afternoon coffee, tea and croissants or cakes are very nice touches.", "Date": "March 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "cork", "Title": "\u201c\\friendly, clean ,nicely decorated and centrally located\u201d", "Author": "CorkStarbucks", "ReviewID": "UR58556321", "Content": "We recently stayed in Raco del Pi and were pleasently surprised, the hotel staff were very welcoming and friendly.

As mentioned on this board, we also found that cabs never seemed to want to take us directly to the hotel, as the streets are very narrow and largely pedestrian. This was only really an issue for us when we were arriving to the hotel from the airport and got dropped off with our luggage in the middle of a crowded square and had to figure out where the hotel was, which was a bit frustrating, but ultimately it wasn't that hard to find. The other issue was the bed. In Europe, a double or king bed is almost always two twin beds positioned next to each other, which was the case here. This is usually is not a big deal, but the beds in our room were on wheels and even though we tried to lock the wheels in place, the beds moved around a lot. When we were trying to treat the two beds together like one big bed, the beds kept separating and one person was always falling down in the ever-widening chasm between the beds, so ultimately we had to just sleep individually in each twin bed, which isn't very romantic.

Once I found the hotel the gentleman at the front desk gave me a map and marked our location and directions to the nearest sights. Once you learn that the hotel is just around the corner from the Barcelona Cathedral then you can find the hotel from anywhere in the city....as long as you can find the cathedral! You're also equally close to Las Rambles and the Bouqueria and Port Vell which is a spectacular sight as well.

It was a little hard to find at first (since it's off the Ramblas on one of the side streets), but once we'd found it, it's location was one of the most appealing aspects of the hotel. We were glad we weren't in one of the many hotels on the main thoroughfare - the little street it's situated on, with it's myriad of little speciality shops (ice cream, cafes, chocolatier etc.) was beautiful. We were greeted by very charming and helpful staff on both occasions upon our arrival and the complimentary Cava and fresh fruit were a very nice touch during check-in. Staff were better than excellent and since our Spanish isn't very good - we were glad their English was great. The room allocated on our first visit was spacious with good facilities - but don't go there to spend time in your room watching TV if you only speak English. Chanel selection wasn't great. On our second visit, the room was small - we literally had to back into the bathroom - but even so - it was very clean and had all amenities we could want. Hey... it's Europe... embrace the closeness and get to know your partner a bit better! We took breakfast on our second visit at the hotel and it was very good (our first visit - we ate at a couple of the little bar/cafes close by).

We loved the atmosphere, the vibrant feel and the noise that came from the narrow street during the day and evening. The view was also great from the balcony (see pictures). Only issue (and this is not meant to discourage people to book this hotel) was that the old doors are not sufficient to isolate the room from the noise from the street (with echo) at nighttime. Earplugs did the trick for us (we were prepared) but again this is not unusual if you want to be in the old town of Barcelona (and we encourage you to choose that location to be \"in the heart of it\".

We were given a glass of cava on arrival and told that internet use was free and tea/coffee/croissants were also complementary after 2pm, though we only took advantage of this once as we were out sightseeing. The room was modern (no kettle though so I would advise to take a travel kettle if you enjoy your morning cup of tea - although there are plenty of cafes nearby) and we were lucky enough to get one of the rooms with a balcony overlooking the beautiful street (we had emailed the hotel in advance to request this but we were not sure whether we would be successful).

Didn't bother with breakfast, as even at the discounted rate of 9 euros pp, it is miles cheaper to stop at any of the nearby cafes for coffee and tostadas etc. Word of warning re: attempts to part you from your belongings (which is always a problem in Barcelona) - beware a couple of small senoritas along the water front area attempting to get you to sign what purports to be a school petition.

I did go back to reception and they offered me the same room on another floor but with no windows!!(Although we had a window,the curtains were too narrow and there was a big gap down the middle so we were unable to make it dark...at least no one was able to see in due to being overlooked by the brick wall!) Our room was so small that we were unable to move around the bed at the same time ,so had to take it in turns to lie on the bed to enable the other to get ready.The bathroom was ok though except the shower sprayed the floor ,and all our stuff ,until we got used to it!

Expensive,but we decided that if we ate loads we wouldnt need to bother with lunch.This is what we did ,and it worked well.They also wanted us to pay in cash (for some reason their credit card machine was missing!) we refused as we didnt want to tie up E82 of our cash and guess what...the machine had reappeared the next morning!Very weird! As it is a buffet you can obviously pick and choose but if you are not fussy it was fine.There was : fruit juices,cereals,fresh fruit (lovely selection),cheeses,hams,smoked salmon,rolls,bread,yoghurts,croissants and a good selection of other pastries.Hot food was the same every day: scrambled egg,bacon,fried egg and sausage (the german kind).it was never very hot but was quite tasty. The free drinks and pastries in the foyer that others have mentioned are actually whats left from breakfast and usually ended up being croissants.There was never any hot water left to make tea so we managed with a cup of stewed coffee from an urn.But hey it was free! I have to say that everywhere was very clean and the staff were friendly enough.The position of this hotel is good for walking to lots of places although we felt very uneasy on the Ramblas and tried to avoid it as much as possible.

The hotel is tucked down a side street very close to Las Ramblas so in a brilliant location. We had complimentary cava on arrival and the complimentary coffee/tea and pastries provided throughout the day were great especially after a busy day out round the city. The staff on reception spoke very good English and were very helpful. We had room 407 on the 4th floor. It is on the back of the hotel so was lovely and quite but it only had two small skylights and a very small low level window (at ankle level!) so felt a bit dark. However it was clean and had everything we needed and to be honest you dont spend much time in the room so we didnt grumble. Looking at the floorplan on the back of our door we shall ask for room 402 next time which was much larger and had a balcony, but it it is on the front of the hotel so imagine it might be a bit noisy at night at busy times of the year. We would definitely recommend this hotel, particularly because of its position. We would also recommend using the aerobus to travel to and from the airport. It went from right outside the terminal to the centre at Placa de Catalyna and cost just 3.90 euros each. It runs every 15 mins even on Sundays and is less than a 10 min walk to the hotel. The hop on hop off Turistic bus is a must. The red tour round the north of the city was more interesting and we used it to get to and from the Nou Camp. For a lovely evening meal we would recommend Attic. A fab restaurant on Las Ramblas. Its above some shops about a third of the way down Las Ramblas. At night you cant miss it as you look up to see a modern and inviting restaurant overlooking the street with a queue of people waiting for tables! It was great to sit at the window watching the entertainers and people going by below whilst enjoying a lovely meal. It cost about 80 euros for a 3 course meal and a good bottle of wine. We loved it so much we went twice but would advise you to book a table or go before 8pm as there was always a queue after 8.30pm because its so popular. One word of warning - be careful about having a drink at the tables in the middle of Las Ramblas. We stopped for a rest and had 2 beers (not large ones) and they presented us with a bill for 15 euros! They charged us 7.50 euros each for a glass of San Miguel!!

You're reading all of the reviews but can't decide where to stay ? When you don't know the city at all, it's so confusing having to weigh up the various permutations and options. After all, you want to enjoy the trip, not be let down by a bad choice of hotel, right ? I had the same difficulties, but am very glad that I opted for the Raco del Pi. If you want roof-top pools, plush facilities or funky interiors to relax in whilst visiting a great city, this hotel is not for you. However, if you want a clean, comfortable and friendly base for exploring the delights of the city on a long weekend, with little time to waste, Raco del Pi will suit you perfectly. Previous reviewers have not lied. The location is absolutely PERFECT (in the heart of the gothic quarter). The discreet entrance is on a pedestrian only street (though taxis can pick-up / drop off at the door). The Cathedral is only a moment\u2019s stroll away. In the opposite direction Las Ramblas is no further. Shops and cafes abound. Similarly, the waterfront area, museums and main central tourist sties can all be easily reached on foot from the front door. This truly is a central location. We booked a standard double room just one week before our 3 night trip. The only request I made was for it to be non-smoking. We were greeted by a friendly \u201cHola\u201d, a glass of Cava and a front facing room of ample size on the first floor, with a balcony view of the street below. The bathroom (with customary toiletries) was large enough for a bidet. Both rooms were spotlessly clean and a room safe allowed us to store valuables. The beds are firm but very comfortable and the air conditioning can be easily controlled by a wall thermostat. The rate was for a room only, but we welcomed not being \u201ctied in\u201d to breakfast in the hotel (though it was extensive and a 50% discount was offered for the first morning). English newspapers lay on a table for guests to read. If you prefer, there is a very pleasant coffee shop 10yds up the street serving a wide selection of pastries or a pretty church square 50yds the other way with two cafes. We were happy to mix it up. All of the staff are very friendly and helpful. Complimentary tea, coffee and pastries are available every afternoon and the free Internet is also available for guest use. If you have a late departure, the hotel will gladly store your cases after check-out so you can enjoy the last few hours in the city. We both enjoy staying in more opulent hotels, but on a city break with so much to offer, the amount of time spent in them doesn\u2019t justify their cost. Not once did we regret booking this hotel. You can waste your time looking at more options if you want to, but at the Raco del Pi you won\u2019t be wasting any time in Barcelona\u2026!", "Date": "October 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "shropshire", "Title": "\u201cLoved Raco Del Pi and Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "lassieshropshire", "ReviewID": "UR8601431", "Content": "Just returned from a three night stay at the Raco Del Pi with my family.

The location can't be beaten, right in the heart of everything, with tapas bars, restaurants, sights and local transport links all within a stones throw. The Ramblas is about a 10 minute walk away, with loads of little squares and alfresco bars to quench your thirst along the way! Just as people have said, it is really quiet at night and the hotel's airconditioning is fab. Yes the rooms are small, but to be honest, the cleanliness, location and staff make up for it. We didn't have the breaksfast, as we weren't staying on a B&B basis, and it was really expensive (about 15 euros) per person, but there were loads of little places just outside so there was no problem. It did look great though so if you get a deal including breakfast then go for it! The only negative that we found with the location, and it is really minor, is that when the shutters go down, it is quite tricky to navigate your way back through the little winding streets to find the hotel, as all the streets look the same. It took us a few days of trundling around late at night to get our bearings in the dark, which was fun, after a few sangrias, but a little scary if you're alone i would imagine! Also, although the cleanliness of the streets has been mentioned, their methods haven't! As a youngish girl (!) with a penchant for high heals, and a tendancy to get very sore feet late in the evening, I was quite surprised by the ritual spraying of the streets from about 1:30 in the morning onwards. I have normally kicked my heels off by this point, but I learnt my lesson pretty quickly after the 3rd night of slimy and rather yucky feet, to plan ahead and either not wear shoes that will need kicking off, or avoid the sprayers - tricky when they spray the whole of the Ramblas and gothic quarter!

That was worth it as there is a good selection to choose from. This hotel is situated in the old part of the city and is surrounded by lots of interesting little shops and cafes. If any girls reading this are into jewellery making (as I am) there is an excellent bead shop right beside the hotel. There are several more in the vicinity but some of them are trade only and in some you have to buy a set minimum number of beads. On a practical note the Aerobus is the cheapest way to get from the airport, and very straightforward. Also, as with all cities, stopping for a coffee or snack on La Rambla will be much more expensive than heading off the main street.

Took my mum to Barcelona for 3 nights to celebrate her 70th birthday so was looking for a central hotel - not too expensive. This hotel is very centrally located - ideal for shopping and exploring the Ramblas. The rooms are clean (if a little too warm and as we were on the first floor over looking the terrace we couldn't open our window) and ours was a nice size with a large bathroom. Majority of the staff were nice and helpful although we were not offered a glass of cava when we arrived - even though it was on the reception desk and I didn't have the guts to ask for it!! Only fault I found with this hotel was the noise level - be warned - bring ear plugs. Regardless of where your room is within the building you will have some noise - because it is located in a pedestrianised shopping district you won't have much traffice noise but you will hear the local church bells, shoppers and late night partiers and also within the hotel, the rooms and corridors are tiled which means that foots steps etc. are quite loud. Also, some rooms are located right next to the lift and stair well which can also be noisy. Aside from that I would highly recommend this hotel - price and comfort could not be beaten and the choice of breakfast in the morning was huge (this was included in our package). Only major downside of our weekend was the fact that my purse was stolen from my handbag - I still have no idea how they got it but when I returned to the hotel after dinner on our last night it was gone. Luckily I had only the bare essentials in it but still - it was a shock to find it gone. I'd like to pride myself on being savvy when it comes to this kind of thing but they are utter professionals - so make use of the safe in your room (only 2 Euro a night) and ensure you use a back pack that is zipped up and has two straps - and preferably keep it to your front.

We got dropped off halfway down Las Ramblas and he told us that he couldn't drive direct to the hotel, but 5 mins later we had found it.The price ended up at 7 euros, not bad at all. The little walk to the hotel quickly put any doubts to the back of our mind as we were presented with the most quaint alleyways, shops, buildings and an electric atmosphere from the tourists.

At this point i will tell you we had booked the room all on the net via spain bookers, we had asked if possible for an upgrade as we were celebrating our wedding anniversay- TRUE !!

Biggest tip is to get the tickets for Nou Camp tour well worth it, also the bus turistica is brill for getting you from a to b it has 2 routes and you can mix and match with just one priced ticket, 18 euros for the day, it goes everywhere you'd need to see, and has tour guide speaking in english too.

The smaller room had a constant dripping noise which no engineer seemed to be able to sort out but in all honesty, these factors did little to discourage my overall impression of the place.

A short walk to Las Ramblas and as said before a location that cannot be beat. Was in room 204 with a small balcony overlooking Carrer del Pi. Only noise at night was the garbage collection. The area is really quiet after the shops close. At night it is best to stick to the main streets and aviod the dark/quiet ones. Room was clean and functional and the staff was great. Beds were hard but did not prevent us from sleeping after touring all day. Water, pastries and coffee available daily right outside the small breakfast room. We did have breakfast the first night at the 1/2 price rate of 7e...not worth the regular 14e rate...plenty of places to grab breakfast. Right next door is an inside shopping gallery with some cute shops including a very small family owned food counter which opens at 9:00am. Breakfast for two was about 7e. Great fresh squeezed zumo de narranja. We tried Taller de Tapas close to the hotel and was not impressed. Prices were high and food was so-so. If you want tapas go to one of the many small tavernas. Tapas are about 1,60e each and you select right off the counter. They count the toothpicks after and charge you accordingly. Great with beer or cava. Also, go to Placa Real about a ten minute walk. Many great restaurants including Les Quintz Nitz. Join the line about 8:00 pm for the 8:30 seating. VERY reasonable...great variety and super food. Four of us had three courses and wine for 80e. And do not miss grabbing some fruit, a bocadilla or pastries at La Boqueria Market also a ten minute walk right on Las Ramblas. We used the Tourist bus and it was a great way to see the entire city if the weather is good and you can sit on top. We lucked out and it was 68-72 with no rain every day. Taxi cost about 30e to the airport as they do charge a luggage surcharge which seems to have no set rate. Many taxis cannot find the hotel. Heading up Las Ramblas.... turn right after you pass La Boqueria...then the second right on Carrer del Pi. Our friends stayed at the MonteCarlo right on Las Ramblas for three times the price. Room was certainly much nicer but we were glad we picked the Raco del Pi.

Our flight arrived in Barcelona very early local time, so when I confirmed our reservation in writing a week in advance of our arrival, I requested early check-in. Nope! They couldn't be bothered to arrange this, not even with a week's advance notice. The hotel did not let us check in a second before 2:00 p.m. Exhausted and unbathed, up for more than 24 hours straight, we had to wander around Barcelona in a sleep-deprived stupor before many places were even open. You can't tell me they couldn't have compromised and had a clean room for us by NOON, with a week's notice, at the very least. Our room was a colossal disappointment. We had room 101, which must be very different from the guest rooms described by other reviewers. It was a dim and depressing 9' x 9' not counting the bathroom. There were no luggage racks, only two tiny sock drawers, and no place to conveniently stow luggage out of our ways, even on the floor. The \"two beds\" I'd requested were twin beds with about 2\" of space between. If the tile floor was ever swept or mopped the whole time we were there, I'd be surprised, because my socks turned black walking on that floor. The air conditioning and air circulation was beyond abysmal; the air reeked of stale smoke and never, ever changed. Even overnight, even cranked, the air conditioning never quite cut it. Window was locked shut. The front desk staff seemed polite, professional and made earnest attempts to accommodate us, but the housekeeping staff was puzzling at best. Although there were two people in the room, the housekeeping staff only provided towels for one. When we finally got them to start providing enough towels for two, we still couldn't get them to give us an extra washcloth. We left a note with a tip of 3 Euro (we tipped every day about this amount) asking for \"por favor, uno mas toallita.\" We returned about 2:00 that afternoon to find both the tip and the note GONE, but our room still not made up. A few minutes later, a housekeeper came by with two more towels, not washcloths. Our Spanish was not so awful that we couldn't hear her cackling to the other housekeepers outside the door about the \"weirdos in 101\" who wanted all the extra towels. From then on, we did not leave tips! Although the tile in the bathroom was lovely, the loose-fitting shower door inevitably allowed a lake of water to leak onto the floor during every shower, and a sole towel hook meant that one of us always had to hang her towel in the closet. The room was also poorly insulated against sound, and late-night partiers lurching around and yelling to one another through the stairwells easily woke us. Our conclusion is that this is a 2-star hotel that charges and masquerades as a 3-star hotel. Although the Barri Gotic is a fascinating neighborhood and very walkable, if you're looking for comfort and cleanliness, I'd recommend going elsewhere.", "Date": "September 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, NY", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel !\u201d", "Author": "jlafata", "ReviewID": "UR5816297", "Content": "Pros: Location is excellent in middle of gothic quarter, tons of restaurants, shops, plazas, within walking distance of everything.

It was our first visit to Barcelona, and we chose to go to this hotel on previous recommendations posted here. We agreed that the rooms were rather small although the air conditioning was good as it was baking hot outside. The hotel was ok, although a bit expensive, but considering the location was very central, but quite hard to find as all surrounding streets were pedestrians only. La Rambla is only minutes away from the hotel. Breakfast was an extra \u00a314 euros per person per day, plus 2 euros per day if you wanted to use the room safe. Free tea & coffee at the small bar, but no tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms, which was disappointing. For those considering taking/hiring a car to get to Barcelona, forget it totally, there are no parking places anywhere. We left our car in a public car park the first night, which cost 23 euros. We then tried to find alternative parking the next day, and found a parking place 8 kilometres from our hotel in the Val De Hebron area, and had to use the subway to get back to the hotel. We left the car there for 3 days, then used the public car park for the rest of the stay. The hotel does have an arrangement for parking around the Cathedral we found out too late, but it's almost 22 euros per night. It's also a nightmare driving in Barcelona, it's always totally conjested, night & day, and you can't even stop to look at a map. Weather was very hot & humid, around 93 degrees most days. Subways are air conditioned and regular, if you can stand the 100 degrees on the platform waiting for the train. All in all it's a nice, clean small hotel, rather expensive tho. Note :- The police will stop you and warn you to be vigilant if they see you're wallet in your back pocket, as there are pick pockets. Also watch out for young women with babies. They gather round you in crowds begging, and looking for something to steal.

I can repeat all other things that other reviewers have already stressed, but I will concentrate on a few inside tips for this specific hotel. HOW TO GET THERE: Remember oyu are in the Gothic quarter, the taxi will not be able to drop you off in front of the hotel during regular hours, since it is a pedestrian zone, but your walk will be short. On the way back, if you are leaving early in the morning, the cab will definitely pick you up at the door. Just remember the time of the day makes a huge difference between nobody in the streets and hundreds of people walking with you... ROOMS/LOCATION: Location, excellent in the middle of the Gothic quarter. If you have a room with balcony (Rooms 01-04 on each floor) you will have more noise but a larger room. If you stay, like I did, in rooms (08-09) it will be in a smaller room but super quiet (only minor problem in room 309 was that the maid storage room was near our room and when she would come in the morning you could hear her pull the cart and her stuff out of the room). CLEANLINESS/MODERN: Rarely have I seen such a cleaner hotel, and since it is new, all areas exude modern clean taste without looking cold. BREAKFAST: Although lovers of continental breakfast will find everything under the sun in the small restaurant room in the morning, you can have a very large breakfast in the croissanterie right in front of the hotel for a quarter of the price. Only trick (already mentioned): first day is half off, so have breakfast there the first morning until you find a good spot for the following days. The best is the free food left at the bar 24 hours a day for the guests, not so much for the pastries, which are just the leftover from breakfast and get stale by the evening, but for the free water that is a nice gesture since you will be walking a lot in the city and a nice glass of water upon arriving to the hotel before you go to your room is great. INTERNET: It all depends on the other hotel guests: there were days in which nobody would be there, ther were days when one person would be sitting there for hours at a time. Moreover, it is only one computer open to anybody but also to everybody's view, so forget privacy... LOBBY: they do ask you to leave the keys at the desk when you leave (?) they must have had bad experiences, but they are very nice and helpful. Yes, there is free cava (champagne-like wine) but after the first couple of days you want to go and drink it in the bars and restaurants, not in the hotel lobby... Also, remember, the safe is not included in the price, and it is 2 euros a day. OVERALL: To recommend for the best location in a relative quiet area and the clean modern look, great service.", "Date": "May 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo, Norway", "Title": "\u201cNew room, old city\u201d", "Author": "Jumper71", "ReviewID": "UR5185617", "Content": "Stayed 5 days at Raco Del Pi based on reccomendation on this page.

Previously asked for 'a quiet room on the 2nd or 3rd floor' and got one - room 207 at the back of the hotel. Size OK by European city standards. Spotlessly clean, good bathroom facilities. Room safe, 2 euros a day. No view - overlooked a wall - but not overlooked by anyone. Air conditioning worked fine, at night we could close the window and there was no noise at all. Really quiet for the centre of a major city. If you want a better view, the rooms at the front overlooked the Carrer del Pi, lovely pedestrian street with lots of little shops. These would have had a more attractive outlook but you would have got quite a lot of 'people noise'. Depends what you want, we wanted quiet and got it. Probably best to specify the room location when you book. Other reviewers have mentioned hearing people walking on the hard floors - I have to say we heard virtually no noise of this type. Just one thing - the bed (double) was very hard. We got used to it after the first night. As for the rest of the hotel - friendly efficient welcome including glass of cava. Excellent breakfast - discount rate of 7 euros for first day, thereafter 14 euros. We didn't have breakfast there every day. Coffee/croissants available in the bar area at all hours after breakfast, also apples. Computer in bar area for free internet access. Locked luggage room. Location - we found it very convenient. Ramblas/Liceu metro about 2 minutes walk. Plaza de Catalunya (aerobus to airport) about 5 minutes walk. Gothic quarter was lovely by day, not so attractive at night when shop fronts are covered by metal grilles with graffiti. It felt safe at all times if you stuck to the wider streets, though we weren't out late at night. Took the usual precautions but no problems with pickpockets etc. at any time, didn't see anyone else having problems either. Taller de Tapas just round the corner was a good place to eat. Also liked Trobador in C/ Ferran at the Plaza St Jaume end. We bought the Barcelona Card, ideal for a stay of 5 days, free transport (used the metro) and discount on all admissions. Buy it in advance online, it's cheaper, and pick it up from the tourist office at the airport or the Plaza de Catalunya. For a shorter stay (say 2 days) Bus Turistic would be better. Highlights for us were the Casa Batllo, Sagrada Familia & Palau de la Musica Catalunya.

There are plenty of cafes around the hotel where you can get breakfast for between 2 euros and 5 euros; for instance, on plaza del pi, just across the hotel, I got for 3.8 eurosa glass of freshly-pressed orange juice, a chocolate croissant and a milk coffee. Rooms are well-furnished and very clean. However, do not expect your room to have a great view, since the hotel is in a side street in the gothic quarter.

Definitely request a room away from the street.", "Date": "November 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cLoved the H10 Raco del Pi\u201d", "Author": "avery99", "ReviewID": "UR4136265", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights at the beginning of our trip and one more night at the end. We loved everything about the hotel. Our only complaint was that the bed was a little hard but by the time we went to sleep at night, we really didn't care much about it. The location can't be beat, the staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms were small but clean and the bathrooms were of a decent size. There is free internet access which we found to be invaluable. Also, they give you free water, coffee, tea, and snacks which were small pastries downstairs in the bar area. They offer a breakfast for 7E each but we preferred to go out and get our own breakfast for less money. I would definately stay at this hotel again and found that the price was worth it.", "Date": "November 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Livonia, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location to Barri Gotic, Cathedral and Las Ramblas\u201d", "Author": "loulan", "ReviewID": "UR3838984", "Content": "Great location of this hotel. Just a short distance to so many tourist attractions, the Cathedral, Las Ramblas and Barri Gotic. Many things to choose from for Breakfast scrambled eggs, sausage (like a hot dog), pastries, cold cuts and cereals. It is in a shopping area so if you need to pick up a gift item it is very convenient. Our room had two twin beds pushed close together. Our non smoking room faced the inner courtyard so we had no problem with noise or smoking smells from others. You need to have the room key in the slot by the door in order for the air conditioning to work. It does take a while for the room to cool down but was comfortable to sleep in. Staff was friendly and helpful with directions. Also it was nice to have internet to send a quick message back to family. Would definitely stay here again", "Date": "September 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3761228", "Content": "The hotel was excellent. The free champagne at check-in. The room. The breakfast. The mineral water and soft drinks and peanuts at the outdoor patio. One thing that I did appreciate was the written safety material provided at check-in. The woman at the check-in desk made a point of saying, \"It is unfortunate that we have a problem with theft here in Barcelona. Here is some written material about safety precautions. Please read it.\" I had never had someone say that and, quite frankly, it spooked me a little bit. I did, however, read the material when I got to my room. Mostly common sense suggestions, though my sensitivity was heigntened. One thing that was emphasized was the fact that theft was partuicularly rampant near the central railway station. I broke-up my trip in Barcelona with a few days in Palma. When I returned from the airport to the central railway station, I noticed a few guys who seemed shady. The pushed their way between me and my wife on the escalator up to the street and when I got to the top the guy in front of me bent over as though he had dropped something to block my way. The two guys behind me were about to press up against me to pick my pockets, no doubt. I immediately realized what was going on so I dropped my shoulder and reverted back to the offensive lineman on my high school football team and I barrelled-over the guy who was attempting to block my way. I managed to hold onto my bags and I let out quite a few obcenities--in English--to the puzzled guys who feigned surprise. They got nothing. Interesting to note that two English girls sitting at an adjacent table at an outdoor cafe were approached by a nice young man and after he left one girl's wallet was gone. Be careful in Barcelona. Theft is rampant! You might want to consider having a decoy wallet: an old wallet filled with expired credit cards and a wad of worthless cash (e.g., 100,000 old Romanian lei or Bulgarian leva). If someone goes for your wallet they will get the decoy wallet and promptly walk away to examine their (worthless) booty.
