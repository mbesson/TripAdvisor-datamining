The museum-type showcase displays seem to have been put together by amateurs with a blunt nod to a local jeweller. It continues into the restaurant, Renoir where they put paintings on columns that don't sit well and add nothing to the decor. Another massive flaw is the restaurant's ceiling that has been left in an industrial type of state with exposed lights and utility tracks from the ventilation I suppose. It's a waste of a gloriously high ceiling. This is Montreal and you're within blocks of the museums (a plus, location-wise) but honestly, there's been an oversight in style. The room in spite of a king bed was cramped for two people, and the washroom doors offered no privacy. Overall, the effect was of efficiency, as in ideal for business people in transit, but nothing beyond. The restaurant service was lax, with simple items from our meals missing. Now for the upsides: location was great; valet and garage security were great; front desk was courteous; the luffa as part of the toiletries was a novel touch; the food was adequate.

It was a wonderful experience. The hotel location is excellent, a few blocks from Rue Sainte Catherine, Montreal's main shopping street and a 20 / 25 minutes walk from the Vieux Port, one of the Montreal's main tourist attraction and Basilica Notre Dame. Rue Sherbrooke itself where the hotel is located is a trendy area of Montreal with luxury shops and nice restaurants. External design of the building is sleek and modern as is the lobby which - but it is a minor point - is not very large. Room decoration is very nice using soft colors and modern furniture. I appreciated the Bose iPod dock as it is always nice to listen your favorite music outside home. Room size in the so called \"Superior\" rooms is sufficient but some additional square feet wouldn't hurt. The luxury room I occupied during the first 4 nights is much larger and looks like more a junior suite. It corresponds more to the size of teh rooms you expect in a hotel of this category. However, the strongest point of the hotel is undoubtedly the service. Whether it was in-room breakfast (as I had to leave the hotel before the opening of the restaurant), bringing office staples to the room while I was working in it or taking my luggage to the taxi staff was extremely forthcoming and diligent. Everything I requested came extremely rapidly with a smile. Breakfast at the Renoir restaurant is great. It is served at the table with a lot of options and always the same quality of service, efficient and professionalism. Quality of the food served for dinner is also very good. Not only wouldn't I hesitate to recommend the hotel but for sure I will pick it up again for a stay in Montreal", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel, great service, terrific restaurant!\u201d", "Author": "JB789", "ReviewID": "UR120716424", "Content": "The hotel itself is beautiful, with a clean, contemporary look, and its location is excellent - within easy walking distance of a busy downtown area with many restaurants and shopping outlets, and within more ambitious but still walkable distances to such key locations and landmarks as Chinatown, Notre Dame Basilica, Windsor Station, Mont Royal Park, McGill University and many others. The staff was professional, efficient and extremey friendly.Our room, a \"Superior\", was not large, but beautiful, well-appointed and more than adequate for two; it was in impeccable condition, with tasteful contemporary styling and a floor-to-ceiling window facing out onto the avenue. The bathroom was outfitted with a rain shower, and L'Occitane toiletries were replenished as needed. One minor issue I had with the room was with the way the room safe was built into the closet - the closet was not huge to begin with and the dimensions of the wall safe limited the amount of hanging space for longer items (dresses, fully-hung slacks, etc.), but this was only a minor inconvenience. Another minor issue was that the down comforters, though extremely soft and full, could perhaps use a tighter weave, or be filled with a higher proportion of down vs. feathers, as feathers tended to occasionally poke through, providing a minor nuisance during an otherwise very comfortable time in bed. The fitness center is quite modest, with only a few machines (both weight training and cardio), but it was a beautiful room, impeccably maintained, and well-stocked with towels, bottled water and fresh fruit; it was never crowded, and was more than adequate for our needs .

The washroom here is phenomenal... the glass shower is a showpiece, and the even the toiletries are arranged artistically. The gym is well equipped with excellent machines and has washrooms with showers inside for extra convenience. The gym also stocks apples and bottled water. There were only a couple of cons: The rooms don't have a fridge... they come with a stocked minibar instead. The restaurant prices are quite high... $15 oatmeal ? The concierge was very helpful when we asked about visiting the old city, explaining attractions and marking up a map for our use. The hotel has a good location... only a 10-minute walk from St. Catherines St. with shopping along the way. Old Montreal is under a 30-minute walk and has awesome history and architecture.

The staff are extremely well trained professionals who are friendly, gracious and attentive. The rooms are comfortable, though our room was quite small - perhaps we should have paid closer attention when we booked our room. The bathroom was really nicely appointed, with tasteful tilework and a shower with an overhead rain shower head. I am sensitive to noise at night and our room was very quiet and I noticed the shades were designed to help block out the maximum of light. Terrific. In the evenings, we received nice recommendations from the concierge for dinner. We usually started with a drink in the bar -served with complimentary tasty snacks, which one evening included a nicely presented, delicious crab spring roll. After several nights out at more formal restaurants, we were in the mood for something very casual where it would be appropriate to dress in jeans. Since we had heard about local comfort food called poutine, we asked for recommendations for locations to have great 'poutine' - a dish that consists of French Fries topped with a tasty pepper gravy, and cheese curds. You can also order special toppings - one of which included chopped steak with mushrooms and onion. Sounds like a heart attack on a plate, and it is....but totally worth it!!!! We loved it! I think it speaks incredibly well of the range of a great concierge to be able to recommend the very best of dining options at the top end and sometimes, AND when the mood strikes you, more humble, comfort-food type establishments. We had a ball! Cold beers and all! If there were any criticism of the hotel, it would be the valet/front door service. On three separate mornings, I stepped out of hotel, dressed professionally for a day of work/conferences. Each day it was raining heavily. On each occasion the narrow driveway was awkwardly blocked by a car or taxi. While there were only two or three other guests waiting, the attendant (in full uniform with a hat - i.e. the guy in charge) completely ignored me. No 'Bon jour', no apology for delay, and no offer to call a cab. I quickly learned that the cabs wait at the corner to the right of the entrance and started getting my own cabs. Given the terrific service at this hotel, I was surprised to get ignored at the entrance even though I was a guest. A small irritation, but an important detail since these are the first and last impressions.

Unless you didn't have a nose, it was noticeable so why didn't they make efforts to get rid of it? They finally \"found\" another room for us which looked the same: what I would compare to a nice Hilton. 2- The Sofitels bathrooms are always high end with marble throughout, but this entire room, including the bathroom, was just dated, not to mention dull and dark. It needs to get an upgrade and ditch the black 1980s decor. Even little touches could be cheaply attended to, such a making sure the bed frame isn't visible and properly placing the bed skirt. 3- It was a birthday celebration and they did nothing special and comped nothing. They have turndown service which only includes closing the curtains. 4- The concierge was very shifty. For example, for an authentic breakfast, he sent us to a very poor chain (Eggspectations). Really? He acted annoyed and burdened by our educated questions and tried to just brush us off. Instead, use the tourist place at Dorchester Square because they are free and wonderful. 5- They have wifi, but it is only free for one day.

This hotel is up to what you expect of a Sofitel - high quality - great service. The service and staff are wonderful - they are always welcoming and happy to help. They take note of any comments for improvements and when you have a question or require special help they are very accommodating. Something I've noticed is the low turnover (at least in the front of the house staff) - this typically indicates that its a good place to work and maybe one of the reasons why staff are so friendly.. Rooms - most recently we stayed in a regular room - but over the years we've stayed in all levels of rooms - my favourite, though a bit on the small side, are the corner rooms - loads of windows and nice views. Actually the floor to ceiling windows offer great city views regardless of what room your in - although you may want to ask for a room facing either the Mountain or Sherbrooke St. W. on the east side of the hotel there is a condo/office building and views are therefore limited. Junior suites are beautiful - bathroom is amazing! Amenities are excellent - good quality Occitane products. The hotel is constantly upgrading - recently they've been replacing the carpeting - but I think its probably time they started replacing some of the furniture (chairs/sofas) - the upholstery is starting to look a bit \"worn\". Beds are extremely comfortable as is bedding. Restaurant - we have not had dinner at Renoir as there are so many choices in Montreal and we like trying new places outside the hotel - but breakfasts are wonderful and worth it to take the b&b option. Service in the restaurant is as good as elsewhere in the hotel - again no issues ever. The bar is a good place for a pre-dinner drink.

We also had trouble with the key cards-they only worked intermittently, and when they stopped working after we returned exhausted from a long walk in nearby Parc du Mont Royal, the woman at the front desk was not apologetic-in fact she blamed me, saying it was from having the key card near my cell phone and credit cards (which were in the hotel safe. . . nowhere near the key card).

Our room was a superior, which is an upgrade from their standard room. The upgrade was worth the extra few dollars to have the extra space and a higher floor. We had the Picnic package that included--guess what--a picnic? We took ours to go, but if you want to have a picnic during your stay the hotel supplies a picnic basket and suggested picnic locations. We had a choice of salads, sandwiches, and a bottle of red or white wine. Cookies, apples, and granola bars rounded out our feast. The lobby and guest rooms are super chic without being bare or stark. The staff was very pleasant and helpful and they switch from French to English depending on their guests first language. Our only suggestion is that the Sofitel give guests access to free WiFi in their rooms. It always amuses us to see that Red Roof Inns have free WiFi and breakfasts and five-star hotels don't. What is the story here? Why? Nevertheless, we would definitely stay here again. The hotel is located just a block away from good restaurants, McGill University, and two top museums. Young people can walk the few blocks to Crescent Street to find all kinds of \"happening\" bars and night spots.

The room was very comfortable, with a bed that you don't want to crawl out of in the morning, and a washroom that's decked out with great amenities and a wonderful shower area. Plus, it's super sparkling clean! What's most remarkable about this hotel is its concierge service! They are so helpful, kind and knowledgeable. They are the people you want and need when you have questions in your head - \"what's the best restaurant to go to? how best to make use of your day?\" The concierge managed to squeeze us into Montreal's best 'Au Pied de Cochon', which is almost impossible as this restaurant has a long waiting list.

The external architecture is pleasing but, lounge apart, the ground floor is a design flop. Access from the hotel to the combined bar-resto area, and through to the summer terrace, is by one door. The terrace, with its plastic chairs (at these prices !) veers between bar and resto. Staff were friendly. Check-in was form-free (but see below), and the employee came from behind his desk to show me to the lift. My room was well-furnished and appointed, as was the bathroom. I appreciated the morning sunshine, the bedside reading light and the turn-down service. The pricing of food and drink is opaque. The impression is given that if you have to ask the real price, you should not be staying at the Sofitel Montreal. The room menu indicates that taxes, service and delivery are addditional, without specifying. Is this legal ? The mini-bar pricing is silent on additional charges. In the resto, the breakfast menu indicates,for example, a continental breakfast at CAD22 which according to my internet booking becomes CAD32. I decided to give the breakfast a try if the Financial Times was available - but it was not.(New York and Washington had a plentiful supply). CHIC PICNIC - this summer offering bears little relation to the publicity. While sandwich and salad were in the hamper, the 'delicious' pastries and fresh fruits were replaced by nibbles and M&M sweets. Instead of champagne or wine, plus soft drinks and bottled water, there was one small bottle of water. The hotel was in a complete muddle over the wine. As I took the picnic in my room before late check-out, I was not too bothered but if I was the romantic couple on the flyer, I would be pretty annoyed. The conditions of my Accor gold card were respected. At check-in I was welcomed back, which was destabilising as I have never been in Canada before. The hotel thought I was from Alberta. Despite trying to correct this, I was presented at check-out with a bill with an address in Alberta (plus my home street added to one line). I have googled this address, and a namesake does live there, and it is easy to deduce he works for a near-by oil company. At least I got my points...The same sort of thing happened in Sofitel Melbourne and New York (but no points). New York had a Melbourne suburb address for me (another namesake). Sofitel should really sort this out because of the legal and privacy implications of guests being wrongly identified.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oakville, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cFelt as wonderful as home\u201d", "Author": "torontogirl5", "ReviewID": "UR112334994", "Content": "I moved to this hotel after a disappointing stay at another property.

The hotel is excellent. Location is very very good, on the same street as McGill University, 2 blocks from St. Catherine, and minutes from the high end stores.

Some pointers: 1) The parking is over priced $30/day for valet they do not offer self park which I was very disappointed with. Just drive 1 block in either direction of the hotel and 24H parking is $10 in a covered lot - save your money for shopping! 2) Room service is very very expensive. $10 for a bagel! It is not even the famous Montreal Bagels. - if you need breakfast right away, walk 1 block to the Western hotel they have a bagel/coffee shop at the bottom. Not the best but will hold you over until you go out for some real food. 3) No Internet or WIFI service in fact they charge extra for this service. I have stayed at Sofitel's before and this is a first to have to pay for wifi. 4) get the staff in the lobby to make your reservations for restaurants, they seem to know how to get a table even if the restaurant is booked. 5) For those driving - Not sure if this applies when you decided to read this, but Sherbrooke Street was closed for construction so it was a pain to get to the hotel especially when you are not familiar with the area. 6) No Umbrellas in the rooms for those rainy days, but you can always get one from the front desk.", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cConsistently good - perfect for business or leisure\u201d", "Author": "travellingunderpants", "ReviewID": "UR107652558", "Content": "Location is excellent, a short walk to many restaurants / shopping.

Having stayed in ultra hip, expensive \"shoeboxes\" in New York City, I appreciate that even the smallest rooms are well laid out, bright and airy. They've got the details down to an art. The rooms are elegant in a fairly modern architectural style (but they should update their art -- the faux Van Gogh flowers on the wall above the bed was not up to the hotel's design \"look\".)

Sorry Toronto! While I would definitely recommend this hotel, and it meets Sofitel standards, the room size was definitely inadequate. Indeed, our room - which was a deluxe suite - was no bigger than a regular room at the Best Western, and perhaps even smaller. And the regular rooms at the Sofitel - which I have read other complaints about on TripAdvisor - were probably closet sized! Granted, everything about the room was nice, and clean, with an awesome bed/mattress, I just thought that the room was kind of puny for a hotel of this calibre, and for the deluxe \"label\". Perhaps that is typical of major centres, not sure - I hear the rooms in London or Paris are even tinier. So may be I just need to get out more? Luckily we obtained an extremely good rate - $375 with taxes - for 2 nights from the Travelzoo website so I guess we can't complain too much, or may be not at all. But there was no free internet access. And while I suppose if you can afford to stay at a Sofitel paying for the internet should not be a problem, I thought that $15 per day was excessive, so I simply passed on it. $15 per day per room seems like a rip-off to me. Other than that, and on the plus side, the concierge service was second to none, and extremely helpful - in both official languages. So overall, I would still recommend the hotel - the location is very good for accessing most of the sites of Montreal, and literally a block or two away from the (must-see and free) Museum of Fine Arts. It is also relatively close to the Peel subway station from which you can access most of the City (on a world class subway system - Toronto are you listening?!?), and it's only about a 20 minute drive from the airport, perhaps 40 minutes during rush hour! If you want a nicer (and potentially more $$) alternative though, I would suggest the W Hotel in Montreal , which I stayed at 2 years ago.

Thrilled with my prior experiences at the luxurious Sofitel in Chicago, I expected the same gold standard up North...but was quite dissappointed with our stay. First of all, the standard room only had a shower - no bathtub. This wasn't an issue until my boyfriend and I came down with a nasty flu and requested a room with a bathtub, only to find out that we had to \"upgrade\" to the next class of room if we desired one for an extra $50+tx per night. Most luxury hotels in North America offer both a shower AND a bath in their standard luxury rooms. Second of all, we had prepaid the entire weekly hotel stay yet we noticed that a $200 charge from the Sofitel was appearing on our debit card every day or so!?! When we inquired what the debits were about, we were told that it was a customary hold just in case we had incidentals, and that our funds would be replaced within 7 days upon checkout. What the...?!? Typically, a certain amount is blocked in case of incidentals on a credit card...but a charge of over $200/day on a debit card was unusually steep. Furthermore...the fire alarm went off one morning at 9AM and the hotel directions were vague and discombobulated. First the increasingly blaring alarm nonstop, then we were informed they were trying to locate the cause of the alarm, then we were advised to stay in our rooms...very confusing directions and we ended up walking down 17 flights of stairs (!?!) just in case there really was a fire on the premises.

There is a great breakfast place, 2 blocks from the hotel called Eggspectations. It open at 6:00/6:30 in the morning. 2. It is just far enough from Old Montreal that you need to take a cab or bus. You can walk 2-3 blocks to the Tourist Information center and pick up bus 515 to Old Montreal. Much cheaper than the cab. Very convinent. 3. Nearest grocery store for soda and snacks is about a 6- 7 block walk. I would definitely stay here again.

It is on the \"Golden Mile\" , catty corner to the Omni Mont-Royal, which is one of my preferred hotels. However, given the similar price that the dated (but currently under renovation) Omni wanted for the same stay, I chose the newer and more modern Sofitel. I loved this hotel-- it is voguish, sleek, and smart, with superb staff and amenities. The lobby is large, light, airy and chic. I went up to my room, where I got a personalized welcome as an A-Club member. The room is average-sized, and some may consider it on the small side, (especially given the price), however the use of space is very efficient and functional. The decor is trendy and the room's lay-out, particularly the the foyer entrance to the room -- equipped with a shelf with a candle set to enhance ambiance, gave the place an almost homey feeling. Light seems to be a theme with the hotel, and the use of natural light has been incorporated into the hotels decor and atmosphere. The expansive windows in the rooms are ceiling to floor. I had a corner room, and so I got plenty of sunshine. The marble bathroom is luxurious, from the Occitaine toiletries to the fixtures, especially with the rain shower head, and the two-way shower door. My bathroom did not have a bathtub. I didn't want to get out of that plush bathrobe and slippers that were provided. The room and the entire hotel are impeccably spotless. I don't know if I can say anything more about the bed that hasn't already been stated. The bed is dressed with feather comforters, pillows, and mattress top. It's like sleeping on a cloud -- deep and peaceful. Do not get into this bed at the end of a long day unless you plan to stay there for the evening, and good luck getting out of it in the morning. It's *that* comfortable. The hotel staff is exceptionally professional, attentive, and as another reviewer stated, quite unobtrusive. They all speak English well, without a snobbish attitude. Housekeeping comes and goes quietly, the front desk checks you in and out in a snap and, the concierge tends to everyone smartly and intuitively. The bartenders and valet were superb. Speaking of the valet parking, I used the valet parking $30CAD/day (in and out) while I was there. Normally, my car would be ready within 10 minutes, however, this particular weekend there were several weddings and other affairs being held at the hotel. So at times the valet service could take up to 20-30 minutes during events, and the vehicle reception area would be crowded and congested with vehicles and taxis loading/unloading passengers. The valet/concierge services were very apologetic and did their best to deliver the vehicles as quickly as they could. The bar/restaurant service during this time was also stretched as the staff augmented event service, but they always managed to give you the attention you deserve. However, the Renoir restaurant and bar was fantastic. They served remarkable dishes and drinks, and it is a popular spot with hotel clientele and locals alike. Not surprisingly, the food and particularly the drinks, are quite expensive. There are many fine and lesser expensive choices near to the hotel, and throughout Montreal, but if you do have supper at the hotel, you would enjoy it. The location is great -- near a Metro stop, the great shopping of Ste. Catherine, and the nightlife of St. Denis and St. Laurent, as well as the Museum of Fine Arts and McGill University. My only complaint is that for the price of the room, they should offer free wireless Internet in the rooms. There are computers (3 of them) in the lobby available to use at no cost. I found them to work very well and I didn't have to wait to use one. I exceedingly enjoyed the hotel and would return there.", "Date": "September 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york city", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Stay and Excellent Value !\u201d", "Author": "JayNewY0rk", "ReviewID": "UR44265033", "Content": "We stayed here for three nights with the \"stay 3 nights pay 2 nights\" promotion that Sofitel is running, what a deal!

Our room was 318, which is above the banquet hall where weddings and other things are held. The rooms are beautiful and we loved the bath robe and slippers! The beds were absolutely incredible and we didn't want to leave simply for that reason alone. Shopping of course was great and so was the food. We never did eat at the hotel, however walked to Old Montreal most evenings. Its about a 25 minute walk. We also walked up Mont Royal, which was also about 25 minutes on a straight upward incline! The only thing to mark our trip was on Saturday night. A wedding was being held and unfortunately it sounded like we were over a night club. We were able to hear the words to the songs and pick out what was being played. The bass was so loud that the mirrors were rattling on the walls. But being fairly young ourselves and not planning to go to bed too early, we didn't worry at first. At 11:30 I called reception and she stated that it should be over in an hour or hour and a half. We just put up with it figuring at 1 a.m. it would be over....it wasn't. At about 1:30 I went down to reception in my pajamas with my mouthguard still in. I was asked to sit in the lobby and wait for the Customer Service Manager, which I did wait - for about 5 to 10 minutes. He was polite and said I should have come down sooner and that the music would continue until about 2 a.m. He offered us another suite on the 9th floor. So sometime after 2 a.m. we were in that, however I was so mad that no compensation had been even offered - I couldn't sleep. I had so been looking forward to one last amazing sleep in that amazing bed! The manager had stated that we were welcome to use the bigger suite the next morning and take a late checkout. That wouldn't help us since we had a big drive ahead and planned an early checkout. We were also told that any room service we ordered would be put on the tab for our original room. That was a bit of a slight as well. I wasn't too impressed with him. I don't have is card on me anymore to remember his name. It didn't go over well though when a few hours later we had our alarm go off and had to hop on the elevator all bedraggled to ride back down to the third floor to get showered and packed. Of course someone got on the same elevator as us. How embarassing. We must have looked like something that had been run over a few times. Anyhow, saving grace was that morning upon checkout with big bags under our eyes, there was a different person on the front desk. He originally checked us in and was FANTASTIC to deal with. He sincerely apologized and said we could expect to be contacted about the situation. So that has made me feel better. We hope we will get our moment of recompense. Today is our first day home and we have yet to receive that phone call......I sure hope it comes because we would still love to go back to that hotel. The amenities and service from the staff (other then that one rep on Saturday night) were wonderful. Its a great place to stay.

Got to the hotel to check in to be met by a very snooty front desk girl who was VERY unhelpful. Asked for a room with 2 beds - not possible unless I was willing to pay $50/night extra. Then asked whether the room had a coffee maker or if we could get hold of a kettle - not possible unless you upgrade at $50/night extra. We travel with our own tea and cups so all we need is a way of heating water - they weren't willing to help out even with that. Got to the tiny room - you could touch all walls while holding onto the bed - to find that there was no tub - just a shower. It was -20 outside, we were cold and needed to thaw out in a hot bath. Called Reception - yes, a room with a both was available - but you guessed it, at a charge of $50/night! This was the straw that broke our back - their Superior rooms are tiny, have 1 bed and no bath - so what is \"superior\"?

The bathroom had both a bath and shower; it was perfect, as was the bed. Housekeeping was impeccable.

In the future, I would request a south or west facing room. - traffic noise could be heard on the 5th floor; the hotel was generally quiet but we could hear the ice machine at night; - windows do not open so no fresh air; - there was a cigarette burn in the bedding--a very small detail that did not bother us. Breakfast was served in the Renoir restaurant; on the first visit we were seated immediately next to the open kitchen but otherwise both service and food were excellent. On the second visit we reserved a table at the window; they claimed they did not have a reservation and, although there were many empty tables, they made a bit of a fuss.

We had a corner Superior King room. Our children had a Deluxe room with 2 double beds. Great location in an upscale residential and business area. Safe, clean and many cafes and dining options in walking distance. Each room had floor to ceiling windows. The corner room had windows on two sides. The A/C was effective and quiet in each room. The rooms were very clean and quiet. The Deluxe room is larger than the superior (which is a very good size), with much more storage space and a tub as well as shower in the bathroom. The storage space in the superior room was inadaqute for 2 people staying for a week, but we were creative, using every drawer and shelf, and it was OK. The Deluxe room came with a flat screen panel TV, while the superior room had an old fashioned tube TV. Glass enclosed showers, which doesn't work well for older children sharing a room. The shower in the superior room is very large, and comes with a rain shower as well as a hand held sprayer. The sink was a very attractive bowl design, but very little counter top space. Much more counter top space in the bathroom in the Deluxe room. Granite and marble and upscale fixtures throughout both bathrooms. Comfortable bathrobes. While many hotels boast of their bed linens, and some offer triple sheeting, this hotel only had a comforter and no top sheet. That was surprising. We asked for a top sheet for each of the beds, which was provided. The pillows were OK. The bath towels and toiletries were of very good quality. The beds were on the firm side, acceptable, but no competition to the Weston Heavenly Bed. Internet access is extra, at $16 per day. Since we only pay about $25 per month for high speed acess at home, we skipped the internet service in the room, and used one of the 3 free computers located in a business hospitality section of the lobby. The hotel might earn more if they charged $5 per day, which would undoubtedly get more customers for them. Parking is $30 per night. There are many garages in the area that charge much less. Valet service is prompt. Thanks to the person who wrote about the exchange rates offered by the Omni hotel about a block away. The Omni had much better rates (about 10% better) than the Sofitel. The entire staff is very accommodating and friendly. Trendy, modern and large lobby which is very interesting. The lack of storage space in our Superior room, lack of sheeting on the beds, and the beds just being OK are the main drawbacks. Couldn't decide if we should give 4 or 5 stars because of this. Decided to go with 4 stars because as a luxury hotel, these items should be addressed. Would nevertheless stay there again. Recommend Van Houtte Cafe at 400 de Maisonneuve O, just down on Stanley Street about a block away, for breakfast.

When my husband and I chose to get away from the usual family hubbub for a long weekend over the busy Thanksgiving Holiday, by driving to Montreal, we booked the Sofitel naturally. Not only because we had excellent stays in other Sofitel hotels in the past, but the ratings for the Montreal Sofitel was so favorable on Trip Advisor. When we arrived, after a lovely drive through the Adirondacks of New York State, we were greeted by friendly, bilingual doorman \"Buon Jour!\" and check-in desk service people. Everyone was consistently friendly and always tried their best to deliver ideal service. From the first hello, to the waitstaff in the bar/lounge and the goodbye packing up our car, all were kind and personable. The room we had reserved at a very competitive rate, was clean as always and well appointed. We had a corner room on a high floor which afforded us two walls of windows, a large L-shaped room, ridiculously wonderful bed and stylish bathroom. (Has anyone seen nicer bathrooms at any hotels in the same price range as Sofitel?) The maid service was very kind and attentive, delivering weather reports, bottles of evian and chocolates every evening. Something I always seek is peace and quiet in a hotel, especially in a busy city, and this Sofitel delivered. We never heard anyone in the halls or in their neighboring rooms and the hotel was quite full. Location was great and the bar/lounge area was very nice. I have to state a couple of downsides, so here they are: 1. The restaurant, Picasso, while quite elegant and very french, didn't really have that extensive a menu. The first night there, we wanted to use their guest card for a free cocktail, but the bar and restaurant was packed with a convention meeting booked for the night. Why have the area open, if you can't get in? We recommend the Sofitel in Montreal highly to anyone looking for a nice getaway from the states. Its smart, stylish, fun and definitely the best you can get for your dollar.

Great service from the second we left our car, the doormen were prof. the desk staff was prof. the room staff was prof. people who seemed to enjoy their work...what a concept. The Hotel is an old converted office building that opened I think about five years ago. It is centrally located on sherbrooke street close to st. catherine street (shopping) cresent street and mckay street(bars every where) (restaurants everywhere). Close to shopping malls(cours mount royal is one) for those cold winter nights and the famous st. catherine street is just a few blocks away. You can even walk to the bell center to watch a hockey game if you don't mind walking abit. The rooms were small but the beds were like sleeping on a cloud, it was so soft and fluffy that it was hard to see the person next to you...well almost. The bathrooms were super clean marble throughout and the shower had a hand held and a overhead rain shower....hmmm heaven, all surrounded by floor to ceiling glass doors. the windows overlooking the city where also floor to ceiling and when the sun did come out the view was pretty spectacular. I am not sure if we were on the other side if we would have been able to see mount royal or if buildings would block that view. It would be worth asking i am sure the view would be spectacular. For those of you who like to hit a morning run you have trails going up to mount royal right behind the hotel that are challenging and safe for all joggers(remember it still is a big city) The restaurant in the hotel was top notch but your selection of eateries within close proximity to the hotel are unlimited. from hot dog joints to 5 star restaurants, oh ,and a starbucks just down the street. The hotel is expensive but if you want to kick back for a few days and impress your partner(s) then this would be the place. .", "Date": "November 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, ON", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at the Sofitel\u201d", "Author": "DMW73", "ReviewID": "UR6174064", "Content": "I had a nice stay in the Sofitel in August.

The Sofitel may not have free internet access and other freebees offered by other big chains - but what it does have is rooms that are incredibly clean and fresh; beds and linens that are to die for; rooms that are VERY quiet (you never hear anyone beside or above you), bathrooms that are actually big enough to move around in and some (not quite all) staff that are very attentive. We were there for 3 nights, and after the first day the doorman knew my name. The valet parking is swift, and cost in line with any other downtown hotel. The location is one of the best - and even though our room faced busy Sherbrooke street, the traffic sounds were not too disturbing. Still I would go for a room at the \"back\" of the hotel next time. You are steps from McGill, Holt Renfrew, the major art Museums, Crecent Street and the downtown core. The hallways have a wonderful pot-pourrie that form some reason reminds me of Hawaii. Don't know what it is but want it for my hallways at home. Agree with other posts that recommend walking a few blocks to the Eggspectation for a great breakfast at a reasonable cost. Be prepared for a busy spot - it's very popular among Montrealers.

The counter was black granite however the counter space was a little skimpy.

We spent 50 dollars for breakfast the first morning and after that we scouted for cheaper alternatives. We found a Van Houtte cafe on 2020 Rue Stanley that was not great but ok . We found it hard to find a decent, reasonably priced place near there for breakfast. It would have been nice to have a coffee maker in the room. Room service coffee was also very expensive.

The location of this hotel is really good, right near good restaurants and close to the subway.

We chose Sofitel based on knowledge of the brand, plus reader reviews at TripAdvisor. It is, indeed, a modern business hotel a couple of blocks south of University, within walking distance of Vieux Montreal if you like a long walk. (There is no shortage of taxis and easy underground access if you don't.) Looking for a promotional rate, we found a suite on Sofitel's 16th floor (17 is their penthouse, and there is no 13th floor) at $255 Canadian/night if you prepaid, non-refundable. We booked three nights, wondering what allegedly five-star hotel was giving away dramatic suites at that price, regardless of terms. Upon arrival, we got our answer. First, the web site offers an add-on flat rate for breakfast, but you cannot book it online. We paid for our room and then asked for the breakfast package. The desk clerk advised that since we had just processed our payment, we were no longer eligible for the breakfast part of the package. I asked about the \"free high-speed Internet.\" That turns out to be two computers at an open desk in the lobby, both of which appeared to be permanently occupied. If you want Internet in your room, that's $15/day. \"Is any part of the hotel wi-fi?\" \"Yes, the lobby, but that's $15/half-day.\" You get the picture. The suite was cramped, but it's tough to complain at $255Can. The sitting room was little more than a walk-in closet with a small desk. The bedroom had the dimensions of a room at your basic W (W Hotels set the bar for cramped). There was an extravagant bathroom, but it was so chopped up (hard to describe, but a kind of 'Z' shape floor plan) that it lost whatever cache it might have had. The room was clean, quiet, and the floor smoke-free. Smoke-free turns out to be a huge amenity in Canada's answer to Tobacco Road. Getting a dinner table away from the city's legion of chain smokers proved nigh impossible. This is not the format to report on Montreal's shortcomings, but we cut our trip short after one night. Of course we did not expect a refund for the pre-paid room (and luckily, we weren't allowed to pre-pay for breakfast), but we should not have had to demand a valet parking credit, and one would have thought a discerning clerk would have asked, \"Was everything all right?\" No such luck.

The lobby music was hip and calming. There are two computers that you can use to check email and surf the net. I like hotels that pay attention to the small details. The candels mentioned in a previous review are definitely a nice touch, as are the complementary apples at the front desk. Twice daily maid service is nice too. The maid leaves behind free, small bottles of water. The soaps, bath gel, and toiletries are all very nice. I barely used the stuff I brought myself. I loved my room, which was larger than my friends' room because of the fact that it was a corner room, I imagine. (Request room #818 if you can.) The bathroom has a sink which is basically a porcelain bowl on top of the counter (looks really cool). It also has a shower with two shower heads (a removeable hand-held one and an overhead rain shower). The bed is super comfortable! As for the gym, it's true that it's not large. We had read that the Omni a block away had a nicer gym and (because we enjoy working out) we considered switching to the Omni...that is until we saw it. It just wasn't worth sacrificing a MUCH more comfortable stay at the Sofitel just for a bigger gym, which really wasn't all that nice. So instead we purchased day passes at a gym less than a block away for $20 CAD. I can't remember the name, but the hotel staff can tell you. It's a very nice gym and well worth the extra expense: extensive free weights, cybex, cardio machines, pool, towels provided, locker rooms with sauna and steam rooms. The works! We ate breakfast every morning at this place a couple of blocks away called Eggspectations. They have a HUGE menu of all kinds of breakfast foods.

In a city where the quality of hotels seem to get better with every passing year, Sofitel Montreal can certainly be ranked as one of the elite hotels in the city.", "Date": "November 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Luxembourg", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel but.......\u201d", "Author": "jmalux", "ReviewID": "UR4038987", "Content": "The Sofitel Montreal is indeed a very nice hotel but I fail to see that it is so wonderful as other reviewers claim.

The carpet had several big stains (red wine etc.) which had been removed without much success. We found a thick layer of dust on top of the closets and we had to make two requests to have it removed. There is a rainshower but the water pressure was so poor that we couldn't use it. Instead we used the normal shower head. Great toiletries. The bed is among the best I have ever tried. The gym is in a tiny closed room and not really a place where you want to stay for long. The equipment is OK and there is free fruit and water.

The hotel is on Rue Sherbrooke which is like Montreal's version of NYC's 5th or Park Ave. Mont Royal park is one block away as is the metro (which is wonderful, fast, perfect)--the hotel room was beautiful--marble bath with tun and marble stall shower--very large, big thirst towels--BUT, the best part off all was the BED--there wer 4 king size very expensive down pillows which were sol big and soft that we could not leave the bed--and under us was an enormous lush down featherbed--you will not want to go home after sleeping in this bed--trust me---the last night we stayed we had to wake up very early for a flight back to jfk at 6am so we were up and in lobby by 4:30--I asked about coffee and, within seconds, a cart came out with a huge silver urn of coffee and service for two and a waiter wearing white gloves!!! pretty impressive", "Date": "September 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, FL", "Title": "\u201cDespite an bumpy start...a great ending\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3925754", "Content": "My wife and I just stayed at the Sofitel last week for a 3-night stay.

The front desk staff was extremely apologetic and made arrangements for us to stay at the nearby Sheraton--a few blocks away on Rue Sherbrooke. Despite being placed in a suite for the first night we were very disappointed...obviously the Sheraton was nowhere near the caliber of hotel we were used to or what we were expecting at the Sofitel. We informed the Sofitel of how unhappy we were and I must say that from that moment forward they made every possible arrangement to make us happy. They started by upgrading us to a junior suite at the Sofitel for our return on the second night. The remainder of our stay was spectacular. That evening the night manager sent us a fruit plate and an apology note for the previous night's events. The concierge was wonderful...he made reservations for us at two local restaurants that were great. I highly recommend Le Blanc in the French Quarter and a very stylish italian restaurant by the name of Cavalli (just a few blocks away from the hotel). We were greeted at both restaurants with a smile....they VIP'd us the entire time we were there.

Service was extraordinary, the room was small but very clean with lots of extras, the bathroom was among the nicest I had ever seen, and the bed was really comfortable. Parking was steep, $20/day, but I guess that's becoming pretty standard for city hotels. We did not eat in the hotel, but there was a great little breakfast/lunch place just down the street (actually on a side street, but I forget the name) called Vasco de Gama that we ate at every morning we were there. A little pricey, but great food with lots of fresh juice and coffee. I was surprised this place was not in our Fodor's book on Montreal. Speaking of food, avoid Mr. Steer's on St. Catherine at all cost. Amazingly Fodor's gave this a decent review but we just found it awful. Most of the other recommendations were pretty much on target though. Very much liked the bagel place called St. Viateur near Mont Royal. We took a dozen home with us. It was very hot and humid while we were there (90s with humidity about 70 percent). Although the hotel is close to a couple subway stops and is very close to St. Catherine St., we were disappointed that the subway did not stop anywhere near the old part of Montreal near the waterfront. This made for a little bit of a hike, which in most cases would be fine, but in the weater we had it was tough. We were sweating almost immediately. Recommendation: Pack plenty of water with you when you go out during the summer here. A hat would be good too. All in all we were very happy here. I might have opted to stay at a place closer to the old part of town had I known the city layout a little better and the limitations of the subway, but in any case this is a great hotel. Probably caters more towards the business types due to it's proximity to downtown.", "Date": "August 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alpine, NJ", "Title": "\u201cMontreal Sofitel is not with the program.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3704256", "Content": "I have stayed at other Sofitels and I would rank the chain in Montreal at the bottom.

We were then given a room on a non-smoking floor which smells like a smoking room...to add injury to the matter, the room had little drops of blood on the carpet and wall which the cleaning people have missed. My children found them. It went on like this all weekend, with lots of apologies from the management when you talk to them but very slow in action. I would also advise you to take the advise from the consierge with a bit of caution. When I asked him for a route to Old Montreal so that I could walk with my two children, one in elementary school, I was given a route with a street laden with obscene/--- industry.

I've stood at the desk waiting to ask a question and waited while the doorman, desk staff and bell staff had a long personal conversation before someone finally, rather grudgingly, helped me. On the good side, the hotel is fairly new and decorated in deco style. Beds are very comfortalbe and baths are marble with separate shower and large,deep tub. (deluxe room) Large closets and the usual chair/ottoman finish the simple and clean decor. Houskeeping is spotty and all the little things that make a 4 star hotel a 5 star hotel slip away. Hard to get service in the resturant, that serves average food. Montreal is a real food town and you do much better walking to any of the many excellent local places.
