Both were massively spacious and extremely comfortable beds, kept beautifully clean and some great views out over Paddington, both sides of hotel. (Providing on high floors)....

Had to retell and ask when handed key. Felt it was unprofessional and lack of personal care. Out the lift on 6th floor had to go through door straight on our left, not that unusual in terraced hotels. Suddenly, I was sprawled over the corridor as unexpectedly stepped into \"mid air\" as 2 very steep/ deep, but small width stairs! I jarred the metal brackets in my back, which were very painful for the rest of my 2 nights. Unfortunately, it meant could not do as much as planned on my trip either, which was very upsetting. After going out of room later, did see a tiny warning sign on the door. It definitely is not big enough for the lethal drop waiting behind the door!

Everything else in London seems to have been booked out. If you are 4' 6\" tall and do not suffer from claustraphobia then this hotel would be fine. I am 6 foot tall and while I don't suffer from claustrophobia, small tight spaces make a little uncomfortable. The bedroom I had was on the ground floor facing the main road. It was very noisey with only single glazing. To give an idea of the size of the room - the bedroom had one standard size double bed. On either side of the bed there was barely 1 foot of clearance until you hit the wall. You could not comfortably walk around the bed so getting into bed by crawling from the end of it was the only way. Not so bad though if the rest of the room was okay. Well there was 2 feet of clearance between the end of the bed and the wardrobe. And that my friends was the extent of the room, save the bathroom - which was in all honesty not too bad in terms of size and condition. I entered the room with one average sized wheeled suitcase and a laptop bag. I put them down behind me at the door entrance and at that stage i could not move forward because of the bed and couldn't move backwards because my small amount of baggage was enough to block of the entrance! All in all VERY small. I tend to like to hang up my suit and shirts for the next business day in order that they are not wrinkled. When I attempted to do this I found that the wardrobe was not wide enough to accomodate the width of its own hangers! They hung at an angle, which meant that hanging anything more than two items in the wardrobe resulted in the door being wedged open. This had the affect of bunching up the clothes hanging in the wardrobe and actually encrouching into the already sparse space between the end of the bed and the wardrobe. To be fair the room was not in bad condition but it is extremely small. I have stayed in other small city hotels before, but this is extremely snug, the smallest i have ever seen. For more than one person travelling with more than one suitcase it would be impossible. The only other comments I would have is that the whole hotel is 'snug'. The corridors are narrow. Downstairs for breakfast one is inclinded to bend down going through door ways because of the low ceilings in the basement area. I would hate to see the rooms down there if they are as small as mine on the ground floor, coupled with the low ceilings it would be like sleeping in a coffin. So if you are hobit sized with hobbit sized luggage then go for it. If not I would suggest looking else where or at least preparing yourself for a 'snug' experience.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel; worth a visit!\u201d", "Author": "Livy1000", "ReviewID": "UR124800190", "Content": "Stayed here for one night as I was attending a friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday dinner.

I've selected very good as much better than staying in similar hotels and chains of hotels - although if we had paid full price I'd have been less impressed. It wasn't perfect - the first annoying thing is that it has an entirely different name in gold lettering across the top where you would expect the name of the hotel, which is very disorientating when you're looking for it. We went by the address numbers after spending far too long wandering around and when up close found a small plaque with the name on that we were expecting - If it says Park Lane across the top you have found it! Secondly our key card needed re-setting every night when we returned, very annoying when you've gone up to the third floor, the door doesn't open and then you have to go all the way back down. This happened for the additional two nights we stayed after we checked in. In all it is a good place to stay, you will often need to change twice on a tube so expect some travelling and if like us you made the most of your day this is not cheap as we travelled at peak times (before 10am and after 4.30pm).

A large room to sleep four for my daugher and grandchildren and what was supposed to be a deluxe double for my husband and I. It is the smallest double room I have ever seen. The space around the bottom and side of the bed must have been approximately 9 inches. At the bottom of the bed you also had to lean over the bed otherwise you would have bumped into the large wall mounted television. I asked three times to check if there had been a mistake regarding the room and was told that this was definitely a deluxe room. The bathroom is also tiny - getting dried is almost impossible as you keep banging into the wall and shower cubicle - we ended up having to leave the door open into the room. I am aware hotel rooms can be on the small side but this one took that rule to a new level. Having had a hard day shopping and sight-seeing we thought a relaxing drink in the bar might be nice. The bar turned out to be in the breakfast room. The only place to sit was at a dining table. There was a very poor selection of drinks (all warm) and after just one drink we were asked if we required more at the bar was about to close - this was approx 10.15 p.m. I accept that we did pay a discounted price for the rooms. having booked through an agency but the cost of the two rooms (without breakfast) came to \u00c2\u00a3358.00 for the one night. Also payment was taken upon check-in. A very mediocre breakfast served by totally miserable staff could be purchased for \u00c2\u00a312.00 per head.

The hotel was clean, although rather impersonal, and did exactly what it said it would; a decent room, bathroom, and a satisfactory breakfast. Beware - The Shaftesbury Premier Paddington is a few doors down across the road - the two look very similar, resulting in a bit of confusion! The room: fairly small - neither I nor my mum are very tall; had we been, we may have struggled for space and legroom. After opening the door, there were four steps down into the room, halfway up which was the bathroom door, which opened outwards. So be aware if you are someone with mobility difficulties, or if you are afraid of falling up or downstairs in the dark, you should check this out. Adequate tea and coffee making facilities, with biscuits and fresh fruit and a daily newspaper provided. The bathroom was tiny, with the smallest of ledges on which to put toiletries etc. The shower was somewhat \"cosy\" in terms of elbow-room. However, again it was clean and there were plenty of towels, with shampoo, conditioner and shower gel provided if you needed it. Our main gripe was with the temperature in the room and hotel in general. It was extremely warm - the air con unit in the room did not appear to work at all, and the window was sealed shut. This, coupled with the tiny bathroom, in which I don't think the fan was working, made for a very sticky and uncomfortable time after two people had showered. Breakfast: Usual hotel fare, with full English as part of buffet. This was ok, although not always piping hot. Disappointingly tea and coffee was from vacuum jugs and was \"help yourself\". Judging by the very little amount which the waiting staff appeared to do, I didn't think it would overtax them to serve drinks hot and fresh. All of that said, we spent very little time in the room,and the hotel was well placed for what we wanted to do. Reception staff went out of their way to help us - I had e-mailed to ask for a room upgrade as the trip was to celebrate my mum's birthday. They said they had nothing available the first night, but that they would move us the next day. In the event we did not take them up on this, as we were only there for 2 nights, and couldn't be bothered to move, but we appreciated the gesture.

Needed a hotel in Paddington for a pitch meeting. I travelled down from up north, worked until 11pm at our London office, went to my pre-booked, nearby hotel for some sleep as I had to be back in the office by 8:30am. Got to hotel - the reception area looked really nice. They asked me to wait while they tried to find my details. The guy on reception was a bit dopey to be honest, so someone more senior took over. After a while they said that I hadn't been allocated a room yet. I asked how this could be possible seeing as it was 11pm and I had pre-booked. They clearly had over-booked and had given my room away. They said that they would get me a room in their sister hotel. When I asked where this was, he gestured 'down the road' - I asked if he meant the same named hotel across the road and down a bit? He nodded but said not to worry, he'd get me a cab and I would be in my room soon. 30 MINUTES later a cab turned up, which was just as well as I was near tears due to lack of sleep and the stress about the next morning's very important pitch. I got into the cab - the driver was very nice. I would like t point out that the people at the hotel did not apologise once or even seem remotely sorry for the inconvenience. So, the cab pulled out and went the wrong way. I asked where he was taking me and he said to Earls Court! I made him turn around and go back to the hotel just so I could have a rant at them, but there was no choice - it was too late for me to find somewhere else to stay and I was too tired and just wanted to go to bed. I did insist that they arranged a cab to get me back to the office in the morning - they suggested the hotel but I said why would I want to go back there and the very least they could do is get me to the office, for free, seeing as I would have to get up even earlier to get through the awful rush hour traffic in the morning (at least a 40 minute journey now rather than a 5 minute walk). So, off to Earl's Court we went (still no apology). The cab driver said that yes, the proprietor's were rude and this wasn't the first time he'd had to do this. So we pull up outside the hotel in Earl's Court, I get into reception, tell them my name and he does actually apologise but informs me that according to the system, I am in another of their hotels up the street, so off I trot. This hotel was quite a small, narrow affair, but ok. The staff were nice and assured me that my cab would be there for 7:30 and that I could have a free breakfast (wow - they'd normally charge \u00c2\u00a315, but it would probably only cost them \u00c2\u00a32). My room was on the top floor (the lift only went as far as the floor below). It was very small, but nicely furnished with a nice bathroom. However, it was very warm seeing as it was in the loft and the windows opened up onto railway lines so I was serenaded to sleep by the loud shriek of trains braking. That's not it... in the morning, I got down to reception at 7:20am the next morning. They offered me breakfast but I said I was ok thanks. They were very nice though. When I asked if my cab was coming, I think I jogged their memory - they'd clearly forgotten to order it and there was much whispering down the phone. They kept insisting I had some breakfast - I think they were trying to get me out of the way while they sorted my cab - in the end I said yes, thinking I would grab a croissant to go, but then the porter starts leading me out of the front door - turns out breakfast was in the hotel down the road that sent me to them the night before! That was the last straw - I declined breakfast as I was too angry to eat. My cab eventually turned up at 7:45 - late. So, avoid this hotel at all costs. I can't vouch for the hotel itself as I never got to stay there, but anyone can create a nice hotel.

The rooms were incredibly small (I would actually use the word pokey). They were in the middle of major refurbishments (which I was not informed of), the staff seemed fraught and immediately defensive of any mild criticism. Ongoing refurbishments had evidently left the hotel with no air conditioning (and it was a particularly hot few days) and although electric fans were provided, space in the room was so lacking that the fan kept getting knocked over. There was also no mini bar or fridge in the room, just an empty cupboard where one had clearly been, so keeping cold drinks cool was a problem. Broadband internet access was also advertised however it was slow and intermittant, again my complaint was simply greeted with a defensive shrug of the shoulders.

I stayed in a 4 star around the corner, only last year and not only was it much better quality and worthy of its 4 star rating and it was also half the price of this one!

Secondly: We were there on a very hot day and the air conditioning in my room wasn't working even though the manager told me on several occasions that I was wrong and that \"it is a hot day Miss, the air conditioning is definitely working!\" My air con controls said it was on full blast and at 17 degrees and you couldn't even feel anything coming out the vents. It was not working. I got a desk fan in the end which was adequate. Thirdly: The water was cold on both mornings which meant a cold shower before each hectic day of work. The hotel staff didn't mention anything about it and when I complained at checkout the receptionist said \"oh yes, the boiler isn't working\" she then went on to tell me the long story of how it was broken but didn't apologise until I questioned the level of customer service I had received throughout my stay. She still acted as if the cold water was my problem. All together a very uncomfortable, cramped and frustrating stay.

My colleague's room, on the contrary, was approximately of a fridge-like size. Most refreshing, when you are coming back after a whole day of work to rest for a while.

Otherwise, I could heard every bit of the conversation going on next door. For the last two mornings of our stay we have had cold showers. The always-surprised staff explained that there are some 'boiler issues'. There was a 'misfired' fire drill on the last night. It's painful to wake up at three o'clock, scared of the noise. Not bad for a 4 star hotel, huh? Seems like not a single staff person we've met had given any attention to our queries. A shame. Let's put it this way: next time I will go to Holiday Inn or Ibis. Yes, they are simpler, cheaper, etc. - but at least no one says they're 4 star and you know what to expect. If this is a 4 star hotel, then I am Albert Einstein. Oh!

Both myself and my partner were extremely looking forward to our stay in the 'delux doube suite' which I booked for \u00c2\u00a3150 per night (not including breakfast may I add). The hotel initially appears to have some potential- it seems clean enough and looks fairly standard from the outside. The location is also fairly central- only a short walk away from Paddington station however upon further inspection the walls and ceiling were yellow with dampness and there is no bar or restaurant available till after 6pm. We had specifically asked for an early check in and although we were initially told upon arrival that the room would be ready for 11am- we were still waiting at 1.50pm. The hotel staff didnt communicate with us in English much, except for the Bellboy who seemed more than happy to help us. When we eventually got into our room we were totally disappointed as the room was tiny and we had to walk in single file sideways to get around as there was only room for the double bed. There was metal poles sticking out of the wall which may have been the result of air conditioning removal but the job has never been finished. The hot and cold tap has been installed back to front which took us a while to figure out and so we found ourselves washing in cold water then later brushing our teeth with scalding hot water! The room doors dont close properly which we only realised the next day-when we noticed the door had been open all night and upon leaving another resident was complaining that her belongings were missing after she went out and, like us, never noticed the door only sounds like its closing. There was a que of very unhappy customers when we checked out the next day, and we left wondering what a standard double room could possibly look like since ours was apparently delux. A very dissapointing hotel in an area where many other more appealing hotels are available for much more reasonable prices. Also would have been nice to find staff talking in English more as we felt very uncomfortable and misnderstood during our interactions with some of the receptionist staff.", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Exeter, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGo Somewhere Else\u201d", "Author": "alfie0312", "ReviewID": "UR114706694", "Content": "We arrived at 20.00 after a long journey to be told that there wasn't a room for us.

With that mind read on. There are many bad reviews on here, but this hotel must have read them and is upgrading it's decor. I stayed on 014 a basement single room. It was reasonably quite (no accounting for guests noisily chatting in the corridor before bed). The reception, clean, a little worn, but recently updated, efficient (when the manager arrived to help) and not a bad experience. The route to the room, is poor, lifts are slow and I found only one. Even then the corridors are not wide ( big cases beware) and there are many steps and fire doors. Sign posts, at least to my room were poor and the decor old and worn. The room, well it was a single and I have stayed in smaller, but consider it very compact. Short corridor, desk, huge TV above, small cupboard below, wardrobe, single bed (obviously new, comfortable, clean and well made but with sheet and blanket, no duvet). The bed side table showed it's age but was well placed as were the light switches (important on dark nights to be easy to find). The window was unsafe though, didn't really open well, whined if not closed properly and didn't lock, though it opened onto a courtyard which looked secure except to other guests. The bathroom, was compact too. If you're a large traveller then it's going to be a squeeze. Well furnished and obviously brand new, good decor, vey clean, almost a pleasure. But the shower was small, OK for me, but again larger travellers beware, you ain't gonna bend over. Lighting through out was good, well placed and enough for all needs. Luggage space, only the floor land precious little of that to go around, so large bags are going to get moved a lot! TV was free view and some Sky channels, great reception, and enough choice for me, no movie or pay selections, but I didn't really look too hard. WiFi was non existent, but there was free and very speedy cabled broadband, though no good for an iPad or other wireless device. I did here that ground floor refurbished rooms have Wifi so it may be available in some places or in the near future. Location is good, reasonably quiet, easy walk from Paddington Station.

The site led us to believe that we were getting a room in a four-star hotel at the last minute for only $220/night.

We were a bit surprised to find that our bags (only two roll-ons) had not been shifted to our rooms when we returned four hours *after* the specified check-in, but so it goes. The room was small but clean. Good linens and comfortable bed. Nice bath. Quiet. No wifi in the rooms, alas. There was evidently ethernet connectivity but alas, that doesn't help much when one is traveling only with handheld devices. The hard-wired guest computer in the hotel lounge also failed to connect, but it took three different sets of guests observing this to the desk clerk before he verified that in fact all three sets were correct and then went off and presumably rebooted the hotel's router. This gave us a working machine in the lounge and also wifi there (but no where else in the hotel). Unfortunately, there was no email access: evidently whoever set up the hotel's router left common mail ports blocked. We could use our handhelds for web access to webmail but routine mail clients failed to work on multiple different platforms distributed amongst several unrelated guest parties. The sales-reps we shared the lounge with were not terribly pleased, nor were we. The clerk shrugged helplessly. You won't be able to print your boarding pass using the guest machine in the lounge: there's no printer. The clerk explained to us that this is circumvented by emailing said boarding passes to the hotel concierge who would then print them.

The hotel's facilities did not reflect the description of 4* laid out by Visit England or the AA and I have reported this to their inspectors. Tea and coffee making facilities were of poor quality. Room fridges/minibars and hospiitality had been removed. The hair drier was wired into a wall that did not have a mirror and the flex would not stretch to one. The ironing board was simply propped up loose against a wall will a burned and torn cover. There was no upholstered chair in the room and no side table. The hotel is clearly being refurbished and both rooms had very nice new shower room suites and had been recently redecorated. Nonetheless the rooms were so small it was difficult to sit on the lavatory, Bedroom furniture was old and shabby: scuffed, marked, handles loose and missing; and the bed sheets were worn and in one case torn. Throughout corridors coils of electrical cabling and piles of old newspapers were sitting on the floors for the duration of the weekend. On chekcing in and being asked to pay in full up front we were not informed that the air conditioning was broken. Later that evening we were told that it was in the process of being repaired - the repairs were not effective all weekend. Fans were not available and staff were not willing to sort any out for us. On three seperate occasions I asked for the duty manager to contact me. He/She failed to do so for the whole weekend. The breakfast room was clean and the cooked breakfast on offer was freshly cooked and plentiful if a little limited in options. The quality of the continental breakfast items was below par: tinned fruit, processed cheese and mechanically recovered meats. As in the bedrooms, tea and coffee were of a very poor quality. Candidly this hotel is not what is puports to be. It is not a patch on other 4* hotels in London. It's not anywhere cheap enough to make up for this. With the Lancaster at the end of the street less than 1/4 mile away offering vastly better accomodation and service plus fantastic views over Hyde Park for only \u00c2\u00a320 per night more, I see no reason to ever visit this hotel and certainly will not trouble to return to it.

There was a huge air conditioning/ventilation unit outside the window which was very noisy and went off every hour or so, actually when it was on it was fine because it drowned out all the other noise, but it would go off and on randomly.

On the other hand, one important negative: previous host must have smoked a lot (even though all rooms are non-smoking!), and the room carried a heavy odor of smoking.

A colleague was flying in on a flight a couple of hours after me and we both used the online booking system provided on the hotels website to book our rooms. On arrival I was told by the receptionist that there was no record of my booking. I provided her with a printout of the details and she told me it would take \"5-10 Minutes\" to get in touch with the reservations office and sort my booking. After 25 minutes waiting in reception I told the receptionist that I was due to meet people on the evening for work purposes and that I needed to get into my room to get changed as I was now running late. She told me she would contact reservations again. At this stage, the most irritating aspect of what was happening was that the receptionist was spending more time joking and laughing behind the counter with one of her colleagues rather than trying to rectify the problem. It took another 20 minutes before I was finally given a key card to a room (45+ minute delay to get the key card). While standing waiting for this problem to be sorted another guest arrived to reception to complain that there were no towels in his room. Having finally received my key card I made my way to the room - but the key didn't work open the door. I returned to reception and asked to speak with a Manager, but was told \"there's none on duty\". I told her I found it exceptional that there was no Duty Manager at 7pm on a Sunday evening to which she replied \"It's too late\". I rang my colleague who was flying in a couple of hours after me to warn him of the difficulties I'd encountered with the hotel. On his arrival he was told there was no record of his booking. After a significant delay for him, he was given a key to a room, which had three single beds in it rather than the double he'd booked. To the best of my knowledge there was no fitness centre in the hotel - but if they wished to establish one then they could certainly have used the room I was staying in as the sauna. The room was small, with a tiny window and the air conditioning didn't work! The heat was unbearable. I have stayed in many hotels around the globe for the purposes of business and pleasure and I can honestly state that this in probably the worst I ever stayed in.

The good points about this hotel are the staff are very friendly and welcoming. The main reception is lovely, brights with magazines on table. The hotel itself if small and the rooms, descrbed as 'Deluxe' are a wee bit misleading as they are very small. Not much space to move, but if you're looking for somewhere that is comfortable, clean and to rest your head for the night then this hotel is fantastic. The window had a street view and the sun shone brightly and beautifully into our room. The location is roughly half a mile from Hyde Park and there's access to two main tube stations a few minutes walk away. The area isn't too busy and there's a nice sense of community which I feel is often lost in the hustle and bustle touristy areas of London. My boyfriend booked this through Lastminute.com as a deal which included 2 tickets to see Wicked, the Musical. The seat tickets were brilliant and the value for money was superb! It worked out much cheaper than booking the two seperately, so if you're looking to go to a stage show then definitely buy in advance through here. Alternatively, in Leister Square there are tons stalls selling last minute theatre tickets at half the price you would pay in advance on Ticketmaster so if you decide to do it that way it might be worth your while to wait. As I said, the hotel was wonderful. Small but very friendly and clean. I was impressed with it more than I have been with some of the overly luxurious hotels I have stayed in. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because for one, I found the rooms to be a bit small to classify as 'Deluxe'.

The taxi turned out to be a mini bus, which we think belonged to the hotel, as it was not marked as a taxi. We were then taken to the new hotel and dropped about 50m from the entrance. The driver pointed to the hotel and then was off, no chance to say no take us back. The Grand Royale is a very old hotel and in its day (1850'ish) would have been called Grand. We had booked the Shaftsbury as we like hotels with a modern interior. At reception they informed us that they knew we were coming but our room was not ready so we left our bags and went for a walk. On returning an hour later we collected our key and were told where our room was (not shown). The maid was still cleaning the room and we had to wait for another 15 mins. THE ROOM!! We had booked a Superior Room. Good points - yes it was clean, yes it had a bed and a TV. Bad points - The bed was a small double, we can't remember the last time we had a hotel bed this small!!! There was about a foot of space on either side of the bed, infact it was so close to the wall that my partner stubbed his toe on the radiator during the night. Looking on the bright side there was no chance of falling out of bed - there was no room!!! The bathroom - Yes it was new but very very small. Infact I am only short (5'2\") but I could touch both walls both width and depth ways!! The last time I was in a bathroom that size was on a caravan holiday. The side of the bath was also very high which made it hard to get out of. The shower panel was so small that the bathroom was flooded when you used it. We were in a room at the back of the hotel, our view was of the back of flats and shops and the rubbish bins. So closed the curtains and didn't look again. Now to breakfast. We had breakfast on the first day but did not bother on the second. Most of it was cold, the fruit juice had run out and we had to ask for them to refill the containers. Watch out!! We had paid for breakfast at the Shaftesbury but when we checked at reception they said we hadn't, we had taken our booking paperwork with us which showed breakfast included. The receptionist said she would take this off the bill but when we checked out we were still asked to pay for it. Also the bar was closed during our stay. Overall we were very disappointed this was not what we would have expected in a 4 star hotel and would not book with Shaftesbury Hotels again.

As expected, finding a hotel within walking distance of Hyde Park for this date proved difficult on a modest \u00c2\u00a3100 p/night budget. Eventually we found the Shaftesbury Premier London Hyde Park Hotel which ticked all the boxes; perfect location (500m from Hyde Park), 4 star, the right price(\u00c2\u00a399). We made the booking through www.booking.com where there appeared to be a choice of 2 rate types. 1) Flexible \u00e2\u20ac\u201c This is not to be confused with other hotel chains\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 terminology where flexible means you can cancel but you pay a premium. If you read the T\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and C\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find that this hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flexible rate means that on the day of arrival, if the hotel is fully booked they will transfer you to another sister hotel across London and if your lucky, pay for your taxi. Fair enough though, they do print this in the terms and conditions so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re stupid if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t read them!! 2) Non-flexible \u00e2\u20ac\u201c After reading the flexible conditions, we were not going to fall for that trap, especially on such a busy night in London where the Hyde Park hotels would definitely be fully booked! We booked on the non-flex rate and paid a slightly higher rate (\u00c2\u00a35). So we arrive at 1.30pm Sat afternoon and go to check in. Hotel exterior looks promising, tree lined street leading down towards Hyde Park. Car park has smallest spaces ever; seriously if you have anything other than a smart car then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a write off! Reception, although small was nicely decorated and pleasant. After giving our name to check in, the young lady behind the desk looked like she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d had a bad day and we were about to find out why. She informed us that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153due to maintenance work and water problems\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.our rooms were unavailable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, however she did say that alternative arrangements had been made at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153better hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd so we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t greatly concerned. That is until we found out the alternative hotel was located at Holborn, a couple of miles of the road. This was not an option as the whole idea was to book a hotel within walking distance of Hyde Park. The young lady recommended a bus to use as public transport (she clearly had forgotten that a 40,000 strong crowd would have the same idea when the event finished). After much disagreement, it became clear there was no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153maintenance issue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at all and the hotel had clearly overbooked themselves. We were very unhappy and insisted it was the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s responsibility to arrange alternative accommodation. The best they offered us was a free phone call to the reservations team (booking.com)\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6rubbish. I insisted that the hotel was at fault and they find us something nearby, whatever the cost (as they would be paying any extra on the room bill elsewhere). After speaking to the manager, she told us to have a seat while she \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sorted it out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. As a taxi driver arrived, everyone who had been seated in reception, got up, got into the taxi/minibus and left. It soon became apparent that they had used this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153maintenance issue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd problem for other guests who arrived before us and sent them packing to the sister hotel which I assumed was previously empty! As soon as the reception had emptied, we were called over by the hotel manager and given a room key\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.apparently they had shifted someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reservation out and made room for ours (maybe because we kicked up a fuss or maybe because they realised we had booked on the non-flex rate). The reception staff were polite enough but fairly unhelpful at first! Once through the maze of corridors it took to get to our room, we were made aware of just how small this hotel is, apparently it has 119 rooms but I think there are only 13 rooms here, the building is just too small!! Rooms are tiny (cant be any bigger than 10 sq metres), bed touches 3 walls, curtains dirty, no floor space for anything but feet!! TV is awful, its at a 90 deg angle to the bed, you feel like you should watch it through a mirror on the wall! Now onto the bathroom\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.the smallest bathroom I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen. Reminded me of a hall of residence en-suite at university! Brushing teeth was a no go, when you bend down to spit/swill you bum hits the door behind you. If you had more than a 36 inch waistline, showers are also a no go zone! You simply wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to squeeze past the aeroplane toilet-sized sink to fit in the shower cubicle let alone wash your hair!! The toilet didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t flush properly either. These are basics!!! Throughout our 1 night stay, we must have seen 20-30 sitting in reception or outside on the steps waiting for taxis to other accommodation! I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stress this enough, It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a total CON and even if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re one of the lucky ones to get a room, its 2 star at best not 4 star!!

The room was incredibly small and I would never have believed it possible to get a single bed, bedside table, dressing table and wardrobe into such a small area.

The price, $350 a night was high, but seemed right for a four-star in London. We booked a 'triple' for my wife, I , and our six-year old, and a single for my mother-in-law. The lobby was large and clean and well furnished, and the check-in was smooth. The beautiful Polish girls who appear to run the place could not have been nicer. Our expectations rose accordingly. They were quickly dashed by the rooms. My mother-in-law's room was the smallest I have seen, at any price, anywhere in the world. It appeared to be a closet that had somehow had a room squeezed into it. The shower toilet combo was plainly designed for slim contortionists. I went to the desk to protest, but all the singles were the same. The $280 a night we paid for it was robbery. Our room was marginally better. There were three single beds in it, each one the size of a camp cot, and about as comfortable. The bathroom was ludicrously small. The folding shower door was hung an inch over the tub, so water went everywhere, soaking all the towels and toilet paper right off the bat. The hand-held unit fell off as soon as we turned it on. Hot water came and went with some drama, particularly for the person showering, who alternately boiled and froze. When we got all three suitcases in the room, we had to climb over the beds to get around. The AC consisted of a fan, and an open window. The tiny TV picked up three blurry channels, by virtue of a rabbit ear antenna, something I have not seen for 20 years. Our son used the toilet as soon as we got there, which immediately failed to refill. After a complaint to the desk, a guy showed up to have a look. He looked a little dodgy, so I waited to see what he would do, as he lacked both tools and any sense of purpose. He waggled the handle a few times, and opened up the back and peered at the workings, plainly with no idea what to do. Suddenly he hit upon the solution - if the shower tap was turned on, the toilet refilled. He grinned and shook my hand at this revelation, \"See, fixed!\", he chortled. I pointed out that this was a poor solution. He agreed, visibly disappointed at my reaction,, and promised to come back and have another go. We never saw him again.

I repeatedly asked for replacements but as soon as, the limited number, were placed on the tables they were swooped up by guests who had obviously asked before me.

It was definately worth the price. When hotels in London on average are over $200, finding one for this price was great. we paid around $155 CDN a night. reading the reviews i was kind of worried, it seemed like a mix bag of experiences. Location: from Heathrow, it is only 15 min to Paddington Station and from Paddington to the hotel a 5 min walk. The city siteseeing bus even comes by the hotel, so if you have a ticket you can ride into the city centre. Very convIenent to the tube station (many lines connect at Paddington). Close walk to Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. First day we walked into the city centre from the hotel, took about 1 hr, great way to acquaint yourself with a new city. Hotel is also convienently located to Kings Cross/St.Pancras Station, this is where you get the train to other parts of Europe. Hotel: when we first checked it, we were given a room on the 6th floor. to our surprise, when we open the door, there was someone watching TV. kinda amusing, we went downstairs and the problem was fixed. The hallways are very narrow, with some bendy turns, making suitcase moving challenging, but that's okay b/c u only move up and down once. The room: Very small, but efficiently laid out. (once we got to Paris, we realized that this room was 'huge' in comparison). The furnishings were cute and trendy. Bed was pretty comfy. The bathroom is small, but good enough, there is a tub with a shower. one problem is that when you shower the water goes all over the place, since the shower door is useless. We had one double bed in the room, and really only had enough room for our 2 suitcases, but again, you don't really spend too much time in your room anyway, so for the price it is okay. There is a fridge in the room which is great, saved some money by eating breakfast in the room. Coffee making facilities, it was only instant coffee, but it does it job. Internet in the room works of the TV so you don't need a laptop, but there is also a cable you can connect to. I believe that there is free wireless in the lobby. The walls were a little thin, we could hear some people speaking LOUDLY in the hallway, I think you just need to be aware of this and be considerate to others and not shout in the hallways at 7 am.

So more detail.. Getting there. Very handily located from Paddington Station, maybe 5-7 mins steady walk, which makes it ideal for people with an early start or late arrival using Heathrow Express to/from the airport. Reasonably nice area, felt quite safe walking along the wide, lit road with very nice properties on them. On the downside, there are 2Premier hotels on this road, the Paddington and the Hyde Park Paddington, on opposite sides of the road, neither of which had proper big signs above, so it is easy to go to the wrong one- and easy to miss them! Arrival Small reception area, staff looked a bit surly, but were actually helpful and smiley once you start. I was upgraded from a double to a queen (2 xDouble) room, which was nice. The girl on reception was apologetic that my room was not yet ready, and directed me to take a seat in the \"lounge/waiting area\" with a drink for the 15mins till it was ready. Comfy chairs and good selection of papers and magazines to read. I was collected and given my room keys within the promised 15 mins. Hotel appearance. Generally clean, with a few nice design features, but just a feeling of being a little shabby round the corners. Lift upto the 5th floor clean and working well. The choice of carpet was.... hmmm. loud? The corridors along from the room were pretty hot and stuffy.. The room Reasonable sized room, and clean. Large desk with tea/coffee making facilities and tv/internet keyboard on. The desk was pretty large and dominated the room a little, and was a bit beaten up and tatty- which brought the room down somewhat. The 2 beds were nicely made up with sheets, blanket and bed spread, 2 pillows per double, and 4 extra pillows in the wardrobe. Also in the room, iron/board, lugguage rack, clothes rail and a wardrobe with plenty of hangers, and 2 chairs, one stacked with plenty of extra towels (for reasons obvious later!). The bathroom WAS small... Toilet, basin with small shelf with tissues and 2 glasses. A bath with shower over, as well as a shorter handheld shower attachment,and a foldable shower screen. So small no space for a loo roll holder, so toilet paper was on a shelf behind the toilet. Again, hooks with a good number of towels. Problems.. There were a number of issues with the room.. The reason for the large number of towels became apparent- a quick shower and the floor was flooded. The aircon unit control panel was broken so couldnt change the temperature- and it got pretty stuffy! This explained why the window was open when i came in! The problem being that there was no lock on the window at all. However being on the 5th floor with no balconies, maybe this isnt as big a problem as it could be else where.. and at least the area is pretty quiet so there wasnt the usual london traffic noise. Service Good points, already mentioned the girl on reception and room upgrade. Rang down for a bottle opener, and it arrived within 4 minutes, and the staff member even opened the bottle for us. Bad point There is a small room service menu until 10pm, however upon asking it was unavailable as the waitress had gone home sick. The girl on recpetion was helpful and offered a selection of takeaway/delivery menus to choose from instead and recommened a good thai place around the corner. So. Would i recommend it? If you object to paying the high mid week london rates, and dont mind a few rough edges, then you will have a clean bed, and reasonable stay. if you like all luxuries and super smart, then go somewhere else..", "Date": "January 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheshire", "Title": "\u201cHyde Park - Stay at your peril!\u201d", "Author": "Noggin52", "ReviewID": "UR12284823", "Content": "Thought I would give my review on this hotel. Reason - because this is by far the worst hotel ever, in my experience of staying in London Hotels! This should have been a great 20th anniversary weekend for me and family, so we booked 2 rooms to accommodate us all. When I reviewed the recent comments on line I was a little concerned. However, we decided to stick with this as it couldn't be as bad as some of the reviews!! Bad move! The hotel has an impressive facade, but I am afraid the good points end there. At reception we were asked to pay our full bill in advance, very unusual I thought, especially since we had not even seen our rooms yet. But it gets worse and maybe the best thing is to bullet the comments I have to make: 1. Size of room - so small it was not big enough for a single bed never mind a double (and superior size at that!). There was approx 4 inches of leg space to pass the end of the bed. 2 Size of bathroom - how this got planning permission is beyond me. The room was about 2 feet in width, so small that there was no room to bend at the washbasin. The shower cubicle at 2 feet square was just enough room to stand in, although washing was quite difficult! The cubicle door only opened about 18 inches because this then clashed with the wash basin! 3. Towels - why was it so difficult to get towels in this hotel? No towels on arrival (pm). Initially had to request from reception. No towels again when we arrived back on the second day of our stay. Again needed to request these from reception! 4. Why does a double room have only enough coffee and tea for one drink ie one coffee sachet, one tea bag and one milk! 5. This room was so tiny that the TV was in front of the mirror on the dressing table, so not only could you not use the dressing table, but you could not use the TV either unless you wanted to sit side on to the bed! 6. No storage space. 7. Fans very noisy immediately outside our bedroom window. 8. No dial tone on the phone. Our children were in a different room and on a different floor and we would have liked to have had the facility to communicate with them via the room phone. 9. The bed was very hard, hence it was very difficult to sleep. That is once we had overcome the noise from outside the window. 10. Finally, our discussion with the hotel staff regarding our concerns fell on completely deaf ears. It was as if, they have had our money now they dont give a damn! Completely disinterested. The room we were in was 'M3' and on further inspection outside the room it was obvious that this was originally one room (door architraves still evident), which has now been divided up into 3 double rooms!

The Hyde Park Paddington is beautifully and very conveniently situated in the lovely Westbourne Terrace, five minutes walk from Paddington station. The area is safe and easily connected to both Heathrow and \"downtown\" London. However, we got our first surprise as we discovered that the hotel changed from 4 to 3 stars after we'd booked but before the trip took place! It turned out to be a lot closer to 3 stars, the rooms being very small and averagely, but sufficiently clean. Judging by the interior, we got the impression that the rooms had been redecorated fairly recently. The bathroom was delicate, but ridiculously small - there was a small square metre of floor in between the bath, WC and washstand.

One thing struck us as odd: Our reservation included a preference for a twin-bed, non-smoking room, which the reception staff confirmed upon our arrival. Despite their announced awareness at this point, upon checking in we were presented with a double-bed room with a pervasive stench of cigarette smoke. As we complained, we were given a twin-bed, non-smoking room in stead - why didn't we get that in the first place?

Their letterhead now reads \"Shaftesbury Hotel Paddington\" The Good: Free hi-speed ethernet internet connection. Does flake out at times, but otherwise reliable. There are computers in the lobby for those who forgot theirs, or need to access the internet while someone else is using the room connection. Family Room (sleeps 4) good size for family w/ small kids or two couples who do not mind tiny quarters. Nice flat screen TV. A lot of fine places to eat in surrounding area, including small shops to purchase cold items. Super convenient access to ATM and Paddington Station (rail and London Underground). You have access to underground lines: Hammerstein/City, Circle, and District. Downtown buses also terminate nearby. When exiting Paddington Station, exit Eastbourne & Praed (do not cross Praed). Go to Westbourne, but do not cross Westborne Terrace street. Turn right. The hotel, not marked, is on the same side of the street Only a 5-10 minute walk. The Bad: Family with teenagers -- especially one of each, you'll end up with double beds. Apparently, no twins available. Room so small, you cannot get to the closet. Refrigerator almost out of the question. Ours did not work. Emitted heat that only compounded the temperature issue. Maid service -- diminishing towel replacement. Spent 5 nights, each new service, we were missing replacement towels and/or bathmat. Reception Staff only process in and out. Cannot (whether incapable or under instructions) answer many simple questions about the area. No free breakfast. No matter what their website will advertise, plan on eating outside -- \u00c2\u00a310 for pre-order, \u00c2\u00a312 for drop-in. Go down the street, and enjoy the same advertised meal for \u00c2\u00a36. Restaurant only opened for breakfast. Did not see bar/lounge. Could exist on basement level as well. When receiving documents (fax), make sure sender instructs reception staff to alert you. Otherwise, it will sit at the reception desk. The Ugly: When we were there, humidity = 80-100%. No ventilation or air circulation. Hotel will offer stand fans, but only good for small area. Really does not resolve discomfort level. No bathroom/shower exhaust. First one into the shower, gets the best. Last one, the bathroom is a steamroom. Did I say -- broken refrigerator? Family room good for two committed couples or families with small children who don't mind sleeping in the same bed. Families with teenagers, beware. Mini spotlamps in bathroom, sleeping areas and hallways. None help with the climate (extremely hot) nor environmental friendly. Would recommend to hotel to change certain area to florescent tubes, would reduce heat and save energy. No garden. Views of street or back towards buildings and roofs.

It would have been compact as a single but as a double it was pathetic. You can only exit one side of the bed as the other is against a wall. There is barely space to move around and the bathroom is so tiny that there's no space for toilet paper next to the toilet; it's out of reach by the far wall.

Unfortunately, the hotel was full so we had to put up with the nicely decorated but microscopic room. Good things are free mags and wireless broadband but it's only in the lounges on ground floor. The room was heavily discounted but GBP 99 without breakfast is way over the odds for this standard of accommodation. You can do very much better in the neighbourhood for the same money.

However, I was very impressed that it was nowhere near as bad as had been made out. Dealing with the negative comments that others have made: Unfriendly staff - I have to admit the receptionist wasn't the friendliest but she was efficient. Check in time - the check in time is quoted as 2pm. We arrived at 12.30pm and I was expecting to be told to go away and come back later. The receptionist called through to housekeeping as our room wasn't ready yet and found a room that was ready and checked us in. So far so good. The room - possible one of the bigger rooms I have stayed in in London. To be honest most hotels are the same, they try and cram as many rooms into the space they have to make as much money as possible. At least here there was space to walk around the bed which is always a plus point in London. Bathroom - the bathroom looked newly decorated and was very clean. However, there was a pungent smell coming from the shower as if the water was being brought in from the Serpentine! We just had to keep the bathroom door closed so the smell didn't come into the main room. Also, the shower was very small but again that is the same in most London hotels unless you can afford to spend \u00c2\u00a3200 a night. The shower was an electric one therefore no issue with hot water running out. As mentioned by another reviewer the walls are incredibly thin and you can hear conversations in the next room. You just have to hope the people in the next room go to bed before you do and don't snore! Again, I've stayed in lots of hotels where that is the case so this hotel doesn't stand out on its own on that issue. The only other hiccup we had when we arrived was the room number. We were allocated room 809 which turned out to be on the ground floor and not the 8th floor (there is no 8th floor which we found when we got to floor 7 with our bags and the lift wasn't working!). On the ground floor the room was signposted 09, not 809 so we had an unnecessary trip up 7 flights of stairs. On the whole, the room was very nice. The bed was comfortable and clean, there was air-con, a tv, tea, coffee, biscuits, internet, hairdryer, all the usual things you expect.

Beautifully and recently redecorated, I was pleased they had my reservation and checked in. The room was small, the bathroom even smaller, but everything was going to be OK until I discovered there was no water - only gurgling and hisses from any of the taps. The front desk told me they were aware of the problem, the plumbers were fixing it and water would be restored shortly. I went for a walk. The hotel is in a nice part of London, Bayswater, and very close to Paddington Station, just a few hundred yards away, so it was easy to take the Tube to the theater district, Soho, and stop in the many used books stores along Shaftsbury Avenue. I returned around 9 pm and discovered still no water and more ominously, no gurgling or hissing. I called the front desk again and was told that the plumbing had been fixed and most of the hotel had water, but it would take a while for the tanks and pressure to fill and reach the 4th floor. As I had to be at Heathrow around 5:30 the next morning, I turned in. I was awoken at about midnight by a guest, Japanese, from the sound of it, angrily complaining to a staff member about the lack of water and how unhygienic it was that he couldn't flush his toilet or wash his hands. I got up and checked - true, still no water. I called the front desk and got a varying babel of stories about why there was no water and when it would return. I asked to speak to a manager and was told that they couldn't be disturbed - and this got my dander up. I asked what would happen if there was an emergency, such as a fire (they would call the fire department - would they then call their managers? - probably not). I asked to change rooms to a lower floor where there was water (only now to be told that the entire hotel was without water) I asked to be relocated to another hotel with water, asked for my money back, nothing budged the 3-4 useless minions left in charge. In the distance, I heard another guest yelling that there was no water. It was turning into a nightmare. So, I was stuck, facing two six hours flights the next day and a 5 hour layover in Toronto, plus a two hour check in at Heathrow with fresh clothes but stinking like a homeless tramp. I really needed to clean my teeth - no luck. The coffee pot mocked me as I realized it also wasn't going to work. This was not my plan to finish my English trip with a stay in a three star hotel in the heart of London. Since when had London turned into a Third World country? The final straw? I figured that the toilet should have had one flush - from before the water disappeared, and I chose the point to use the facility. The newly decorated bathroom was very small. and the toilet was situated in the small space between the very high-sided tub/shower and the bathroom wall. As I sat down, I realized I was being squeezed into a space smaller than the worst economy seat on the smallest airplane you can imagine - Who designed this final insult? What building and planning commission had allowed this inadequate design? What hotel inspector gives out the three or four stars this hotel had proudly displayed when this is what guests are subjected to? After my trip, I finally was able to get in contact with the booking agency who, to their credit, tried to obtain a refund from the hotel. Their advice, I should have called that night and they would have re-booked me elsewhere. Great advice, but I couldn't manage to make any international calls - perhaps my ignorance, but perhaps long distance calls were blocked on the phone. Eventually, after two weeks of trying to get somewhere with the hotel (and failing), the booking agency refunded my entire hotel bill themselves. I am grateful, but realize that this hotel has no incentive to change or improve its service - they are still listed and still getting paid in advance reservations - and then they stonewall and try to avoid taking any responsibility for the substandard accommodations and service they provide. My advice - unless you are a gambler and figure this could never happen to you - AVOID THIS HOTEL. Final note - be aware that this same hotel property seems to be operating under varying names. The one hotel occupies several terrace houses on Wesbourne Terrace, #78-82. In March 2007, the hotel had The Hyde Park Paddington above the door, yet the hotel is also actively listed under the names: The Shaftsbury Hyde Park Paddington (perhaps a new name) and it can also be found under the name Hotel Senator (perhaps a former name). But it appears that you can book the hotel under any of these names. When googling this hotel to see if my experience was unique or not, I felt that many guests were reporting a variety of problems on a number of sites, under all the various hotel names. If I had read these comments in advance, I would have booked elsewhere - but then I didn't know I had been booked into a sister hotel that was closed for renovation - is this all a scam to trap unwary guests?

Firstly the TV didn't work well, exceptionally poor reception for local channels, movies didn't work nor did the internet access.

I had prebooked a cooked breakfast. The restaurant was very clean and modern and well laid out with both continental choices and cooked choices. There appeared to be only 2 staff so attention to guets was minimal. I had to ask for the tea and toast and even then the tea was poured for me, no teapot left so that I could use as needed. The cooked food was very nice looking and a good choice but either cold or not very warm. Poor for a 4 star hotel.

I can't stress too strongly how very disappointed we were with the accommodations! It appears that only the very worst rooms are reserved for BA customers. Our ground floor room was a nominal 8 feet by 12 feet, with a very uncomfortable queen size bed, small desk and freestanding wardrobe 18 inches wide. Further, there was only one tall and narrow window completely covered by dark draperies, with no way to pull them back and allow light into the room. The window was sealed shut and, considering that the air conditioning throughout the hotel had failed about the time we checked in, there was ABSOLUTELY NO VENTILATION IN THE ROOM! The hotel did deliver a fan to the room at about 6 p.m. but in order to achieve any air circulation we had to prop the room door open with a piece of luggage. Needless to say, we cancelled the remaining two nights of our stay and we also cancelled a separate booking we had made for members of our family residing in the UK. During our very short stay, we observed 6 parties with confirmed reservations being told that there were no rooms available for them. These people were shuttled to the Best Western Paddington and told that they would be accommodated at the Hyde Park on the following night. We know from experience that the Best Western Paddington is not even a three star standard and it appears that one hotel is being overbooked in order to keep the other hotel occupied.

Upon arrival, the receptionist told us that he had no record of our booking. Then he told us that it had not been put in the system and the hotel was full, and he would have to shift us to a different hotel. In hotel-speak, this is called bumping, and we only ever do it under the most extreme circumstances and only once in a blue moon - it's very bad practice! We were assured that this hotel would be close, of a similar class and that they would pay for whatever taxi needs we had. Whilst we were waiting for a taxi, two more people showed up and the same thing happened to them. It appears that the hotel chronically and deliberately overbooks its rooms, a kind of 'bait and switch' method if you will, to allow them to shift business to other preferred hotels in their group or otherwise. After waiting 20 minutes for this taxi, I enquired as to why we couldn't take a taxi from the street, as there were hundreds passing the hotel. I was informed that the hotel had a 'private car' service (read: hotel group has made a deal with a particular car company). In the end, we had to wait 40 minutes for a car that we were told we would be sharing with the other couple. A word of advice: ask which hotel they are going to bump you to. If it is the Kensington International, REFUSE. This is an extremely poor quality, tiny old inn with the rudest manager on earth, and it is in Earl's Court, nowhere near the Hyde Park Paddington. I have no idea why they chose this hotel to bump us to since there were rooms available in several Paddington hotels. He put us in a tiny double room in the basement - literally, we were below ground and the half-window looked into a wall. When we went back to reception to request a different room, the manager became offensive, defensive and aggressive. I called the HPP and told them that this hotel was not suitable. The receptionist agreed to change us again, and again we waited 40 minutes for this private car to show up. While waiting I saw 6 other couples from the HPP arrive in cars at the Kensington International. In summary, HPP hotel staff are completely incompetent, the hotel they sent us to was ridiculous and unsuitable. The biggest problem is that, having read the other reviews, I suspect they have a policy which routinely allows for the overbooking of rooms in order to garner business for their other or affiliate hotels. This is dishonest, despicable and unacceptable. Please stay away from this hotel unless you wish to spend 3 hours of your night waiting for cars and speaking to incompetent receptionists.

After enquiries we were informed that maintenence problems were the cause of this inconvenience. The hotel reception area was chaotic and staff dealing with our query answered telephone calls whilst talking to us - customer service was extremely poor. I had contacted the hotel only one hour before to reserve a parking space and had not been advised of any problems. I asked why we had not been informed of this during the phone call but no one could give us an adequate explanation. We were advised that we would be moved to a sister hotel in Earls Court. I explained that due to the fact that we were going to a concert that this was a major problem because of time factors. Hotel staff were unhelpful and acted as if the problem was not theirs to resolve. During the period that we were at the hotel we saw other guests checking into the hotel despite the fact that we had just been advised that due to maintenance problems no guests were being checked in. We asked the hotel manager if we could have any alternative rooms not affected by the maintenance problems. Initially he said he had no rooms available. Then he offered us one single room. Then he said that he had two single rooms available. Staff, including the manager were giving us contradictory information at many points through our discussion with them. We asked the hotel manager if we could be given an adequate explanation of what the maintenance problems were but he refused to do so. We also asked if we could see the rooms that we would have been staying in - but again he refused. We advised the manager that we did not find this situation acceptable in any way and the manager asked us what he was supposed to do about that! As a result we had to agree to take transport to the sister hotel after the concert. We returned to the hotel only to be faced with having to explain the whole situation again to new staff. We were assured by staff earlier that transport would be arranged and that we would not suffer any further inconvenience. The members of staff we spoke to that evening had not been briefed in any way and to add to the problem the staff had very poor english which complicated the matter even further. Eventually we were able to arrange rooms and transport at the sister hotel. Unfortunately we then had to wait almost one hour for transport to arrive. The hotel did pay for transport to the sister hotel but we were then appaulled to find that the sister hotel - The Kensington International , 4 Templeton Place, Earls Court was not what we expected. The rooms were very basic, with substandard bathrooms - e.g cracked sink, washing up liquid in the soap dispenser and cigarette burns in the bath. The carpet in our room was stained in several places and the breakfast was poor - white toast only , cereal with milk that was warm. During discussions with the hotel manager we were advised that we would receive a discount of just 20% for the inconvenience. He assured us that he would arrange this and that the money would be recredited to us during the next 24hrs. When we returned to the Hyde Park Hotel to check this we were advised that this had not been done. Moreover when we asked for something in writing to confirm this, we were also advised that this could not be done. We asked to speak with the manager once again and were advised that he was not available.

We had included in our price a full english breakfast but on arrival were told it would only be a continental and we'd have to pay \u00c2\u00a35 extra each to have a cold fry up! it was only when my partner took our printed recipt as evidence that they supplied us with this disapointing luxury. To top all of this off when we arrived the bulding site outside the hotel left just enough room to park our car in a very narrow space and pay \u00c2\u00a315 a night for the pleasure of it! It was only after we accidentally left our winge list lying around when we went out for the day that we arrived back to find the list gone, a new duvet, new kettle and an electric heater.( As there was no heating in the room because the electric control on the wall was broken, but they had been kind enough to supply a fan, what one wants with this when it is 3 degrees outside in december is beyond my kmowledge.) So i would advice you winge if you want anywhere near a warm stay. Also the electrics in this building were appaling, the lights flick on and off continuosly and every time they do, so does the tv!! The two good things i can say about the hotel itself is that it was clean and the staff at reception were friendly. So overall?

The hotel manager promised to compensate, but has yet to do so despite several follow-ups. I have reported the matter to the UK Department of Trade & Industry who have cited contravention of the Supply of Goods & Services Act 1982 that requires a \"service be provided with reasonable care and skill\". I intend to take it further and I suggest everybody else do the same. They cannot be allowed to get away with this. Email: \"Dear Sir/Madam, I wish to advise that I found my stay at the hotel mentioned below quite uncomfortable, troublesome and overall very unsatisfactory. The trouble began on the first night when we were sent to a so-called \"sister hotel\" a few blocks away due to an overbooking at the hotel. The other hotel was not of the same standard and the room was actually sub-standard. It was only when we forced the issue that we were able to spend the remaining six nights at the hotel we booked. I feel that the staff at the Hyde Park Paddington Hotel handled this matter appallingly. However, the main aspect of discomfort for our stay was the fact that the air conditioning was not working for the entire stay due to the refurbishment work not being completed. The room was extremely hot, not unlike very hot summer nights in Sydney Australia. Having the window completely open and the portable fan running did little to alleviate this. Other factors I would like to bring to your attention are: * The room was located next to a service elevator which was very noisy throughout the night and early morning. * The room internet (tv monitor) did not work properly. * The hot water was often lukewarm apparently varying in temperature according to general usage within the hotel. * The door was not sealed properly and let in a lot of corridor light throughout the night. * One of the bed lights kept breaking down. * The room iron was useless (was not a steam type). All in all, this does not accurately represent features of a supposed \"first class boutique hotel\" as you describe it, complete with \"luxurious features\". I spoke with the General Manager of the hotel (John O'Neill) and he promised that some sort of compensatory refund would be forthcoming.

I arrived in Heathrow on the overnight flight from Miami, tired and looking forward to a good sleep. On arrival in the hotel I was met by a scene of utter chaos that would make faulty towers appear like haven of tranquility. There was a crowd of about 12 people all complaining about different things. While I stood there, two different couples slammed their keys on to the counter, there faces flushed with pure anger, shouting about the fact that they could not even check out because of the incompetence of the staff. Another American couple beside me was trying to explain to a female staff member who was had about as much English as a parrot, where the Royal Albert hall was, and how do they get there. When I eventually jostled my way to the desk, they said that I did not have a reservation. As I tried to explain that I did, she was distracted by some one else who needed attention more then me. As I stood there dreaming of a bed, I was eventually told to sit down while they investigated. After about twenty minutes it became apparent that the only things that were being investigated where the broken lift, the fact that they could not find any reservations, and where this mysterious place called the royal Albert hall was. Despite the fact that I had a pre paid reservation, I decided that it would be a more sensible option to cancel my date in London that night and get the first available flight home. I walked out the door, boarded the Heathrow express, and got the first flight home to Dublin, which incidentally cost me over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300.00. This was a small price to pay to escape what can only be described as a scene as disorganized and chaotic as an A and E department in Saigon in the late 70\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. During my train journey home I reflected on the fact that it does not all ways pay to try out different hotel web sites, because as the old saying goes if it seems to good to be true it probably is. I travel regularly, and will be returning to hotels.com secure in the knowledge that if you have found a professional hotel booking service, its better to just stick with them. I have no doubt that other hotels on your site are superb, and the whole booking procedure was simple.

The room that I stayed in (queen size double) was small but comfortable but the bathroom was absolutely tiny. You would not even be able to use the bathroom if you were a large person (250+ lbs.). Our friends stayed in the three bedroom which was a great deal larger but the bathroom was still a little cramped. If you were a large person, you would probably get stuck between the wall and tub if you were using the toilet. The rooms were clean and neat but the rooms are not air-conditioned so it can get kind of hot. The restaurant was average but convenient for breakfast. The hotel was very close to Paddington Station so it was easy to get around the city.

It is definitely worth spending the extra dollars for a decent and comfortable night's sleep somewhere else. I normally research all my hotels on this site but opted not to for this one. What a huge mistake! My room was miniscule, mildewed, hallways were run down, carpeting threadbare, I'm certain my bed had bugs in it, and I did not feel safe and secure at all. I really felt the front desk staff would come and rummage through my belongings when I wasn't there. This place still gives me the creeps and I have nightmares from it.

This was by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Upon arrival we were informed that the elevator was broken and that we would have to use the service elevator to reach our room...in the basement! So some unintelligable bell hop crammed us, and our suitcases, into a service elevator the size of a small phone booth and sent us on our way. I almost lost my finger as the bare walls rushed past the open platform...and when we reached the basement I was suprised to find that the only exit from this death trap was to heave open a metal door. We made our way through winding hallways, doubled back a few times, and eventually asked a maid where room 1a was. Unfortunately she didn't understand a word, and we were forced to continue on our own. Eventually, we found the room, only to open the door and find a single bed, no closets, and barely enough room to walk. Not to mention the pugent odor of mildew that instantly sent my girlfriend into a sneazing fit. By this point we were very dissappointed and made our way back upstairs (in the death elevator) to the front desk and demanded the full-size room we paid for. To make a long story short, they switched our rooms to a room right next to the lobby. I'm convinced we were directly above the boiler as the room averaged 90+ degrees. The air conditioning was broken, the TV didn't work, and the bathroom was about the size of the death elevator. During our harrowing 3 night stay, the elevator was never fixed, our TV was never fixed (even after many many requests), the AC never worked, and by the time we left we both felt sick.

I always try to see the good aspects in a venue, but I'm not joking when I say the only good things about this hotel are the lobby and the location. It looks impressive when you enter, but then you get dispatched to your room... Oh my. Tiny corridors (and I'm not a big person) lead to tiny staircases, which lead to tiny rooms. Maybe if you get a family room or suite, the size is okay, but regular/double rooms are appalling! You walk in, and within two steps your feet are touching the bed, which is wedged up against the wall. This means if two of you are staying in the room, one person has to climb over the other just to get out of bed! The hotel did provide a fan - because the air conditioning wasn't working months after being installed - but that just took up more room. It was impossible to open the closet door or sit at the desk because of the lack of space. The bathroom was equally atrocious in the lack of space. You can sit on the toilet and without moving an inch can wash your hands at the sink, turn on the shower and get a towel off the towel rack because the space is so cramped. I didn't speak to the staff, mostly because I was sulking at having been deceived about the room! I can't stress this enough: DON'T TRUST the hotel's listings on ANY website.
