My wife and I stayed at the adjacent JW Marriott previously, which made me familiar with the area. Ko Olina is a great spot on Oahu. 20 miles or so from extremely crowded Honolulu/Waikiki Beach. This property feels isolated in a good way. Far less crowds, plenty of space, etc. It sits on one of several identical lagoons. These lagoons offer ideal swimming, even for young kids, protected from the surf. You can snorkel, etc. without worry about currents or other boats. The hotel itself has several large pools and a number of hot tubs. They are cleverly designed to look natural, with rock \"grottos\" and other landscaping features. The rooms are perfect for a family. We stayed in a two bedroom suite. The bedrooms are separated by a large living area and full kitchen. The kitchen was handy for afternoon snacks and breakfast. Overall, the property is kept in excellent condition. Very clean rooms and public spaces, with the usual Hawaiian hospitatlity.

Unless you are a regular guest or a Marriott vacation owner, you better think twice! If you are a time share exchange owner, I suggest that you go elsewhere or you will be treated like a second class citizen! We were transferred 3 times within 2 days...the first room smelled like fish and when we opened the balcony door to let some air in, there was nothing but loud screams because we were located on the floor right smack by the lagoon. We asked for another room and they transferred us to another room which smelled like a musty old person and the location was where everybody meets to go somewhere, to socialize or just to play some type of ball game. On top of that, we had to request for an iron and a change of ironing board because the one we had had stains all over it and it was disgusting. The next day, they finally decided to transfer us at a higher level (thanks to John) away from all the noise and disgusting smells! We thought this was the end of our vacation from hell but no!!!! We had a rental car that was parked in front of our hotel and guess what happened? For some reason, our tires were flat - such a co-incidence! Private parking with an attendant 24-7 and we were parked right by the parking attendant!!!!! Hmmmm!

It required us to listen to a 90 min time share presentation, but 998 for 5 days here was very cheap, so we couldn't pass it up. First the Bad... Double check what the room type is before you pay. I was sold on a 2 bedroom description, but when I arrived, I was in a one bed room with one less bed. I was told the roll away was included, but when I checked in they said it would be 20 a night. When I requested another roll away (since the room only had 2 beds) they said they would accommodate us, after the women went into a long speech of how dangerous it was and how would I feel if my family was caught in an accident and the roll away kept them from escaping. Seriously I am not making this up. I told her maybe I shouldn't stay here if it was so dangerous. She said nothing has happened in all the time she has worked her. SO....why go into the \"your family will die in a blazing inferno if I let you use this roll away\" speech? They charged me ANOTHER 20 a night, so a total of 200 extra and I still didn't have the room I paid for. BUT the GOOD out weighted this because everyone else was amazingly nice. The resort was beautiful. The pools (there are a bunch, I think 4, including waterfalls and a water slide). are amazing. TIP: BUY YOUR OWN FOOD AND COOK IT. The restaurants are not worth it. Pricey and not good food. ALSO if you are Vegan, there is a Down to Earth Store 2 exits down that has amazing organic vegan food. There is also a target that has a HUGE food section.

We traded our time share in Maui to stay here. First off know that we are at least a 45 minutes ( with no traffic) from Honolulu and Waikiki. That is best case scenario for driving. Usually you should allow at least an hour to get into Honolulu. The Ko Olina area is away from all the chaos and touristy places. There is a free shuttle that will take you to the golf club, Disney Aulani Hotel and the JW Marriott Hotel. There is an ABC store, ice cream parlour and taco restaurant right here too. Having said all that, we love it. The studio that we are in is very comfortable. The bed is a really wonderful. I don't always acclimate to new beds, this one was just a dream away :-) There is a small refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker and everything else needed for our comfort and convenience. The staff here, and I mean every person we have come in contact with here has been amazing. I love the Aloha given to us here in Hawaii. There is a very nice walkway along the beach that connects all the hotels and the 4 swim lagoons. We ate two meals at Long boards, one of the onsite restaurants. Both times the food was very tasty. I will say that their happy hour prices are nothng to write home abou I don't consider $8.75 for a Mai Tai a \"happy hour\" price. Although that is a $3 discount! All in all we are having a great time. Don't forget to stop in at the Aloha Stadium Swap Meet. Sat./Sun. and Wed. The vendors are completely around the entire stadium!

We aquired our two bedroom suite through a timeshare broker (I never could have afforded the nightly rates through the resort) and were thrilled to see our ocean view when we first walked into the room. As we walked through, there were ohs and ahs from my kids as they ran around claiming beds. The rooms were very comfortable in size and the two bedroom easily could have slept eight with the two king beds and two queen sofa sleepers. The full size kitchen was great and they even had a BBQ area outside near the lagoon. My three kids had a great time hanging out at the pool with their new found friends and I felt very safe letting them explore (they're 15, 13 and 12) without us by their sides. First thing when we arrived was to get a drink and food at the little bar in the pool area. Drinks were good. Food was expensive, but only okay. Not what I expected, however I forgot all about it as I watched the sun set over the lagoon. It took us a little while to figure out the food situation. A family of five is expensive and I was fully going to take advantage of the kitchen. I would avoid the market at the resort if you'd like to conserve your budget. Instead, there's a small little market in the shopping center across the street from the Disney tower...their items were very reasonable given that it's Hawaii. Of course we also hit Costco and Safeway during our stay, which were only a few miles away. We opted to go to the timeshare presentation in exchange for one of their free rewards. I was actually curious how everything worked. What I expected to be a presentation was more of a one on one with a sales person, which turned out to be long and tedious. The presentation wasn't a requirement, but we thought we'd give it a shot. I loved the location of this resort. It was easy to explore the island without having to sit in the traffic I've experienced during previous stays in Waikiki. The weather was always beautiful in this area even when it was raining elsewhere, although I'm sure that may not always be so. All in all, we had a wonderful time and I'm very satified with our accomodations.

We stayed 7 nights in a 2BR condo in Hale Naia, the most southern building which is the closest to the beach and the \u201cbig kids\u201d pool (waterfalls, caves). I believe it\u2019s also the newest building since it\u2019s number \u201c3\u201d. We then went to Kailua for the weekend and returned for 2 nights to a 1Br unit in Hale Moana, the most northern building which is building number \u201c2\u201d. That is closest to the \u201clittle kids\u201d pool with the beach entry. It is the farthest from the beach unless you leave Marriott\u2019s property through the gate and walk through the public parking lot to the lagoon. In Hale Naia, we were on the 15th floor in the closest unit to the ocean. The unit and view were fantastic. We are not Marriott timeshare owners, but rented this unit from an owner on redweek.com. In Hale Moana we were on the 2nd floor that walked out to ground level about 50 yards from the pool. We did not have a view. We booked this room through Marriott directly. The units were comparable with Naia having nicer, newer stainless appliances and nice GE HE washer/dryer. Moana had a small room/office area next to the master bedroom that I really liked because I was able to set-up the pack n play in there. Ko Olina has 4 lagoons. All of them are open to the public. Starting from the north and working south is Lagoon 1, which is shared by the Mariott Ihilani and the new Disney Aulani. Lagoon 2 is used by the Ko Olina Beach Villas. Lagoon 3 is used by the Marriott Beach Club. Lagoon 4 has no resorts on it, is by the Marina, and has the largest public parking lot. It seems to get a lot of action on the weekends. Ihilani and the Beach Villas seem more geared toward adults while Aulani and the Beach Club cater to families. I did go and check out Aulani to see how it compares to the Beach Club. It seems very nice, but the grounds were not as large as the Beach Club\u2019s (which are not unmanageable at all). They had lifeguards, a lazy river and a big pirate-ship themed spray park. They also have a snorkel tank with lots of fish and lots of people. The overall quality seemed comparable to the Beach Club. I certainly wouldn\u2019t spend a lot more money to stay there, but if they were comparably priced (which they currently are not) I would definitely consider it. We went grocery shopping at the Safeway about 10 minutes away and mostly ate in our unit. We also used the grills outside. We did regularly go and get breakfast (donuts, muffins, etc, until they run out around 9am) at the Marketplace. We ate dinner at Longboards twice. The tuna melt is phenomenal. We ate at Roy\u2019s once, it is extremely expensive. We also considered eating at the local Mexican restaurant across the street from Aulani, but heard from other travelers that it was terrible. The only other non-resort restaurant option is a Hawaiian place by the Mexican place, but we didn\u2019t have a chance to try it. I heard you could get good ready-made meals at the ABC store behind the Mexican place to take back to your unit. Overall our trip to the Beach Club was fantastic and I would not hesitate to return. Service was excellent and the resort was beautiful. If I had to be picky, these are the changes I would make: enforce the no-kids pool (1 out of the 3) and hot tubs (2 or 3). Although I have kids, I can appreciate some adults would like to get away. I think it\u2019s great they have the \u201cquiet\u201d pool and the adult-only hot tubs, but the rules are not enforced. Also, add some picnic tables by the grills so people can eat outside. Finally, an airport shuttle would be fantastic since parking at $30/day is outrageous and a taxi runs $80. Finally, understand that Ko Olina is the dry side of the island. It\u2019s not the lush \u201cJurassic park\u201d Hawaii that you see in the movies. If that\u2019s what you want, take a trip to the east side of the island.

If you are on Oahu on business and need convenience from a business perspective, I would stay at the Ihilani. If you want lots of pools, lower prices and don't mind crowds, then stay at this property. Personally, I liked Aulani best for family vacations and Ihilani for business. This property offers nice grounds and larger units if necessary (it is a timeshare property), and is on one of Ko'Olina's less crowded, beautiful lagoons. It is also within a short walk of an even less crowded lagoon, and a Roy's restaurant. Specific complaints I have about the property are that the AC in my unit appeared to have some sort of motion sensor attached to it (i.e. turned off in the middle of the night, even though I set it to stay on) and the fact that the valets at the front lobby didn't suggest that I wait to unpack my car before checking in. I took everything out, stood around waiting for someone to attend to me, asked if they had valet parking, then they took my car. When I checked in, they told me I needed to take my car to a completely different valet area, so I had to put everything back, etc. The main breakfast location at the resort was also buffet only (no ala carte), which I only learned after being seated.

We had three major concerns with this property: 1) The room categories are highly deceptive \u2013 our \u2018ocean view\u2019 had NO ocean in sight; 2) If you are not an \u2018owner\u2019 you will get \u2018bumped\u2019 by owners on everything \u2013 I strongly caution against renting here; and 3) Our children got very sick following a full day playing alone in the pool. ROOM CATEGORIES \u2013 we booked our Ocean View room via the Marriot\u2019s central reservation telephone call center. We received several emails between booking and staying that confirmed our Ocean View 1 bedroom. At check in we were ushered to Room 20230 \u2013 on the 2nd floor, which is GROUND LEVEL, in the furthest tower back from the ocean (I think it was called the Hale Moana tower). We opened the curtains and saw our view of the barbecue area, as well as the fitness center. There was literally not a speck of ocean to be seen, and we tried. The bellman was there, and told us that in the many years he\u2019d been working there, he\u2019d seen many \u2018questionable room categories\u2019. So he dialed a supervisor for us, and handed me the phone. The woman explained that this IS an ocean view room. When I asked WHY it\u2019s an ocean view category she said that it USED to have an ocean view before the fitness center and BBQ areas were built. Huh? I was given a 'view categories' leaflet (which I can't attach because of copyright concerns). On it, every room that even remotely faces the water \u2013 even those on bottom floors, on the sides and directly behind other buildings where you would never get more than a little slice of ocean in your view - are categorized as Ocean View. There is no way any room below the 5th floor would be able to see any ocean over the buildings and trees. This practice of calling an ocean view room with no ocean view is unethical, and there is no excuse for it. It needs to be changed. Management needs to go into each room and LOOK and if they cannot see a full ocean view, change the category. Until then, I strongly encourage you call and ask for a 'View Category' brochure and ask exactly where you are located. To make up for the lack of ocean view, they reduced our rate from $441 to $400 \u2013 which they said is a \u2018garden view\u2019, even though there is no such view on the View Categories brochure. I suspect this rate exists solely for those who complain that their Ocean View room is missing the ocean. Sorry \u2013 10% off is not enough. If we had any idea we wouldn\u2019t have an ocean view, we wouldn\u2019t have stayed here. CAUTION TO NON-OWNERS \u2013 When we called to complain about our view, we were also informed that because this is a Vacation Club property, we should have known we would get \u2018bumped\u2019 by owners who were literally placed above us. And they were \u2018at capacity\u2019, so even if we moved rooms the next day the best we\u2019d get would be a Marina View (which is very ugly \u2013 this marina is not picturesque). The woman on the phone said we should have known this would happen because the confirmation emails said it was a Marriot Vacation Club. (Hmmm\u2026 they also said Ocean View room). You want to park in that lot right beside your building? Oh, sorry. That tower is for owners, but you are not an owner, so you have to park in the next building over. You were told you would get a roll away bed? Sorry, you\u2019re not an owner so that will cost $20 a night. Bottom line \u2013 if you are not an owner or are not renting directly from an owner, if it\u2019s even a bit busy, you\u2019re probably going to get screwed. POOL BACTERIA \u2013 As this is a \u2018vacation ownership property\u2019, the amenities are spartan. There are no lifeguards, lousy towels, flat pillows, etc. No-one seems to be monitoring the pool water for chemicals and bacteria, even though there are hundreds of kids and toddlers in diapers. We spent one full day at the property ocean side and poolside, with our kids in the pool. The kids used their underwater camera to take pictures of each other. In the pictures the kids are smiling with their mouths open. The next morning both kids woke up with a violent stomach illness. It passed in a few hours, but was very unpleasant. And because we had to check out that day at 10:00, our only option was to have the kids lie down in their little lounge on the third floor. When I brought this issue to the attention of the male \u2018manager\u2019 at the front desk, he didn\u2019t seem surprised or alarmed. I insisted they check the pool bacteria levels so other guests would not get sick. He nodded and said he\u2019d bring this and the room category issue (which also did not seem to surprise him \u2013 he\u2019s the one who gave me the View Category leaflet and said this is the way it is) to the attention of senior management. He didn\u2019t write anything down, didn\u2019t offer to help or to compensate (a later check out or a room where the kids could rest 'til they felt better would have been appreciated, for example), and I seriously doubt that anything will be escalated. I would have expected an immediate call to someone in Recreation to have the water tested, but I\u2019m pretty sure that didn\u2019t happen. If you stay here, PLEASE caution your children (and adults) to be very careful not to drink any pool water, and to be careful to keep their mouths closed in the pool.

The layout is odd \u2013 one bathroom door opens to block the entryway to the other bathroom door, the shower door opens right onto the toilet, the desk is on a lanai that has no plug ins, etc., etc. The restaurant food was very average.

We ordered lunch from a pool waitress, and we were pleased with the quantity, quality, and service. TIP: We ordered 4 kids meals, and it was plenty of food for 2 adults and 2 kids.

It is certainly not a good hotel for people here on business. There is not desk or work area in the room; Free internet, but you have to frequently log in to get access. Internet performance was good. Last complaint - mandatory valet parking. They charge you $30 per day for valet. The problem is that during peak hours, you may not be able to get your car when you want it. I have waited up to 30 minutes for my car. No room service. Limited spa services.

Also about 30 minutes away from North Shore if you want to enjoy that side of the island. It's also a couple of exits away from the Waikele OUtlets if you'd like to shop. This is also a perfect place if you have little kids. The beach has little or close to no wave as it is a logoon and there rocks that blocks the waves from coming in. You also have a couple of choices of restaurants and if you don't feel like eating at a restaurant, they have a mini mart downstairs where you can buy almost anything plus they sell sandwiches, bagels and even a whole pizza which I think is a good deal if you are on a budget. They do cost a bit more than normal sandwich or pizza places but I expected that since we are at a resort but at least you won't spend an easy $60-100 which you would spend if you eat at a restaurant on the island. As for us, we like local food and we know where to go around the island so we know where to go for cheap food. But this is a great place to buy food if my kids are just tired and want to relax at the resort.

We aren't timeshare owners so we paid for a rental room. Check in took 1/2 hour but they were very busy around 4:00 so not really their fault. The room was nice with a full kitchen and partial ocean view. The hotel is in front of one of 4 lagoons all in a row. Good snorkeling in each one. We saw lots of fish and an Octopus. The pools are great, there are 3 total. One has a volleyball net and basketball hoop that got alot of use every time we were there. The second is a \"quiet\" pool. We didn't use it, but did see a few kids there. I don't get the concept of this as it's not really quiet and smack in the middle of all the activities/noise. The third is a multi level pool with caves and waterfalls, as well as a fun waterslide. My kids loved these pools. You have to get out of the water and climb the stairs to get to each one. Not a big deal but if the wind is blowing it's a bit chilly. The water in all the pools was warm and there are many hot tubs around and they're very hot which we like. My only complaint with the pools is that you get a wristband for the pools to identify you as an owner or guest. At least half the people at the pools didn't have one. I only saw an employee checking wristbands twice in 8 days and they didn't ask anyone to leave. This is kind of irritating considering the amount of money we were paying to stay at the resort and use the pools. The Disney resort next door doesn't allow this kind of nonsense and have employees ensuring only guests can use the pools. The resort always has something going on like a movie on the lawn (free), and fitness and crafts. There is a pretty good fitness room with cardio machines, strength machines, and dumbbells up to 50 lbs. Good enought to get a decent workout. There is also a market with essentials and drinks/snacks. Pricey but convenient if you forget something. We didn't eat at the resort so I can't comment on the food. We drove to the Walmart about 15 minutes away and stocked up. There are a number of free grills to use througout the propertly that got alot of use. I used them once and cooked early in the afternoon so I wouldn't have to wait. I like this feature of the resort. Drinks at the resort are pricey but that's expected. Parking is $30 a day whether you use valet or not! That's stunning but I will say the valet service is very good and fast. All the employees are very friendly and welcoming. We sat through the timshare presentation for 90 minutes and they gave us 4 free dolphin cruise tickets. They have a number of choices for activities if you listen to the presentation. Some are highy discounted and you pay a bit extra ($20 per person) and some are totally free like the dolphin cruise, which included roundtrip bus pickup. Food and snorkeling on the cruise were extra. We thought it was a good deal and they even gave us the tickets the day before we went to the presentation. We didn't buy into the timeshare but was interested to learn more about it. Not high pressure, but was 90 minutes.They have a kids club you can drop the kids at for no charge.

I have been to Hawaii many times but never to a timeshare resort. My parents invited my BF and me along, and we had a large 2 bedroom, 2 bath unit facing the Ko Olina Golf Course (and hotel parking lot), with a large living room and kitchen in the center. They traded their points for a stay here, so we couldn't get the ocean view b/c they are not Marriott owners. The view was fine, and we waived to my parents from the golf course while playing one day. It was great having the kitchen and washer and dryer, as we cooked most every night. The Safeway is about 10 minutes back toward the airport - very convenient. We knew about the high cost of the food there from other reviewers. You are indeed a captive audience once in the resort. The little store is very expensive, as are the restaurants. Our initial late lunch/early dinner on our day of arrival cost $118 at the Longboard Grill, and wasn't much to write home about. Salads and sandwiches and two beers. The place was like a perfectly manufactured group of 6 or 7 large hotel buildings, making up the Ko Olina development area, including 4 man-made lagoons, a new Disney Resort timeshare, and a JW Marriott Hotel up at the other end. Kind of like Stepford Wife Hawaii. (The interior pools with hammerhead shark and many stingrays at the JW were fun to see.) There were several pools, and they did a good job of keeping kids and noisy people away from the one pool nearest the Longboard Grill designated for quiet. We would have loved more drink service at the pool; the girls rarely came around. The lagoons were wonderful for kids...they were roped off so the kids couldn't easily swim out past the ropes and rocks into the open ocean. It was a nice long walk about 4 miles (?) from one end of the development to the other and back. Walk past the last lagoon by the JW to a little dirt trail to a small REAL lagoon and hope to see the large sea turtle that lives there! We did! There was a small shopping center with an ABC market across the street from the JW Marriott entrance with an expensive Mexican restaurant (we didn't try it, as we have plenty of good Mex food in San Diego), and a delicious HI BBQ place across the parking lot. We ate lunch there twice. The ABC market was fantastic for reasonably priced souvenirs. There are about a million ABC stores on Waikiki. We golfed twice at the Ko Olina Golf Course across the street from our hotel. Excellent and difficult and beautiful, and about $150 per round. We are avid golfers, so we will spend money on golf and cook dinners at home to save a little money. I don't mind spending on an excellent meal; hate feeling ripped off. The shuttle around the Ko Olina development was great for taking us to golf....stops across from the JW Marriott (cross street to the ABC market) and other places too. The staff at our timeshare resort was extremely helpful. A couple of minor things were broken and they came to our room within minutes to fix them. The room key cards are a JOKE. Oh my gosh....they worked about a quarter of the time! Even with 4 key cards between us, none of them worked on two occasions. Usually just 1 worked. What a stupid hassle. (Keeping them separate from your credit cards doesn't work, either, like they say it will.) The AC doesn't work unless the sliding glass doors are closed....of course it says this on the glass doors themselves, but we were lazy and didn't read it. We called and the nice lady ansewered that question for I'm sure the 1000th time! We most enjoyed the Happy Hour at the expensive steak house - $4 Mai Tais and other drinks from 445 to 6, and 930 to whenever each night. Beautiful bar....it felt the most like HI to me in that bar. Hawaiian music and nice breeze blowing through, w/lovely ocean view. There were activities for families to watch on the lawn area, like a fire dance one night and hula dancing and a luau. We skipped those. We are not big on crowded touristy events, but people were really enjoying them, especially the kids. The BBQs were very popular (there were 2 groupings of about 5 BBQs each at either side of the hotel entrance) but the heat was very low and it took quite some time to grill our corn. There was a little wait each night but the guests (mostly men sent down to BBQ) seemed to have fun visiting. Not sure we would do this place again, as I'd like a more true Hawaiian ambiance, but it was nice to be guests of my parents. We picked up the flights, so it all evened out.

We were \"slightly\" concerned due to some negative reviews we saw earlier but they are unwarranted. Keep in mind that this is a 3.5* property and it is a time share and not a regular Marriott Property. They will give room preferences to the timeshare OWNERS over Marriott Members so Platinum Members be warned as you won't get an automatic upgrade. Since this is a time share there is no distinction between Beach-front, Ocean View or Ocean-Front as in normal hotels. There are only 2 categories here: Island View and Ocean View (and not all Ocean Views \"face\" the ocean) Everyone was very helpful and friendly here. I can pretty well guarantee that this is going to be one of the nicest 3.5* stays you will ever have. Don't confuse this with a 4 or 5* Property BUT the service is GREAT for 3.5* (missing rooms service and better toiletries for 4*, 5* needs page service, 1hr laundry, car service etc). As for time share, they'll tell you about it at the Welcome Centre but they are not pushy about it. Definitely stop by and grab the Welcome Package for maps, discount cards etc and sign up for the presentation (and go to one if you have the time for some more freebies). If you have kids, this is an awesome place. They have a different pools that cater to babies all they way up to adults. There is a Kids Club and kid activities planned almost everyday. There are lots of families here so if you are planning a Romantic getaway, I would suggest the JW Marriott Up the road. If you want to be in the centre of all the action, stay in Waikiki. It's not as quiet as Maui here but it's very close AND you have the option to drive into town for better city life (food, shopping, etc - good luck finding Dim Sum or Louis Vuitton in Maui).

The room fit the two of us, and we both slept great every night. Being on daily rates, we had some housekeeping everyday. Enjoyed the view, and had a thoroughly relaxing stay. Did notice a few oddities about the room: With a sleeper-sofa, the room is obviously intended to fit 4 people but the kitchen service was only for 2 (2 spoons, 2 forks, 2 plates, etc). There are dishwashing supplies but no plug for the sink drain and no rack to dry the dishes in. But since there was only two of anything, we had to wash dishes... The refrigerator is in an unventilated cabinet. Unless you leave the cabinet door open, the heat builds up until the only cold spot is the bottom shelf of the refrigerator. There is no luggage rack, so my husband used the floor and my suitcase rested on an odd, big square piece of furniture. There is no table and chairs other than that on the tiny balcony, which could make an unpleasant dining experience on windy or rainy days. (Maybe there would be room for an inside table if they got rid of that odd piece of furniture?) The cute vanity in bathroom is not enough counter space, and the drawers below are too tiny to fit a medium size cosmetic bag. TimeShare Presentation: We decided to attend this time, and it really wasn't painful for the number of Marriott reward points we got.:) I expected to not like their Vacation Club system, but their new points plan was more affordable than I had imagined. Just not us. The downstairs market is convenient. Ate at the restaurant downstairs and it was fine, but dined at Roy's twice and loved Azul at the JW Marriott, both just a nice evening stroll away. Also walking distance is an ice cream shop, taco shop, Hawaiian BarBQ and an \"upscale\" version of an ABC for supplies and food. Ko'olina is out from Honolulu so you definitely need a car for day trips. (If you stay in Waikiki, and we usually do for a few nights, you are walking distance to the zoo and aquarium, and can hop a bus to museums and Pearl Harbor.) The lagoons are nice and safe for swimming but no natural surf, and the shoreline itself is all rock; you will have to drive to find surfing, windsurfing, etc. As others have said, getting to the North Shore is easy from here, and we had an amazing dinner at the Hale'iwa Cafe one night with island friends.

We travel frequently, even more so since we became empty nesters. When I read reviews here I always start with the one stars and work my way up. From our experience, I cannot understand why this property would get less than a 4 star review. Granted, construction on the new building was over, which I know led to a number of complaints here. Our 9th floor view was a partial marina, industrial, and parking lot view -- no big deal to us. We were enjoying the grounds 90% of the time anyway. The property is kept immaculate. No sounds from neighboring units and hallways, and the place was sold out. Complete cross section of people and ages. Our experience was nothing short of wonderful, and we've been to Hawaii a number of times....friendly, knowledgeable staff, check-in line was no more than 10 minutes (we arrived at the property approximately 1 PM in the afternoon to start our stay), great floor plan (I can understand complaints about staying in the \"lock-out\" rooms which are like hotel rooms with a mini-kitchen. We would be unhappy in one of those for a week). Our room wasn't ready, but we were given free run of the place. We merely changed into swim wear in the fitness center locker rooms and enjoyed the property's many amenities. During our stay nothing ever seemed crowded. Restaurants there were pretty good but nothing to rave about. Typical resort prices. We BBQed twice, after grocery shopping a few miles away (you do need a car if you don't plan to stay on the property 100% of the time). BBQ grills and tools are all deluxe stainless, and the work areas very clean. We never had to wait in line to use a BBQ. The man-made lagoons were very nicely done and the landscaping rates a 10 on my scale. The Beach Club and the Nearby JW Marriott hotel anchor a 3/4 mile walking path along the shore, with the new Disney Aulina resort between the two. We ate sushi at the JW and one breakfast at Disney. Both were good food and reasonable prices for what you got and where you were. Went to Roy's Hawaiian accross the street in the Ko Olina golf complex. Food was good but in my opinion overpriced for what we got (we dine out a lot and frequently spend $150-200 at a time for two, so my comment isn't due to sticker shock).

This was our third stay at the property, and each visit reinforces the unique qualities of the resort for our family: peaceful yet family-friendly, modern with updated units, a variety of services/amenities on site and a gorgeous set of grounds set in front of a serene and calm ocean lagoon. We stayed in the new wing of the Nai'a tower and had a 12th floor ocean view 2 bedroom unit. This wing just opened about 2 weeks ago. The views, especially the evening sunsets, from our balcony were breathtaking. The appliances in the new units are stainless steel and are of nice quality. This is not to say that the older units are outdated. that's not the case; rather, the property seems to be ensuring that the new wing is current and modern. We were impressed with the service--we checked in around 3:30 along with just about every other guest. I waited in the open-air lobby for about 20 minutes. Yet, the staff was handing our free fresh fruit (papaya and pineapple), had chilled clothes to cool off with and fruit-infused water in the lobby for those checking it. Nice touch. We aren't timeshare owners and just booked the room through Marriott. We were only asked once (when we picked up our welcome packet) if we wanted to tour the timeshare units. We said no, and we didn't hear from them again. I didn't get the sense of hard-pressure sales tactics. If you are thinking of other properties in the Ko Olina area, both the JW and the Disney Aulani are right there and are good ones to consider. The JW has a smallish pool and is more geared for adult couples. Either the Ko Olina Beach Club or the Disney property is more suited for families. That said, we walked through the Aulani property and I had the feeling of sensationj overload. My 10 year-old daughter discribed it as \"chaotic.\" I think the Ko Olina Beach Club has struck the right balance--Kids activities galore, family-friendly pools but without the constant blaring of music and scripted activities that we observed at the Aulani. That said, it's worth walking through both the Aulani and JW properties. At the JW, check out the salt-water ornamental pools on their property--rife with manta ray, tropical fish and even some hammer-head sharks. It's a well appointed property. A free shuttle service which runs every 30 minutes gos from the Ko Olina Beach Club, to the Marina, to the golf course, to the Aulani and to the JW. All of the Ko Olina properties are about 40 minutes fron Honolulu and the Waikiki scene. It's set amidst the arid southwestern coast, but the grounds immediately around the Ko Olina properties have been manicured, landscaped, and watered to help you overlook the natural aridness of the surrounding environs. Nearby are a Safeway and Target; a Walmart recently opened up as well but we didn't make it there so I don't know if it carries groceries. More adjacent to Ko Olina is an mexican sit-down taco restaurant, a Hawaiian BBQ joint, and an upscale ABC market. The free shuttle used to go to this complex but the driver told us that they no longer stop there. Other recommendations while on Oahu--sea kayak at Lanakai/Kailua Beach Park (the water there is turqoise and absolutely stunning); eat at Boots and Kimo's; snorkel at Electric Beach (near Ko Olina); attend Ko Olina's Monday night Torch Lighting ceremony (the chief is great!) and try some lychees. It's pricey to stay here, but I think it's worth it. Adults will come back rejuvenated and kids will have losts of great memories.

Ko`Olina feels more like South or West Maui than Oahu if you can block out the fact that the power plant and oil refineries are nearby. Ko'Olina is a resort unto itself now with the JW Marriott, DIsney Aulani and the Marriott Vacation Club but still lacks alternative dining and shopping options outside of the hotels. We've stayed at the JW a number of times and while very nice, it's not as perfect for families. The vacation club on the otherhand is exactly built for families large and small. There are 3 towers, none of which are far from the ocean or pool's edge. The lobby has a modern Hawaiian flair to it but the rest of the buildings and rooms are pretty generic for the Vacation Club family of properties. Rooms are comfortably appointed including full kitchen, 42\" TV and decent sized lanai. My suggestion would be to not spend money for the ocean view upgrades unless that's really important to you. Mountain views are fine on floors 5 and above and you'll likely be spending more time awake outside of the room than in! The pools really shine here - even better in my opinion than at the Maui Marriott. A tunnel water slide and cave/waterfall pool on one end, an adult pool for a more quieter atmosphere and a young keiki pool that has a terrific faux-sand beach and bottom with 18\" deep water. Absolutely perfect for the littlest kids and babies. For dining, there's a decent but expensive steak/seafood restaurant and the more casual \"Longboards\". The food is not worthy of the price tags at either. The pool-side keiki menu options are $11 but at least they include a drink and fruit. Poolside service can be sketchy with only 1 waitress per pool. Happy Hour from 3-6 daily offers best deals. As usual, there's plenty of grills which opens up dinner and drink options. The onsite marketplace stocks some grocery items but I'd suggest going to Safeway in Kapolei or the ABC Market wihtin the Ko`Oline Station for best value. Staff are very friendly and always say aloha in passing. The valet even remembered my name! This is a very do-it-yourself type of resort which can be nice. They're not pushing you to spend money like hotels but it's still expensive all told - but hey, it's Hawaii! This is a very enjoyable resort for all ages except perhaps for the honeymoon crowd.

Ko'Olina is so serene, quiet, amazing and overall just magestic. You'll find this area to be quite unlike anything that the hustle of bustle Waikiki has to offer. This property is part of the Marriott Vacation Club line of properties that includes at least a kitchenette in each room. While you're here, you can truly be at home. Many of the rooms have full sized kitchens, separate bedrooms, and even living rooms and balconies. For this stay we used Marriott points for one of the smaller rooms. For the two of us it was still comfortable. Several restaurants are on or near the property and include casusal fair (outside along the beach at Longboards - perfect for watching a Hawaiian sunset and enjoying a cold beverage) or you can dine in one of the upscale restaurants for a fine dining experience. You'll find several stores and restaurants outside of the Marriott property in the Ko'Olina resort area including a small grocery store. At the property you'll find 3 wonderful pools and 2 or 3 hot tub lagoons. One large pool has a tunnel waterslide, waterfalls and shallow areas perfect for kids. There is an adult-only pool and jacuzzi, but during our stay, we found that the staff didn't enforce this policy. (One suggestion I would make for the staff is to strictly enforce this. Many adult guests were either annoyed or left the pool areas a couple of times because of kids being present at the adult-only pool.) The property sits on 3 amazing lagoons a perfect area for snorkeling! While you may not see as many fish as other parts of the island while snorkeling, it's great calm water areas to enjoy. If water sports aren't your thing, be sure to grab a seat at one of the many family-friendly Hawaiian activities daily on the property. One night before our dinner at Longboards, we watched a Hawaiian ceremony that took place on the lawn. Great opportunity to bring the family and learn a bit about the culture too. We can't say enough about this resort without writing a book! We absolutely loved this property and all it had to offer.

So we broke up our Waikiki stay with a couple days here. It is a nice place. Room was fine..although you do have to clean up after yourselves if you are on the timeshare. Had a nice sunset view from our mini-balcony. Lots of pools and jacuzzis. On one evening, the people at one jacuzzi were quite noisy and while I was looking unhappy at the prospect, an employee came over, and guided us to the jacuzzi right next to the Longboard bar/restaurant. So we sat in that..listened to the live music and watched the sun set. Nice..and those noisy people over at that other jacuzzi didn't know what they were missing. (Note: I think there are at least half a dozen jacuzzis) Lots of pools-- we tended to stay where there were no children. The kids seemed to be having a great time in other pools though..nice for families. The lagoon beach was hot..no shade. You can pay for a cabana type seat..but the whole beach was otherwise uncovered. In the lagoon, my husband was snorkeling, and he came to inform me that there were turtles there.. So I had to go take a look..this was pretty exciting--- to see them right up close. Used the washing machine to catch up on laundry (free). Very convenient. We used the gas grill to grill steak..and lots of other people were out there as well, but we didn't wait long and everyone was friendly. The restaurants looked busy but we did not eat there. We did get juice and yogurt at the supermarket 10 minutes away..As another person mentioned, food prices are high compared to the mainland, oh well. Got our steak at Costco which was really busy but we got out pretty quickly. The grounds are so immaculate it left me wondering when they take care of them. I never saw a gardener or anyone doing anything..do they garden at 3 a.m.? Maybe they do not do that on weekends.. Someone is working hard, because there is barely a leaf out of place. Pretty much everyone appears to be relaxed and enjoying themselves. There was a ceremony in the evening..something like \"torch lighting\" .. with a plug for the next night's luau. It was fun, the guy was humorous..I recommend you take your family to the grassy area for that.. Husband used the gym..which was top class. He gave it a thumbs up--and he is a gym rat. Employees around the property seemed friendly and everyone works to make sure the guests are enjoying themselves. We did not use the \"visit our desk\" coupon --avoided the timeshare sales people. They do need to improve the parking lot. Too close between cars, difficult to get in with a large car, and I can see dented doors would be a problem often. Parking lot needs a re-design. Add a foot between parking spaces. Overall, I think just about everyone will enjoy themselves..but we did not pay for this stay, so I cannot comment on value/prices.

We have been dreaming about it ever since! In fact, we are going to have a hard time staying at any other hotel while in Hawaii, and we have stayed at some wonderful places in the past. We traded our 2 bedroom villa in Palm Springs for a single hotel room overlooking the pool/ocean and it was well worth it! The room was spacious and clean and we didn't find there was much noise (at least, not to the point of disruptive) coming from the pool area. We enjoyed many of the restaurants on the property, in particular Longboards, where we never had a problem getting a table with a beautiful view of the lagoon. Even though we knew the hotel was likely at max capacity, we never felt that it was overcrowded and often enjoyed sitting on the beach feeling like we were the only ones there. Our favorite thing to do was get up early, grab a coffee at the on-site Starbucks, and walk the path between the three resort hotels. The resort area was only about a 20 minute drive north of Honolulu, and we felt it was reasonably located to anything we wanted to do on the island while giving us the relaxing experience we wouldn't get if staying in Waikiki. We still easily visited Diamond Head and North Shore, although we were always happy to get back to our little paradise at Ko Olina. While I have to admit that Oahu used to be my least favorite island (being from San Diego, Honolulu reminded me a little too much of the hustle and bustle of home), we can now say that we will likely stay at Ko Olina for every future trip to Hawaii.

Our suite was beautiful! It was a single entry 2BR with a full kitchen, King beds in each BR with 2 additional pull-out sofas (which we didn't use), which afforded our family of 4 plenty of room. We looked at the Ko Olina marina with the mountains beyond and the ocean was visible to our right. There is an industrial complex in the view line, but we spent very little time in the room, so for us the extra space was well worth the minimal sacrifice of the mountain view. The grounds of the hotel were gorgeous! There was never a problem getting a lounger at the pool or beach and the lagoons were great for swimming and snorkeling.The full kitchen allowed us to stock up on beverages, snacks and breakfast and lunch foods and we even made dinner one night using the abundant gas grills on the property! We ate at Longboards and Chuck's on the property and both were wonderful. The staff was so friendly and accommodating and everyone we met: staff, local people enjoying the lagoons, and other visitors shared their \"aloha\"! Although time share representatives were available if you were so inclined, we recieved one message on our phone from them and were never bothered again (we did not opt to return the call) and we never saw them on the resort grounds or in the buildings during our stay. We also at Roy's located at he adjacent golf course and it too was terrific! The Ko Olina area is so relaxed and serene but it is only a short drive to waikiki. There is a walkway along the four lagoons and each resort basically has their own lagoon. Next to the beach club is the Ko Olina Beach Villas which looked very nice but seemed pretty empty, the Aulani (Disneys new resort) which is huge and I actually preferred the grounds of the Beach, and finally the JW Marriott which is a more full service, hotel room style resort. I highly recommend Ko Olina Beach Club! We also stayed at the Marriott ocean club in maui the following week, and it too was beautiful but I missed Ko Olina! I hope to return very very soon! The also resort hosts a luau called Fia Fia, which we did not attend, but we did watch the preview they had prior to the actual show and it looked wonderful! Just remember it is a cross between a full service resort and a time share property so some full service resort features may not be readily available (for example we self parked our car, brought our own luggage to room) but we actually prefer calling our own shots and coming and going as we please so for us, this is a plus!", "Date": "June 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hickory, NC", "Title": "\u201cComfortable place on Oahu\u201d", "Author": "SCSweendaddy", "ReviewID": "UR131020295", "Content": "This is one of three hotels we stayed in during our week in Oahu and we liked it the best.

I was working in Waipau and found it very convenient. Ko Olina is a new area and the area inbetween here and city is growing rapidly. The Place: Facility and grounds are beautiful. Pools are fun with a slide, caves and waterfalls. Our son had a great time and missed this place when we moved on. There wern't a lot of kids during our stay but we were there mid-week before school let out for the summer so maybe that changes.

The Food: We only at at Longboards down by the beach but the breakfast buffet and dinners were very good. Once we got past the sticker shock (everything in Hawaii is expensive) we really enjoyed it. Breakfast buffet was hot and had a good selection. Lunch/Dinner had good selection and the fish sandwich was outstanding. Good variety of beer on tap as well. Room: Very nice. We did the one bedroom suite which has plenty of room for the three of us. Sinks in two seperate rooms were great but having the toilet and shower so close was a little crowding. Full kitchen was nice. Rom was quiet and had a nice marina/cove view. Grounds etc.: Excellent landscaping. Open lobby design was interesting and daily market downstairs was fine. Gym area was great and locker rooms were first rate. Very clean. Staff: Always friendly and very helpful. Decided to stick with valet parking ($30 per day either way) and it was handy to have them get the car. They always had it there by the time I got down from the room. Concierge was very helpful as we moved on to the North Shore - recommending the more scenic route and giving us a few tips for our time up there. So, all in all I would certainly recommend this resort. If you are staying for a full week, then a run to the market for food and drinks would be recommended - but groceries are expensive so don't expect too much savings.

It's very different from the Ko Olina Beach Club. The Ko Olina Beach club is not as \"busy\" architechurally and is much more nicely landscaped. After two days of dark room illness, we were able to get out and make up for lost time. We visited a number of the acheologically significant sites on the island, and took in a lot of musical events. We also went up Tantalus Drive to see the scenic overlook of Honolulu, and that is well worth the drive up the mountainside. Northcoast is still great for snorkeling, and the Romy's Shrimp Truck is still a delicious place to stop for lunch. We took some friends with us this time, and they loved it.

This is a wonderful resort. We stayed in a 2 bedroom in the new Hale Nai Tower. This really is a fantastic resort if you are looking for a beautiful setting with fantastic sunsets and a more quite environment away from hustle and bustle of Waikiki. When I first looked at the online pictures of the man made lagoons along the coast of Ko Olina I wondered if they would be very nice. Take my word for it the online pictures do not do this beach justice. These quaint lagoons are fantastic for swimming and even a little snorkeling. While the fish are not that colorful in the lagoons it is good calm place for beginners to snorkel and see some fish and even a few turtles if you are lucky. There are plenty of other places on the Island for better snorkeling and more colorful fish. One of the things that I really liked about this location was the sidewalks that ran along the beach from the harbor in the south to the JW Marriott in the north. This is a great walk any time of the day but especially in the early morning and the late evening. The Ko Olina is far superior to the JW Marriott. The pool at the JW is tiny I think that the JW needs a serious makeover. The Ko Olina on the other hand is absolutely beautiful. the lush grounds with waterfalls, ponds filed with koi fish and many swimming pools are stunning. I really enjoyed the hot tub near our tower. I could sit in the hot tub and see the beautiful cove for hours. I miss that view. The rooms are very nice and the service was superb at this resort. Many guests will leave their boogie boards or swim items that they purchased at the first of their week for others to use when they depart. Check the bins near the towel booths before buying any items for free items. The beaches that you can easily walk to near the resort are on the rocky side and not suitable for surfing or boogie boarding but the lagoons are perfect for swimming. The closest beach for surfing and boogie boarding is only about 15 to 20 minutes away called White Plains Beach. Many locals at this beach. You can even take surf lessons at this beach. There is a nice Luau offered at this resort. Kind of pricy. We have seen many luaus so we passed on this one. If you have a room that overlooks the pools you can watch the Luau from your room balcony. You can also watch if from many of the public balconies in the main lobby or even by walking along the beach. Of course you won't get any dinner :(. But if you have never seen a Luau and don't want to pay the price you can see much of it for free if desired. The walk to the Disney's Aulani resort is worth your time. The Aulani grounds look like a Disney theme park. While it is very nice I think that the Ko Olina grounds are more beautiful. One thing that I did like about the Aulani was their man made snorkeling reef called Rainbow Reef. They only allow guests staying at Aulani to use this and they charge their own guests an additional fee. There is a viewing area where you can see under the water and the many colorful fish in the south end of Rainbow Reef. There are a couple of chairs there and a nice place to take some pictures without getting wet. It is like looking into a very large salt water aquarium. The water is crystal clear. The JW Marriot is the right next door to Aulani and they share the same lagoon. The JW was very disappointing. I thought it would have been much nicer. I kept looking for the REAL swimming pool but they only have the one very small pool for a resort that size it needs a serious makeover. Staying at the Ko Olina is a MUCH better choice. Here is link to the resorts in Ko Olina. http://www.koolina.com/explore/interactive-map There is a nice water park only five minutes away called Wet and Wild. While this water park is fairly small it is very nice and has some very good variety of rides. If you like water parks this is worth your time. If you plan to go there do so your FIRST day and the rest of the week and the next 51 weeks are free. It is the same price for one day or the year. Wish I would have known that the first day. This place is a bit pricy about $45 per person for adults so if you go two days it cuts your price in half. This place is so close the resort you can get there in about 5 minutes. The lines are small and the variety of rides makes this a very nice water park. They don't allow you to bring in your own food but you can easily walk to your car and eat lunch or drive back to the resort eat and return it is so close. One other option is just drive two minutes to Costco for a cheap lunch it is only 3 minutes away. If you are planning on going more than one day pay the extra $10 for a parking pass for the year. Parking is $7.00 per day. Costco is at the same exit as the Water park in Kapolie. There you can find a nice movie theater, fast food, restaurants, Wal Mart, Safeway etc... This is all only about 5 to 7 minutes from Ko Olina. Ko Olina is located on the dry side of the Island but the lush grounds beautiful sunsets make this an ideal setting. When you travel on the Island to the North Shore or Waikiki be sure and avoid rush hour times. The traffic can be very congested at those times. You can easily see much of the Island in only a week. Pearl Harbor is best visited early morning be there by 7:30 am. The USS Arizona memorial is free. The submarine and the USS Missouri are worth the added costs. The Dole Pineapple plantation is a nice place to visit and get some pineapple ice cream. Sharks reef on the North Shore is a great place to snorkel without the crowds. We really loved snorkeling here. The Polynesian Cultural Center is a very nice place to visit near the North Shore. While there drive to see the Mormon Temple it is a beautiful building. The mountains north of Honolulu have some impressive vistas of the city. There is nice waterfall called Manoa Falls not far from Honolulu well worth the hike. The cost for parking is $5.00 the hike is moderate through tropical jungle like conditions. Over all I have to say we loved our stay on this Island and at this resort. The Ko Olina area also has a beautiful Golf Course.

I stay at various Marriott properties throughout the world 20-30 nights/ year. This Marriott experience was the worst I have had. The resort location and presentation are amazing. The lagoon is meticulously clean, the pools are perfectly heated and clean, and the grounds are gorgeous. The rooms are beautiful and the furniture is very nice. I have been all over the world and have never seen such beautiful sunsets as I did from the balcony of this resort! Longboards restaurant has some good food and is conveniently located at the edge of the lagoon which makes for some beautiful, romantic moments while eating. The Exercise facility is very nice and the small store on site is expensive, but very convenient. The service had this hotel was pathetic. I was extremely disappointed with the Marriott Ko Olina Beach Club for several reasons. When we checked in it was obvious that they had given our room away to another guest. I booked my 2 bedroom suite with 1 King Bed and 2 Double beds 4 months prior to our arrival. When we arrived, we were told that our room had 2 King beds. With the number of people in our party, that was not sufficient. The Front Desk Attendant showed very little concern for our circumstance and said that the only option was to purchase another room at $600/night or to have people sleep on the floor. She explained that the additional room was the last room available due to the hotel being sold out. Upon having our luggage and personal things taken to our room by the bellman, my wife's expensive jacket was lost. When we called the Front Desk to report it missing, very little concern was shown...No apology, No reassurance that they would attempt to locate it. We filled out a report and were never notified of it being found until WE made a call 3 days later to ask about it! We woke up the first morning and took off to discover the north side of the island. When we came back, we were disappointed to find that our room hadn't been cleaned. When I called to inquire, the Front Desk person asked \"Oh! Do you want your room cleaned every day?\". Once againg, there was NO apology or explanation given. When you are spending several hundreds of dollars per night you have expectations. Having a clean room is a very minimum expectation that is even met at cheap hotels like a Super 8. Another really frustrating aspect of this hotel is that you have to deal with the pool towel nazis. You have to check out pool towels every day from a towel hut. My kids love to swim all day. The towel hut closes at 6pm, but the pool stays open much later. Therefore, if you would like to continue to swim past the early hour of 6pm, then you get to dry off with a wet towel. Then you have to take your wet towels back to your room and then back down to the towel hut the next morning. If you don't return your towels, then they charge you $25 per towel. Once again the towel attendants were rude and unhelpful. I wondered if I was the only one that noticed the poor service, but in discussions with other guests I discovered that many others felt the same without any solicitation on my part. In conclusion, this resort is amazingly beautiful with very nice rooms, lobby and facilities, but the service is one of the worst experiences I have ever had. The management of this resort does not deserve to work for Marriott. Their vision is not in line with what is expected of the Marriott brand.", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cWow - a real family paradise ...\u201d", "Author": "MekkTekk", "ReviewID": "UR130298815", "Content": "We stayed here 5 nights and were travelling with our 2 young children (2 and 6). We had plans to visit various attractions on the island but skipped several of them because after we got here - we thought \u201cwhat could be better than relaxing here?\u201d Service was good overall \u2013 we did not really need a lot of service since the place is more of a self serve / time share owner type resort. The folks we did encounter were almost always friendly and helpful. At these resorts, there always seem to be a few pool staff that are \u201ctoo cool\u201d to be friendly. Room \u2013 we had a 1 bedroom suite with the full kitchen. Room was very clean, very spacious and very well appointed. It was as good or better than the pictures. We were assigned a 3rd floor room (lowest) facing the parking lot. The front desk said they were full and this was the best room they could give us. The staff at kid\u2019s club confirmed they were definitely were not full \u2013 she said it was really quiet relative to spring break 2 weeks earlier. So I would agree with other reviewers that they put non-owners in the worst rooms. Minor issue for us \u2013 was still a great room. Resort Common Areas \u2013 there are so many nice areas in this resort. The lobby, the pool areas, the walkways, the gardens, the beach \u2013 you could just plop down and enjoy your surroundings just about anywhere. Pool \u2013 there were 3 great pools at the resort. Two pools fronted buildings 1 and 2. A family pool with a huge shallow area and a beach entrance using fake sand (easy clean). And a \u201cquiet\u201d pool \u2013 I suppose for adults only. And third pool fronted building 3. This one was family and young adult friendly with a water slide, waterfall tunnel, music playing and a swim up bar. Water temperature in all the pools was perfect (I sometimes find the pools too cold). There were 1 or more hot tubs at each pool. Beach \u2013 the man made lagoon was the highlight of the resort for us. Calm waves was perfect for the kids. You could do some snorkeling near the rocks but not too many fish to see. Setting is just awesome \u2013 especially at sunset. Activities \u2013 these were pretty limited. Some fish feeding, lei making, yoga, etc. A few were free, many had fees that were reasonable. Welcome event on Monday was fun (also with Chief Seilu from the luau). They do not have half day long camps for kids. Location \u2013 resorts is in an isolated gated community. Only three other resorts here \u2013 Disney, JW Marriot and Beach Villas. There is a golf course with lots of luxury townhomes surrounding the area as well. The suburban town of Kapolei is 5 minutes drive down the highway where you can find lots of strip malls with Target, Safeway, Costco, Walmart and the usual host of shops and restaurants. You may want to plan your outings to Honolulu or the east side of the island (e.g. Hanauma Bay) around rush hour. Traffic around Honolulu can be terrible. No problems getting to the north shore. Dining - We only ate at Longboards once - was OK. Did not eat at Chucks. We cooked and ate in our rooms frequently since we had young kids or ate outside the resort when we ventured out to attractions. Fia Fia Luau \u2013 I highly recommend this luau. It\u2019s so convenient being right in the resort. The host, Chief Seilu, and his team are very funny and entertaining. Chief did a great job balancing culture, stand up comedy and his own personal experiences to make the show truly memorable. Buffet was good and they even had some children\u2019s food like spaghetti and meatballs, chicken strips, etc. Tip: The seating is first come first serve based in when you make the reservation! Call a week before to get a front row seat. You can cancel 24 hours before if you change your mind. Check out time was 10am but our flight did not leave until evening. No problem \u2013 we put our bags in the car and front desk gave us a key to the locker rooms near the family pool. The locker rooms were clean, had private showers and fresh towels. So we enjoyed a full day at the beach, showered up and caught our flight fully refreshed. We definitely want to come back to the Ko Olina area and to this resort.

We couldn\u2019t imagine staying here during the busy time of the year. It would be an absolute zoo. We stayed in the newest building. They were still completing some of the building so not all the rooms were open. Construction on the final building just started when we arrived. We could hear some noise but nothing that bothered us. However, it was very early in the construction. The area is still in development so in 5 or so years we expect this to be a wonderful vacation spot. For example, don\u2019t expect to see much when you snorkel in the lagoon. The coral is still growing so the fish is minimal at best. You MUST have a rental car to get around unless you are willing to pay for mediocre yet expensive food. Overall, we loved our stay and would come again but only doing the slower seasons.

We were supposed to stay in Waikiki the entire 4 nights but this was my partner's first trip to Oahu and we realized that the Marriott in Waikiki wasn't really a resort and we didn't want to be in the middle of the Waikiki scene. I have probably been to Oahu 8 times over the past 15 years but have never been to the Ko Olina area so was a little nervous about moving to the Marriott Beach Club. However, once we took the Ko Olina exit off the H1 I could immediately tell that we made a good decision. Ko Olina is a master planned community. There are 4 resorts (including the JW Marriott and the new Disney hotel). The grounds are perfect and it seems like it's a world away from the buzz off Waikiki. Just note that rush hour traffic on Oahu is from 530am to 9am and from 330pm to 6pm. I would highly advise that you stay off the highways at that time unless you enjoy bumper to bumper traffic. We were debating on staying at the Marriott Beach Club or the JW Marriott. I typically prefer JW Marriott as they are nicer but am glad that we chose the Beach Club. Note, the Beach Club is a Marriott Vacation (aka Time Share) destination. So most of the guests are owners but they still rent rooms and villas when the units are not occupied. This was not like any time share I have ever seen. Not once did they even mention the time shares to us. I went to Mexico last year and was approached 4 times during a 5 night stay at a nice resort to attend their sales presentation. Not once did that happen at the Marriott Beach Club. We rented a 1 bedroom villa which was huge. I wasn't a big fan of the decor, it reminded me of a retirement community but it was still very nice and spacious. We had a mountain view room which was actually nicer than I expected (ever other view I had on our 12 day Hawaii vacation was ocean so it was nice to see the mountains). The hotel has a lot of great pools, including an adults only / quiet pool. We only ate on property once at Chuck's and I would not recommend it. In fact, it was the worst food we had on our entire trip. Roy's is right across the street and is amazing for about the same price. So skip Chuck's and go to Roy's if you want to eat out. We also walked around the JW Marriott and Disney hotel and actually preferred the Marriott Beach Club. Ko Olina has 4 man made lagoons which are probably nice for children to swim in but I would have preferred swimming in the ocean. We tried to snorkel in lagood 2 but the visibility was very poor.

The property is beautiful, clean and well kept up. The beaches on the \"lagoons\" were easily the cleanest and least crowded on the island. The resort area is very clean and easy to walk around with some amenities close by. There is an ABC store (think C-store on steroids), ice cream shoppe, Asian BBQ and Mexican restaurant in the shopping center just down the road. Many more shops are being built and planned so this will be an nice area in the near future. It's located just over an hour north of the airport (map services all say 20-30 min, HA! more on that in a bit) and out of the way. If you have a car you are about 10 min from Kapolei and all the major brand names: Walmart (brand new!), Safeway, et al. As we were potential clients for the MVC they put us up in a King Studio room on the 15th floor with an ocean view. These are basically a Standard Marriott Room you'd find in a Courtyard or Springhill Suites. The balcony is tiny and you can see, and will be seen by, many others around you so no shenanigans. You'll fall off and/or end up with potentially embarrassing pictures of you on the internet. There is a tent card saying they would only freshen up the room once during the stay and it would cost you extra if you wanted additional freshening or actual cleanings. We learned that this is solely for the MVC members staying there as we got clean towels and freshening daily. A car is almost a necessity at this location as it is a long way to anywhere else on the island. Parking is $30 a day (plus taxes and fees) unless you are a member of the MVC. There are a few things you can do at the near by marina (sunset cruise type things), and the resort does have \"daily activities\" mostly geared to families and kids. So, unless you are content to sit on the beach and stare at the sun, get a car and see the sights. But! Plan a LOT of extra time to drive anywhere. The traffic on Oahu is horrendous. Waikiki to Ko Olina is a 75 minute drive (one way) the two times we did it and parking is a nightmare! Taxi? $100 - one way. Rent the car. I'll just get up early and jet down there! No, you won't. The \"Base Traffic\" starts at 4:30 and is bumper to bumper. The people at this resort are typical Marriott quality customer service with a smile types. Friendly, efficient, helpful and fun. A+ on the service. There are two restaurants and a bar on site. All are \"resort priced\" (lunch was $45 for two of us - burgers and beer) , but the food is really good and in ample supply. You also have a \"welcome gift\" that will get you 10% off at these and other restaurants in the area like at the JW Marriott just a 10 min stroll down the beach. The pools, beaches, and spa are not that crowded for the time of year we went (mid-April) and we expected a ton of kids (Disney resort next door) but other than a few kids with Grandparents it was a nice, uncrowded stay. We used the hot tubs (made from lava stone! way cool) and they are HOT tubs. Feel around with your hands for the inlets as the water coming out of these is really, really hot and could burn you if you parked your butt in front of it.

At this hotel the $30 parking is the same for either valet or self park. If you are so bitter and rude against tipping the valet a few bucks for getting and parking your car, then self park it yourself, I myself have no problem tipping a valet...if I (or anyone) can afford to travel to Hawaii for vacation, I think I can afford $2-$5 to tip a valet.", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "BC, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAmazing property - kid friendly and more\u201d", "Author": "LadgoestoFR", "ReviewID": "UR129127354", "Content": "My family and I stayed at the Marriott Ko Olina for a second time this March.

My husband and I came here on our honeymoon. Thinking this was the place to be. We had an early flight and went to the hotel to see if we could do an early check-in and they said our room was not available and they would call us when it was ready. So, ok, we can handle that. Keep in mind normal check-in is at 4pm. We went driving around not very far away because we thought the room was going to become available soon. We get a call 20 mins from 4pm saying our room was ready! Really? 20 minutes away from normal check-in and they call??? Don't understand why the front desk just didn't tell us that right now early check-in is not possible and that we should come back at 4pm. We would have respected that and went driving to the other side of the island knowing that there is no chance for our room to be available., instead we hung around the area which had industrial stuff down the beach from us. Once we got our room the front desk told us that we had to valet every time because our tower didn't allow self parking which is ridiculous. We are not going to pay the price for parking which was approximately 30 dollars a day and have to tip for someone to go get the car also? We can park and walk perfectly fine ourselves and save the money. So, after a few times of valeting we asked if we could just park on our own which they allowed. They should have gave us the option of self parking to begin with. In the room the AC was broke. Did not work at all!! I would think housekeeping would catch this or the people prior to us staying there would have notified the front desk that the AC was broke. First night we suffered through the stuffiness, thought we could just open up the windows and let the breeze in but out of control drunk adults kept us awake. I understand if you want to entertain but we are not 17 here and having high school drunken parties. This happened on more than one occasion of hearing grown adults yelling cause they were drunk. We could also hear through the walls.NOT impressed at all. I felt as if they kept trying to sell us a timeshare here also. No, we don't want to buy anything we just want to be left alone.

They have a round opening in the top that dumps a waterfall into the middle of the area. Great fun. Several spas, some adults only. The bar by the pool had friendly staff as did the staff passing out the shave ice and the towels. We didn't have any trouble finding lounge chairs. Ate at Longboards restaurant. Nice location and decent food. I liked the sweet potato fries. They had their Wednesday barbecue that the kids liked. Bread pudding had no sauce which I found unusual. Wifi is free and connection, even out by the pool was decent. I didn't use it a lot, but others were and I didn't see anyone throwing their computers into the pool, so they must have been satisfied.

But when we checked in, we were given a room on one of the lowest floors (despite requesting a \"high floor\" in the comments section of the reservation, specifically confirming with the desk clerk that this room had an ocean view, and asking whether any upgrades were available, given my Silver Reward status). That meant that while the room faced the ocean (as opposed to the mountain side of the hotel), I could not see the ocean at all from the room. One had to go to the far end of the lanai/balcony and stretch over, in order to catch a glipse of the ocean through the trees and buildings. I went back down to the front desk and got a different clerk. She explained that all of the rooms were rentals of time share properties and that when that particular unit was built, it was deeded as ocean view. I told her I understood that, but since I paid extra for an ocean view and the room currently does NOT provide such a view, I was requesting for her to look to see whether a genuine ocean view room was available. It helps to be both polite, logical and persistent. She found me a room on a much higher floor in a different building (there are three different buildings). I had to move my car as well as the luggage, but it was well worth it. This time, I had a beautiful view of the gorgeous man-made bay (what is called a \"lagoon\" at all of the Ko Olina properties). I am attaching some photos to this review. The room itself was not fancy or huge, but it was fine. The sofa bed was unusually nice, with a good foam mattress rather than uncomfortable springs. Daughter appreciated that. Several very nice features of this resort: no resort fee, although there is a nightly parking charge, which seems to be standard for Oahu and probably most of Hawaii. I had free Internet; not sure whether that was due to the Silver Reward status or just comes with all rooms. There are several pools and multiple hot tubs to enjoy. My room only had a microwave, fridge and plates/silverwear. But other larger units probably have a small kitchen one could cook in. There are several areas with nice barbecue grills and one apparently can check out clean barbecue utensils from the pool stands. I saw a few people saving money by grilling their own steaks, etc. The lagoon #3 right out front is beautiful and has water breaks for calm water, great for swimming and young families. The lagoons all have wonderful palm trees and grass areas as well. The other lagoons in the area are an easy walk away. Lagoon #2 is supposed to have the best snorkeling. I found it just o.k. and did not see any turtles although there are supposed to be some in there. Also an easy walk away are the Aulani/Disney resort and the JW Marriott hotel. One cannot use the pool facilities at the other resorts but one certainly can frequent their shops and restaurants. Disney's water features look like a blast for families with small kids -- a lazy river with rafts and an aquarium like feature where you can snorkel among hundreds of colorful fish. The latter seems absolutely perfect for first time snorkelers. Also, check out the man-made reef feature at the JW -- lots of hammerhead sharks and manta rays swimming there. There is a smallish shopping center a long walk or short drive away where you can grab a lunch or snack at lower prices than at the resort. Also, a huge tip -- the small market in the shopping center is part of the ABC Store chain and has the same decent prices and selection, AND a terrific deli that can make you great sandwiches, cooked to order breakfast, etc. They even have some spam musubi if you know what that is. Ko Olina has a relaxed vibe, nothing like Waikiki. Yet it is only about 30 minutes away so you can drive into a bigger town if you wish. (about 10 minutes or less away there is a small town with a real supermarket, a Costco, Longs Drugs, etc.) You also are better situated to explore the North Shore from Ko Olina than from Waikiki. North Shore has amazing beaches, including huge surf during the winter to watch daredevil surfers or fantastic snorkeling at Shark's Cove during the calmer summer water. And, of course, Shave Ice!

The Ko Olina Marriott has Villas available with full kitchens...and just 10 minutes away is a supermarket and a Costco. We bought all supplies on day 1 and never spent 1 dime at a restaurant on location. (Yes, I'm too cheap to spend $40 per person on breakfast, sorry) I cannot comment on any of the restaurants or food choices as we never frequented them. We even brought our own collapsible cooler and brought our own drinks to the pool. There was no sign saying we could not, and nobody ever said anything or gave us a dirty look. I'm too cheap to pay $10 for a beer or watery Mai Tai. (the supermarket sells all alcohol including spirits...a very small bottle of rum at the resort is 5X the price) There are multiple pools including one without kids. There are great gas (stainless steel) BBQ grills. We used them almost every day. Self parking or valet was the same price at $35/day. We did use the valet and gave the guy a tip each time we picked up our car...but it was very nice to just call down and have the car ready for you when you got downstairs. Overall, this place is awesome. I would only stay there again if I could get the full kitchen. The JW does not have that option and they had signs on their pool that \"outside drinks were not allowed\". We used points...I believe 200,000 or maybe 210,000 for 6 nights in a 2 bedroom villa with full kitchen. There is a great walking path that connects all 4 properties and the marina...so if you want to take a nice stroll, it's right there. The workout facility was great. It got a little crowded between 7-8...but you should be able to find an open treadmill or eliptical. Get there before 7 to be 100% or after 8. The Fia Fia show is expensive and our kids were able to see the whole thing from the lobby's balcony. The Polynesian Culture Center is a great experience with a great show at the end of the day. It is about 90 minutes away...so be warned. It looks close on a map...but it's 90 minutes. However, my kids loved it and thought it was the best experience. Pearl Harbor is close by. You are on the other side of the bad traffic...so going to the airport was easy. ***We were maybe 30 minutes from the Aloha Bowl...which every Wednesday has hundreds of vendors selling all the souvenirs for a fraction of the price found in hotels and stores. You cannot miss this. Trust me...you will save a ton of money buying your sovenirs here.

My parents ate at Chuck's Steak and Seafood as my mother is a diebetic and had to eat right away. They said the food was excellent. We rented a car as the rental and parking was way less than a cab or other transportation. The view from the room was great! We could see the ocean through beautiful landscaping. I had my morning coffee on the lanai. The grounds are immaculate and the walking/running path is superb. I felt like I was in paradise. We got fresh rolls from the Marketplace for breafast. They are baked every morning. mmmmm! The most impressive thing was the service. From checkin to bell service, everyone was helpful and friendly. I felt totally pampered. My father has some mobility problems and I had not mentioned this when I reserved the room or checked in. The room was a long way from the elevator and the resort is large making it necessary to walk a ways to get to some things. I would suggest calling ahead if this is a problem.

Right now there are 2 1/2 towers open, I understand that the Hale Naia tower will be fully open in a few months. I also heard that they are planning on building a 4th tower? Not sure if this was true. One of the things we liked about the resort is that it didn't seem crowded at all, although we understood it was full... with another 1 1/2 towers this may change.

When I then asked for a higher floor, the desk person conferred with the manager and said that the hotel was full but because I woudn't have an ocean view I would only be charged the garden view rate. First of all, isn't the point of a reservation to actually reserve a room? I made the ocean view reservation months ago. Also, had I not asked for a higher floor room I think they were going to charge me my original ocean view rate...crooks. I think good customer service would have said that if my original reservation wasn't available they should upgrade me rather than downgrade, and if having to downgrade they should then further discount. In the building we were in, only valet allowed, not self park. While the same price at $30 a day, it was a little annoying to have to tip with every use of my car, especially since we went out multiple times a day. Not sure why self park not allowed, supposedly they only allow timeshare owners to self park but there were plenty of open spars. Also the bell desk was understaffed so many times no one was there and you'd have to wait a while for your car, Room was ok, layout useful, but decor was dated, housekeeping did a good job. Decor definitely not on par with the room price. Staff on more than one occasion was rude and unpolished. Since this is primarily a time share I think it lags behind in customer service in comparison to a hotel, after all, most residents/owner money is locked in so there is less incentive to provide the best service. I think their staff needs more training. Just go over to the Aulani to notice an immediate difference. Every staff person there immediately greets you and tries to help. At the Marriott when I needed just some replacement pool wristbands the front desk was very busy. I asked the concierge to help and she was rude, reluctantly helped and interrogated me beyond reason to ensure i was actually a resort guest. Setting of the hotel on the lagoon was nice, the pool was nice too. Didn't try the restaurants, drove into kapolei for meals and ate at the Aulani buffet once (not very good). Overall, if you need a suite setup because of kids the room layout works but the customer service is not very polished and prevents me from fully recommending this place.

While we thoroughly enjoy a few days in the hustling, bustling Waikiki prior to Ko Olina, we are always happy to arrive at this quiet destination resort area on Ko Olina's west coast. The Marriott property is one of several tourist accommodation options available at Ko Olina, which is also the site of a marina and 18-hole golf course and several residential developments. A small - yet to be completely occupied - market place, Ko Olina Station, has a convenience store with deli (mentioned by other reviewers), a Mexican restaurant, ice cream shop, Hawaiian restaurant and soon, a sushi place as well. We stay in the small 'efficiency' unit side (king bed, couch, chair, kitchenette with micro-wave, refrigerator and coffee pot) and small balcony as part of our stay, then move to the larger, full-size condo unit for the remainder of our time. We own an ocean view unit but the property has ocean front, ocean view and mountain view rooms so those renting should be clear on what they have rented. (Some 'mountain view' rooms have partial views of the ocean and others look out over the parking lot and golf course with no water view). The kitchens in the large unit are very well appointed with all you would need for cooking meals in the room. Salt and pepper, dish soap, paper towels and a coffee starter kit are provided. Shampoo and soap for the bath. Cooking in the smaller side can be done using creativity and thinking of it as a 'glamping' (glamour camping) type experience. The grounds: as others have written, Ko Olina features four lagoons and the Marriott property fronts one of them making it feel as though it were the private lagoon of that property. In reality the lagoons are open to all guests and residents. Local families often head to the beaches to make a day of sunning and picnicing at Ko Olina. Three large pools serve the property - one with a water slide that delights kids and another with a zero-edge sandy-beach type entry that toddlers love. Grocery shopping is a treat when staying at Ko Olina. For those who are Costco members, there is a large store about three miles away in the city of Kapolei (also a Target, Safeway, and soon, a Walmart). A bit further down the road in Waipahu, though, there's a large locally owned store, Don Quijote, where we head for packaged Hawaiian favorites of Lomi Lomi, Kailua Pork, and Lomi salmon as well as more than a dozen types of poke (fresh marinated fish and seafood). It is an ethnic food lovers paradise. Prices are reasonable and the selection is large. Another favorite is to head to Waianae, the town just up the road from Ko Olina for its Saturday morning Farmers' Market held at the local school. Fresh fruits and vegetables, eggs, baked goods, fish are among the items available in this small, but interesting market. As one other reviewer noted, there are banks of gas barbeques for guests to use and it is a treat to gather at them and visit with other guests trying out their culinary skills. You can bring adult beverages from your room to sip while cooking. Restaurants: Chuck's Steakhouse in the Marriott is one of our favorite Mai Tain Happy Hour destinations and their food is good. A beachfront restaurant, Longboard's, is also on the Marriott property. In addition to the places mentioned above, there is a Roy's Restaurant at the golf course (it was being repaired as result of a kitchen fire and not open while we were there this year but was scheduled to open soon after our departure). There are many restaurants in Kapolei, one of our favorites is Thai Lao in the Halekaui Center (across from the Safeway shopping center) Activities: In addition to golf, there are several boat/snorkeling tours that leave from the marina. The resort also offers a number of fitness and craft classes. One of the few free activities is the plant tour of the grounds offered once a week. Just walking the grounds is good exercise and during our time exploring the lagoons this year we saw our first Hawaiian Monk Seal sunning herself on the beach and also Hawaiian sea turtles. Our stay was during Chinese New Year so we were treated to a special performance by the Honolulu Lion Dance group. Ko Olina provides us the feel of an outer island stay without the cost of flying to an outer island. It is also close enough to Honolulu that you could drive back into town for any number of performing arts events or tourist attractions there. There is a shuttle bus service to get you back and forth in the resort, but not too and from the resort. A rental car - especially for getting off the property to buy groceries - is a must. Parking charges apply for those who rent here.

Room was huge, with three patio doors going out to a wrap around deck that offered a partial mountain view and a view of the cove/ ocean that is partially blocked by some palm trees. I'm a Marriott Rewards member, but I figured we would get stuck on a lower floor since were just \"renters\", not owners or Vacation Club members. Still the room was large, clean, and the full kitchen was great. We only ate out twice (Chucks, and Longboards, see separate reviews), the rest of the time we prepared meals in our kitchen. Safeway grocery in Kapolei is open 24hrs and is only a short drive from the Ko Olina resort area. Sign up for their \"Safeway Club\" card to save some money, it's worth it. The resort is beautiful overall, but it's not without some minor flaws that would be easier to overlook if it didn't cost so much to stay here. Most were very minor issues with service and/or maintenance. I think the more we pay, the more we expect things to be perfect (just to give you an idea...this is the most per night that we've ever paid to stay anywhere, and we've been to Ireland, Vegas, Sonoma, and Germany, just to name a few). A few of the minor issues: there was some garbage in the hall outside the door of a room adjacent to ours, it sat there all week! They have several hot tubs on the property, none of which seemed to be working 100%, the problem was with the jets, some work well, some work a little, and some don't work hardly at all. There is a sewage/ garbage smell in the parking garage that's a little overwhelming at times. I suppose this could have been avoided if we used valet, but we chose to self park so that we could come and go at a moments notice without having to arrange for our car to be brought out. And yes...as with most places that you stay in Oahu, there is a parking fee at this resort of $30/ day, but you can come and go as often as you like, no extra charges. We took several walks and there was always some garbage laying around somewhere (never a lot), and definately not the resorts fault, garbage is from lazy/ sloppy people, but I would think they would have maintenance workers out at all times picking that stuff up during the day. We sat through the \"Vacation Club\" sales presentation (about 1 to 1.5 hours) and received a couple of tickets for a Sunset Cruise (see other review) that turned out to be pretty cool. The only drawback was that we had to drive down to Waikiki and park at the Hilton Hawiian Village to board the boat, but it didn't cost us a thing, they even comped the parking at the Hilton (which would have been $24). The sales presentation was relatively painless, and definately not high pressure, we opted not to participate at this time, and walked away with a much better understanding of the Vacation Club,how it works, and the costs associated with it. My wife and I went on this trip by ourselves and enjoyed our stay, we took several walks around the resort area which include the Disney resort, the other Marriotts, and some shops/ restaurants, the whole area is just awesome. The coves/ beaches at the resorts are beautiful and offer (what seems to be) a more relaxed/ laid back setting than the Waikiki area. We never heard anything late at night with our doors open except the ocean and the wind. This was our first time to Oahu and here are a few of the things that we did that I would definately recommend: Pearl Harbor (Arizona Memorial). Aloha Stadium Flea Market. Drove up H2 to North shore area (saw Sea Turtles basking on the beach), then down the east coast. Dole plantation (just visited the gift shop). Drove out to east coast (H3) and down around south east coast to Diamond Head/ Waikiki area, stopped at several scenic overlooks to take pictures, Haunama Bay, climbed Diamond Head (tough climb, but well worth it if you can do it).

To begin with, the resort has nice swimming pools and wonderful beach. Although the weather is nice and warm in 1st week of Jan, the sea water is a bit chilly for swimming. The location is OK given the size of Oahu, by which I mean it is about 25 miles from city center / the Waikiki beach, 20 miles from the HNL airport, and you pretty much can drive to any place on the island within 1.5 hour. To our disappointment, the studio unit we got is much smaller than a typical hotel efficiency room. In the past, we have stayed at studio unit of other Marriott timeshare resorts including Marriott\u2019s Maui Ocean Club, comparatively speaking, this one is surprisingly small. Our unit does have a balcony, but too bad the space is not enough for two persons move around. What bothers me most is the noise coming from the highway nearby; you would not have a problem if you have your glass door shut. However if you wish to enjoy natural sea breeze and warm sunlight, it's just too noisy to leave the door of balcony open. Overall we had a good time in Oahu; the island has everything a family looks for on a vacation: beautiful sea, shopping, variety of food, etc. To summarize my opinion for Marriott's Ko Olina Beach Club: it\u2019s good, but not great, I definitely would not use \u201cluxury\u201d to describe this resort.

The only criticism is the 5th floor is at the same elevation as the canopy of the coconut tress so they partially blocked the view. Be aware that this a timeshare mot a full service hotel however the common areas and restaurant areas are much superior to most timeshares. The master suite has a king size bed with full ensuite including a jetted tub. The second bedroom has 2 double beds with full bathroom across the hall. The bedrooms are private as the common kitchen living/dining room separates them. Internet is free but quite slow however there is wireless as well as ethernet (both free) and the lattter improves the speed some however downloading large files was still very slow. The grounds are well maintained with extensive pools and beaches. The beach was not crowed and it was easy to get beach chairs. We particularly enjoyed the hot tub at the south end of the resort that had a wonderful view of the beach. The beaches are engineered half moons with cuts in the reef that allows good water circulation but very little wave action. The water was also warmer than the open pacific and very pleasant. Beaches were spotless with hardly any weed in the water, perfect for swimming, not good if you want to surf or use a boogie board. We did not try the onsite restaurant as we went off property for 2 dinners and used the excellent gas BBQ's provided onsite for the other 2 nights.

Very nice golf course available within walking distance but a free shuttle pickup is offered. ABC food store, coffee shop, ice cream 15 min walk / 5min drive away.

Four lagoons, beautiful walking trail, and very well-kept landscaping. Other than that, our trip was a huge disappointment. We tried to book at the nearby JW Marriott, but the NFL bought the entire hotel for the Pro Bowl (we didn't even know this when we booked our stay). So we settled on the Ko Olina Beach Club; one of the selling points was that we could use the restaurants, spa, and amenities at the JW Marriott. We made dinner reservations at Azul Restaurant at the JW Marriott our first full night there, and then were made to wait outside the hotel on the lawn until 10 minutes before our reservation by hotel security. We had arrived early to enjoy a drink in the restaurant bar, and instead were made to feel like criminals waiting on the lawn with a bunch of security guards! Other downsides to this resort: An astonishing lack of restaurants; very small room with a bed and bed linens that weren't anything close to \"resort standards\"; extremely limited poolside food and beverage service; high-priced buffet breakfast at Longboards is really your only option for a sit-down breakfast, and certainly NOT worth the $18 per person! The temperature in the lagoons was warmer than the pool water temperature, which they kept around 75 degrees. You really couldn't enjoy the pools, but rather used them to \"cool off.\" Most of the clientele was over 60 years old and time-share owners. They were unfriendly and didn't seem happy; there was certainly no \"vacation\" vibe that we typically see at other resorts. Grumpy, grumpy old people worried about the price of a Pepsi and planning their next time-share destination. If you stay here and do not rent a car, you'll find that your dining options are extremely limited. Longboard's $18 breakfast buffet; Chuck's Steakhouse for dinner with its salad bar and mediocre food; and a few high-priced, not worthy restaurants at the nearby JW Marriott and Disney resorts. We walked to Just Tacos and the Hawaiian Barbecue restaurants for a couple meals; huge disappointment. We have better Mexican food and Hawaiian food in the city where we reside. Just Tacos \"famous\" tacos were awful; salty and hard to tell what kind of meat you were eating! Although the location was incredible and the grounds kept impecable, I'm not sure we will come back. My husband and I are used to first-class resorts, with beautiful rooms, expensive bedding, and outstanding service. This \"resort\" had much more of an \"apartment\" or \"condo\" feel, with most of the clientele being time-share owners who cooked their own food and washed their own clothes. No one should plan on coming during the Pro Bowl; they close off part of the walking path and make you feel like criminals for wanting to visit the JW Marriott and pay full price to use their higher-quality amenities! And speaking of amenities, we also had spa appointments at the JW Marriott's spa, but canceled after they made us wait on the lawn until 10 minutes before our dinner reservation. So we booked massages at Ko Olina Beach Club, in little makeshift \"tents\" that they had erected poolside. The price of those 50-minute massages ($100+) wasn't much less than the JW prices, but what a huge disappointment! I requested a therapeutic massage, aka \"deep tissue\", and my therapist, Pi, was a tiny little woman who didn't have the strength nor the skill to do a decent massage.

We were two couples who shared a two bedroom villa and it was great - we were able to buy some food to eat breakfast and use the kitchen and we loved all the pools and the beach lagoon. If I come back to Hawaii with kids, this would be a great place to stay. Since I'm a Marriott Associate I stayed on a discounted rate and we did not receive maid service but that didn't matter much since we were only there 3 days. We just tidied up after ourselves and alled the desk if we needed towels or any other necessities. I think the only improvement could have been a better selection for breakfast - there was only a bar/grill type place and a steakhouse on property but like I said we went shopping and bought food for breakfast to save a bit of time & money.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cIf you have a family and are self sufficient-this is the way to go in a one bedroom suite!\u201d", "Author": "BotRoad", "ReviewID": "UR123185595", "Content": "Ko'Olina is the quiet but not remote part of Honolulu.

We knew going in that we probably would not receive an upgrade(even though my husband is a Platinum Premier) as it is a vacation club, and after reading reviews. We had reserved an ocean view room...well it was a poor excuse for an ocean view. We overlooked the pool and stared right at the tree tops, as we were on the 5th floor. The room is rather small, but it does have a decent size fridge, a sink and microwave. BUT in our room the fridge kept our goods just above lukewarm warm, so I had to call down and have it fixed. As well, our shower was not working properly, so they came up to fix them both. Well, let me tell you that I ended up fixing the knob on the fridge AND we had to call a second time to have the shower fixed. Definitely not great service. Oh, but they did leave a magnet as an apology! My husband called down and spoke with several different people (including two managers) and even they neglected to call us back. They did then offer us another room 2 days later...but we still would need to check out of our room by 10 and then weren't guaranteed when we would get into the next one...so needless to say we said forget it. They kept telling us that they were 99% full, but the pool beaches or restaurants were NEVER busy, and we stayed there the week before Xmas. Something didn't quite add up. There are miniclub activities for the kids, but you have to pay for them. I didn't mind except the leader DID not interact with the 3 kids that were there. She sat at her \"desk\" and never moved. There are lots of chairs available at the beach and pool. Both are great areas for children. Restaurants are few and far between (hotels are pricey, there are a couple in the strip mall down the street...Mexican was good). If you want to drive 2 miles back to the shopping area, there are a couple of others that are decent. There is a Kmart, Target, and Costco also in this area, so you may want to take advantage of the BBQ's available at the resort or if you are staying in a condo. Parking is ridiculously expensive...but NOTE: self park and valet are the SAME PRICE for non-club members. So take advantage of valeting it!! Staff members do not seem to communicate with each other...we had a parcel that was to be denied and sent back to the shipper. Needless to say they received it (while we were still at the hotel!), accepted it...and called us 24 hours later, after we had arrived at home. So, eventually the noted it was there error and forwarded it to us. And this was also indicated by the lack of return phone calls to my husband after his discussions with the front desk. It is a nice quiet area of Hawaii...if you are looking for a relaxing vacation, this would be a place to stay. There are no hotels on either side of it, and is only one of four in the area. Nice lagoons for children, but no waves if that is what you are looking for in a beach. NOTE: The Disney hotel is two doors down...it just opened and is a beautiful property. If you have children, take them to the character breakfast...a little pricier than the hotel breakfast, but not by much!! It is a buffet, and was VERY well done.

The service from everyone was 1st rate and as nice and happy as they could be. The all you can eat BBQ on Wed night for $29/person is high but considering the high cost of food there, it was worth it. Although check-out is 10 am, the front desk will give you a visitor key that gets you into the locker room to change so you can use the whole place until you're ready to leave--you just need to remove bags from your room into storage or your car. The one bedroom room was great with 2 high def flat screens and a large lanai. Very comfortable for 2 people, probably not good for more since only one bath although a separate dressing area with a sink is nice. ou don't have to park in the garage--there are about 30 spots next to building 2 which are very convenient to the elevator. Disappointments: There were very limited food choices in Ko Olinda, Disney's Aulani is quite expensive and the JW Marriott is all high end Asian food. You do need a car and even then there aren't many choices. so stop at Costco just 2 miles away to stock up.

The pull-out was actually pretty comfortable - much better than the usual coil-in-the-back models. The sliding doors that separated the den from the master bed was great for added privacy. The kids enjoyed the pools, especially the waterfall/slide one that was farthest from the Hale Moana tower. They didn't find it overly cold as some other reviewers have stated, even though it was early January. The grounds were beautiful and we particularly enjoyed the wildlife - a den of feral (but quite tame) cats that lived in the shrubbery by the beach and a mongoose sighting.

Wanted to get this review out for everyone. First of all, we got the 2 bedroom ocean view room that looked over the pool. The view was really incredible!!! I really think that I will never again do a garden view, we were definetly spoiled with this room!!! We are not time share owners but have quite a few points on Marriott, so we were able to get the 2 bedroom ocean view for 170K points for 5 nights, But here is one thing we would change....if you want a more quiet room then I would choose a room that was over by the adult pool. It seemed like the noise coming from the pool kinda echoed up, we were on the 9th floor. I read another one of the reviews about pillows at the resort, yes, the pillows kinda suck!!! But the beds are great and super shower and soaking tub. A must try is the shaved ice by the towel bar. Black Raspberry is to die for!!!! One other thing that was kinda of a bummer is that your checkout time is at 10am, okay so this is what we did....the line to checkout was super long, so my husband waited another 30 minutes before checking out and I finished packing up. It was crazy because at 9:55 there was a knock on our door and I said \"I'm just trying to finish packing\" the cleaning team was so great they said \"no worries, just take your time\". When we originally asked for a late checkout at the desk they said NO, because all the owners were checking in on Sunday and needed to get the room cleaned, they said they were 99% booked. HMMMM....I think they are supposed to say that to everyone. Anyhow, we finally checked out of our room around 11:15 or so. They also give you a key that allows you to use their facilites after you checkout, our flight wasen't until 10 pm so we really had the whole day to hang out, they have some lockers and showers.

I have been to 44 cities in 35 countries on personal travel plus I travel for work so I have stayed in literally hundreds of hotels. This property is a beauitful resort with gorgeous landscaping, a very elaborate pool that includes lava rock and beach, koy fish ponds, as well as it's own private beach. The rooms are excellent and clean. Why did I rate the property poor, you may wonder? Because a property charging in excess of $350/night should be excellent so I'm not judging it verses a Holiday Inn but by other resorts at that price point. That said, you don't get you pay for at this property. For example, the mattress was average but the pillows were cheap, flat pillows that you have to stack multiple pillows for any support. I've stayed in sub $100 hotels that had much nicer bedding. Customer Services was lacking. The front desk was helpful but every time I called whether it was from an outside line or dialing 0 to reach the valet, I always got placed on lengthy holds. The maid didn't leave any coffee the second day. When I called room service, I was told coffee is only offered the first day. Really?! At almost $400 a night? Hotel 6 gives you daily coffee at $35/night. The parking charges were egregious. At $30/night it was more expensive to park our car than it was to rent it. Finally, I have never seen a 4 pm checkin and they made us wait till the very last minute of that. Something to think about if you're coming off a long flight and want to shower or nap in your room. Couple that with a quite early 10 am checkout time and you really get shorted on both ends during a short stay. Perhaps not so critical on a longer stay but it significantly cut into our vacation time on our breif two night stay. Last thing, they offer a Lauau on Tuesday nights for $90 that was decent. However, you can see a much larger and better Luaua at the Polynesian Cultural Center for $65 so, like most things at this Marriott, it is highly overpriced.

The resort grounds are beautiful with perfect landscaping, nice pools, waterfalls, restaurants and an ocean front lagoon. The resort has 3 towers open now with a new tower to open by the end of 2011. The newest tower is the Hale Nai\u2019a. All rooms facing west from the 4th floor up have an ocean view. All rooms facing east have a view of the harbor and parking areas. The main building called the Hale Kona Tower is in the center of the resort and hosts the main entrance, Chuck\u2019s Steak and Seafood, mini market, concierge, check in counter, Marriott Vacation Club membership presentations and guest rooms with partial views of the ocean. Most ocean views are side views off the balcony. The 3rd building is called the Hale Moana Tower. This building has views of the ocean on the west side and mountain- parking lot views on the east side. There are many pools and hot tubs with plenty of chairs for every one. There is a no saving chairs policy at this resort. Smoking is only allowed in a few areas of the resort. No smoking is allowed in the guest rooms or balconies. There are multiple gas bar-b-que stations on the grounds with cooking tools near each building. The two restaurants on site are Chuck\u2019s in the main building and Longboards next to the Ko Olina path way. The prices are in line with upscale restaurants. A glass of wine and a cocktail cost $18.00 + tip. Hamburgers are $17.00. Steak dinners start at around $35.00. The fitness center has everything you would expect in a fitness center. The wellness spa offers various types of treatments including massages. The two bedroom unit we enjoyed had a full kitchen that included everything but enough cabinet space . The counter top is granite. The range / stove has a microwave fan over the top of it. The fridge is full size. There is a washer/dryer in the closet next to the fridge. The master bedroom has a comfortable king bed, flat screen tv with dvd player, alarm clock and chairs. Thee view is fantastic from the bedroom. There are two bathrooms in the master bedroom. One has a soaking tub with sinks and the other has a shower, sink with toilet. The living/dining room has a comfortable queen size hideaway bed, two chairs, large dining room table, 42 inch flat screen tv, dvd player and empty storage drawers in the entertainment stand.

The main bathroom is a toilet, sink and tub/shower set up. The balcony is small, maybe 80 sq. ft. There is a reclining chair and table with 2 chairs. Parking fee\u2019s depend on your reservation type. Owners and their guest do not pay for parking. The resort is walking distance to Ko Olina Marina, TW Marriott Ihilane and Disney Aulani via the ocean front pathway. TW Marriott has a good restaurant. Disney Aulani allows you to bring the young ones in for a character meet and greet or to use the restaurants. Golfing is available in Ko Olina. Fishing, snorkeling and cruises are available in Ko Olina. The Paradise Cove Luau is ok but the Fia Fia event at the Marriott Beach Club is far better food and entertainment.

Even the pots and pans and tupperware were clean. Yes, the dishwasher was loud, and the washing machine in our unit was not working perfectly (had to run the spin cycle twice or the clothes would be soaking wet), but at least we had a dishwasher and washer/dryer. Very convenient. There are 3 pools at this property, and the one right outside our building had a very nice kids area with a sandy beach and a family jacuzzi. The lagoon was beautiful. Soft sand, beautiful blue water, and you can see small silver fish just a few feet from shore. Plenty of lounge chairs on the beach, and it was never that crowded. Plenty of seating, both by the pool and on the beach. The location is very convenient, as it's a short drive to Waikiki and the North Shore. Also, there is a Costco, Target, Safeway and Kmart less than 5 minutes away, so it's very easy to shop for the essentials. Lots of restaurant options close to the hotel, i.e. Roy's at the golf course, a couple of restaurants across from the Aulani, and tons of restaurants at the strip malls in Kapolei. We passed by an Outback Steakhouse, a couple of sushi places, a noodles place and a Zippy's. I would say the property is similar to other Marriott timeshare properties, but the service was a bit lacking at the Marriott Beach Club. The lady at the front desk who checked us in was abrupt and not very friendly. Also, it took over 2 hours (and 3 phone calls) to get a crib for our room, even though we requested one when we made our reservation and reconfirmed this during check-in. When the guy finally delivered the pack and play to our room, it was not assembled and the guy asked me if I wanted to assemble it myself. I described this resort as \"low key\" because hotel employees leave you alone here. Staff members do not greet you or say hello when they pass by. When you are at the pool, nobody will come around to see if you are okay or to ask if they can get you anything. There is no drinking water by the pools. It's more of a timeshare feel than a resort feel, which works for us because we like low key, but we've also stayed at other timeshare properties which have the excellent service you expect from 4 star properties. So we know that it's missing from the Marriott Beach Club. This was evident when we walked through the Aulani one morning and noticed that every staff member who passed by had a friendly smile and hello. Not a big deal, just an observation. Overall, we had a very pleasant stay here. It's nice to be away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki, and the Marriott is definitely more luxurious than most Waikiki hotels.

In fact I had decided that if they couldn't I was going to go somewhere else and sue Marriott for cost of the room and the inconvenience.

It is about 20 miles from Honolulu which we found perfect. We referenced this thread before we chose this location and read 20 entries, then came up with a composite picture that was incredibly accurate. The only problem with this resort is that the accommadations are a 3 to a 3 1/2. There is nothing wrong with them--the units are immaculately clean, but everything looks a bit dated which could be due to its contemporary decorations. The sinks in the main tower, Kona, were rusting and showed wear. However, the beds were modern and sleeping on them was a dream. The other issue another reviewer addressed on this thread was the view of the room. After reading this column, a reviewer mentioned that the front desk regards a view of the pool as \"a water view.\" I called ahead and requested a high floor (as per a reviewer, the 2nd floor is really the first floor). They told me \"no problem.\" When we arrived the woman at the desk gave us floor 2 near the pool and told us that it was a water view. Armed with what I read, I asked her if we could have a higher floor. She was inflexible and firm but polite and told us that \"it is a beautiful view of the lawn.\" I'll keep my own personal thoughts to myself here. We pleaded for another room but she told us that there was absolutely nothing open. We couldn't see a pool, just a lawn and people walking. When we got to the room, and opened the patio, smoke from the grills was wafting in our room and my husband called the manager and we were switched to the 6th floor of another tower which had a partially obstructed view of the water. We were absolutely THRILLED. After this, everything went smoothly. Since we were there in November, there were very few kids. The staff was incredibly attentive, but conspicuously absent when you didn't want to see them. We opted to take a snorkel class via marriott for $10 per person which gives you mask, fins and snorkel for an hour. Best money we spent. The instructor will answer all of your questions and explain what to stay away from, and what the ropes inside the lagoons mean. My husband and I snorkeled all the lagoons. They even gave us a laminated fish card so we could identify what we were seeing. and...yes we saw sea turtles. One in lagoon #2 (not Lucky--he's the sea turtle with the flipper missing). There is one lagoon off property if you go through Paradise lual--ask the concierge---the turtles hang out in 8 inches of water (see picture). There were three pools and they were delightful. The reflection pool was quiet and the pool with the slide is suspiciously warm. It has a killer waterslide, and this 41 year old couldn't get enough of it. Hawaii is expensive and a hamburger at Longboards was $21 with the $5 sharing charge. Longboards has a million dollar view, but the food's quality is on par with a pool snackbar. We ate breakfast every morning on our patio listening to the rustling of coconut leaves. We purchased cereal from Target or Walmart (Target is two miles away). Also, we went to the \"Down to Earth\" health store in the Target shopping mall for organic fruits and veggies which surprisingly were cheaper in some instances than the Times supermarket. We also bought liquid laundry detergent which they sell in bulk--we filled a small water bottle which was about $1.00 and lasted us the week and environmentally friendly. Drinks at the bar are upwards of $13 unless you get a drink at happy hour for $8. I highly recommend the \"Lava Flow\" if you like sweet drinks. Our plane didn't take off until 10pm and check-out was 10am, so we took advantage of the program they have at the Marriott which lets you use the facilities. The locker room was nicer than the room---with cherry cabinets beautiful fluffy white towels, showers, sauna and steam room with blow dryers. There were also sparkling clean restrooms every 20 ft. We fully enjoyed our last day there. Also, many are complaining about the $30 fee for parking. If you are an Interval international owner or an owner at the Ko Olina the fee is waived for one car.

This property was certainly more relaxing. It seems to be fairly new (I'm not sure when it was built) and is right next to the new Disney Resort. The grounds were beautiful, and the beach front was very nicely manicured.

We were using points so I really thought it was fine, but I saw their published rates and would have been a bit disappointed with the room size were I paying money for it.

I don't know what they were thinking when they built the balconies... There are larger rooms which have larger balconies. The other negative is that it is a timeshare and therefore, they are very persistent with the sales pitch.

The hotel is modern and the 3 pools was great. The kids loved the water slide, and we loved the adult only pool. The private beach was never a disappointment and the sunsets from the beach could not be beat. My only complaint about the hotel was the lack of opening windows.

The Naia pool has waterfalls and a really cool slide. The two hot tubs have a waterfall that provides a steady stream to relax your back. The rooms are simply outstanding - make sure you ask for ocean view - the sunset, at least in October, is directly outside your window; relax an enjoy on your balcony which includes a relaxing chair with a footrest. The lagoon is peaceful with ample lounge chairs to soak up the sun. Cabanas are available @ $30 / day and yes it's possible to get a freebie for one day by commenting how expensive the rate is. There are a host of activities each day including exercise and yoga sessions. The workout room is second to none with a diverse group of both strength training and cardio equipment. Take advantage of the free snorkling sessions each morning. There's quite a variety of tropical fish near the rocks the separate the lagoon from the ocean waves. If you snorkle take advantage of going to the nearby lagoons, particulary lagoon 2 which often has sea turtles, including one named Lucky. The rooms are quite comfortable with a large HD tv in the living room. The conceirage desk personnel are extremely helpful - it's a shame that Stacy has no enthusiam(just kidding of course). Parking is available on-site either outside your property or in one of the garages - in addition, there's valet parking available. MVC owners park for free - valet is also available around $5 a day. Longboards, restuarant near the lagoon, has a traditional fare with perfect views of the ocean. Staff is extremely friendly - no surprise if you'd stayed at other MVC resorts. Take advantage of the MVC sales pitch - the 90 minute presentation goes quickly and there's the opportunity to receive a valuable gift. We used ours as a credit for the Fia Fia luau show. We only paid $30 for my wife and I. Normal price would have been $180. Great show - highly recommended. Resort is on the western side of Oahu - I recommend renting a car ............taxi is quite expensive........unless you want to stay on the property for your entire time.

A complimentary washer & dryer were on the 14th floor (bring your own soap). The bed was absolutely fantastic. At home I sleep on a Tempurpedic and this one was almost as good. The one major downside was the lanai, which was the size of a postage stamp! In order for two people to be out on it required each of us to go single-file....and if the first person out had to go back into the room it required that both people had to get up and move. Regardless of this situation we still enjoyed sitting out on our last evening with a glass of wine while the piano music from the bar below drifted up. The accommodations were pretty much your typical Marriott style room and nothing felt particularly Hawaiian, but the room served it's purpose for just a 2 night stay. I personally would not stay here for a long term visit to Hawaii. I perfer a more natural setting nestled in with local people and resturants, but that being said the property is nice for what it provides. Anyone considering staying here for more than 2 nights should definitely secure a larger condo style unit so that you have room to move around. The pool and grounds were pretty.

We reserved an Ocean View one bedroom suite for a family of 4. When we checked in at 10PM the front desk clerk warned us that the room we were in had no ocean view, but told us \"anything above the 4th floor is considered ocean view\". Well we had a beautiful view of a rooftop and some trees, but not an ocean anywhere to be seen. When we checked out I complained that we paid more for an ocean view but our room had no view and the front desk clerk after 10 minutes did revise our rate to the non-ocan view category, but why make us even ask? Why take a room that even the front desk acknowledges has no view and try to pass it off as a view room? We only stayed here for one night on our way to Molokai - and the only reason we stayed here was to use their water slide. We needed to leave the hotel at 10;30am and the slide opened at 9AM - said so on the web site and i called to double-check before making my reservation - plenty of time to use the slide and get back to the room and change for our flight. But no - when we went down to use the slide the sign had a handwritten \"10AM\" written over the 9am for the opening time for the slide. Guess the slide staff doesn't want to wake up very early. My kids were disappointed, I was disappointed, but we managed to get over it and then changed our plans a little and thought we could still get in 15 minutes on the slide before leaving the pool. We were there at the slide right at 10AM waiting, but the slide was not open - finally after 10 minutes I went over to the pool shack to ask the staffers what time the slide would open, and the woman folding towels said she would be right over to open it!

We did a timeshare swap with a friend. Our week in St. kitts for hers in Hawaii. CHECK IN AND ROOM: The check in process went smoothly. Our room was not ready, but we waited by the pool bar and had a drink. It didn't take too long for the room to be ready. My wife went up to see if the room was satisfactory since we were told it was a penthouse villa, but a mountain view, not ocean view. When she arrived at the room, it was indeed mountain view, but the ocean was also easily in view if you simply turn to the right. We were in the tower that faces the marina and industrial area. I know from other reviews that this view has bothered some people, but we were fine with it. The Black Pearl from Pirates of the Carribean was dry docked at the marina, which was pretty cool to see. The room was standard fare for a Marriott timeshare property. Very clean and all the amenities of home. Nicely furnished and plenty big for the three of us. SERVICE: The service was great as usual, but unfortunately we experienced one glitch that we have NEVER experienced before at any other Marriott timeshare. The dreaded towel police. We woke up one morning and went to the pool. Then we took a walk out to Ko Olina Beach Park to see the Black Pearl a little closer. We came back to the pool for about 15 mins and then went up to get changed into our suits. When my wife went back down, our stuff was gone and somebody else was in our seats. She went to the activities hut and confronted the girl. They told her they took our stuff off the seats because we were not there for over a half an hour. This was not true and we told them so. We reported this incident to guest relations. We are fully aware of the seat saving policy and we know we did nit violate it. I hope that the guest relations manager spoke with the staff. Other than that the service by the staff was impeccable. Everyone we met greeted us with an \"Aloha\". The pool service staff was very attentive when we used them. We didn't use the concierge much. Security also was very good. We had an issue with our safe right after we checked in. I called the front desk and security showed up shortly thereafter and fixed the problem quickly. RESTAURANTS: We typically only eat at the restaurants for dinner, but on this trip we opted to use the grills they had on property. We went to Safeway in Kapolei to buy groceries. The grills on property were immaculate. They have a person that services them daily. You borrow the cooking utensils from the towel hut. We did eat a couple of things from the pool bar. The Parmesan garlic fries were awesome! Also had the Kula pork quesadillas which were very good as well. One night after a full day of sightseeing we went to Longboards for dinner. It was better than expected. ACTIVITIES: The pools are very nice. The one closest to our tower had the water slide and the waterfalls. The beach and lagoon was great for swimming. Other lagoons a short walk away were better for snorkeling. Most kids activities have a fee associated with them. We skipped those. There is a luau on property, but we opted to do one on Maui instead. Ko Olina Golf Course is nearby. We didn't use the spa facilities. OVERALL: The location of the resort is great. It is away from the city atmosphere of Honolulu. The grounds are really well kept, the staff is friendly and the rooms are beautiful.

They offer kids activities throughout the day, but sadly no Kids Camp (really would have liked to drop off the kids for a few hours one day and just chill). We ate at LongBoards near the lagoon several times for breakfast and lunch - pricey but good - and service was friendly and great! Our large group went for dinner at Chuck's one night, food notsogood; don't recommend. Take the free shuttle and treat yourself to an awesome dinner at Roy's; they also have a kids' menu. Bought little groceries on property at the small market, but then also took the free shuttle down to the little grocery store which offers a little of everything. You can also walk there, it's about 1mile or a little more. The rooms (we had a 2 bdr) were so nicely appointed, clean and very spacious. Had nice appliances, TVs, etc. We didn't have an ocean view, but there is not a bad view a this place - we looked at the golf course and marina. (See attached picture; ate out on the private little balcony for lunch & breakfast a few times) Almost forgot to mention the best thing - the on property Luau!! It was a blast! Good food and good entertainment, don't miss it. They have grills (about 6 or so) for anyone to cookout on, a nice workout area/room, and a playground right next to the \"beach\" pool. It's close to a nice marina; I went snorkeling one day and my husband went deep sea fishing one day. We grilled his fish for dinner! I'd go back in a heartbeat with or without my kids.

First of all, there is a big difference between staying in a hotel and staying at this timeshare resort. We have stayed at many Marriott properties and their level of quality is always dependable. It's the attitude of the guests that makes this timeshare stand out. They are just more out going and friendly, as are the few locals you will meet strolling the paved walkways along Ko Olina's beautiful lagoons early in the morning. It's a great family place but you will also see a lot of couples. It sounds crazy, but our experience has been that even the children staying there are so well behaved! Our daughter was married there a few years back and the staff went above and beyond to make it so special! At the suggestion of a key employee they were married on a Tuesday afternoon then proceeded to the Ko Olina's Polynesian show and luau as a sort of reception. To our surprise they had saved a special table up front for us. All week long the bride and groom were met with hugs and well wishes from countless guests which seemed like extended family by the end of the week. Quick hint: Wherever you decide to stay, if you have a kitchen don't be discouraged by the higher prices at the grocery stores. Join a Sams' Club before leaving home. The prices at Sam's were almost the same as our stores in the midwest. Also, for the typical souvenirs visit a local Walmart. Believe it or not, they have many of the exact same items as the shops but at a much lower cost. They even beat the flea market prices. (but don't miss the flea market!) Walmart is also the best choice for drug store items. (no, I don't work for Walmart) You will appreciate the fact that this property is away from the horrible traffic in Honolulu and the lagoons are a safe from strong tides.

Our room came with a full serviced kitchen and there is a BBQ area by the pools with minimal wait times so you can keep your costs down by not eating out every meal. There are a couple more resorts along the beach and a JW Marriott that you can walk to for a more romantic dining experience. Be sure to set aside a day fro the Polonesian Cultural Center, we had alot of fun and laughed alot, beautifully put on shows and there is a Luau feast/show in the evening.

You need a car as this place is not near anything. Parking however is over $30/day. I complained of course but they said it was a goverment imposed rate - really? We were supposed to have a studio with an ocean view but got a view of another tower. If you stood in one corner of the small balcony you could see the ocean, however if you stood in the other corner you could see the refinery. Yes that's right there is barbers Point refinery, and a power plant, and a garbage burner all within a mile of the resort. But who spends much time in their rooms. The property itself is excellant. several pools and swimming lagoons. Our studio was reasonably appointed and could accomodate 2 adults and 2 kids comfortably. The food at the resort was way overpriced - $18 for a hamburger. This is typical for these kinds of resorts but I don't get it. They overprice themselves so much that the majority of the guests don't eat there. Problem is there is not much in the way of decent restaurants other than an Outback which is about 5 mlies away in Kapolei. Within the complex there is an ABC store, a hawaiian barbque fast food joint, and a mexican restaurant. The ABC store is well stocked and reasonably priced as is the barbeque. Hopefully with Disney opening and bringing another 2,000 people to the area, additional amenities will be added. We went to the Fia Fia Luau held in the beach club on tuesday nights. Very expensive at $90 pp. The buffett was disgusting. Dried up fish and chicken, fatty stringy steaks and some salads. No seafood. If this was your hometown buffet the place would go out of business in a month. They start seating you at 4:30pm, Feed you at 5:15pm, have a really hoaky audience participation with one of the samoans that seems to go on for hours (it did) and the real show doesn't begin until 7:00pm The Samoan performers however were very good. They put their hearts into it. my advice to them would be to go find another hotel for their show. When the show started people tried to sneak in to watch but the were mostly chased out of the immediate area. Maybe Marriott could offer a non dinner packge, a couple of drinks and the show for $40.

In November I received the much anticipated call that I had successfully executed a trade and was staying at the Ko Olina on Oahu. I immediately began researching the property and reading many reviews on Tripadvisor and other sights. The vast majority of reviews praised the property and justifiably so. I cannot understand the reviews of the 'nay sayers\" but to each their own. The property was absolutely beautiful from start to finish. Upon arriving, we were warmly welcomed by a genuine and helpful staff member who directed us to the front desk for check-in. The staff at reception was extremely kind and helpful in getting us quickly started on our vacation adventure. Due to our early arrival, our rooms were not available but they were more than willing to store our luggage and give us temporary passes to begin enjoying the property. In addition, they offered to call my cell phone when the rooms were ready, which they did! The resort was full that week but we had no problem navigating the area, enjoying the ammenities or finding a space at one of the three pools. The only concern I have regarding the pools is with the Reflection pool, also known as the \"quiet pool\". Unfortunately, not listed as an adults only pool lead to many young families setting up camp and allowing their children to run amoke in this quiet area. We, along with others, made several phone calls to the front desk asking them to deal with the situation. They made some attempts at dealing with the problem but unfortunately, when you come up against mommies who feel their children can do anything they want witout regard for others, there isn't much they could do. We talked with one security guard who told us that some parents just give him a hard time when he asks them is control their children. Not surprising as this seems to me the \"MO\" of some young parents today. I digress... Dining and drink options were expensive but expected for a resort like this. There were a few properties within walking distance to try which offered variety. In addition, within 5 miles is a shopping plaza that contains many chain restaurant options. Generally, we don't eat at chain restaurants on vacation so we enjoyed trying the local fare at the properties within the Ko Olina area. The activities offered at the resort and the surrounding areas were wonderful. Snorkling in the lagoon's, walking trails, swimming, etc. The best night of the week was walking to the ABC store and picking up food to have a sunset picnic on the lagoon. What a moving moment and a great experience to share with friends or family. In addition to these we wanted to attend a luau and chose to go off property to Germaines instead of the Fia, Fia offered at the property.

The kitchen supplied pretty much everything you need for cooking quick meals. My kids were happy to have a \"home cooked\" meal every other night or so. I did wish a few basic items were included such as salt and pepper, cooking oil, foil, etc. Otherwise, it really was such a great convenience to have. The Safeway, Target, Costco and Longs Drugs, and many other stores are just a short drive away and the bell hops are great for helping you bring up all your groceries. I was always glad to tip because they were so nice. The beachs and pools were fabulous. The lagoon was always clean and not very crowded, but we spent the most time at the pools simply because there was so much to do. The water slide, volleyball net, basketball hoop, and lagoon pool were great fun. My 2 year old loved the shallow water in the lagoon pool. We only ate once at Chuck's and Longboards. The food at both were just decent, but the service was very friendly and nice. I regret not being able to try Roy's, but I suggest leaving the property for food, especially if you're looking for good local cuisine. The Fia Fia show was unfortunately canceled shortly after dinner due to rain, which I was really sad about. The chief was so funny and entertaining and we were really looking forward to a great show.

It was spacious, had a great view of the lagoon and pool. We used the kitchen facilities for every meal and ate on the balcony every night. There were no noise problems since the new construction is finished on the outside, they are working on the inside. The whole facility is in great shape. LAGOON The lagoon is fantastic for a dip and play time with the kids, although a bit chilly. The rocks break the waves at the inlet, so this is not a good place for boogie boarding. It is also not a good place for snorkeling. I was worried about crowding since it seems kind of small, but it was never crowded. There was always alot of chairs and alot of space to spread out in the water. There is also a nice walking path that goes by all 4 lagoons, great for an evening walk to watch the sun go down. Disney's Aulani is 2 lagoons down, and I can see that one byt the JW Marriott getting crazy busy. POOL There were 2 pools and both were great. The first one has a sand bottom entry and a shallow playing area for little kids. It is bordered by alot of greenery and there is alot of shade. The 2nd pool was even better with a slide, several waterfalls, a cave and meandering water paths.

The property is pretty, the rooms are large and well kept up, the service was good (Tina, the concierge should get some sort of medal for her enthusiasm!), the gym is great, and the pools are fun. The best part of the property by far, is the series of lagoons, each of which is a quiet little oasis on the ocean. We rented snorkel gear and had a great time exploring the reefs and looking at tropical fish. Considering how crowded and noisy the pool areas were, I was surprised by how relatively empty the beach was. There were always plenty of lounge chairs available --and the views were seriously beautiful! As nice as the property is, we had a couple of issues. As other have said, the restaurants onsite are very expensive and pretty mediocre. It's a resort, so I get why they are going to be expensive, but If you're gonna charge a lot of money, the food should be good and none of the restaurants on site were great. The Marketplace has sandwiches and snacks which is convenient, and there are grills on site to cook up lunches and dinners, but if you're not in the mood to cook yourself every day, you're limited. There isn't much food within walking distance except for Roy's (which is great/expensive) and in the new shopping center down the road which is still mostly vacant (a long, but do-able walk.) At the shopping center, we ate a couple of times at the mexican place called Just Tacos, which was good and pretty affordable (and has more than \"just tacos!\") I think that when the Disney resort opens soon, the shopping center will fill up quickly and there will be a lot more food options. So this issue might just take care of itself. The biggest issue I have with Ko Olina is the location. We picked it because we didn't want to be smack in the middle of Waikiki, but Ko Olina is so remote -- isn't near anything! So definitely rent a car and expect to drive AT LEAST a 30-40 minute drive to any attractions except for golf (ie: Waikiki, Pearl Harbor, horseback riding.) Also, don't expect a scenic drive. It's highways all the way.

We loved it so much we ended up purchasing a time share there. It's important to remember that this is a time share property. So if you are expecting high end room service and such the JW Marriott that is next door is a better choice for you. With that said, this property is fantastic. The grounds are beautiful and the villas are large and tastefully decorated. There is plenty of room for a large family to spread out. If you get the larger 1 or 2 bedroom villas they come with a full kitchen and laundry machines. By having full size laundry machines in your room, it allows you to pack lighter. We tend to do laundry 3-4 times during our stay. It's really convienent. With a full sized kitchen that has pretty much everything you need you can really save on food costs. Why take the family out to breakfast for $80 when you can easily cook it for under $10. It's a great way to save money that can be used on other fun stuff while on vacation. There is a Safeway just a few miles down the road that we go and stock up at the first day we arrive at the resort. We really love the pool areas as well as the lagoons. My daughter was 6 when we visited and I took her snorkling for the first time in one of the lagoons. The lagoons are great because they are protected from the big surf by large rocks stragically placed at the enterance to each lagoon. Yet each lagoon is still open to the ocean allowing for endless types of tropical fish to call the lagoons home. My daughter had a blast and was blown away by all of the beautiful fish that she saw. The pools are fantastic as well. My 4 year old who doesn't swim yet loved the shallow beach entry pool. My daughter loved the new pool which was added recently. It has a fast waterslide incorperated into it. I can't say enough good things about this resort but it is far from perfect. 2 of the 3 times we have stayed here our room wasn't ready by the 4pm checkin time. One time we had to wait 2 hours after the 4pm checkin time for our room to be ready. The restaurants that are onsite are overpriced and the food is just OK. Although the grill by the pool does serve decent food and really good drinks. We did have some broken stuff in our room once. Microwave missing a foot that would rock. Dishwasher that had broken loose and would fall over when opened. Wood floor warped in the kitchen and creaked. However everything was fixed when we called the front desk. They quickly sent up a service person. Still that took away an hour of our vacation waiting for them to come fix these problems. With that said, the problems were very minor. We love staying here and the kids can't wait to go back in October of 2012.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cWe love it here!\u201d", "Author": "elj111", "ReviewID": "UR112414501", "Content": "This was my second trip to KoOlina, my husband's first, and my parents' fifth, and we all loved it.

We traded into this resort for the 3rd time over the past several years.... Got a spacious 2 BR, ground level room that faced the ocean and was 30 steps from 2 hot tubs and the pool.... Fully stocked kitchen with all the appliances we have at home, delicious oversized shower, decadent king beds in each room, 3 large flat screen TV's (we DON'T have these at home!), in-unit laundry and FREE covered parking close by...... Our 3 and 5 year old boys LOVED the pools, water features and the beach.... In addition, i enjoyed grilling several dinners on the nearby outdoor grills..... Costco, Target and other shopping was 5-10 minutes away, so stocking up for the kitchen was a breeze...... What more could we ask for? I realize people stay at resorts for different reasons. Our plan when staying at the Marriott timeshares is to have a family vacation with all the comforts of home (and then some) once or twice a year.... That said, i can kinda understand some of the negative reviews if people are expecting a romantic getaway or get stuck in a hotel room while expecting a condo unit and so on.... My only complaints about Ko Olina (the area, not the resort itself) is that it's about a half hour from PH, Waikiki, HNL, traffic permitting (double or triple that during rush hour)... Then again, Oahu isn't that big, so the far reaches of the North Shore, traffic permitting, is less than 1.5 hours away.... Also, Ko Olina is near one of the most un-scenic parts of the island....and yes, an industrial park is not far away----it's just down the road from the Costco..... But if you drive a few miles to the North, it gets beautiful again..... That all said, if staying in a naturally beautiful place, or staying near all the \"action\" is important; or if you don't care to cook and eat in, then the Marriott Ko Olina Beach Club is probably not for you...... I do have a few small complaints regarding this resort----constant cold air blowing when not needed or wanted. Couldn't turn it off.

My husband has always wanted to visit Pearl Harbour, so our first trip to Hawaii had to be to Oahu. I wasn't interested in the craziness or crowds of Honolulu, so this was a good option for us - away from the craziness, but close to anything you'd need. We traded through Interval to stay here, and at the time we were told that all that was available was a studio. We learned after arrival that because Marriott now has its own vacation club that they aren't making the bigger rooms available for exchanges with outside agencies anymore. So FYI non-Marriott owners - you'll probably find it harder to get get higher floors, bigger rooms, ocean views, etc. However, parking was free for us and I really appreciated the calls from the owner's desk prior to our arrival - I still felt like I was treated as an \"owner\" (though we met others that didn't have the same positive experience). That said, we did have an ocean view room on the 11th floor of the new tower, and the room was just fine for the two of us. While we looked longingly from our tiny (TINY!) balcony with table and 2 chars at the one next door with sun-beds and lots of room, we managed with what we had. If you do get a view of the ocean from your room, it is SPECTACULAR - I would sit out there in the mornings with a cup of coffee and look for whales (and even saw a couple!) The furniture in the Naia tower was all new - including a fitness room right in the tower that we found more comfortable than the bigger one open to all resort guests. And if you're in a studio you won't have laundry in your room, but there are several laundry rooms you can use throughout the building.We thought the tower (and our room) was great and I don't think we'd have done any better anywhere else with a similar category room. The grounds are great. There is a walking/running trail along the property and lagoons that will give you a decent 5km up and back. We didn't have our little one along with us on this trip, but we'd bring her back to this resort for the pools and lagoon alone - small water slides, fountains, a shallow/beach entry pool area, and lots of places to play. Being that we were there without her, we enjoyed the \"quiet\" pool and adults only hot tubs :) Either way, lots of space and chairs available, even though we were told the property was close to full during our stay. We ate at several of the restaurants onsite and next door (at the JW), and the food was fine. We had the breakfast buffet a couple of times - mainly for convenience (as we didn't have a full kitchen to cook in), and it was fine - nothing to write home about but it did the trick. We had the sushi buffet at the JW (decent sushi and pretty good selection), ate at Roy's (yum!! great meal), and at the steak house on-site (pretty good). Yes, things are on the pricey side at the resort but that was what we expected. We attended the time-share presentation - partly because we were interested in finding out more about the program but we also wanted the free Fia Fia tickets :) The presentation was informative, we were out within the time promised, and although we didn't buy, we appreciated the opportunity to ask any questions we had about their ownership program and the property. Much lower pressure and MUCH more respectful than other time-share presentations we've attended. Fia Fia was excellent. Go. Its a small show, but the chance to watch the Chief in action is worth every penny (or every moment of the time-share presentation). Great for adults and kids. Go. Otherwise, we kept busy with drives up to the North Shore (ask the locals about which shrimp/snack trucks to stop at, they won't lead you astray), drives around the island, a day a Pearl Harbour, a helicopter tour (that was COOL!!!!), a trip in to Waikiki just to see it (craziness!!), got a massage by the pool (very nice), a sunset tour on the Ko Olina cat (leaves from the marina next door - AWESOME), and some good ol' R&R. I don't know that we'd go back again without our kids - but only because there are so many other places I still want to see. But I can see this being a great spot for us as our little ones get older.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Vacation\u201d", "Author": "iLove2vacay", "ReviewID": "UR102306491", "Content": "My family of 5 (including a 3 year old) stayed here for 6 nights the beginning of March. I knew it was a good hotel from the reviews on this site but I was amazed by the end of the trip. Check in was smooth, the valet were so helpful and nice each time we asked them for directions or needed help with our bags. We had a one bedroom room then upgraded to a two bedroom. The ocean view was amazing. We had the breakfast buffet the first morning at the restaurant on the beach. It was good except for the birds that walk all over and they don't really move when you shoo them away. Other that that it was okay. The rooms were spacious and clean and upgrading to the two bedroom was the easiest transition ever. We packed up all of our belongings and they had someone take our times to a locked room until our room was ready. EVEN our clothes on the hangers and our refrigerated items. All of our food was placed in a large tupperware container for the move. We hung out at the pool until they called us which wasn't too long. There's a gorgeous golf course nearby for those interested. I couldn't believe how nice the staff was. Everyone we encountered was sooo helpful and genuinely nice. It didn't matter if it was the front desk staff, the valet, the concierge, the pool attendants, or the waitresses everyone went above and beyond our requests. One thing that we would have like to see is more restaurants on site. Since our room was a fully stocked condo we made too many trips to the local target to load up on groceries. One place that guests should definitely shop at is the market ABC store located down the street from the hotel. It's in a little store area across from the Disney hotel with a bunch of restaurants. We found the groceries to be alot more economical than the hotel's marketplace and not as far as target (which isn't very far). The store also offered a hot bar and the food was really good. But it was great for a quick run to the store if you don't want to go to far. Some guests even walked to the market (not us). We found everything in there including my son's soy milk that he can't live without. They offer you a store credit depending on how much you spend so save your receipts. My mother used it to pick up a few souvenirs on the way to the airport. Now the pools.....The pools were the best part of the hotel. As most parents of small children know; the kids love the pool even though its not the safest place for them. That's not the case at this resort. This was the ONE place where my son could play on his own. One side of the pool had the beach feature so the water was extremely low, the younger kids could play as they wanted to. The pool had two fountain like spouts for the kids to step on and play with. The kids could sit on the sand, go in the pool or walk over the the playground and play (which my son did every other five minutes). There was a bar-like set up for towels, ice cream, toys and sunblock purchases. There was even a air hose for parents to use to blow up the endless water toys for the children. The hotel even set up a bin of water toys for children to play with. My son truly enjoy this pool. The nearest jacuzzi was a family jacuzzi so my son also enjoyed (it was extremely hot). It would have been good if the pools opened earlier than 7am. Coming from the mainland we were up at 4am with nothing to do for 3 hours. Entertainment........Make sure when you check in you get the resorts schedule of activities. They have so many things for children. They offer fish feeding , arts and crafts, exercise classes, and so much more. We purchased tickets to the Fia Fia show which was amazing. The food was good and the host of the show was sooooooo funny! It was a great way to spend the evening and well worth the price ($90 per adult $45 per child). It was great show and my son often asks to watch our video of it especially the fire throwing parts. If you plan on attending the Fia Fia show buy your tickets as soon as possible since its assigned seating. We did the hotel tour of Pearl Harbor and the downtown area which was really good also ($40 per person). The tour guide was very knowledgeable and knew the answer to every question asked. One thing to know that the concierge didn't tell us is if you sign up to do the pearl harbor tour PACK LIGHT. Since we had a small child I packed a baby bag with the usual. But you can't take anything with you that can't fit into your pockets into the Pearl Harbor exhibit. If you don't mind leaving it on the bus then its not a problem. But we were shocked when we realized that we had to leave our valuables on the bus. So if possible, leave that stuff in the safe in your room. We ended up taking with us the stroller, a camera, and a credit card and cash. That was it. It rained off and on the whole day so we ended up buy sweatshirts and plastic ponchos in the gift shop. But other than that it was great and its a must see if you go to Honolulu. Also make sure to check out the outlets if you like shopping and Waikiki Beach (do it in the day time its waaaay too packed at night). Make sure you have on comfortable shoes too because its a long strip to walk but its fun if you're shopping and stopping to eating. The Honolulu Zoo is on Wakiki beach also. There's a flea market that happens on Mondays and Wednesdays at the stadium, we found that to be the best place to pick up souvenirs and more (again wear comfortable shoes).

We had an efficiency for 3, my wife and I and our 17 year old son. It was about the size of a decent sized hotel room, king sized bed with pull out sleeper sofa, and had a very small balcony - two chairs and a little table. The kitchen area had a microwave, toaster, coffee maker ,sink, and some cups, saucers and silverware. No corkscrew for you wine drinkers. The one bedroom units had much more floor space and a larger balcony. We traded for the room through Interval International and as such were not charged for parking, which was a pleasant suprise. The paved beach walk connecting the lagoons is about 1.5 miles end to end, so you can get in a 3 mile jog going from one end to the other and back. The workout facility had some top norch cardio equipment, dumbells, and weight machines. The area for mat work (stretching, abs, etc.) was limited, but the facility was never that crowded so it was ok. The food prices were high at the casual restaurant -$15-18 for a sandwich and fries, over $6.50 for a beer and over $11 for tropical drinks. The steak place was a better value - most dinners were in the $26-$32 range but that included a soup and salad bar. The on-site grocery store was also pricey. However, within a mile, across from the entrance to the JW Marriott, there was a very good mexican restaurant Just Tacos, with dinners around $10-$15, 24 oz Dos Equis for $6.50 and frozen drinks for about $8. Also, across from Just Tacos is an ABC store (think UDF on steroids), with more reasonable prices on beer, wine and groceries. Of course you can go about 4 miles to Target - they have a food section and the prices weren't bad. You definitely need a car if you stay here - we used RentalCar.com and got a Malibu for 8 days for $210. Gas was $4.16/gallon.

First off, we happened to be here during the Tsunami. We were on the north shore when the sirens went off. The roads started getting jammed up so I called the front desk and was told to go where the locals were going. We did so, and spent the night in our car up in the hills. After the \"all clear\" we finally made it to the hotel, very tired and ready for a nap. When we explained our situation, the lady at the front desk showed no empathy and told me our room was cancelled since we didn't show up. I explained I had called the night before and was told to do what the locals did, which was go to higher ground for the night. She then told me she would have someone else make us a new reservation. This took at least 15 minutes. When the lady in the back came out, I asked if we were finally ready. She gave a snappy response and again showed little empathy for our situation. I understand they were probably tired as well from the previous night, but I was amazed at how little care they showed. We finally got into our room which was fine, but definitely false advertising. We signed up for an \"Ocean View\" room, but you can't see the ocean from our room. I called the front desk and they explained that \"Ocean View\" is a category and not that you can actually see the ocean from the room. She actually told me to go on my balcony and try to see around the rest of the building and that we might be able to see it. Amazing. I'm a very frequent Marriott guest, but I will never stay at this resort again. The resort itself is nice, but the service was terrible.

We were able to get a studio room (which is a very small room, enough to fit two people comfortably) I was originally fine with the studio because it was just my husband, myself and our 1 year old daughter. Well, then at the last minute, my mother in law came with us so as you can imagine the studio room quickly become crowded. I tried to call Marriott to see about an upgrade, but they said that there was nothing they could do since I booked the room through Interval. Fair enough. We arrived at Oahu at 10 PM at night due to our flight being delayed and the airline losing our luggage. They accidently put the luggage in a later flight. Fortunately, we were coming from Maui so it wasn't a huge wait to get to our luggage (just a big inconvenience). Anyway, when we got to the resort, the front desk staff was very friendly and helped us to get settled. The room was clean, however, I thought the colors were a little too dark for my taste, and I noticed that there were ants in the room. I found ants in the bathroom, bedroom area, and the kitchen sink area. (We had no food when we checked so I knew the ants weren't there because of food). Anyway, it did annoy me, but I just dealt with it because I didn't spend money on a trip to Hawaii just to spend my entire time in a hotel room. Another complaint, I had about the room was that I found it to be misty and humid. Now, onto the positives, the resort is very beautiful and well landscaped. I liked the lagoon area and pools. I thought all the staff members were wonderful and very helpful. I also liked the fact that the resort is a little out of the way and secluded - although, they are starting to build up around the Ko Olina area so I don't know how secluded this resort will be in the next 5-10 years. I will say that this is a large resort so the pool and lagoon area can get crowded depending on the time of day you go there. When I had a chance. I tried to go to the lagoon late in the afternoon so it was not so crowded. You will definitely need a rental car if you want to drive around the island. They also have a Fai Fai luau, which I thought was excellent and worth the price. This is definitely a family friendly, kid friendly resort so if you aren't vacationing with children, or if you do not like children or want to see children running around the property with the parents running after them, then you may want to consider going to another resort that caters to a more mature audience.

The room was very nice and up to what we are used to for Marriott Vacation Clubs. Comfortable beds, nice fixtures, a nice (but small) kitchen. Outside amenities are very nice. The elevators were a pleasant surprise. So many times reviews complain about having to wait too long to get one. We could usually get an elevator within a minute of pushing the button. It was nice to see the gas grills getting scrubbed every day, so you knew that they were clean. The kid\u2019s pool seemed very popular and busy. The adult pool was quiet. Neither pool was heated, so the water was quite cool but refreshing. There seemed to be plenty of seating around the pool and on the beach unless you waited till noon or after, which is late by most beach resort standards. There is a nice 3 mile beach walk along the front of the resorts along the various lagoons that ends down by the J. W. Marriot. Great for walking and jogging. While we were there they had severe downpours and flash floods. It caused a brown water alert and the ocean water was contaminated, so the lagoons were closed and guests were not allowed in the ocean for several days. Some people got upset, but I don\u2019t see how they thought this was Marriott\u2019s fault. We just walked up to the pool for a dip if we needed to cool off, but we were glad we took our photos of the beach and ocean before the water turned brown. It had been awhile since we were last in Honolulu. We were quite surprised by the traffic on the highways. Rush hour was a dead stop on H1, so plan accordingly if you are driving between Ko Olina and Honolulu or Waikee during those times. What is a quick 20-30 minute drive becomes an hour and a half. As other reviewers have stated, you trade the peace and tranquility you get from being away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki for the fact that you may have to face that traffic on the highway. You really should have a car if you stay here, as there is not much you can get to by foot. Which brings me to my final point. There is not enough parking at Ko Olina. Being a Marriott Owner, we opted for self parking which was free. However, on each of the 3 evenings that we came back to the property after 9 pm, we found a sign at the garage that said that the garage was full and we should use the valet. Two of those evenings we drove around and found a space available, not in the garage but on site. One night we did leave the car with the valet and paid for valet parking.

Suggestions: 1) There were a lot of great free activities. We loved feeding the fish in the lagoon in the morning, they had a great torch lighting ceremony with hula and fire dancers that was free, we also went on a great native plants walk with a very knowledgeable guide. 2) My husband and I did a surfing lesson through Surf Girls, at nearby Barber Point - which was A-mazing. 3) We highly recommend dinner at Roy's - the Golf Course's restaurant. Truly fantastic food. Beyond fantastic. Azul at the JW Hotel was also good. 4) If you're looking to save on dining, there are lots of grills on teh property. We did a big grocery shop at Target for dry goods (and the prices were totally comparable to what we would spend here in upstate NY) and the grocery store for meat/veggies/fruits. This saved us A LOT of money. 5) The Marketplace (little convenience store in the resort) sells a 24oz mug for $35 that gets free refills for the duration of your stay - soda and coffee. If you drink a lot of soda - this is a great bargain. We rather regretted purchasing the mug, as we could have just made coffee in our room for much cheaper, and drank water. 6) We also did the Ko Olina Ocean Adventure snorkelling - there had abeen a lot of rain the previous week/weekend, so the snorkelling was really disappointing - we didn't reef snorkel, but they did find a pod of dolphins for us to snorkel near and that was cool. But not worth $250. 7) Also took the $10 Ukelele lesson at the resort - which was also fantastic. I'd never played a string instrument before, and after an hour, was rocking Twinkle Twinkle and Wipe Out. 8) Ko Olina really isn't centrally located to touristy things - Pearl Harbor was the closest at 15 minutes away, Honalulu was about 20, and the North Shore about 75 minutes. But if you know and accept that going in, it isn't a problem. 9) We were travelling with another couple and their three month old baby.

We shared kitchen facilities, but also had our own microwave and mini-fridge, so that if we were up early, we could still make breakfast.

I am hoping that the review is helpful for fellow travellers as well as for the Marriott staff since there are some areas that need improvement. At our check in, we were told that our room was (1) an ocean view and (2) in the same building as the rest of our extended family. Neither was correct and no one fixed the issue during our stay. A \"sorry\" basket was delivered by the front desk but in no way made up for either error. Huge disappointment all around. We were told that our view was \"technically an ocean view but because we were on a low floor, we wouldn't be able to see it through the vegetation and trees\". This is what they actually told us! Needless to say, we asked for our bill to reflect a downgraded view. They didn't offer, we had to ask for it. There are three towers; Kona, Naia and Moana. The Kona tower is the main building and an ocean view looks directly towards the lagoon and ocean. I can not teill you the difference between a low floor and a high floor. The second tower, the Moana, where we stayed is angled and truly overlooks one end of a pool, bbq pit and the parking lot. We were on the 3rd floor and our ocean view had no view of the ocean. The 3rd tower is the Naia which I understand is the newest. Several trips in to that tower convinced me that it was the nicest. That tower is angled over a pool, the lagoon and the ocean. Other family members had low floors (3rd and 4th) and each had an incredible view. Our villa in the Moana was beautiful and spacious. The other tower had similiar decor and layouts. I think that the design (layout) was perfect and allowed privacy for large families staying together (Lots of doors!) Loved them. Housekeeping is exactly as described by others: dishes put away, towels changed and bed linens were not changed over the 10 days (not sure why) but bed was made and garbage was taken away. Our unit also came with washing machine and dryer. Pools: Several posters mention an adult pool but there wasn't one. One of the 3 pools is a \"Reflection\" pool and it was supposed to be quiet. Kids are allowed but horseplay and games were discouraged. As a result, there were not many kids at that pool. The lagoon pool has the volleyball net and basketball board so that had a ton of kids. The 3rd pool at the Naia had waterfalls, hidden coves etc and was probably the prettiest. It also had a bar. IMPORTANT NOTE to MARRIOTT STAFF: We noticed lots of dead snails, slugs and worms in 2 pools. When we pointed this out to pool personnel, they told us that it always happens after heavy rainfalls. Well if you know that, then you should be vacuuming the pool floor after heavy rainfalls. It was really gross! Inspect your pools each morning! Restaurants: There are only 2: Chucks Steakhouse which was so-so and had an unimaginative menu. Since they aren't affiliated with the Marriott, they actually compete for Happy Hour and their prices are better. Host stand needs more training. The guy with the \"System\" was rude and unprofessional. The other hostess knew it and tried to curb/correct him several times. Painful experiences for many people on the 3 nights we went there (2 against our will). The beachfront restaurant, Kolohe's had really great sandwiches and salads. It's a bit pricey for sandwiches ($15-18) but the convenience, view, taste and staff made it all ok. The Mai-tais are better here than at Chuck's but the Happy Hour price is $3.50 more than Chucks. Thought the staff there did a wonderful job. Target, Safeway and Costco are about 10 minutes away. Use the map the staff provides not your GPS because one of ramps is closed for construction. GPS also had us go on the highway from one place to the other and the route should have been local streets. The on-site grocery was limited and expensive. If you need a quick grocery, there is an ABC store over by the golf course and that had a better deli, fruit, wine and dry goods selection of items. Sightseeing: The best traveler guide we had for the west and north shore was \"Oahu Revealed\" which we purchased on the Amazon website. It was more locally oriented than Frommers and Fodors. We had an amazing time on the north shore. We visited the Triple Crown beaches, Haleiwa and the famous shrimp shacks in Kahuku (Fusi and Romy's). We also drove through the Turtle Bay resort and checked it out for future vacations. On the east side, Kailua Beach was amazing and would definitely recommend it for families of all ages, sun and shade and calm waves. We had lunch at a friendly and charming place, Kalapawai Cafe. Ready made sandwiches and salads, along with other entrees made it quick and refreshing after a day in the sun. Waikiki: If you already live in a big city, skip it. It's crowded and crazy. One thing we learned: If it's raining in Ko Olina, it may not be raining on the other side of the island. Don't let the weather stop you.

Turned in Gold 5 star 1 bdrm time share condo , got the bum's rush from Marriott and Interval International. Requested 1bdrm or studio.

The unit we traded was gorgeous, hot tub in room, full kitchen, all amenities, view. This one had a balcony that was unusable - tiny, no room for ,table/chair, bird poop, view of parking lot. Had to park 1/4 mile away. The facilities were at best adequate. Most pools very shallow, full of kids. One okay 30' pool for 1000 rooms with double rows of lounge chairs crammed around it, like Jones Beach in July. Very very uncooperative front desk. Just didn't care. Marriott is in this for the money, and this place doesn't give value. Because it was a hotel room, we had to eat out every meal. The on-site restaurants were very expensive, and the only other options were to drive to four other huge comparable expensive Marriott hotels on the same huge site. This side of the island of Oahu has not been developed, and this Marriott complex is all there is. Terrible poverty if you drive north on the west coast of Oahu - people living in cars, camping in beach shelters. Unbelievable that the USA is allowing these conditions to exist. Nothing to do outside the Marriott without a real expedition to Honolulu which involves a lot of time and traffic. Very aggressive hard sell on buying time share. Took advantage of people we met who were unfamiliar with time shares. This is a scam to get primarily renters, some Interval people to Hawaii, merely to run them through the sales scam mill. Honolulu is well worth visiting to see the World War II sites. The USS Arizona Memorial is so moving, on the water at the site of the ship, like a chapel. Don't miss it. We drove to the North shore of Oahu and saw the waves that form the surfers Pipeline where the international surfing competitions are held. 30' waves, extraordinary. You really need a car to enjoy your visit. Aside from Pearl Harbor related excursions, the very best part of this trip was our day trip to the Polynesian Cultural Center. It has villages representing 8 Polynesian cultures, and really gets you into the culture of those islands hundreds of years ago. Fascinating, and well worth one or more days. Each tribe showed off its own dances, from the laid back Hawaiian hula, suited to an island with no neighbors for hundreds of miles, to the fierce war dances that got island warriors ready to hunt their enemies on adjacent islands. The evening program with dances, fire throwing and all is an event we'll never forget. The eastern coast of Oahu, especially the southern portion, seems to be where \"real people\" live on Oahu. Lots of real little towns, beautiful coast, great restaurants, even bookstores! I'd stay there if I went to Oahu again, but all in all, we saw the Pearl Harbor sites, and would prefer the other islands. Honolulu is very built up, expensive NYC type brand stores, crowded beaches, probably lots of night life. We also visited the island of Kauai and fell in love with it. It's gorgeous, much less settled, quiet, with the most extraordinary foliage, shore line and cliffs. Great snorkeling and fabulous restaurants. The helicopter trip is breath-taking. We'd go back there in a minute, and very happy to have purchased a Shell Vacation Club property there.

This is our second time staying here, both times we stayed for six nights. The first and last are just travel days, so we basically had five full days of play. We have been tagalongs with extended family who own a Marriott timeshare. Both times, they had ease of exchanging their 2 bedroom/2 bath Marriott in California with this one in Hawaii. Hawaii is such a easy jaunt over from California, why wouldn't you vacation there? November turned out to be a great time to travel. They said it was 90 percent full, but it was really not crowded at all. Last time, we went in January and it felt equally sparse. This time, for some unknown reason, they upgraded us to a 3 bedroom/3 bath unit. It was heaven. This place was like a little mansion. We only slept six but we could have slept 10-12 people comfortably. (Three young families would have been perfect!). On the property, the Fia Fia \"fire show\"/ luau was really well done. We saw the Paradise Cove one last year. And while the paradise cove had more activities, the food and the overall show was better on the Marriott property. We had small kids and love their kids activities. We especially recommend the Kamiya race cars for the boys and the luau for the girls. The raft race is fun too. It's so easy to just hope out of your hotel room and go snorkeling too. Lots of fish and turtles if you just swim by the rocks. The kids just enjoy playing in the sand and swimming. But it is a little cold in November-January, so we enjoyed the spa too. The bummer is that you pretty much have to drive everywhere if you want to take a day trip, but going to the north shore, Dole Plantation, and Pearl harbor were all doable. We steered clear of Waikiki this time because it felt like such a long drive. But on the flip hand, you are away from all the touristy spots and it feels like you have the island to yourself. Don't pack much....washing machines are in every room. And if you forget something, there is always costco, target, and safeway in the next exit at Kapolei. We bought our own food and just cooked to keep cost low. Of course, if you want high end shopping, you will have to go to Waikiki. I don't think this will be the last time we go to this resort.

Apparently, if you are a renter, the higher floors such as 8 and above (which have the best views) are reserved for Marriott Time Share owners. Parking is pricey at $30 per night but is apparently free if you are a Marriott Time Share owner. The room did have one major design flaw. The a/c unit (a/c handler) is located in the bedroom, so it was a bit noisy in the bedroom (so that was a bit of an impediment to sleeping well.) The lagoons are fabulous, like something out of a movie. Be forewarned that a massive Disney resort is being built nearby, which will soon bring swarms of people and which could upset this peaceful balance.

I'd gotten a very good nightly rate directly from Marriott's website and was treated like a regular hotel guest--daily maid service, no timeshare presentation, etc. I'd been a bit confused about this beforehand. I had a one-bedroom villa (even though it was just for me), with a nice, modern full kitchen--granite countertops, modern lighting, full-size stove and frig., microwave--with appropriate dishes and cookware (although it's good to know that there will be only one day's coffee provided--with only two little packets of sugar, and none of the basics of cooking, like salt. So stock up before you get here if you plan to have coffee or any meals. I stopped at the Safeway in Kapolei, right on the way to Ko Olina from the airport). The villa (more like a large one-bedroom apartment) was huge and very clean, although the design was a bit odd, and made getting to the bedroom a rather long walk through either the two bathrooms or through the living room and then an odd and rather useless small sunroom (or was it a very small den or a very small extra \"bedroom\" since the small loveseat might have folded out? I couldn't tell). The living room had a nice, new, large flat-screen TV, a comfortable couch to watch it from, and a couple of large sitting chairs. The dining area was part of the living room, and had a full-size dining table with 4 (or was it 6?) pretty comfortable upholstered chairs. There was a nice view of the resort when you were seated at the table or on the couch.The furniture was typical Hawaiian \"tropical style\" although a bit big, bulky, and dated. But everything seemed very clean and was generally comfortable. There was a very good size lanai, well designed to maximize privacy and with a small table and chairs as well as a lounger. I'd asked for an ocean view and would have liked to have been a couple of floors higher (I was on the 6th floor) to really be able to see the view over the balcony railings and the palm treetops. But if I stood up on the lanai, I had a wonderful and mostly unobstructed view of the resort and the lagoons/ocean, and I saw a couple of wonderful sunsets. The lanai had a glass partition up to about 2 feet high, so would be safe for children. The bed was pretty comfortable, although perhaps just a bit too firm for my taste; a softer pillowtop would have been nice. The bedding was good quality and there were plenty of pillows (regular and European square ones). There was an older but good-size tube TV in the bedroom, although perhaps they'll be replacing it with another flatscreen. I liked the fact that by closing the sliding wooden doors in the bedroom and the wooden blinds in the connecting \"sunroom\" you could get the bedroom really dark for sleeping. The hotel was quiet at night, so again good for sleeping. The a/c in the villa worked well, although it was a little noisy in the bedroom, so I kept turning it off and on during the night (so that was a bit of an impediment to sleeping well). The bathroom was really two bathrooms: one with a vanity and a nice walk-in shower and one with another vanity and a deep soaking tub. Being a shower person, I never used the tub (and wasn't sure how easy it would be for someone like me with bad knees to get in and out of it without any grab bars). There were wooden panels between the tub and the bedroom--for romance, I guess. This set-up with two sinks and vanities would be ideal for a couple or family. The shower head was old and apparently clogged, so sprayed a bit unevenly, but apart from that and a bit of water overflow from the glass shower door, the bathroom was very functional and very clean. The towels weren't the softest, but were very clean, in good shape, and reasonably large, and there were plenty of them If you have any mobility issues, be aware that this resort is quite spread out. There are three towers now (and another one is pending, I think), so if your room/villa is not in the main tower (and mine wasn't), keep in mind that everything else is (restaurant, sundry store, computers, check-in desk, etc.). From my tower, it was actually a bit of a hike to the lagoons, which are past the pools. I never made it to the third of the 3 pools since it was the farthest away from my tower. The pool area, though, is very nice, with an adult pool and another pool catering more to children and families. There were also at least two hot tubs. There's a nice sandy beach by the nearest lagoon (the only one I tried), and beach chairs/loungers available. Although I'd thought that one could snorkel in at least some of the 4 lagoons there, the concierge said they'd really be too murky for snorkeling, so I didn't try. You borrow beach towels from a counter in the pool area and must return them before you leave (and they do have some snorkel equipment to rent). You can replace the towels whenever they get wet or dirty. You can also find some shaded sitting areas by the pools, too, if the Hawaiian sun and heat start to get to you. The parking is pricey (about $30/day), although there seems to be plenty of it. Everything at the resort is pretty expensive. If you didn't bring a computer and therefore can't use the free wifi, it's 29 cents/minute to use the computers in the main tower's small business center. The Marketplace shop (for sundries, some food, and some tourist items) is over-priced, but I was glad to discover that a new ABC store (with a nice deli in it) had recently opened in the Ko Olina Station, a very short drive (or a long walk) from the hotel. There were a few small restaurants in this little strip mall, too, which I didn't try. The hotel's main restaurant is a steakhouse that seemed expensive (and didn't appeal to me as a non-meat-eater, although it says \"Steak and Seafood\") and then a more casual open-air bar and grill near the lagoons. They did offer free music one evening at the bar, but I didn't partake. One thing to keep in mind here as in many other parts of Hawaii--most things (including the lobby) are open-air, so if you want to escape the heat and humidity, you're almost out of luck (except in your nicely air-conditioned room or villa). My research had suggested that the food might be better at the JW Marriott Ihilani (a short drive or long walk away from the Beach Club), so I went there one day for lunch at the Naupaka Terrace (with a 10% discount courtesy of the Aloha Desk at the Beach Club--worth a visit for coupons and a free tote). It, too, is open-air, but the food was pretty good and not badly priced for Hawaii. I also went to Roy's (part of the famous chain of Roy's) at the Ko Olina golf club near the hotel for lunch, and the food there was excellent. Roy's has a nice view of a lagoon or small lake with black swans in it, which I enjoyed watching. I'd recommend trying Roy's, although dinner prices are much higher than lunch. All in all, I'd highly recommend the Marriott Ko Olina if you're looking for a relaxing getaway for a few days or a week or more, especially if you have a family, but even if you don't but value peace, quiet, spacious accommodations, and great views. I'm not sure how often one can get good nightly rates--especially if you want to stay less than a week--but I felt like it was well worth it. I was going to Honolulu for a conference right afterward, and really missed Ko Olina once I got into the Honolulu noise, crowds, and traffic. It was only about a 30-40 minute drive from the airport to Ko Olina, and although the north shore might be more lush (since Ko Olina is on the dry leeward side of Oahu), the resort is beautifully landscaped and relaxing, and the lagoons are really nice for safe swimming. The staff at the resort are very nice, too, and seem to have the Aloha spirit, too.

Although I requested a high floor room with a view of the ocean, we got a first floor room with a view of the bushes which was facing the ocean. Not bad though considering we got an awesome deal by joining Marriott Rewards. Location was just perfect, far from Waikiki and Honolulu and all the crowds. At most, there were maybe 50 people at a time on any beach lagoon. No fighting for beach chairs. The beds were so comfy, I actually slept every night. And I can never sleep in hotels. No problems here. The housekeeper came in while we were at the beach, and when we came back to the room, she actually put the dirty dishes in the dishwasher for us and ran the washer. Really, now that's service! I loved being able to do the laundry every day. I popped a load in before going to bed every night. (They even provide detergent). Made packing and unpacking when we got back home so easy. I wish all hotels had this. The man made lagoons were perfect to spend an afternoon at or to watch the gorgeous sunset. We saw large sea turtles and one even came up on shore. Very cute! We ate at Chuck's Steakhouse once, which was decent but way overpriced. The mai tai there was terrific and only 4 bucks!

We saved a lot of money by making our own breakfast and lunch every day with groceries from Safeway and then eating dinner in town at night. The ABC Store across from Aulani (Disney) is the best place to shop for souvenirs or quick food items. We got an angus steak and some salads from there, and for $15 we had dinner! Oh, and the resort has BBQ grills you can use if you'd like to grill. The Ko Olina staff was amazingly friendly and helpful, which is so refreshing coming from Northeast USA where people can be rude most of the time. We went to the Paradise Cove Luau down the street and it was unbelievable. The hotel concierge can book the tickets for you. A quick 10 minute walk takes you to Ko Olina Ocean Adventures where you can book a cruise to snorkel with fish, turtles, and swim with dolphins. They include a lunch afterwards which is nice. I recommend NOT picking up the Aloha Package at the front desk however. This is a timeshare and they will try to sell you. We didn't pick it up, and they called us 3 times to remind us. Just don't pick up the package and you will save yourself a 45 minute timeshare pitch, unless you want that. All in all, we will be back. Great location, great employees, great service.

This is the 3rd Marriott Vacation Club we have stayed at-they have all been great. We traded in our Myrtle Beach location so we were hoping for oceanview but not expecting it-we didn't get oceanview but they did give us a marina/golf course view so it was OK. We had a 1 bedroom which was spacoius and beautiful. The pools are all very nice-lots of hot tubs. It wasn't too crowded the week we were there which was nice as you could always get chairs at the beach or pool with no problem. We had two good dinners at Chuck's and it is so nice to sit outside and watch the sun set. It's a little pricy but there are not alot of options. We had lunch one day at Kolohe's which was good but at $16 for tuna melts we thought very pricey-nice setting though on the edge of the beach. We did do as others recommended and drove to Target-10 min away and picked up a few groceries/beverages for the room-this saves alot even just getting breakfast items/snacks. That same exit also has a few restaurant options-we at a a great Italian restaurant-Assaggio's, Outback, and for breakfast at Zippy's. ABC store at Marketplace on same street as resort is also a good place to pick up groceries/souveniers. A car is definitely needed as there is not too much right in the area-Hotwire has great prices-we got a full size car for $15.95/day. We thoroughly enjoyed the onsite luau-Fia Fia which is held on Tuesday night-make your reservation ahead of time as your table is assigned based on when you book-we were right up front at the table front and center-perfect view!! We also loved the Sunset Cruise on the Ko Olina Cat-the crew was great and we had a blast!! They picked up right at the resort. Great pictures from both!!! We did do some sightseeing as it was our 1st trip to Hawaii-we climbed Diamond Head-not easy but breathtaking views!!! We did the whole Pearl Harbor complex-Arizona-Missouri-Bow Fin. Plan for several hours if you want to do it all-we were there for 5 hrs. If you go on Wed/Sat/Sun-there is a Flea Market of sorts at Aloha stadium-all kinds of souveniers (all new stuff) and it's right near Pearl Harbor. We went over to Waikiki-had to see it!! Glad we were staying 45 min away in the quiet Ko Olina-it's a zoo there, but something to see. Eat at Duke's-great lunch buffet and right on the beach!! Dole Plantation was OK-a bit overrated. Enjoy your stay-we tried to balance sightseeing with enjoying all the amenities of the resort.", "Date": "October 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bremerton, Washington", "Title": "\u201cA terrific home away from home\u201d", "Author": "DelS_10", "ReviewID": "UR84700879", "Content": "I had the pleasure of staying at the Ko Olina Beach Club while on business travel from August 28th until September 23rd. My room was a kitchenette with King size bed and golf course view on the third floor. Self parking was available on the 1st and 2nd floor and was $30 per day (same as valet parking). My room had a coffee maker, microwave, toaster, small refrigerator and dishes for 2. Complimentary laundry rooms were located on floors 4,7,10, and 14. The resort covers a lot of space with 3 pools in one area and another pool area more suited for childen with a water slide. The bed was very comfortable and easy to get used to. The only negative thing that I noticed was a lack of ventilation (A/C) in the bathroom. The restaurant on the beach (Kalohe's) was a good place for the breakfast buffet (rice, eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes, pastries, fruit, yogurt, cereal, bagels, juice and coffee) and begin the day looking out at the lagoon or to have a sandwich later in the day and especially catch the sunset. Newspapers are available but you have to be nuts to want to read one when surrounded by the beauty of the resort. It is a time share property but I was never hassled by any of the sales people and treated pleasantly by all of the staff people that I came across. The lagoon is a very nice place to get into the salt water and then rinse off for the pools (the quiet pool was my favorite). There are also several spa's around the pool area including one with a water view at the property edge by the restaurant. I traveled around Oahu quite a bit and after the busyness of Honolulu and Waikiki, I was glad to return to Ko Olina (20 minute drive). There is a nice shopping area between exit 1 and 2 on H1 that has a Safeway, Longs Drug, Target, K-Mart, Costco, gas stations and quite a few restaurants. Target has the best prices for food and Costco is the best for macadamia nuts. There are activities available both at the resort and around the island for a fee. On Tuesday there is a Luau type of show called \"Fia, FIa\" and there is music at Kalohe's on Sunday and several other evenings. A snorkeling cruise is available on the Kai 'Oli 'Oli at the Ko Olina marina which was great fun watching the spinner dolphins and snorkeling with the turtles. My wife was able to join me for the last week and she enjoyed relaxing by the pool, exploring the property, and checking out the artists by the gift shop.

There was absolutely no foliage in front of the lanai to create some sense of privacy.

Everyone was just being friendly, but it wasn't very relaxing. This room also shares a wall with a utility room of some kind and there was an annoying persistent hum heard through the wall in the bathroom. Speaking of the bathroom, if the vent looking thing on the ceiling was a fan, it didn't run. There was a large dead cockroach on our lanai all week. Although housekeeping straightened up the tiny table and two chairs out there, they didn't remove the dead bug. There were stains on the curtains and the chair in the room was very banged up. The pool towels were a disgrace, threadbare and holey! If you can help it, avoid the on site restaurants. They are crazy expensive and nothing special. The good points: Then landscaping is beautiful. The grills outside are a nice touch. The staff was very friendly and helpful when we had questions about the area. The lagoons are wonderful. If you stay in the Ko Olina Resort, plan on having a car and doing some grocery shopping and cooking or eat at the many restaurants outside of the resort a few miles away.

Upon arrival, we were not too impressed. We had the hardest time of our life trying to find the right building as there were no signs, when we did finally get into the main lobby, we stood in a 20 minute long line and then spoke with the receptionist to get checked in. The receptionist was very nice. We arrived at 2:30pm to ask about an early check in but they said our room wasnt ready yet, so we came back at 4pm. My mother in law requested us an ocean view in the main tower on one of the top floors. We ended up in the furthest tower away from the ocean and a partial view of the ocean. The room itself was small, but okay. We had a studio room (smallest available), and we had a hard time moving around in it comfortably. The view was pretty good. The room was a little dusty and the maids left the toilet seat up (a pet peeve of my husband) before they left, not the best presentation. There was only 35 channels on the television, not much to choose from. The room was for the most part up to date and modern. The pools were pretty nice, not too many kids and not too much screaming. We went to the beach during the earlier morning hours and there was always lots of space to swim and have fun in the sand. It would have been nice to have that option to swim out further into the surf or have more waves, but they contructed lagoons to prevent waves. The shaved ice was very yummy. We did eat at Koholes Bar and Grill, STAY AWAY! Total rubbish food and expensive! Rent a car if you plan on visiting the tourist areas out of Ko Olina. They told us the traffic was terrible in Honolulu, but we are from Seattle and laughed at their interpretation of \"bad traffic\". All in all, the hotel is probobly one of th nicest on Oahu (most hotels are icky in Waikiki) and its definitley seculded so you wont be near the crowds. The area surronding the Ko Olina is suprising, it was very dead and there was lots of graffiti around, being from Seattle we would say it looks alot like Eastern Washington. Parking can be really hard to find if you are not back at your hotel by 7pm. Most of the time we found a spot somewhere (really tight spaces for even the Camry we rented). But otherwise, if they are totally out of spots you are forced to valet park. I would HIGHLY recomend getting a room with a kitchen, eating out is hard in that area. Plus most of the resturnats arent very good or expensive. Oh and stay away from their \"welcome\" speach they offfer you when you first arrive, its on the second floor and they will pressure you into buying a time share after they have offered all these good coupons. Overall, we probobly will go back as our parents own atimeshare which they are stuck with, so free lodging for us.

These shouldn't be a surprise to anyone anymore - just resolve to rent a car and enjoy being away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. Being that its a Marriott timeshare, its run much more like a traditional hotel than a typical timeshare. That being said, this is a beautiful property. The room was tastefully decorated, the grounds of the resort were beautiful, the pools and beaches were wonderful. Would I stay here again, probably, but I'm not completely sold. Here's what you need to know, for being such a high end property, the walls are paper thin. When the telephone in the next room would ring, I could easily hear the entire conversation of my neighbor. Considering my wife and I were here for a romantic week away from the kids, I can imagine what my neighbors heard emanating from my room. Marriot and the developer cut a significant corner here in failing to adequately sound proof the rooms, and it did detract from our experience. Can you get over that-sure-you're in Hawaii and not likely to ever see your neighbor again as long as you live, so we decided who cares? Only other drawback was the food. There is a decent beach bar at the Ko Olina to get drinks and munchies, but do not, under any circumstances, eat at a full meal at this beach bar, or at the supposedly \"upscale\" Chuck's, also on property. Here is where the isolation of the resort can sometimes be an issue. As East Coasters, we tend to eat much later than Hawaiins, where restaurants typically stop serving dinner around 8:30 p.m. So on two nights, we sort of got stuck eating at the resort. Truly-the food at both of these restaurants is virtually inedible. The salad bar at Chucks was swarming with fruit flies, the steak was a congealed hunk of meat. At least they didn't screw up the Johnnie Walker, but hey, that's just ice and a glass. To top it all off, the meal at Chucks was about $125 for two people. I wouldn't have paid $20 for it. The beach bar (I believe its called Kolohe's) isn't much better, but at least the prices are significantly less. If you are stuck on or near the resort for meals, walk the 1/4 mile down the beach to the J.W. Marriott Ihilani Resort, were the restaurants are all either 4 or 5 star. Quite frankly, we are foodies and the best meal we ate in Hawaii was at the JW's 5 star rated Azule. The staff are mostly friendly and eager to assist. There was a mistake in cleaning our room (since its a timeshare you don't get a full \"cleaning\" service like a traditional hotel-but can request one for a small fee). We requested that our room be cleaned several times, rather than merely \"tidied.\" On one occassion, not only was it not cleaned, but not even tidied. When we informed the staff they immediately ensured that our room would be thoroughly cleaned the next day, and waived all charges for the extra cleaning. In short, if you want the Waikiki experience, don't want to invest the $$$ on a rental car for a week and can't deal with Honolulu's rush hour traffic on the occassions you might want to venture to Honolulu/Waikiki-then the Ko Olina is not for you. If you want a quieter \"off-isalnd\" experience, without actually going to Maui or Hawaii, then the Ko Olina may fit the bill. One more caveat, right now the four beach \"lagoons\" are very quiet, serene and uncrowded, but, as has been noted by others, Disney is currently constructing a resort right next to the Ko Olina. Let me tell you, its going to be enormous, and given that its a Disney property, probably teeming with children.

Rent a Car - That way you can travel the island, not many (if any) activity shuttles get out to the Ko Olina. Parking is expensive but cheaper than taxis or the sedan service. Most of the resort activites are family orientated. 2. Don't eat at the resort - The food was average at best, there is a place called \"Just Tacos\" on the Ko Olina property (easy walking distance) that is the best best best Mexican food in the area and reasonably priced as well. Or buy your own food and bring it in, we were still able to make many meals without a stove in our unit. BBQ's are ample on the grounds. 3. If you're looking for some adventure, the Stand Up Paddle adventure at the Ko Olina Marina is great. Highly recommend. 4. Go to the resort Luau \"Fia Fia\". It is the best show on the island. The food and entertainmetn was great. 5. Don't shop at the Marketplace on the grounds, there is an ABC type store near Just Tacos, go there for your basics and some gift shop stuff.

Twice as a regular customer and this time as an every other year \"mountain view\" owner. My room is in the new building (Hale Nai'i) which has a slightly different configuration than the previous rooms we had. They expanded the bedroom by getting rid of the separate lounging area and turning it into a \"work area\". The cabinets over the refrigerator are gone leaving little room to store groceries. Changed out the TV's and cabinety but the furniture is too far away from the screen. No screen door on patio window out to the lanai. I liked the old rooms better. Our mountan view is really a view of the marina. The problem is that there is an industrial park and refining plant behind it! Asked to be moved but was told there's limited availability (in my category of room). Told we could check back tomorrow but would have to check out at 10 am and check back in at 4:00 pm. Yep, that sounds like fun..carting clothes and food and stuff across the parking lot. Not doable..... When asked why we were assigned this room, I was told I didn't book early enough in the year (April for a Oct vacation) and that they came as close as they could to meeting my criteria. Silly me, I guess I should have specified that I didn't want a view of the industrial park........ They want you to be happy but really don't seem to have much flexibility to accommodate their owners. I was assigned a better room when visiting as a prospective client versus what they gave me as an owner.

We were given the week by my father for our honeymoon. He is an Interval International member and we got pretty lucky to book here since these rooms don't come up for exchange very often. We had \"studio\" lock-off which was pretty standard. A nice marble bathroom, standard size tub, wet bar with small fridge and microwave. The \"lanai\" was very underwhelming. It was small with a view of the tops of palm trees. We were on the 4th floor and maybe had we been lower we could've seen the pool or higher the ocean, but oh well. You only get a mid-week \"tidy\" service. Makes you realize how nice it is to come back to a fresh room on vacation each day, but again, not a big deal. What makes this property special are the grounds. Huge pools, large jacuzzis and breathtaking beaches. Clear blue water in the lagoons which is calm as can be. On the beach there are a lot of lounge chairs and cabana rentals available ($20 for 4 hours). Most of the people were young families or older (>50) couples. Children not overwhelming (probably the time of the year) and plenty of room to find activity or to avoid it. They have a great beach bar and restaurant called Kohele that has the absolute best views of the sunset. Good convenience store but you absolutely have to go to the Safeway (get a savings card or use your \"Dominicks\" card if you have one) and stock up for the week. Get chicken for the grills, cereal for the morning and save yourself a lot of money which will make you feel better about actually spending the $200 for 2 people on dinner a couple of nights. Speaking of...go to Roy's on the golf course (get the creamy tomato soup).....skip Azul at the JW Marriott. Disney is building a mammoth property next door but the main construction is up and not distracting at all, in my opinion. Waikiki is about 30 min away but over an hour in traffic. Traffic really is as bad as they say. Try to plan excursions to avoid the major rush hours. Definitely hike Diamond Head, you can go up and back in about an hour and the views are out of this world. Try surfing at Waikiki, amazing experience. Giovanni's Shrimp Truck (Shrimp Scampi for sure) on the North Shore for lunch is a must!!! Ted's Bakery on your way back for a cheap dinner and pie. Bottom line...very nice hotel, but a hike to get anywhere.

We own a time share here and this was our third time back. This time we split up the time share. For one week we stayed in the \"Lock Off\" section - like a regular hotel room with some added amenities of a small refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker and wet bar area. We bought some groceries and made dinner several times using the outdoor grills available on the grounds. We enjoyed the small but nice balcony area for reading, having morning coffee and relaxing. This room w/bath was nice, well appointed although there could be better lighting but it wasn't really a problem. The second week we moved into the other side - a suite. We had a separate bedroom with a king size bed, a huge bath with shower, two separate sink areas and a large soaking tub. There was a full kitchen complete with dishwasher, stove, refrigerator, completely furnished with dishes, cookware, knives, etc. and a washer/dryer. There was a large dining area and livingroom with a TV (so my husband could watch the game!). A larger Lanai with a wonderful marina and ocean view. Simply fabulous. Our only complaints were the on-site restaurant (Chuck's) and the adjacent store - all on the first level. The restaurant was expensive, the sides offered (we tried an island sweet potato) which was waxy and not very tasty. My steak, a good size sirloin, was tough and not that great. The price, however, was pretty high. Service was good but, again, overpriced for what you get - we didn't go back after the first time and probably won't again on our next visit. The \"convenience\" store next to the restaurant offers a bit of everything at highly inflated prices. Of course, they have a captive audience but if you have a car, go over to the nearby ABC store and get what you need at a much lower price. As a time share owner here, I'm very satisfied with this resort. I love Marriott Hotels and their other properties and I always can count on them for good service and quality. My only complaint is in the \"value\" department - the value for the rooms is fabulous but that rating is for the other things on property only otherwise it would be a 5! The free parking is for owners - not sure what the fee is for those who are using this resort like a hotel. A complaint is that the high speed internet in the rooms did not work properly at all the first week and only after constant adjusting and getting hotel staff to come to the room and work on the system several times the second week. Fitness center is not free but there are enough swimming pools and lagoons and walking/running trails that you don't need to pay for this.

The pictures on Marriott's website don't do it justice. There were actually 3 different pools. One had waterfalls, one was shaped like a seashell, and the other had water volleyball, etc. in it. There were also 7 jacuzzis, some of which had waterfalls as well. There was a waterslide in one section. We had our own private lagoon right off the ocean and the JW Marriott was just a few minutes away and we were allowed access to their lagoon as well including fish feeding in the morning. There are grills located throughout the property so you can cook. My friend and I purchased all of our food at a place like Sam's and didn't eat at a restaurant the entire 5 days. We ate, fish, steak, shark, chicken, and sausage all week. Our 1 bedroom villa had a full kitchen, dining room, living room, balcony, lanai, and two bathrooms. It also had a washer and dryer. The concierge was the bubbliest, nicest lady I have ever met! The hotel offers lots of packages. We went on a snorkeling/dolphin excursion on a catamaran which runs out of their harbor. We swam with sea turtles, fish, and then road on the cat while about 90 spinner dolphins jumped around us. Because the hotel isn't located in Honolulu, it is peaceful and quiet. I like this over the bustling touristy area near Waikiki. We also went up on the North Shore and swam and even went on a shark cage dive. Our favorite day was the last day. We snorkeled at Hanauma Bay on the Southeastern side and then went to the Paradise Cove luau. Fantastic! It would be a great hotel for families as well as there is a lot for children to do.

I think the reviews are all over the place here because they have lost focus on what the property is--a time share. It happens that it is a Marriott, and my opinion is that it meets or exceeds the Marriott standard one would expect. If you are a young family, you will not find any place better. The resort is spotlessly clean and the gentle lagoons and pool complex are ideal. Anything greater than the studio lock-off room gives you a full kitchen, dining room, washer/dryer, dishwasher and so-on. Shopping and off-property restaurants are 10 minutes away. You do need a car. Period. I understand that any visitor wants to get full disclosure before they make plans, but if you are a honeymoon couple or a visitor who doesn't have chidren, why would you go to a time share in high summer season? That doesn't make sense to me when there are proper hotels all over the islands, including the JW Ihilani just steps away? Regarding views from the room: we have been in the Moana tower twice, and the non-ocean views are not spectacular. OK. So go to the pool/lagoon beach/Na'ia bar/Kohole's restaurant, any day and watch the gorgeous sunset. We have always found the service to be professional and helpful when needed. Because we had a time share week, resort service is not proactive and in your face every minute. That's the nature of a time share. I have not been to the resort off season or shoulder season. I would imagine that if you don't have or don't want kids around, that would be a better time to go. But I don't understand going to a time share in Hawaii in high summer and complaining about kids or some of the flaming comments about service. I'm not disputing that their daily rates are premium and that you are entitled to expect a high-level experience.

My first room was on the 4th floor and 75% of the view out my slider was parking lot, cars and 4 lanes of highway. The top 25% of the window was three palm trees.

Although the reviewer before me has nothing but bad things to say, I think that maybe they were expecting some deserted island in the Pacific maybe?? Any ways, we live on Oahu and this was a little \"staycation\" for us, as it was a 3 day weekend. We got the 1 bedroom Ocean view villa in the Moana Tower. It was nice and had a lot of great amenities. The room itself was HUGE! Loved the fact that there was a FULL kitchen, separate bedroom and shower and tub for bathing. We never ate at any of the hotel restaurants b/c we figured we'd might as well enjoy a good meal in our room seeing as we had a kitchen. Target, Costco, Safeway and many other stores nearby made it easy to get groceries and then come back and cook. We saved a lot of $$ this way, plus we were never disappointed about any meals! The only thing I really didn't care for about this hotel was the fact that they charge you $30 for parking and Ocean View consists of 3rd floor and up. Whether you valet or self park it was the same price, and the \"ocean view villa\" was anything 3rd flooor and up. LOL- all I could see was a tiny speck of ocean, but oh well! In my opinion, the parking's a little steep and the view guidelines vague-but hey, it's Hawai'i! It is a little crowded, the pools especially, however, you would get this anywhere in Hawai'i during the summer and it would be WAY worse in Waikiki! We preferred to swim in the lagoon any way, pool water kind of grosses me out any where I go! They had a movie night on the great lawn with popcorn for the family, which was a nice idea. They had fish feedings, and many other things to do for out of towners. My suggestion would be that if you prefer to go where the action is, stay away from here.

They kept on calling to offer a smaller unit or different location but we stayed firm on our decision to get this hotel and boy are we happy!", "Date": "July 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, California", "Title": "\u201cI love the Ko Olina!\u201d", "Author": "babushka721", "ReviewID": "UR68696368", "Content": "This was our 3rd visit to the Ko Olina and it's still as wonderful as ever. We are owners here and don't regret buying here at all! The sales presentations are so low key and never any pressure to buy. We were able to check in a little early since our room was ready. We had a view of the mountains, the pool and the ocean. The view was awesome from our room on the 7th floor. I know another review stated there were a lot of problems with bug bites. Perhaps this was an unfortunate incident...we've never had any bug bites on any of our visits and some friends we know that go also have never had problems. I can't complain about anything here. Everything is wonderful from the location, the staff, the grounds, the room and the services! Concierge is awesome too...be sure to see Tina...she's so friendly and upbeat! I love being on this side of the island and would never choose to stay in Waikiki! Just make sure you have a rental car. We drove around the island and loved the sites. Having Kapolei so close is great. You can pick up food at Safeway, there's a Target & Costco there along with a TON of places to eat. Zippys was one of our favorites for their Gourmet Teriyaki Burger and their French Toast is the best I've had! If you want to eat at the Ko Olina, Kolohe's is good but pricey but definitely go at least once for dinner at sunset. It's so pretty! Chuck's Steakhouse is there too but we've never eaten there so I can't comment. We did the Fia Fia Luau there and really enjoyed it. The food was decent, not great, but you definitely won't go hungry and there were lots of choices. Their cake after was really good! Be sure to visit Dole Plantation for a Pineapple Whip ice cream...so good! We stopped at Matsumotos in North Shore for the best shaved ice. There is a \"turtle beach\" in North shore that's worth a visit too. You can look at the giant sea turtles that come to shore and you can swim or snorkel there too. Ask concierge and they'll gladly point it out on the map. If you love shrimp stop at Giovanni's Shrimp truck on the highway past North Shore, heading towards the Polynesian Cultural Center. Be sure to bring a permanent marker to sign the shrimp truck! We also stopped at Pearl Harbor and did some shopping at the Ala Moana outdoor shopping mall. Stop at Leonard's Bakery in Waikiki too if you love malasadas (a portuguese donut). We had so much fun exploring! The Ko Olina is a wonderful resort to relax and unwind at. You will see the most beautiful sunsets here and if you just want to lounge by the pool or beach there's never a problem and we always found plenty of chairs to use! We cant'y wait for our next visit!", "Date": "June 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "sacramento, ca", "Title": "\u201cI love this resort!\u201d", "Author": "christine01028", "ReviewID": "UR68112784", "Content": "This is my second time staying at the Ko Olina Beach Club, and I have to say - I simply love it. We had two, two bedroom units in the Hale Moana tower (in my opinion, the best views for the sunset). Firstly, the rooms are very well appointed; you cannot beat having all the comforts of home while on vacation. There are a ton of things to do at the resort, and shopping in nearby Kapolei (Costco, Kmart, Safeway, Target, etc.) is very convenient. The resort is so beautifully landscaped - it is just breathtaking. Palm trees, hibiscus, and plumeria are everywhere. The pools are great too. I even had fun on the slide - usually at other resorts those are just for kids. Two complaints though - there are tons of locals that use the pools and the BBQs day and night. They bring their whole family and take up huge areas of lounge chairs and are not at all friendly to other guests. We were very surprised by this considering this resort is for owners of the Marriott. One night, a group was particularly rowdy by the BBQs under our lanai, and when we called the front desk about it, they brushed us off about it - and never came to check it out or ask the group to leave. We watched them leave via the beach parking lot around midnight. Lastly, lounge chairs get saved by guests as early as 6am - even though they are not in use. This is such a frustrating practice, and I wish Marriott would police it better.

The resort was so quiet and not crowded at all. We spent a day going around the beautiful island and had lunch in Waikiki...thank goodness we didn't stay there. For us it was way too hectic, too many shops, and very little beach access. The beaches we're tiny compared to the beautiful beach we had at Koolina. If you are going to party, probably Waikiki is for you, but if your going to have some pure relaxation and with family (since its perfect for children) this is the place for you. We had a 2 bedroom non lock off Condo in the newer tower (I believe 30) and it was heaven! Beds comfortable and the rooms beautiful. It was so nice having a kitchen as we ate breakfast and lunch there every day. The resort has a couple of tasty restaurants and a market that sells lots of food and other things.

I was willing to downgrade it was for HAWAII!!! On the 2nd offer and told by the representatiive from Interval that 1 brm and up are really available to the (home )owners, I didn't want to risk not getting the date I wanted, As we were doing a vow renewal on a specific date, so we grabbed the studio, it was just the two of us. My husband and I could not be more pleasantly surprise, the resort was lovely, everything we wanted, Beautiful landscaping, clean,tranquil, and the beauty of hawaii, romantic, the staff helpful,courteous,friendly,accomodating,and full of aloha spirit. We had a to our surprise a ocean view woophiee(i did happen to mention that we were celebrating our 25 anniversary in an email the resort sent me prior to check in, in regards to any events and activities we might be interested in--I don't know if that helped in the room we recieved and when we checked in they had it noted and also sent up a box of chocolates and a card with well wishes for our special celebration that was a nice surprise) I would like to mention also I had called the resort weeks earlier to find out about doing a ceremony and they set me up with Alohabridalgallery and their rep. she took care of evevrything we needed for our vow renewal on \"Secret Beach\" it was everything I hoped for. So every morning we'd awake to the pacific ocean view and then the sun and the birds singing if you like that! We chose to have our breakfast on our lanai everyday that memory stays with us --lovely!!! At night the best sunsets- wow it really is Hawaii! What more can I say! Thanks to the reviews on tripadvisor we went for it. Great choice for us. If you want the clubs, a fast pace activity, and the city scene this is not the place for you , if you want down time, do what ever you feel like time, whenever you feel like because you just want to unwind--- this is it!!!. This is a family friendly resort and that means kids--hey thats ok as long as their not yours--right :). The activities they have you -can pick what interested you. Then there are sights to see! A car rental is best so you can come and go as you please ---Waikkiki is 30 min. Pearl harbour 20min, Dole plantation 20min. and so on. The mall area is one exit away maybe 5mins( target,kmart, chili's,taco bell, mcDonalds, pizza hut,nail salons,beauty shops,supermarkets,and so on) . The Activiites desk attendants are great with information and setting up activites for you. The directions they have ready for you where you want top go are the best I've seen--I really hate to get lost:(--but we sure didn't Thanks to Racheal!) The restaurants on site my favorite was Choloe Grill with the view of the water, the palm trees ,the sunset, the music in the background, the vibe was aloha, food was very good and the pina coladas delicious! In short I would say we were not disappointed at all --it then seems the 13Hr travel time from the east coast was in the end worth it(be advised!!!)I could go on-the Bed was the best --everything in our studio( 20 804 in Hale Moana Bldg ) perfectly clean and to Marriot standards.In all would definately go to Hawaii again and stay here in a heartbeat!

My brother and his family arrived before us, so was able to check into the resort around 2pm...and to make up for our long airline delays, we got LUCKY with an Ocean View room....which some was blocked by the palm trees in the front, but still got a spectacular view (so if facing the ocean, try to get the higher floors, anything above 7, and you get the best views\u2026but we weren\u2019t complaining). Our unit was a 3 Bedroom, 3 bath, which was basically a 2 bedroom unit with the separate lockoff 1 bedroom studio unit ...and this worked out perfect for us. My wife and I took the master, the kids in the 2nd bedroom with 2 twin beds, and my brother and his wife took the lock off unit which had a king size bed and sleep sofa. Very nice and clean, hawaiian decor....and lots of room...we had no issues at all with all of us in the unit with room to spare. Full kitchen, stacked washer & dryer (which made it nice so we didn\u2019t have any dirty clothes to worry about when we got home) As other reviewers mentioned, there are local stores to shop, Safeway, Target, and Costco (and the strip malls have numerous places to eat), all less than 15 mins away (really 2-3 exits away). We took advantage of this to buy our groceries for breakfast, lunches and snacks. The grounds are very nice and all the kids loved swimming in the 3 local pools and local lagoon! We usually stayed at the main pool with the water slide, and the kid friendly pool with the zero entry beach pool. The weather was unsually cool for the week we went 4/10-4/17, so the kids really enjoyed sitting in the hot tubs to warm up. I played golf at the local Ko Olina Golf Resort, which was nice....booked an 12pm tee time to get the cheaper rate, but because there were not alot of players on the course that day, was able to get off earlier and had no issues in playing time. Windy, but very nice! The concierge helped book Snorkeling Cruise for my wife, son, and brother\u2019s family which they said was awesome\u2026saw 3 whales and about 30 dolphins swimming next to the boat, but snorkeling a bit rough because the weather was windy which made the water choppy. We did a drive to the North Shore 1 day and visited - Dole Plantation (gotta luv them Pineapple Whips) - Had a snack at the Giovanni\u2019s Shrimp Truck (get the spicy\u2026nice burn), - Grab a sandwich from Storto\u2019s Deli (with the Papaya Seed dressing\u2026made an awesome sandwich \u2013 only negative is sandwich could have used more meat) - And for the kids, a stop at Matsumoto Shaved Ice! On our last nite, we did goto the Paradise Cove Luau, which was nice, and very close (Marriott has a shuttle that circles their hotel, resort, and golf course, which made it very easy to get around). When you check in, Marriott \u201csuckers\u201d you in to visit their Welcome desk within 24 hours to get a discount card to use at their resort, restaurants, golf course, and concierge services, and they entice you to sign up for the Marriott Timeshare Presentation, which we signed up for just to get the gift voucher. The presentation lasted 90 mins, and the guy wasn\u2019t pressuring at all, but the negative was that he was saying that I got lucky to trade in, and when all the Marriott units sell out in 5-7 years, he mentioned that I would NEVER be able to trade in again\u2026.we\u2019ll see. We did this to get a $75 gift voucher (which we used at Roy\u2019s Restaurant, located at the Ko Olina Golf Club\u2026 which if you are staying at the resort, to make a point to dine at one evening\u2026.great dishes!!). There is construction next door for the new Disney Resort, but this was not a bother at all. The only issue we had was with Billing, where my brother and I had separate accounts set up for charges, and for some reason, eventhough we gave room numbers to charge, they still mixed it up, so it took about 15 mins to clear up before we checked out.

(Being a premier owner at MVC I thought I'd have some pull but was wrong. I called for months to request an ocean view and found out I was labeled a 2 and had no other option but a mountain view ie desert view) The view was very disappointing but given that we were in Hawaii we tried to make the best of it. However, it was windy everyday which made the balcony worthless. (If you are on the ocean side the resort blocks most of the wind and you can see sunset). About the resort: -Check in was easy and we were able to get into out two bedroom a few hours early which was nice. -They offered valet parking for $5 a day which is not needed. There is a parking garage with elevator access that seemed to be more convenient than using a valet. -It was a nice two bedroom with kitchen which we have grown accustomed to from the MVC. Nothing different about this and it was spacious for two adults and two teens (After day six it was getting a little small!!!!) -The pools were clean, grounds were well kept and the service was great. -There is not a need to 'grab' your seats at 8 am as there were plenty of loungers in the pool area and beach. -The beach was great and the water was perfect. If you choose to snorkel it's $10 and worth it. Lagoon two is better as it had turtles and more fish. Location: This resort is great if you want to get to a destination and stay there all week. Other than additional hotels on the property (Marriott and a Disney construction zone) it is near nothing that one would wish to go to on a vacation (Fifteen minutes to a Target, Safeway, Costco, Chili's, Outback etc).

We, of course, drove all over the island to see all of the sights - most places less than an hour away. This location is on the less populated west coast so it's a drive to most of the sights - a plus for us since it was out of the crowds and traffic,but could be a negative if Waikiki is more than a once or twice visit.

Our trip to Oahu was a family vacation for some rest and relaxation over the holidays with our kids (ages 3 and 6). This is a great resort for families and young kids. I would not recommend it for couples as the place is filled with kids. But, if you have young kids, this place is truly a dream. Keeping that in mind\u2026here\u2019s why the Marriott Ko Olina is a great resort for families with kids. 1) Kid friendly Lagoons\u2013 Resort is located on the west side of the island of Oahu. The resort sits in one of eight man-made lagoons. The lagoons are tranquil and make for the perfect opportunity for young kids to wade into the ocean without concern about strong undercurrents. It\u2019s like swimming in a pool (but in the ocean). If the lagoon in front of the resort gets too crowded, you can walk along a paved path to one of the adjacent lagoons located on either side of the resort. They are less crowded and just as beautiful. The paved path is also a great place to go running. Beach chairs are free at the resort lagoon and there is $35/day charge for cabana rentals. 2) Good Kid Pools \u2013 There are 3 pools on the property. One is a quiet pool, geared towards adults. The other two pools are great for kids. There is a toddler wading pool that re-creates a \u201cbeach\u201d where kids can wade directly into the pool. It\u2019s shallow enough for kids to stand and this pool was my 3-year old\u2019s favorite location at the resort. There is also another larger pool with lovely waterfalls and a pretty fast waterslide that my 6-year old loved. Plenty of Jacuzzis are located around the resort for the kids to use. 3) Kids Club \u2013 The resort has daily kids activities outside of the pool options. If your kids want a break from the pool and sun, there are many different indoor activities to choose from. Some are free of charge and some cost a fee. However, the activities seemed geared more towards younger kids (12 and under) versus teenagers. Otherwise, we felt the amenities and the service at the resort were very good. We are not Marriott Vacation Club owners but rather booked our stay via Marriott\u2019s webpage using our AAA membership discount. We booked a 2-bedroom unit with an ocean view. Our unit was on the 6th floor - it was very spacious with a lovely ocean view. The units had a washer/dryer, free Wi-Fi access, DVD players, flat screen TV\u2019s, and a well stocked kitchen. The kitchen was a little on the small side relative to the rest of the unit but it served its purpose. The fitness center at the resort is also nice \u2013 spacious, lots of windows, and clean. If you like to frequently dine out, keep in mind the options for restaurants on the property are limited. There are two restaurants and a luau that occurs once a week. The luau was pretty good \u2013 food and entertainment were decent. The food at the two resorts restaurants was also good. Also, close to the hotel is a Roy\u2019s restaurant at the Ko Olina Golf Club and there are a couple of restaurants at the JW Marriott Ihilani Resort. Both are within walking distance. The resort is also within ten minutes of the town of Kapolei. In Kapolei, there is a Target, Costco, Safeway, multiplex movie theater, and many casual dining options (i.e. Chili\u2019s, Outback Steakhouse etc). This is where you will go to do any of your shopping and provides additional casual dining-out options. If you stay at Ko Olina, I do strongly recommend that you rent a car. You need a car to go anywhere outside the resort or around the island. If you are staying longer than 4 days, you will want to venture outside of the resort. If you have time, take a trip up to the North Shore. We really enjoyed eating shrimp at Giovanni\u2019s Shrimp Truck, seeing turtles swim up to the beach, and having shave ice at Matsumoto. It was excellent! My only big criticism of the resort is the steep daily parking charge of $30 per day. If you are not an owner of Marriott Vacation Club, you will pay this fee. It\u2019s a little ridiculous since there are no free parking options yet there is plenty of space for parking around the resort that you can\u2019t use. Another tip: if you want to avoid the timeshare pitch, avoid picking up the \u201cwelcome packet\u201d from the concierge upon arrival. This is where they rope you into a 90-minute sales pitch.

We have stayed at the nearby Ihilani at least once a year for over 15 years but decided against it this year because of the massive and noisy construction going on at the Disney resort being put up next to it. We made a good decision and I suspect we will always choose the Ko Olina Beach Club instead in the future. We had a two bedroom ocean view villa in the Hale Nai'a Tower. We were on the 8th floor in villa 30839. The view couldn't have been better- the lagoon and ocean views were close up. Aside from about 6 end units in the Hale Kona Tower, I believe that the views from the ocean view rooms in the Hale Nai'a Tower are the best. A new addition to this tower has been completed but has not been opened yet- those rooms will not have as direct a view of the beach and ocean. Our villa consisted of a fully equipped kitchen about the size you would expect in a nice condo. There was a combination dining area living room which was about 25' x 16'. The balcony was 16' wide by about 5' deep and had a chaise lounge and a dining table and 2 chairs and an unobstructed view. The main bedroom was quite large with a king bed and a desk. There was plenty of room for a rollaway bed which we needed. Attached to this bedroom was a bathroom with a large tub and a vanity. Another door lead to another bathroom with a large stall shower, vanity, and toilet. The second bedroom, located across the living room, was a bit smaller with a king bed and a bathroom with combination tub/shower. This bedroom also had a small balcony with a table and 2 chairs. As others have remarked, the public areas are beautiful. The lobby, located in the Hale Kona tower, is open air and has many of the attributes of the gorgeous Hyatt Kauai. Downstairs and open air are The Marketplace, which is a large gift shop which also has some of the characteristics of a mini-market (e.g. a refrigerated and frozen foods section, sandwiches, salads, snacks, wine, etc.) and a Chucks Steakhouse (seemed expensive). The pool areas are terrific. The pool (actually a combination of connecting pools) in front of the Hale Nai'a Tower has a tunnel waterslide and a cave. One of the pools by the Hale Kona Tower has a sand beach, suitable for very small children. Another of the pools by the Hale Kona Tower is a \"quiet\" pool. Despite being there over Easter vacation, we never had much of a problem finding chaise lounges either by the pools or at the beach. There is no charge for chaise lounges or towels, but you must wear a wristband while using the facilities. The lagoon and beach couldn't be prettier or more relaxing. It's very large and most people tend to crowd together in the center of it. But the sides of the beach were almost always empty so I just pulled my chaise lounge over there. There are also three other lagoons with beaches, two of which seldom have anyone on them but have no chaise lounges. Although this is a Marriott timeshare, we were there just as regular hotel type guests. They did keep pushing us to go and pick up their \"Aloha package\". I was suspecting it was going to be a sales pitch for a timeshare, but it wasn't. It just was a beach bag, maps, and a 10% discount card for the Marketplace and restaurants. The only sales type pitch we got was on our last day when someone left a message offering us a $399 rate for a standard room for 6 nights anytime during the next 18 months. I suspect that would entail a timeshare pitch if we had taken it. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We travel a lot and stay only in 4 and 5 star hotels and resorts.

Having stayed at several Marriott timeshares we knew roughly what to expect. We have stayed at Maui timeshare and Kauai timeshare. We liked Ko Olina BETTER than the other two.

Kohle's (the main restaurant) was pretty good. All in all, we were very pleased with the hotel. Oh ya, Marriott arranged for perfect weather all week which was very nice! :) CONS: My main issue is the lack of food options at, or near, the hotel. Also no shopping. Lastly, the waterslide (a long tunnel) was a bit too scary for my kids. Oh ya, if you are young and single this probably is not the best hotel for you. It's a family place first and foremost.

Each meal had a decent variety and was nicely prepared. However, I wouldn't call it \"excellent.\" Thumbs up would be all I can say. Beyond those two there isn't much around the hotel. There is a Roy's in the Ko Olina complex and then a few places down the road 2 miles in Kapolei. We had breakfast at Zippy's 3 mornings which was good but not great.

This was our fourth trip to Hawaii, but our first trip to Ko Olina.

We are Marriott Rewards members and Vacation Club owners (Aruba Surf Club), but we also vacation at Four Seasons and Ritz Carltons. Our preferred cruise lines are Holland America and Disney. On this trip, the children and I arrived early and spent the first three nights in a one bedroom unit in the Hale Kona tower. The room included a nicely appointed kitchen with a stackable washer/dryer, a living/dining area, a balcony with a small table and two chairs plus a lounge chair, a \"study\" area with desk and a master bedroom with king bed and bathroom (soaking tub, two sinks and separte shower.) We were greeted by and friendly and effiecient valet staff who took care of us the entire stay. We found the open air lobby to be inviting and check-in was quick and painless. When my husband and daughter's friend arrived, we simply opened a door to convert our one bedroom unit to a two bedroom unit. The second bedroom had a pull-out sofa and queen bed and a second full bath. We traded a week at our Aruba Resort for this Resort so we were treated as \"owners\" during this portion of our trip. Translation...the first three days we received daily housekeeping \"tidy\" service...the second 7 days we received one \"tidy\" service. Also, the first three days, we paid $30+ daily for parking...the second 7 days we paid $5 daily for parking. We shopped in Kapolei (both Safeway and Target) and ate most breakfasts in the room. There are many gas grills throughout the grounds so we enjoyed bbq chicken one night, as well. The pools are lovely, but cold. Chairs were mostly plentiful, but also mostly in the shade. Sunny chairs were tough to come by most days (and, as always) there were plenty of people who placed towels on chairs, but never used them (what is wrong with people?) Towels are found in two towel huts and wrist bracelets are handed out at the huts. We enjoyed the $2 shave ice by the pool most afternoons. The Lagoons are beautiful, as well. And we never had a problem finding a chair on the beach. There is a strict \"no alcohol\" policy on the beach, so don't picture yourself sipping a mai tai with your feet in the sand! The mai tai's, btw, are delicious by the pool. My daughter is a college tennis player and she found the fitness facility to be top notch. She also enjoyed the roof top tennis at the JW Marriott (but not the long complimentary ride to the courts.) There is a 1.5 mile oceanfront path for walking or running, as well a lap lane in one of the pools. We enjoyed both onsite restaurants, but the casual beachside one offers slow service during the lunch period. Charley's Steakhouse has good food and excellent service with lovely sunset views and early bird specials. You can order \"take out\" from either location for dinner in your room. The Marketplace offersonsite basic groceries, tshirts, lotions, snacks and starbucks coffee throughout the day. The kids did the Tuesday night Fia Fia luau and said the food was adequate and the entertainment was \"cheesy.\" We also enjoyed dinner at Roy's...no view (faces the driving range)...but excellent food and service. My husband golfed the onsite course. He said it was great, but pricey. He also did a google search for a less expensive course and took our 7 year old up the Leeward coast for an afternoon on another nice course. The drive to North Shore is about 45 minutes, as is the drive to Waikiki (traffic can be heavy.) We spent more time in the car this trip, but we covered a lot of area. We did a \"Lost\" tour with Ed Koss, we hiked diamond head, we ate Leonard's malasadas and took surf lessons at Barber's Pointe with \"Girls who surf.\" And with two 20 year old young women along, we hit the Shopping at Ala Moana and Royal Hawaiian. And did a snorkel tour out of the Ko Olina marina...lots of dolphins, whales and turtles. Very cool. Overall impression is that Ko Olina provides a great space for a family vacation on Oahu. The lobby and grounds are beautiful, the staff is friendly and the amenities are nice. It is a bit remote for many of the traditional Oahu acitivities (like surfing)...but the flip side is the serenity and peace.

As always, we had a wonderful experience. We were in the Moana tower. Check-in: We arrived at 10:00 p.m. and checkin was a breeze. There was no line, handed the front desk person my credit card and ID, 2 minutes later I had my room key, and 5 minutes later I was in my room, with my luggage following shortly. Everything was perfectly smooth. Valet & Bell service: Every member of the valet service was so helpful and nice. I can't really say enough about them. They were very quick to get my car, very quick getting my luggage to my room, and very friendly and helpful with directions. Valet is only open from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. at the Moana tower, so if you want your car outside of these hours you have to use the courtesy phone out front and call, then they send someone over. Normally it takes about 2 or 3 minutes to get your car, outside of these hours it's probably 5-8 minutes (though you might be able to call the front desk and have the bring it down, didn't think about this until I left). Grounds: The grounds are simply wonderful. The pools are really nice. The Lagoons are great for catching some sun and swimming in. There are grills all over if you feel the need to do some cooking out. There's a general store which has miscellaneous overpriced items like milk, eggs, sun block, etc. There are a couple resturaunts, which I did not eat at, though I did eat at Chucks Steak house on-site. It was actually quite wonderful and only $80 with tip, which for an on-site hotel serving prime beef, I thought was wonderful. The grounds are wonderfully decorated with many flowers and lots of color. Rooms: The rooms are fantastic. They have granite counter tops, full size refrigerator, stove, microwave and dishwasher. the unit has on room which has the toilet, sink, and shower, and a separate room with the tub, which my wife absolutely loved, though it was not a jetted tub. The beds as you will find with most newer Marriott timeshare properties are extremely comfortable. There's also a separate little area that can be used for storing your luggage, or sitting and reading a book. the living room is very roomy and very comfortable with a sofa and 2 recliners. The balcony is sufficiently large for eating a nice meal on. Location: You'll hear a lot about Honolulu traffic from the locals. The one thing they forget is they are forced to drive at certain times to get somewhere, as vacationers we are not. If you want to go to Waikiki, don't leave between 7-9, unless you don't mind some traffic. Its quite heavy around Waikiki and starts to get backed up a long ways before then. During normal times it's about a half hour drive to Waikiki. It's about 40 minutes up to the north shore as measured by Matsumoto's :), about the same as Waikiki is from the north shore I believe. Traffic is much nicer around Kapolei, than it is around Waikiki. As I stated my wife and I love Ko Olina. It is not for everyone. If you want action, nightlife, live music, etc., don't stay here, you won't be happy having to drive constantly to Waikiki. If you like relaxing, spending some romantic time with your partner, feeling more secluded, this is your place. When I was in my 20's I would have only stayed at Waikiki. No in my mid 30's I much prefer Ko Olina.", "Date": "January 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "CA", "Title": "\u201cAmazing in every way!\u201d", "Author": "sunnyCA28", "ReviewID": "UR54053360", "Content": "We stayed for 1 week in a 1 bedroom unit.

This property is gorgeous! It is extremely well-maintained, from the pools to the spas to the landscaping and common areas. The 3 pools were wonderful...it never, ever felt really crowded and we were always able to find a chair. The lagoon/beach is wonderful...calm and beautiful. We enjoyed many gorgeous sunsets there!

Make reservations, though, because they fill up fast. Definitely rent a car if you come...there is lots to explore on the island! We did Pearl Harbor and the Iolani palace, hiked Diamond Head, and enjoyed the shrimp truck on the North Shore. The only complaint we had was with the Ko Olina Cat (the boat tours that run from the marina next door). Twice they pulled our whale watching trip in early...instead of picking us up at 1:30 they called our room at 12:00 and said we needed to be picked up at 12:30. Well...it's vacation and we were not sitting around our room waiting for a call. We rushed back from what we were doing and got there at 1:30 to find out we missed the whale watching trip for the day. They promised to comp the trip the next day and said there was no way they would change the time again. Guess what!?? They did it again and we missed it again. Frustrating... We ended up getting a comp sunset cruise, which was nice, except that they spent the whole cruise talking about how awesome the whales were that afternoon--on the cruise we were NOT on.

I was surprised to that this Mountain view room overlooked the marina with a glimpse of the ocean. The suite was very spacious, with a full sized kitchen, laundry facilities, king sized bed, bathtub, shower, dining table, sofa couch etc. The only unpleasant encounter in the room was when we sighted a little centipede crawling in the bathtub that we had to get rid off ! The wireless internet in the room was slow most times except one of the nights where we were up at close to midnight. I had to print a document, as such had to use the business centre - even though the usage charge shown on the computer screen was $0.30 per minute, there was a minimum charge of $1 to use the computers. We were able to book this suite from Marriott.com for less than $200 per day through a Marriott family and friend rate but we needed to provide check in a letter from a friend working in Marriott. Another observation was that the cost of self parking has increased since July 09. This is our 2nd stay in this resort. When I looked at our July invoice, we paid $26.18 per day for self park and in December we paid $30.37 per day (including tax). As expected, the pools in the resort and Ko Olina Lagoons were great. We went snorkelling in Lagoon 1 and 2 but the waters in Lagoon 1 were far too murky. In Lagoon 2, we could sight a few fishes around the rocks but it was nothing spectacular. The pools were not very crowded this week, which is probably the low season. At the hut close to the gym where they provided towels and wristbands for the guests and owners, there was a board that showed numbers on wrist bands - these persons \"won\" root beer floats and shave ice. Too bad we noticed only on the last day as we had thrown out all the daily wrist bands. For kids activities, there were several throughout the week but our child only attended one - craft making session (Christmas decorations) which cost $1 per craft. Cost $3 for 3 crafts (1/2hr session). Our child was the only one in that session! Luau Having attended the Fia Fia Luau in July this year which we enjoyed tremendously, we reluctantly decided to give the Fia Fia a miss and try the Paradise Cove Luau this time. Never realized that the Paradise Cove luau was located just beside the JW Marriott Illilani hotel. The Fia fia luau was held on a Wednesday this week instead of the Tuesday (which is its regular day). I booked the Paradise Cove Luau over the phone through a 3rd party travel vendor, and got a way better rate (about $20 less per adult) than booking directly with Paradise Cove. Decided to get the cheapest package (side seating) as I was betting on the Luau not being very crowded. Overall, I think both Luaus are quite different. The Fia Fia was on a smaller scale (less people), but it gave a very warm feeling. Kids could sit up front to watch in the Fia Fia luau. There were more activities to see and engage in the Paradise Cove Luau such as throwing spears/stones at targets, getting temporary tattoes, making coconut leaf handbands and wristbands with orchids, people marching withe roast pig (kalau). When I think back the food was better at the Fia Fia one, with a separate menu for kids (had kid's favourites such as Macaroni & Cheese). The Paradise Cove Luau's food was average. Tipping is included in the price for the Fia Fia one, but not the Paradise Cove one, as there were little baskets for you drop your tips as you engage in various activities.", "Date": "December 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cDon't ever stay there!

The resort is about 30 minutes (depending on traffic) outside of Honolulu. A rental car was needed as we did a few things around the island, however it was nice to spend time in this isolated resort -- a relaxing place for a vacation. Check-in was smooth. LOCATION This is the most stunning aspect of the Ko Olina Beach club, so I thought I'd start with it. The location is beautiful. Specifically, the ability to walk to the ocean water within minutes of leaving your room is what makes a vacation here the most enjoyable. The four man-made lagoons have been around long enough where you can forget the fact that they are artificial -- the fish, birds, and other wildlife have grown accustomed to the lagoons, creating a pretty naturalistic experience. While snorkeling, you notice the rocks within the lagoons are covered in various types of plant life, coral, and sea urchins. The first couple times I went snorkeling, I was able to see quite an array of fish and other marine life. The whole cast of \"Finding Nemo\" was there (except for the actual clownfish, which I didn't see). Depending on how far out you are comfortable snorkeling, the colors and shapes of the various fish get more and more exotic. Each lagoon has an artifical rock barrier at the edge that disrupts the breaking waves coming in from the ocean, so unless the waves are especially huge, the water is pretty calm within the lagoon. During my last few days of swimming, some giant waves began coming in, causing some pretty big ups & downs in the lagoon water. Nothing really dangerous for an experienced swimmer, but the wave activity did kick up quite a bit of sand underwater, making the water rather murky -- thus not much was visible during snorkeling. However, it was during one of these \"wavy\" days when I was swimming in lagoon #1 that I came within a few feet of a giant sea turtle. A friendly and surprisingly tame creature, he didn't seem bothered by the humans. It was an amazing experience! The meandering pathway that connects the 4 Lagoons is a pleasant walk. My wife and I strolled along it everyday, between the Ko Olina and the JW Marriott. At Lagoon #1 (near the JW Marriott) and Lagoon #3 (near the Ko Olina Beach Club), guests in either of the Marriott properties can rent \"cabanas,\" which are covered and padded beach chair-beds that make it quite inviting to spend a lazy day on the beach, overlooking the water and feeling the ocean breeze. Location downsides: Currently there are not many downsides. However, there appears to be a large resort under construction (I've heard Disney?) directly in front of Lagoon #1. Sometimes the sounds from this construction site are disturbing. Also, once that resort is completed, I assume there will be larger crowds that could make the place less enjoyable. Another downside is the close proximity of what appears to be some factories/refineries -- very close to the Ko Olina area. (see my comment later on about \"Bad Experiences\") HOTEL ROOM We found our hotel room to be clean and comfortable. The bed was luxurious. However, we were given a \"Mountain View\" room, which basically means you have a view of an empty field in the distance, the refinery, a bit of the marina, and in our case, a good portion of the parking lot (see photo). Since we spent most of our time outside of the room, this wasn't too big of a deal. But it would have been nice to be able to enjoy the spectacular ocean view from our room's balcony. There was no way for us to transfer to an ocean view, because apparently when we made the timeshare trade through Interval International, the type of room that Marriott traded us into was \"Mountain View,\" and the front desk told us that whatever you trade into (even though we had no choice in it), is what must be assigned. We started out in the Hale Moana Tower, the for reasons explained below, we actually moved to another Mountain View room in the Hale Kona Tower. The first room had a larger (kingsize) bed, but an outdated television (see photo). The second room had a smaller bed (queen size) but a new flatscreen television. Unfortunately, the cable signal was not in HD, so the flatscreen picture was not optimal. Internet: One great thing about the room was the free Wi-Fi internet. I really get irked by high-end hotels that charge enormous prices for the use of internet. The connection in our room was sometimes weak, but generally strong enough for web use on my iPod Touch. However, heavy browsing or downloading using our laptop was much slower, about dial-up speed. Still, great for checking email and simple web stuff. HOTEL SERVICE The staff were generally very nice and polite people. I had good experiences with front desk staff, the bellhop, and was most impressed with the staff members who ran the cabana rentals on the beach. One of the guys remembered my name after meeting me once, and greeted me a couple days later as I was walking on the outdoor pathway. It was convenient to be able to charge cabana rentals and restaurant food at either the Ko Olina or the JW Marriott locations to our room account. Food: The poolside restaurant overlooking Lagoon #3 is overpriced and not very good. The restaurant within the JW Marriott is \"vacation priced\" but with good food. Given the close proximity of Costco in the town nearby, we actually prepared our own meals a few times by getting some various fish and veggies, and then grilling them on the gas grill BBQs that the hotel provides in the common areas outside. This was a good alternative to only eating at the hotel restaurants, or the Chili's in the town. Parking: Parking was very convenient (although sometimes the lots would get quite full and it was hard to find a spot). Fortunately, parking was included in our timeshare exchange, so we did not have to pay any extra fees. Late Check out: On the day of our checkout, our flight departing Hawaii was not until night time. The hotel allowed us an extra hour of \"late\" checkout (11 am instread of 10 am). This wasn't much, however...they also gave me a keycard that provided all-day access to the lockers and showers next to the pool; and they informed us of an \"owners lounge\" where we could rest up and kill time before leaving the resort and heading to the airport. Since I spent most of our last day on the beach and swimming, this was quite convenient. BAD EXPERIENCES Truth be told, our \"Bad\" experiences were limited and did not ruin our vacation. But they were significant enough to be mentioned. One evening, about halfway through our stay, a horrible sulfur (like a stink bomb) smell permeated throughout several floors of our tower. It was quite pungent and made it difficult to stay in our room for several hours. On top of that, my wife was 6 months pregnant at the time and we didn't want to risk her being exposed to whatever substance was in the air. As she stayed in our friend's room, I complained to the front desk and requested a move to a different tower. The smell apparently was bad enough that the Fire Department was called. I ran into a couple Firemen in the hall who were investigating the cause. The hotel was accomodating enough to move us to a similar room in another tower, but they still refused to give us an ocean view. I guess this wasn't mandatory for them to do, I just thought it would have been a nice gesture to \"make up\" for the inconvenience of having to re-pack all our stuff and change locations. No such luck. I don't know what the source of the smell was. But it may have had something to do with the close proximity of the factories/refineries. On the day we checked out, a similar bad smell was in the air at a different part of the resort (closer to the golf course)...and again, the Fire Department was there to investigate. SUMMARY Overall, we had a wonderful vacation at the Marriott Ko Olina. We spent most of the time outside. There were occasional rainy times during the days, but they were short-lived. I would recommend going during non-peak times. We were there the week after thanksgiving, it was very idyllic and not crowded at all. However, I imagine its a different scene during summer vacations and holidays.

The reviews already listed for this hotel are accurate so I will just add some aspects that are missing from the reviews that could be useful. First and foremost this hotel/resort is a timeshare place. This is not a secret but as we were not there as time share owners I can add some comments for what they call 'renters' once you get there. As the place is mainly timeshares the occupancy will always be high. Essentially the resort is nearly always fully booked. This was not a problem when we were there are there were not many kids around. But, I can imagine if you go during the main school breaks it would be a lot different. The rooms for renters seem to be just in the Kona tower. We paid the extra for the ocean view room and were very disappointed to mainly be looking at the marina with the refinery behind it. We were also above the hotel entrance so had a great view of all the cars coming and going. If you looked in the right way though you could see the sea. My wife went to see the front desk and they were very accommodating and worked hard to find another room. This room overlooked the pools and had a much better view of the ocean. It transpires that the ocean facing rooms are all timeshares so as a renter you would not get these rooms with the far better views. One aspect of the rooms I tried to find some information on was the layout, as we took a one bedroom villa and would have to be using the sofa bed. All the rooms in the resort are adjoining! Something we wish we had known. This is because the design of the rooms is such that there is a one bedroom villa and a studio next to each other. If you take either the studio or the one bedroom villa then the adjoining door is locked. If you take the two bedroom villa the door is simply opened. Fortunately, our neighbors were quiet and we did not experience any problems but if you take the suite and have a family next two you it will be very different. When people are talking in the adjoining room it is quite easy to hear them in your room. If you go to the Aloha desk for your 'discount vouchers' you can probably guess what is coming - yes, they want to sel you a timeshare! The pressure is not too bad and the deals on offer for going to the 90 minute presentation look good value, but we gave it a miss. they did try to call us a few more times to convince us to go but we declined and they seemed OK with that. They did not give up though and on the last night tried to offer a 'bounce back' deal to get us to come back at a reduced rate. Even though we are from the UK and have just about no chance of buying a time share half way across the world they did not give up. I guess its their job. All said and done it was not too high pressure and we had a little bit of fun knocking them back. As per the other reviews the place is very nice, well kept, very clean and a great get away from Waikiki. The car parking fees are a bit of a scam. Just a way of hiking the prices up I feel. The in room internet was poor. The WiFi signal would keep dropping out and when connected if felt like being back in the era of dial up. Maybe it was just my room though as I did not try it elsewhere in the hotel. All in all a good stay and recommended for a stay in Oahu. But, we went also to Maui on our trip and if we went back to Hawaii we would skip Oahu in favor of the far more laid back Maui and the other islands.", "Date": "November 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay at Ko Olina, but not for everyone\u201d", "Author": "alexsndiego", "ReviewID": "UR48379570", "Content": "We exchanged our lock off at Marriott's Canyon Villas in Arizona (where we own) for what was originally a lock off. A couple month before our stay, Interval International called me and asked if we wanted to upgrade to a 1 BR for $70-ish (can't remember). We accepted the offer and we were happy we did. Here is my brief review and tips: Location: Ko Olina is on the west side of island about 25 minutes from the airport. The location is NOT convenient to airport, Honolulu, and Waikiki. A rental car is must. The nearest town for restaurants and groceries is Kapolei which is about 5 minutes away. The west is still somewhat industrial with a power plant to the north of the resort and an industrial harbor to the south. But the area is undergoing a transformation. This may be perfect for some people. We prefer the slower atmosphere of Ko Olina. Pools: 3 pools and various jacuzzi's are just incredible. 1 pool is multi level and has a water slide. 1 pool is the reflecting pool for those who want a somewhat more relaxed experience. 1 pool with flat sand entry, volleyball net, and basketball rim for the kids. Gym: Nice collection of cardio and weight equipment. Steam room and sauna in each gender's locker room. Locker room is available for use if you have a late flight but check out at 10 am and need a place to shower before your flight. On Site Restaurants that we tried: Kohole's - Marriott owned with views of the beach/lagoon. Typical Marriott food. Chucks Steak and Seafood - decent, solid. Prices reasonable for Hawaii. Steaks are solid but dont expect Ruth's Chris. Roy's - Typical Roy's. Good food. Good service. But to me, Roy's is just Roy's. Lagoons: Snorkeled Lagoon 3 which is in front of the property. Nice safe place for kids. Snorkel near the outlets to see the fish. I went surfs were 6 feet high, thus the fish were looking for shelter and found the amount of fish to be good. You can rent snorkel stuff at the activities desk. If you are a Marriott owner you get a discount. Excursions: I recommend Ko Olina Ocean adventures for a great snorkeling experience to 2 sites plus in water experience with wild dolphin. Not be missed! Lunch is pretty basic with sandwiches from the grocery store but the quality of the experience was great. Spoke with other guests who used Ko Olina Cat and said the food was a buffet but the snorkel site was only 1 and they didnt spend enough time in the water. Off Site Restaurants: Kozoku Sushi Kapolei - pretty good japanese and sushi with a conveyor belt style approach to serving. Sushi goes by you and pick up the one you one. You pay per plate with color coded plates with different costs. Also has an all you can sushi on Sunday nights for $28. Hapa Grill - for a local breakfast with the locals. Be open minded and try a local breakfast. Parking: Parking requires payment, valet or self. Self parking is both tight in availability at night and width. Dont get a full size car unless you absolutely need it. Get a mid size for easier parking if you can get by with it. North Shore: No trip to Oahu is complete without a trip to the North Shore and Haleiwa. Stop by the Dole planation on your way. Have a local meal with the various shrimp trucks in Haleiwa. Ask where Giovanni's shrimp truck is. They have the best garlic shrimp scampi. Avoid going to Kua' Aina bugers. Over rated! Cash only. No refills. Dry/Stale Bread. And not the best burgers. I would rather have a burger at Kohole's at the Beach Club than this place. I am a serious burger connoisseur and I feel sorry for anyone who thinks Kua' Aina is the best burgers they ever had, because you need to get out more! Souvenir Shopping: Best place is the swap meet at Aloha Stadium on Saturday, Sunday, and Wednesday. Best deals on t-shirts and all the other stuff you have to buy your friends and family. Not the place for you person stuff but if you dont want to spend a lot on other people this is the place to go. Only $1 per person admission which included parking. Bring water with you. Its in the parking lot of the stadium and it can get hot. Room: We were surprised that our upgrade was to a Penthouse ocean view. We totally enjoyed the view from the 16th floor. We didnt even have to ask or beg for it. The 1 BR is awesome with a soaking tub, 2 bathroom vanities, and large step in shower. Kitchen had full amenities, 6 person dining room table, one tv in living room, one tv in bedroom, patio with a cocktail table for 2, and a chaise chair. AC has sensors that turns off when it senses no one in the room to save energy. AC will also turn off if the windows and/or sliding door is open. Side note: Preference for room location is approximately as follows: Ko Olina owners, other Marriott Vacation Club Owners, Renters based on room rate, and other exchanges. If you come from another vacation club and expected to have a room selection like you are a Marriott Owner, you are maybe expecting too much. Getting mad at the front desk wont help you with your room location. I have worked in the industry and getting mad never works. Yes, unfortunately there are some rooms that face the parking structure. But Ko Olina does not sell itself as a place with ALL ocean views. This is the inherent game of time share exchange process. Dont blame the front desk person. We had a great time but the overall feeling of Oahu does not suit use. Traffic to Honolulu is BAD. Very BAD! We prefer the Big Island where things are spread apart and you get a true Hawaiian experience. Ko Olina Beach Club is a great resort with great amenities and nice relaxed location away from the hustle and bustle. But you have to drive anywhere and even the nearby town of Kapolei can we be an experience with traffic.", "Date": "November 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cOur great time in Hawaii\u201d", "Author": "daisybelle_0224", "ReviewID": "UR48079114", "Content": "We have just come back from our trip to Oahu, Hawaii.

The charm of staying somewhere off of Waikiki beach is that it is not as crowded, and the natural beauty of Hawaii and the ocean is not spoiled.

We would take trips to Costco to pick up steaks, mahi mahi, etc. and eat outside next to the Marketplace since the parking lot view was not too appealing to us. The location of the facility was nice, even though it was out of the way, but we agreed that being in Waikiki is more our style. The lagoons are nice for families and for swimming. If this wasn't a trade, we would have been happier with our room, although when you go to Hawaii, the view is what it's about. We did a timeshare tour and both agreed that Marriott is not for us. We spoke with many people and witnessed several check-ins of those who were not satisfied with the units they were given (and they were owners). We met a couple who had a Penthouse which we visited and even they had problems renting their lockoff unit (which we would have gladly taken if it was available!). You can't even trade within Hawaii for the same view that you have at Ko Olina. We'll give Disney a try (where we own) when they open next door and see the difference and the courtesy that is standard. Don't get me wrong.

We were lucky weather wise. Sunny and 89 degrees every day. I mention that because every morning walking to breakfast at Kolohe\u2019s grill was worth the flight from Maryland. We were in the Kona Hale building and coming around the walkway towards the grill, you see the blue ocean, trees, beach, and clear ski and think about selling your belongings and moving here. The grounds of this resort are simply beautiful\u2026 Peaceful... Relaxing. We own in Atlantic City and had an extra week in the bank so 2 friends joined us in their own room. We only have an efficiency unit, so the bed and couch we more than plenty for my wife and I. Our friends (2 ladies) worked out their sleep details. First night there after a long day of travel, we were ok to chill at the grill, listening to John Valentine, an EXCELLENT guitar player and singer, as the sun set in the distance. We got some postcard worthy shots of this. Unfortunately my advice probably will not help too many reading this because we have friends we were visiting out there and we also wanted to see other island sites while they were at work, so our stay at the Ko Olina evolved around breakfast a few mornings, and 1 day on the beach. However I hope the follow info proves useful so someone. Kolohe\u2019s is open for breakfast until 10:30, then again around 11:30 for the afternoon. It closes at 9:45pm. We only had 1 meal besides the 3 breakfasts and that was the on the afternoon of our arrival. We all thought the food was very good. The other restaurant, Chuck\u2019s steak & seafood, we were told is open until 11pm. We never ate there because we were out and about. The resort was very quiet after 9:45. I don\u2019t know about the hot tubs after the sun goes down because we were usually spent by the time we got back and headed to our rooms. We planned to hang out but it never happened. We took the shuttle to Roy\u2019s at the golf club one night to see how things were there, but it was very quiet too. So I suppose you have to bring your own party if you go here. If you plan to see Oahu, while excursions can be obtained at the desk in the lobby, I recommend you rent a vehicle. Some activities should not be tied to a schedule. Like driving the north shore side of the island, hanging out along Waikiki beach at a restaurant or international market, discovering a beach to hang out or watching the surfers. Plus, the Ko Olina is about 30 minutes from the airport, 35 minutes from Waikiki. Oh, and make sure you have a GPS or a very good map if you\u2019ve never been there before and want to see things. It\u2019s not hard getting around, but you can get lost. Gas was $3.30 per gallon of regular the week we were there, so figure that in to your plans. Coolest things we did. Blue Horizon Helicopter excursion. Our pilot was Toby and he was great. Fascinating seeing the island from the air at a slow speed. You fly over Waikiki, Diamond Head, the Polynesian Center, the Dole Plantation, Pearl Harbor, among other points of interest. Toby had a wealth of knowledge about the island. IF YOU DO NOTHING ELSE, YOU MUST VISIT THE ARIZONA MEMORIAL. The feeling of being on the site and hearing the story of the attack on Pearl Harbor will never leave me. Polynesian Cultural Center \u2013 Experience some traditions of the inhibits pacific islands throughout the complex, enjoy pretty good food at the luau while entertained by island performers, than see a great show, \u201cThe Story of \u2018Ha\u2019 \u2013 The Breath of Life\u201d. The Ko Olina seems to be a great place if you want a quiet, relaxing vacation. School is in just about everywhere so after Labor day seemed the perfect time to go. I would go back in a second except from the east coast it\u2019s 11 hours in the air to get there. We can be almost anywhere in the Caribbean in 2-4 hours.

So much so, that on this particular trip we finally gave in and bought into the MVCI time share program. I love the Ko Olina and will return there again for many reasons; great location away from Waikiki, private lagoons with lots of marine life, pristine beaches, super nice hotel rooms with washer/dryer and kitchenette. One thing to be aware of is the time of year that you go. For US tourists the best times are in late spring or early fall. The hotel was under staffed despite anticipating heavy check-in on the day of our arrival. There were very long lines and we got so tired of waiting for our luggage we went up and retrieved it ourselves after an hour. The staff were overworked but still remained friendly and courteous. Avoid summer and winter if possible because the non-US tourists flock there at this time. Why avoid it then? The cultures of other people are not always acceptable; a mature couple pushed our kids to the ground to get to some free pieces of coconut that were being given away, young girls without tops, two girls making out with each other in the lagoon and to top it off, a little boy relieved himself on the sidewalk in front of Chuck's restaurant with his dad calmly watching despite us yelling at them during the meal. Marriott stated that there's nothing they can do about these incidents so again, beware what time of the year you go or it may not be friendly for your US born family. A tip for would-be visitors is to head to the Super Target that is a few miles east of the property. You can stock up on food, personal items and a wealth of water and beach toys that are affordably priced. The restaurants on the property are good, especially Chuck's steakhouse but the prices is far fetched ($8.25 for a PB&J sandwich, $15 for a stack of 3 pancakes). The new water slide and recently completed tower are great and our family will definitely be back there again.

We were next to the new wing which hasn't been furnished yet so we had complete privacy for our large group of 10. We had the breakfast brunch at Kohole ($14.00) and dinner at Chuck's Steak &Seafood. The shrimp scampi there is to die for. If you are a Marriott timeshare owner (like I am... I exchanged my three bedroom Grand Chauteau in Las Vegas for the Ko Olina), you get 10% off at the restaurants (including the JW Marriott), a percentage off on swimming gear rentals, and complimentary parking. The layout of the resort is fantastic. There are four lagoons (the second lagoon has the most tropical fish and we even saw a sea turtle), water was calm and blue (although a bit salty so I advise wearing goggles), and a 1 1/2 mile walking/jogging path along the beach. They have fitness rooms fully equipped with sauna rooms, and bar-b-que grills throughout the complex. Ate at Roy's at the golf course and since the weather was perfect, we sat outside.

That means, the staff greeted us on arrival because they knew we were coming, explained exactly how check-in and parking would work, followed up immediately after check in to see if our unit was satisfactory and followed up after every request to verify that it had been fulfilled. The one superlative I will add is how well the staff maintains the property. The place is immaculate--buildings, grounds, public areas. Each time I used a public restroom it was spotless. For me, the attention to details and cleanliness is what makes the resort extraordinary. Also, the layout and collection of swimming pools and beaches is just fantastic. The only negative I might see for others is that in high season (summer, school vacations) the place is teeming with kids. For us and our son, that was a plus, but others might be put off.

There was plenty of seating available at all pools, and there were also poolside bars. The pools were the perfect size for the size of the crowd there. There was also a nice beach that was calm because it was set aside by a cove that sheltered the waves. The rooms could not be nicer. We stayed in a one bedroom villa which had plenty of room for two adults and two children. In Marriott style, it had a very comfortable bed with a down comforter. The only thing that this hotel lacked was a nightlife. It was about a 10 minute drive from the nearest town, which was a suburb that is typical of southern california. It did not appear to have any bars or clubs and the restaurants were all fast food and chains.

The grounds were beautiful, as were the pools. The ocean lagoons were OK. Great for children. There is gentle wave action. But snorkeling in lagoon 4, where the hotel is, I did not see one fish, not one. That's OK, though, because we snorkeled at other beaches around the island. The check-in was fast and easy. And the check out was one phone call. There were only 2 problems we encountered in the beginning. One was the room. We were supposed to have an oceanview room but the second floor with palm trees in the way didn't qualify as far as we were concerned. When they told us that was an OV room we simply said it was not acceptable. We were then cheerfully given a room on the 5th floor. We could see the ocean but it was so far away that I wouldn't pay for that room category again. The other one was the towels in the room. Now you may think that is a petty complaint, but these towels were gross!. I told my husband we would only use those towels at home to wash the car. He said no we wouldn't, they might scratch the paint. Really, they were gray, dingy, and disgusting! I called the front desk and told them exactly that, too. Within 15 minutes we did have fluffy white towels brought to our room. The restaurants were good but there were only 2 of them. The Marketplace had snacks/sandwiches. We spent a lot of time at the Ihilani for meals. They had a wonderful breakfast buffet and dinner was good, too. At the KoOlina, Kohole's was OK for lunch but their breakfast buffet was not very good. The other caution I would give would be that in August when we were there, there were hoards of teenagers. Really hoards. And I think you can figure that comment out. Also, this is not the place for anyone who wants to be in the action. Waikiki is the place for that. We didn't want the action, though.

Ko Olina was clean, comfortable, very spacious, and well maintained. We travel a lot and the room at Ko Olina was our boys (12 and 15) favorite (including comparing it to DVC 2 bedroom Beach Club Villa). The pools were fun and the beach was great. We used the beach/lagoon directly behind the resort (there are 5 man made lagoons in total, others further down had better snorkeling I'm told). Prices were reasonable at the Marketplace and restaurants. We purchased plastic rafts for only $6 at the pool. We took the shuttle to the nearby Marriott Ihilani Resort to have breakfast one morning. Ihilani is an awesome resort as well.with a shark and stingray pool, etc. Check in was easy a Ko Olina and the staff friendly and helpful. We wanted to get a building closer to the main area of the resort and we could have switched, but the agent pointed out that the view of sunset was better in the room we currently had. We never make use of the kitchen in vacation club villas but the clothes dryer comes in handy when you need to dry bathing suits. One morning pressed for time, we had to skip breakfast and opted for hot breakfast sandwiches at the marketplace - Good food and reasonable prices. If you are keeping to a budget, you can save money and get a good meal this way. We didn't spend a lot of time at the resort because we had a full agenda (PCC, Pearl Harbor, Shark Encounter, Waimea falls, etc). Only negative is that the pool areas were crowded and it was hard to find pool chairs, so we went to the beach. Towels had to be traded which was a little inconvenient - you could not just drop off damp pool towels at night and pick up new ones in the morning. Since Ko Olina is an out of the way location, it is great for relative quiet base for an Oahu vacation. It is only minutes from H1 for getting to all key attraction areas. In comparison, staying at Waikiki provides all the excitement of the strip, sights, restaurants, shops, crowds, etc. For our teen son, Waikiki had the advantage for surfing and for great stores (QuickSilver, ONeill, Element, BillaBong, Honalua Surf Shop, etc).

We've been to Maui, Kauai, and Big Island at least twice. This is our 5th time to Oahu and our 4th time to the Ko Olina Resort our first time was shortly after it opened. We always trade in to this resort with our Palm Desert White Week which cost us $7,000 purchasing on re-sale. I feel sorry for those who bought Ko Olina weeks direct from Marriott - pricey! But if it weren't for these less informed folks, Marriott wouldn't build places like this as they wouldn't be profitable for them. Someone has to buy the initial offering. I'd just rent from an owner here if I couldn't get another Marriott to trade to Ko Olina for much less. I find it pretty funny how they have the drapes drawn over the windows by the elevators in the preview center so you can't see the nearby oil refinery. With that said, I'm happy to report the resort is still top notch, even with the expansion. Everything is more or less perfect here. Yes you can get a more rustic experience on Maui and especially Kauai and the Big Island, but we've found the combination of the conveniences of the Ko Olina resort with the man made lagoons and all the amenities., activities, and the option to go into the \"Big City\" of Honolulu/Waikiki or head to the North Shore and watch the world class surfers. More specifically, Marriott has maintained the units well. They appear to be handling the large capacity well, but I think occupant rates are down for this time of year due to the economy and the third tower appears only half complete. The pools and the beach were not crowded although you need to get to the pool early for the best seats. Tip: If you're not a \"sun person\" and you can't find a shady spot, rent the covered lounge chairs as it is what of the few things in the resort that is not overpriced. The other best deal in the resort is the Happy Hour at Chucks. $4 Mai Tais, Beers, and Well Drinks. And the Fish and Chips on the appetizer menu is meal sized! Out kids loving feeding the giant Koi in the pond. The service at Chuck's is outstanding, three people will be waiting on you, a waiter, a drinks server, and a bus person. We preferred this to the beach bar as prices for food are no cheaper and the more casual beach bar. Tip: The snorkeling was best on the right side of Lagoon 4 by the Marina. But only mediocre compared to other places we've snorkeled in Hawaii, but very convenient. Do some of the activities. They are fun for the kids and low cost. The Tamiya Race Car Building and Race is worth it. The kids love it! You can drive 5 min to Kapolei where they have dining, Costco, Target, K-Mart, you name it. Overall Marriott has still hit a home run on this resort. It is relaxing, convenient, and flexible for whatever vacation you want. Relax at the beach one day, do the activities the next. We will probably avoid this place during high season (summer and winter break) in the future as I expect that a combination of finishing the third tower and the economy coming back will make this place a lot more crowded and as far as I can tell they have no more pools or restaurants planned so I wouldn't be surprised if during high season the place eventually ends up being a zoo as more people discover it and fill up the larger lodging capacity. Tip; Forget the timeshare presentation. We wisely never did it. The tempt you with resort dollars or tickets to shows, etc. It's not worth your time. If you can afford to go to this place in the first place, your vacation time is worth much more than they can offer you to sit through a high pressure sales presentation.", "Date": "August 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat trip!\u201d", "Author": "cahill05", "ReviewID": "UR36601472", "Content": "We traveled to Honolulu in June. This was the second time I have stayed out at Ko Olina but the first time out at the time share (previously stayed at the hotel). My husband stayed in the main tower and had a lock out while the rest of my family had a 2 bedroom villa in the new building. They were upgraded for the first week to a penthouse villa which had vaulted ceilings and was beautiful. Only complaint there was that they had to move after the first week due to some error on Marriott's part. They handled the move and gave us all passes for the luau which was actually really fun. One of the better one's I have been to and the food was excellent. The hotel is great and we had excellent service the whole time we were there. We sat through a time share presentation and were able to go on the dolphin snorkel for free which was so fun. The morning is supposed to be better so that's what we booked. They had breakfast and drinks (2 alcoholic pp). The crew was really fun and we found tons of dolphins. We thought the snorkeling was just okay but it was worth it bc of the dolphins. We also ate at Roy's, request to sit out on the patio and watch all the golfers come in on 18. Definitely get the pineapple infused martini, it was delicious. My husband and I went up to the hotel one night and had dinner at Azul. BTW, there is a shuttle bus that runs to Roy's and the hotel which was nice but its not a far walk up to the hotel, we walked back after dinner and felt very safe. The atmosphere is good, make a reservation for the terrace, we wish we had. The food was just okay. We did the preset menu based on our waiter's recommendation and weren't super impressed. We did hear from others that the food was great so maybe it was just our meal. We went to Pearl Harbor on a Sunday morning. Got there around 7:30 am and made it in the first group. TIP: You have to go to where the Bowfin is to get tickets (to the right if you are facing PH), we didn't realize this and walked up to Pearl Harbor only to be told we had to walk all the way back to the Bowfin to get our tickets. We did the audio tour while we were waiting and thought that was great. We did the Swap Meet after Pearl Harbor since they are so close. We got a couple things but nothing super exciting and if you are pressed for time I would skip it. I definitely recommend hiking Diamond Head. It was a hot day (definitely get there early) and we had to walk far bc the parking lot was full. TIP: If the lot is full just circle around and wait for someone to come out. People are always coming and going and by the time we had walked an extra 20 minutes up the hill from a different parking lot there were 5 spaces open. Also bring lots of water! The view at the top is worth the hike. We did the whole thing in about 2 hours but we took lots of breaks with my parents and also spent awhile at the top. Another thing we did was drive up to the North Shore. There are lots of beaches along the way, Waimea Beach seemed the prettiest. We made the mistake of driving all the way out to Turtle Bay (I would skip it) and then coming back but by then it was too crowded and we couldn't find a spot. One thing I would HIGHLY recommend is stopping at Ted's Bakery. The food is outstanding and would have been worth the trip alone. We also stopped at the Dole plantation on our way back. It was worth it for the Dole Whip but I wouldn't spend too much time here. We rode the train that takes you out to the pineapple fields which we all thought was interesting. I would skip the maze though unless you have kids that might really like that. If you are into golf Ko Olina has a really nice course. We also played out at Ko'olau off H3. It was one of the most challenging and beautiful courses I have ever played. I highly recommend it. We stopped at Boots & Kimos for breakfast which is also another must do. Get the pancakes with the macadamia nut sauce and you will not be disappointed. It gets pretty crowded though so get there early. One cool thing though is they take your order while you wait outside(inside only has about 10 tables and no bathroom for public use) so by the time you sit down your food is basically ready. We did go into Waikiki for a day, my parents were staying at the Royal Hawaiian (gorgeous hotel) the first day so we met them and had our own slice of the beach. It was fun for a day but took forever to get there bc of the traffic. Overall it was a great trip. If you are interested in bars and partying this place isn't for you.

We were traveling with an 11 yr old, 7 yr. old and a 9 mo. old baby, and this resort was perfect for everyone! The pools were designed wonderfully using natural lava rock and were perfect for the older kids as well as the baby. Nothing worse than being in a pool that drops right off and you have to worry about the kids being too deep, too fast. Not here! There is a shallow sandy beach entry that smaller kids love, with a volleyball and basketball net at the other end. You can check out balls for these for free next to the pool. The larger pool has a super fun water slide and waterfalls the kids loved. Several hot tubs make it even better, with one of them looking over the ocean. Beautiful! There are four lagoons along the beach in front of the hotel that provide opportunities for snorkeling and playing in the sand. The water was quite murky in lagoon 3. Much better snorkeling in lagoon 2 where we actually got to swim with sea turtles! If your mask is fogging up, just use a leaf from one of the plants growing along the sea rock by rubbing it inside your mask ~ it works great! There's Starbucks coffee inside the marketplace including yummy frappuccinos as well as muffins, sandwiches, etc. The food at Kolohe's was delicious! We made our own breakfast in our room, then had a nice lunch there with an ocean view. Kids meals (12 & under) were only $8 including a drink, and the kids burgers were large enough to fill up my BIG eater. We didn't try a lot of different things, but can definitely recommend the burgers and the tuna melt sandwich. At Chucks, we enjoyed fresh fish that even my kids devoured. The Ahi and Mahi Mahi were delicious. Included salad bar was a bit weak, but the fruit was really good. Can't say how their steak is, but if you're in Hawaii, you should probably eat fish! We had a one bedroom suite on the twelfth floor with an ocean view that was perfect for our family. The boys slept in the living area on the pull out sleeper, and we had a king size bed in the master. There was a perfect sitting area for the baby's crib off the master that you could even close off the shutters to, giving you privacy but still the ability to hear her. I really liked that they had real cribs, not the usual pak 'n play that most hotels have. Make sure you bring your own baby blankets ~ I had one for under her and one for over her. She slept, well, like a baby! :) I found the staff to be very friendly, helpful and generally happy. I can't imagine anyone having a problem with any of them, as I found the valets, pool staff, restaurants staff, and marketplace delightful. Speaking of valets, that was the only bad thing...$25/ day for parking, but I felt like we got such a great value on the hotel that it was worth it. Free WiFi was handy too.

You could literally stay in the resort without leaving (though I don't recommend that you do that because Oahu has a lot of things to do). Their concierge service is excellent. The resort has shuttles to an from the Marriott Ko Olina and the Golf Club although you can easily walk. There is one thing you might want to keep in mind before staying here. The resort is really family oriented. There are a lot of cute little children running around and swimming, so it is great for families. We do not have any children but we didn't find the children bothersome at all, but maybe thats because we went in April before school was out. The resort was really quiet overall. The one thing I would not recommend in this resort are the restaurants which were just average and really overpriced. I suggest going to the nearby grocery store (only a 5 minute drive) to stock up on snacks and breakfast goods. However, Roy's in the adjacent Ko Olina Golf club was excellent.

We really enjoyed the new pool. The kids loved the slide! Snorkeling in the lagoon one over is great all day long - lots of beautiful fish. Definitely loved the new Target (man I wish there had been one there 15 years ago!) and the new Costco. We got almost all our groceries between the two places, and cooked every day. Nice with two kids - we ate so well! Fish at Costco is very fresh, got fruits and salads there, went to Target first for other items. I can't wait to go back again, in a year or two!

The 3 mile roundtrip jogging/walking path makes exercising seem like fun when you have all of that beauty to look at as you pass by. Our children (ages 13 and 10) loved every minute there. We purchased groceries and utilized the grills and saved a ton of money on food. We did however go to dinner at Roy's (KoOlina Golf Club) and enjoyed it very much.

The lack of a \"core\" (such as Whaler's Village on Maui) or even other hotels/condos on the beach walk, is a negative.

The Luau Tuesday nights is out in the open. We were walking past it and stopped to take a look. A security person promptly came up to us to tell us to leave because we didn't pay for the Luau, so we were not allowed to watch.

The first unit overlooked the resort's main driveway that leads to the lobby and parking lot. We were in the first unit for almost an hour and left some dirty dishes and disheveled beds.

The view was advertised as ocean view and was nice, not great. The unit had a partial view of the ocean in the distance and the beautiful pool and landscaping. It also overlooked a huge vacant lot (future hotel?) and small parking lot. We experienced good service at both of the restaurants on every occassion. The only criticism is the inablity to order small, indiviual items for breakfast such as oatmeal or a bagel. If you wish to dine at the restaurant for breakfast, Marriott makes you purchase the buffet or a choice of three huge plates of food and sometimes you are just not that hungry. Usually, the service personnel at Marriot Hotels are well trained in customer service. Marriot is in the business of sales. Unfortunately, these employees appear to not want to be bothered. I wanted to extend my stay. At first, the front desk person told me there was no availability. I immediately got on line and found out there was availability. Then she said my only option was to move to a different room mid stay. I am abbreviating the many many phone calls and days this took. Finally, I went to the front desk service person and asked to speak to the manager. At first she refused to get the manager, she stated the manager could not help me. After several requests, she informed the manager who in minutes arranged an extended stay with no room change. I have read other reviews that stated the guests had good experiences with the concierge. That was not our experience.

However, for those of us with kids it was wonderful. We are owners but we'd never been. We used the 1 bedroom portion and found it to be perfect (4 yr old slept in the enclosed lanai off the master bdrm on the little couch, son on sofa bed in main room). Brought very little clothes and used the washer/dryer daily. We were on the 6th floor of the Moana Tower with an ocean view. We were there from 3/29 - 4/5 and the only downside to our trip was the 7 day WIND (several locals told me it was unusual to have so many consecutive days of strong winds....) So we spent more time in the wind protected pools vs the beach, but that was OK because my kids loved the water slide, the water falls and the FAMILY hot tubs (the pic of the pool above is very old. It's now the lagoon pool and has a sand bottom/beach, volleyball and bball & lots more rocks and plants). I'm attaching pool pics & video. On the calmer days the beach was great. We snorkeled and saw lots of cool fish (by the rocks). The lagoon is well protected so it's VERY calm. In fact, my kids (4 & 9) wanted some wave action so we asked the concierge for advise and she recommended Barber's Point and gave us written directions (5-10 min). Since I mentioned the concierge I'll take a moment to comment on how wonderful they were. Super nice and loaded with good info. When we asked about the North Shore she gave us GREAT INFO and directions on Waimea, Shark's Cove, Banzai Pipeline, Hale'iwa Village, etc (be sure to ask about the turtle basking spot. Very Cool!) We spoke with the concierge right away and obtained so much info we realized we didn't need to sit thru the boring \"Monday Meeting\" which describes all the possible excursions. As far as excursions go we did several. Fia Fia - the on-sight Luau and it was the first I'd ever been seen. The food was great (kid's option also - chicken tenders, mac & chs, etc). The chief was a great showman and really got the kids involved. I, personally, thought it ran a little long and wouldn't do it again but it should be done once ($220 for all 4 of us). The same Samoan Chief does the welcome event and that was a lot of fun too (kids liked it a lot). Star Gazing - on-site ($107 for the 4 of us) and it was pretty cool. My son loved it! The gentleman who ran it was great with kids and really knew his stuff (seeing Saturn was wild!). Whale Watching (w/out snorkeling) - I knew it was late in the season so the concierge suggested Hawaii Nautical because they give a voucher good for 2 years if you don't see a whale. We saw lots of dolphins but no whales so we had a fun boat ride and a voucher for next time ($200 for all of us). Koolina has lots of activities for kids and adults. My son got to make a cool warrior canoe (6\") and my daughter painted a masterpiece on a coconut. If you have kids take the walk (or shuttle) to the JW for the FREE morning fish feeding. Kids loved it and they give away 5x7 laminated cards on lanyards w/pics of the local fish. At the Maze Hut (Lagoon Pool) you can check-out frisbees, horseshoes, bocce ball, etc. (Here's a secret- don't waste money on pool floats or sand toys... since nobody wants to pack them back they leave them at the pools and the staff puts them in an overflow bin on the e/side of the hut. EVERY morning I saw new tubes and sand toys left homeless....) The grills on-site are also very nice! I agree that a car is a must with the Costco, new Target, Safeway, restaurants a few off ramps away (cooked most our meals in the room. FYI - smoke alarms a VERY sensitive... sorry neighbors :-). We went to Pearl Harbor one day and, since we did the Arizona/Missouri a few years ago decided to check out the Bowfin. It's a WWII Submarine self tour that the we all found very interesting. God Bless Submariners!!! ($28 for all 4). We went to Waikiki one night and I was reminded why I hate it. Too many people! Back to the relative serenity of Ko'olina. Bottom Line - We had a fantastic family trip because Marriott Ko'olina is a fantastic resort with wonderful amenities and great staff. We can't wait to go back!!! If you're thinking about buying, our sales rep at Marriott ([--]) was fantastic and no pressure. We took weeks to finally decide.

Some of the poor reviews should be thrown out, because it is obvious they were written before expansions were built. There are plenty of food options, from sandwiches to Chuck's Steakhouse all with great food. Housekeeping was inconsistent, but the room was always clean. We were there for almost 5 weeks and they came in every Wednesday to do an overhaul cleaning. My biggest complaint is that the floors never got washed, including before arrival. The rooms themselves are extremely roomy and comfortable., affording all the comforts of home and more. The beach is a man made lagoon, of which there are 4 of on the whole KoOlina property. There are 3 pools and 7 hot tubs, so you would think you would have some space. Not always so. The resort is on a remote side of the island, away from the city and nightlife. Consequently it is overrun by families of all sizes with kids of all ages. The pools are loud with kids constantly screaming for no reason except for the sake of making noise. Of the 7 hot tubs there is 1 designated to families with children, a few that 10-18 year olds need to have a parent and a few more adult only. None of this means anything as kids are in all of them, parents bring babies into the adult only ones and NEVER is there any monitoring of hotel staff to be sure that the rules are followed. There are 2 very nice side by side ones of which we tried to relax, while there were kids doing cannon balls on the adjoining. The beach which is open to the public has a few hundred lounge chairs of which are posted \"for KoOlina guests only\". Get out there early on the weekend, or you won't get a seat, because the locals take them up. Again no staff to monitor. The real kicker were the grills. Each building had a set of 6 grills, which were great. Apparently on weekends the hotel allows there staff to stay there at a very discounte rate. They come in, bring their extended families of about 25 people, completely take over a set of grills (3 grills to a set), line of the coolers, set up tables etc, while the kids run through the gardens back and forth to the pools, the \"employees\" are partying for hours, not allowing the paying guests access to them. Then they brag to the guests, some of which are owners, that they are staying there for $100. Very tacky and unprofessional. As a past Marriott employee, I was mortified and angry that the hotel allowed their employees to stay there. Other than all this, it really was a great resort, our room was on the mountain side, which was great because it was quiet. We stayed our last night on \"ocean view\" of which we could see the grills, and it was very loud.

As other reviewers have noted, a car is a must since the resort is about 30 minutes from the Honolulu Airport and about 45 minutes from Waikiki. The rooms come in a studio (with mini-kitchen and a sleeper sofa), a one-bedroom (with full kitchen and sleeper sofa in the living room), or two-bedroom units (highly recommended for families). In our opinion, the Marriott Ko Olina Beach Club is the best in Hawaii. Ko Olina is a master-planned community of residential housing, with four man-made lagoons fronting the ocean. The lagoons were designed to diminish the waves, making them ideal for snorkeling and swimming, but not for surfing (one should head to nearby Kalaeloa beach on Mamala Bay for some great surf known only to the locals). The various lagoons are home to a wide variety of fishes that feed in the lagoon (and therefore better than the over-visited Hanauma Bay near Waikiki). The Marriott Ko Olina Beach Club fronts onto the third of the four lagoons, while the JW Marriott Hotel and the under-construction Disney Hotel/Vacation Club resort share the first lagoon. The Paradise Cove Luau is also located in the Ko Olina resort, along with Roy\u2019s restaurant in the golf clubhouse and a full yacht marina where we took advantage of the Ko Olina Catamaran snorkel tour (more on that to follow). A new shopping village similar to Whalers Village in Ka\u2019anapali is also slated to open later this year. The resort access is guard-gated to only residents and guests at Ko Olina. In addition to fronting the beautiful third lagoon, the Marriott Ko Olina now has 3 of 4 timeshare towers completed, with 3 large and very beautifully designed swimming pools. One pool has a portion that has a very shallow sandy bottom ideal for little children, the pool closest to the beach is large and terraced for some great lounging in the water, and the newest pool has grottos, waterfalls, and a 100 foot indoor waterslide. The resort has the convenience of Oahu access, but none of the touristy Waikiki craziness and expense. The 45 minute commute to Waikiki is its advantage, not disadvantage since it is located on the uncrowded west side of Oahu. Yet 5 minutes away is the new community of Kapolei with the conveniences of inexpensive local restaurants, a Safeway, a K Mart, a brand new Costco, and an even newer Target (Hawaii\u2019s first). Kapolei also had a multiplex movie theater and the Hawaiian Waters water park (neither of which we had time to try). But probably our best memory is being able to have the space and luxury in our 2 bedroom unit. We were assigned a room in the newest \u201cNaia\u201d Tower. The furnishings were brand new, the kitchen was fully stocked and well laid out, and the bathrooms and beds were luxurious. It truly was a home away from home (and even better). The pictures attached to this review will speak for themselves. On Tuesday night, we decided to check out the luau called Fia Fia. The star of the show is Chief Sielu Avea who was the star Samoan fire knife dancer at the Polynesian Cultural Center from 1981 to 2001. The Fia Fia Luau is his own show. At $78 per person, we initially thought it was more expensive than the nearby Paradise Cove luau. But afterwards, we concluded it was a far more intimate luau, a great set of performances, and a plentiful buffet luau \u2026 especially if you enjoy Kalua Pork, Teriyaki Beef, Mahi Mahi, and BBQ chicken. Correction to an earlier Trip Advisor review: The Tuesday night Fia Fia luau will cost you money, while the Monday night torch lighting ceremony is free. Some guests tried to view the Fia Fia luau show for free from the perimeter of the lawn area (since the show is on the grounds of the Marriott Ko Olina) or from the balcony of the lobby that looks off the grounds from a distance. But don\u2019t be cheap with your spouse and family \u2026 the dinner and show are well worth paying for. To save some money, we also purchased breakfast and lunch groceries and cooked in, so therefore we did not try Kolohe\u2019s or Chuck\u2019s Steakhouse. But we did eat at the local chain Zippy\u2019s in Kapolei for dinner and did a trek twice into Honolulu to meet up with my sister in law who was on business at the same time we were in Ko Olina. For a snorkeling and sailing experience we purchased tickets on the Ko Olina Cat, which launched from the nearby Ko Olina Marina about a block away. At $110 per person, it was expensive (includes lunch and beverages), but they guaranteed whale or dolphin sightings otherwise a second trip would be offered free. We snorkeled just up the Waianae coast near an ugly water treatment plant. But the warmth emanating from the plant causes algae to grow in abundance \u2026 meaning tons of fish feed here. It was the most fish we ever viewed in any island snorkel. No mammal sightings, and so the Ko Olina Cat guaranteed a free trip good for within the next 2 years to our family. A great deal which we will take advantage of when we revisit the Marriott Ko Olina in 2010.", "Date": "March 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "thc2009", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort\u201d", "Author": "thc2009", "ReviewID": "UR26640275", "Content": "We stayed at the Marriott Ko Olina Beach Club about two weeks ago for five days. We were assigned a studio that faced the parking lot, but other than that, everything else was great. The property is beautiful and pleasant with lots of palm trees and flowers. Owners have access to a private beach right outside in the common area. It's just a very well-designed, clean, secluded beach area. There is a free shuttle that takes people to the Marriott Golf Club (where Roy's is located) close by and the Marriott Hotel about 2 minutes down the road. The restaurant at the hotel, Azul, is superb. If you request to sit outside, you are steps away from sting rays and small sharks (not sure what they are called) that roam around in a pool. The designs/architectures indoors and outdoors are beautiful and magnificent with huge white columns and lots of greeneries. The most important aspect , of course, is the food. It's excellent and very reasonably priced. Back to discussing the Marriott Ko Olina...The location is great. You are about 5-10 minutes away from Costco, Safeway and Long's Drugs. There is a huge shopping plaza in the same area. You can find lots of restaurants there, too. Yes, it's about 30 minutes away from downtown Honolulu, but it's not so bad.

From the villas that face the ocean to the service, this resort cannot be beat! We stayed in a gorgeous 1 bedroom villa overlooking one of Ko Olina's 4 lagoons. The villas themselves are probably around 1,000 sq feet for a 1 bedroom and feature a full kitchen with everything you need to make a perfect meal. They also feature a washer and dryer which comes in handy. There's a bathroom with a toilet, sink, and shower, then another bathroom with just a sink and oversized bathtub. The villa also has a small reading room with what I call a mini bed. Overall you can't beat these rooms, they have everything you need for your entire stay not to mention all the room you could ask for, and the balcony was a fairly good size featuring a table with two chairs and a lounger. You can't beat eating breakfast in the morning overlooking the ocean and also eating dinner watching the sunset. Talk about a romantic dinner! The resort has their own market which has a starbucks and sells some other food items as well as some grocery items. But your better off going to the Safeway just down the H1 freeway to save some $$$. During our stay we ate at Chuck's SteakHouse which had some pretty tasty steaks cooked to perfection and all meals include their salad bar which was average. Resort also features activities you can take part in from hula lessons and yoga to hawaiian style bowling. They also feature 3 pools and numerous jacuzzi's. And their beaches are great that's all you have to do is go down early and grab your chairs and put your hotel issued towel on them and don't have to worry about anyone taking your spot, it's great! Bottom line, if your looking for a secluded resort outside of Waikiki this is the place! They have it all here for you not to mention to superb service.

I have traveled quite a bit and must say I was very impressed with this resort. The on-line pictures don't do it justice. The grounds were impeccable, the staff was very friendly and accommodating, the rooms were extremely comfortable and clean. We didn't even need the mid-week maid service; in fact, it saved us the hassle of worrying about any valuables left in the room while we were out. This resort is ideal for couples wanting a romantic, quiet vacation. It's also perfect for families with small children. The resort is huge and plenty of space to spread out. We didn't feel crowded at all. We reserved a Queen bed w/ Mountain View. We were pleasantly surprised to find a California King bed, sofa and kitchenette (small fridge, microwave, toaster, dishes for 2, coffee maker & even came with dish soap, sponge and paper towels). The water view would have been much nicer, but the mountain view wasn't bad. It overlooked the golf course and some housing developments at a distance. We save a lot of money by selecting a Mountain View. The marble counter tops in the kitchenette and bathroom were a nice touch. It's a gorgeous property! Guests have access to 4 lagoons for swimming and snorkeling. (You can buy snorkels at the Marketplace or local Wal-mart for cheaper than buying them in advance and packing them ~$29). The pools at this resort were very elaborate w/ waterfalls, a water slide and cabana bar service). Shaved ice was only $3 and cocktails available at the bar. Adult beverages and food is a bit pricey, but worth the splurge on vacation. We took a trip with Safe-way Foods on our first day to purchase breakfast foods, fresh fruit, drinks (including liquor), etc. We actually bought a small blender at Wal-mart to make our own frosty beverages. Much to our surprise, Wal-mart was also the best place for small token souvenirs. We didn't do a Luau because I'm vegetarian and they don't cater to non-meat eaters. Instead, we opted for the luau at the Polynesian Cultural Center. This resort is a timeshare property. If you have the opportunity to take the 90-minute preview - Go! You'll get to choose from a gift excursion (to name a few: catamaran snorkeling tour, whale/dolphin watching, sunset cocktail cruise). It doesn't take much to qualify for the timeshare preview and it was nice to tour the larger 2 BR units w/ full kitchen. We chose not to buy, but didn't feel any high pressure either. Everyone was incredibly friendly! Be sure to attend the activity preview at the beginning of the week and register for free door prize drawings. It gives you a taste of all amenities available during your stay. Fia Fia is a free show on the lawn mid-week. Pool towels are plentiful. There are at least 4-5 restaurants on the resort that you can charge to your room. The Marketplace sells Starbucks coffee and has a pre-packaged section stocked with goodies from Cheesecake Factory, Coldstone Ice cream (whole b-day cakes sold here), drinks, fruit/cheese, etc. The resort is in a more secluded area of the island, but this is a huge perk in my opinion. There certainly wasn't a lack of things to do. We ventured over to Waikiki to explore that for a day. As we walked through all of the famous 4/5 star hotels, we were even more appreciative of our luxurious accommodations at Ko Olina. We almost stayed at the JW Marriott which was nice, but not as nice as the Marriott Beach Club. We dined at one of the the JW Marriott's restaurants which overlooked the outdoor open shark tank. That was cool to watch! The Marriott Beach Club offers an ongoing complimentary shuttle service throughout the resort - it takes you to the JW Marriott, yacht club, and Roys Restaurant (highly recommended and extremely accommodating to vegetarians &/or special diets). The paved sidewalks are inviting if you're up for a stroll. Parking is tight, but you'll definitely need a car if you want to explore the island. Self-parking is charged to your room. When it's full, valet will park it for no extra charge. Be sure to double-check your bill at the end of you stay and request adjustment if necessary. Rent a car at the airport - I recommend bidding via Expedia. Do it in advance b/c car rentals do sell out (I was surprised!) All car rental co's have free shuttle pick-up from the airport (I was expecting ours would have a counter on-site, but it didn't). Check your home car insurance plan before you leave home to make sure the rental co doesn't scam you into buying extra insurance you don't need. We also packed our own portable Garmin Nuvi GPS which is very handy! We stayed Friday-Friday. Here's a sample itinerary that may be helpful. FRIDAY: check-in, trip to Safe-way Foods. Ask the produce staff rep to recommend some local fruits. The Hawaiian Gold pineapple is The Best! Much better than Dole. (Pssst... on your way back home, after you go through airport security you'll have time to shop at the airport gift shop. This is your only chance to buy a 3-pack pineapple to take home a taste of Hawaii. I wish we would have known!). SATURDAY: Visit timeshare concierge for Welcome Packet. Sign-up for 90-min preview later in the week. Explore resort. SUNDAY: If you plan to tour Pearl Harbor memorials, go early and pack snacks if you want to avoid buying mediocre food there. (You'll have to leave everything in the car. No purses or even diaper bags allowed - strictly enforced). Carry your wallet, camera, and a fleece with inside pockets if you get chilly early and have extra things you need to carry discreetly). We left the resort by 6:15am and got in line by 7am. The line grew by hundreds within a half hour - no joke! I'm not an early riser, but I was glad we took the advice of the concierge staff. USS Arizona tour is free. If you have time, I recommend taking a guided tour of the USS Missouri ship. It was pretty cool! These 2 tours took up the entire day, but it was worth it. MONDAY: Attend the free activity overview during the morning. Arrive early to get a seat and complimentary fruit juices/coffee/tea. Also register for free door prizes drawings. It gives you a taste of all amenities available during your stay. This would be a great day to enjoy the resort, take pictures at sunset, make reservations for dinner at Roy's (save room for desert). After dinner, take a dip in the hot tub while sipping on a frozen Mai Tai. TUESDAY: We set out for Polynesian Cultural Center. In the morning, stop by Dole Pineapple Plantation for the 1.5 hour tour. Buy your postcards and order a Whip desert (print coupons on-line before you go). Eat lunch there or pick out one of the food vendors along the beach road. While you're there, be sure to take time to pull off and park while you eat so you can watch the surfers. Keep your eyes peeled for whales in the distant see. Drive toward the Polynesian Cultural Center and plan to arrive between 2-3pm. There is a McDonald's next door in case you still need a quick snack. Don't get suckered into buying the higher priced VIP tickets or upgraded theatre seats - it's not worth the extra $. We ended arriving at PCC closer to 3:30 which meant we didn't have time for the IMAX which I was bummed about. Nonetheless, I'm not sure I don't think we would have wanted to stay for an entire full day. The luau buffet offered several vegetarian foods, but nothing spectacular. Hawaiians love there meat! Food was just okay - probably about the same as any luau, but without the adult beverages (PCP is alcohol-free). The purple poi rolls were my favorite - sweet like a potato roll. The night show was worth seeing! It's a pricey ticket, but you do get to see and learn a lot. Many gift shops to explore as well. WEDNESDAY: We went on the afternoon catamaran snorkel/dolphin tour. They gave us a free snorkel, provided lunch and 2 complimentary drink tickets (bring a little cash for tip - the service is worth it!). We Loved It! Take showers, grab a cocktail, and head down for the early evening free Fia Fia show on the lawn. Don't forget your raffle ticket they gave you in your welcome packet. THURSDAY: Take a drive on H-3 (the most scenic). Stop off at Hanama Bay (but I wouldn't bother paying to go down to the beach - you have better snorkeling at the resort). Been there, done that. Now drive toward Waikiki and stop off at some of the scenic spots along the way. If you want to see Waikiki, I recommend arriving and parking in time to avoid rush hour traffic b/t 3-7pm. Park, dine, shop, relax, explore the famous hotels like Ala Moana and Royal Hawaiian. You'll have an even greater appreciation for your decision to stay at Marriott Ko Olina Beach Club. The Hawaiian people are incredibly friendly. Have fun, wear sunscreen and enjoy your vacation.

We received a AAA rate that saved us a substantial amoujnt over booking two rooms elsewhwere. We arrived late at night and therefore had no issues with traffic or lines to check-in. Although it was night-time we knew we found something extraordinary. Our kids started to explore and scope out the resort resulting in a two thumbs up gesture. We were in a very comfortable modern one bedroom with a kitchen, dining and separate sleeping areas. We were lucky enough to land an ocean and pool view. The staff was friendly and courteous and our issue with an unworking ice maker was quickly resolved with a replacement refrigerator/freezer. The grounds were beautiful despite the on-going construction that we were aware of when we booked. Needless to say we are now owners of a two bedroom with a lock-off.

The fitness center was decent enough, and everyone was friendly - even though most were shilling timeshares. They ran out of parking one night, which was a hassle.

The room was excellent \u2013 clean (no bugs as mentioned in previous reviews), fresh towels every day, excellent utensils in the kitchen, two flat screen TVs, and a DVD player. My favorite part of Ko Olina is the lagoons. Lagoon number 4 is not so good but the three others are excellent. The sand is soft; the water is clear and warm. Lagoon number 2 is the best for snorkeling. There is a Sports Authority about 10 minutes away that has good prices on flippers and snorkel equipment. Other thoughts: 1. The pool water was a bit cold. 2. Self parking is definitely a problem \u2013 there are not enough spaces and they fill up fast in the evening 3. There is no hand cream in the room. Shampoo, conditioner and soap \u2013 but no hand cream. 4. Jelly fish arrive 10 days after a full moon. It is unwise to go into the lagoons while the jelly fish are there.

This resort is even more beautiful in person than any of the pictures I've seen online. The grounds are well-manicured and spread out over several acres, and its lagoon beaches are lovely. Ko Olina is close to a shopping area in Kapolei that has a Safeway, a large Starbucks, drugstore, several restaurants and fast food places, gas stations and other stores typically found in shopping plazas. In particular, we found the Hapa Grill a good place for lunch and dinner - it has a diverse menu and its prices are quite reasonable. The KOA Pancake House, which is located on the same side of the shopping plaza as the Hapa Grill, has fantastic pancakes and breakfast foods. There is another KOA Pancake House about ten miles down the road in Waipahu as well. Also in this shopping plaza is a Filipino place, I think it's called \"En Fuego,\" or something similar: be warned - when you walk in, it looks like a once-abandoned butcher shop, and the pictures of food are somewhat unattractive to the typical American. In contrast to the somewhat \"scary\" atmosphere, our food was excellent. We wandered in for breakfast (after KOA, we decided to try another place for variety) and ordered their Hawaiian pancakes with a side of katsu (deep-fried chicken). The pancakes were fantastic! As far as Ko Olina itself, it is about 19 or 20 miles from Honolulu. The drive is no big deal, although traffic can get a little heavy going into the city, especially during rush hour. The resort has these expensive-looking modern grills that owners and guests use for grilling, which is a great option! There is a nice Marketplace that carries Coldstone cakes and assorted mini-mart type food. Although the food is obviously more expensive than if you went to a regular grocery store (and what hotel convenience store isn't?), it does have a good variety of unique gifts that are quite reasonably priced. Buy your groceries at Safeway, and you won't complain about indulging in some overpriced ice cream! We recommend also purchasing souvenirs not just from the Ko Olina Marketplace, but also from the ABC stores. There must be seven of these stores within every two block radius in downtown Honolulu, and they have a decent selection of souvenirs, quality and otherwise. Views from the North Shore are incredible and it's worth the hour drive to other side of the island from Ko Olina. Realize, however, that there are some areas of the North Shore that people who do not have much money inhabit. Everyone on the island is not wealthy. We visited Matsumoto's for shaved ice, which was very good but not worth the drive in itself. You can get good shaved ice anywhere on the island. In all, we do not regret having spent more time exploring the island than on resort property, but do wish we had a few more days there so we could have lazed around all day just at the resort. Its pools and hot tubs are artfully designed to appear as natural lagoons surrounded by stones. They are truly stunning and entirely enjoyable. The beach sand is lovely, soft and hot, and the waters are calm due to their protection from the surf in man-made lagoons that surround the resort. Staff were professional, friendly and actually enthusiastic in many cases. We never met an unpleasant person on staff, it was beautiful. Our room was well-maintained, kudos to the cleaning staff. Although the resort was filled with people, it was always quiet and serene in our building, and the grounds never seemed noisy or crowded in the least.

We brought our 20-month-old son for a week in January and he had so much fun. The beach is on a sheltered lagoon, so it doesn't get the pounding surf that is so common in Hawaii. There are tons of pools, including a huge wading pool with sand at one end. Our little guy just loved the water, sand, beach, and sun. We were very happy with our room. We had a one bedroom villa and it was quite comfortable and spacious. Having our own full kitchen made mealtimes with a little one much easier than trying to eat out several times a day. The resort provided us with a crib and highchair, which were nice extras. The room had a huge master suite that could be completely shut off from the living space. This was great because we put the crib in the living room, and then after our son's bedtime, we could retreat to the master suite and take a bath, watch TV, etc., without worrying about waking him. I am very picky about cleanliness and felt the room was very clean and the housekeeping service did a thorough job. We did have daily housekeeping, however, which I understand the timeshare owners do not get. The resort's grounds are beautiful and very well-maintained. We felt the resort staff was very polite, friendly, and helpful. This was our third trip to Hawaii, and we felt this resort had one of the best staffs we have encountered there. My only other comment would be about the location. It is definitely not for everyone. The Ko Olina Beach Club is in a gated resort area. That area is very nice, but it's a gated resort. Once you leave the resort, there is not much to do in the immediate area. The town nearby (Kapolei) has strip malls with a Safeway, drugstore, fast food, and so on, but it doesn't offer much fine dining or nightlife. That was fine with us because we have a toddler, but I would not recommend this location for young singles or couples without kids. Yes, it is fairly close to Honolulu, but unless you don't mind sitting in miserable traffic, you probably won't want to make many trips from this resort to Honolulu.

It was absolutely beautiful! The rooms were so nice and homey and the pools, beach, etc were fantastic. I will agree with others though that the housekeeping was horrible....We were there on invitation to purchase into the timeshare and those who do or who rent directly from the hotel ARE supposed to have daily cleaning service....owners or people who rent from owners do not. I found this out after we had sand all over the carpet for two days and called to have it vacuumed. The employee was shocked the floors/tables were not being cleaned daily. On a good note, the dishes were washed and towels were replaced every day, with only one day where they forgot to come completely and I had to call for service at 5pm...With this, my one and only complaint out of the way, everything else was great! We loved using the BBQ's and eating outside. We stocked up at Safeway on food and drinks and saved a lot of money that way. There are also daily activities everyday like Bingo, tattooing, etc, just check your newsletter when you check in. Another tip is that if you don't want to pack or buy floaties or sand buckets, check the corner by the lagoon pool hut first thing in the morning for stuff to use. People (us and two other families for sure) leave things behind for others to use. There is a free Ko Olina shuttle bus that you can take from the Beach Club to the Marina, Paradise Cove Luau, Roy's, and the JW Hotel. We used that for the Luau which was wonderful, and Roy's which is a can't miss! I tried the four fish sampler and my husband had the shrimp & scallops (both sooo delicious)! For our daughter they have a kids three course presentation which was so nice...quesadilla first, then fruit & veggie crudite, and a choice of several main dishes. She had a lot of fun with the service...she had her own waiter too! I thought the ambiance would be a little tropical, which it wasn't, but the food and service made up for that. Another must do is North Shore and maybe lunch at the beach restaurant of Turtle Bay...beautiful. Make sure to bring your snorkels and bathing suits. We didn't because it was raining at our hotel, but blue skies on North Shore. The JW has a shark/ray pond which is fun to see...We had an awful lunch there though.

The pool areas are impressive and there are lots of waterfalls and 7 jacuzzis. We had a studio room which was ok for a short stay on the 15th floor. Most rooms have great views of the water, marina or mountains. . It was brand new but very poorly designed with no dinetet area and lots of wasted space. However that is where the kind words end. The property for being new had maintenance issues with the jacuzzis and elevators. The staff shortage first showed up at the front desk which had long lines the entire time we were there. It was raining during our stay so they had closed the restuarants. The only dining option was The Market Place convenience store which as a result was very picked over and had an express men of a hot dog $9, hamburger $10 fish sandwich $16. For a store for guests they actually had very little in room dining options. In addition to the restaurants being closed the bar was closed, the concierge /welcome center was closed,. the activity hut was closed, the pool bar was closed. The pool slide was closed. You see the trend. We chose to head off property to eat and found some nice restuarants. It was odd to be at a property in Hawaii that did not even have tropical drinks for guests. They must be having labor issues. Never have I stayed at a property this major that had no services available for their guests or owners. Presumably owners paid a lot of money for these timeshare units and boy are they not getting what they paid for at all!

I would say that for the most part we really liked our experience. The resort is BEAUTIFUL and very well maintained. The lagoons are great for swimming and snorkeling. The resort was at 96% capacity but it felt quiet and peaceful even with the sold out numbers. There was always beach chairs available and loungers at the pool as well. We never had trouble waiting for anything(restaurants, valet, towel service or pool side waitress). We really liked that it was far way from the hoards of people and shopping mecca's at Waikiki. Being at this resort really felt like we were totally on vacation. From our penthouse unit, we saw whales going by daily and unlike the previous poster, a owner unit comes with some perks. First of all, parking is only $5 for Valet and free if you park yourself. The posh Cabanas at the beach are only $5 and you get discounts at the restaurants as well. So, try to rent a week directly from an owner. I would agree that the beachside restaurant is mediocre at best. We had dinner at Chuck's and although it was expensive the service was great, portions hearty and it was delicious. We did all our shopping at the Safeway about 2 miles down the road for the rest of our meals. There are also BBq's available. I would say that you really do need a car to get to the store or travel around the island. We did take a day to tool around Oahu. I would recommend Giovanni's shrimp shack on the Northside, the Arizona tour(but go really early like 6AM to get in or you will wait for hours), the Aviation Museum, and Hawaiian Fire Surf Lessons only about 10 min from the resort. Our older kids loved the surf lessons! We also did the Fia Fia Luau on site and it was great to have this experience without having to leave the resort.

The Golf Course is very nice, but does not have the views or holes like Princeville or Kauai Lagoons.

It is worthwhile paying the upgrade to get better seating and the free drinks and you do not have to wait in line for food either.

We were there from Christmas day to New Years day. First off, the beaches were beautiful. Property is well manicured and everything looks wonderful from the outside. Room: We got a 1 bedroom villa, which was really nice. The room was big and it was definitely nice to have a kitchen and washer/dryer in the room. We also have a 18 month old toddler, so having the bedroom and living room separated was nice, since he goes to bed at 7pm. Cleanliness: The housekeeping does not clean your room completely everyday. They mainly tidy up your bed, rinse off the bathrooms, put the dishes in the dishwasher and occasionally vacuum. Our first night, we found a broken glass on the carpet by the kitchen and immediately called housekeeping to get it vacuumed the next day. I was furious because our toddler was running around barefoot and he could have stepped on it. When I called housekeeping, they just acted all surprised and kind of acted dumb. The next day, I had to call again to get the housekeeping to show up ASAP to vacuum the room. It was not until I actually talked to the housekeeping person on the same floor, that they would actually vacuum the room. Food: FLY INFESTED RESTAURANT WITH HORRIBLE, OVERPRICED FOOD at Kolohe's. Seriously, it was Denny's quality food for 5 x the price. Also Marriott's website claim you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at Kolohe's which is a mistake. They have breakfast buffets only on Fri, Sat and Sun. Which means, you are stuck with muffins and eggs from The Market Place or you have to cook your own food. Kolohe's don't open until 11am for lunch so you're pretty much screwed. (and forced to eat disgusting food) Service: The staff seem friendly at first but most have bad attitude or just act dumb. We had issues with our key cards not working the last 2 days. We had to go back and forth 3 times to get the door to open. Even when we call from our room to let them know that the door isn't working, they mention that they would send someone over and never did. Finally, we had to go down to the frost desk yet again and the lady there acts surprised and doesn't seem to recall that we just talked to her on the phone 30 min ago. Some of the concierge have attitude issues and were very unhelpful. When we called to arrange the hotel pick up at the airport, then called again to cancel, rather than them making the phone call to cancel, they gave us the phone number and told us to call and cancel on our own. Where is the customer service?? Price: They will seriously rip you off here if you don't have a car. Oh wait, even with a car, they will rip you off by charging you $26 per night to park. We didn't have a car at the beginning of our stay. The cab ride to safeway will cost you about $30 one way and if you use the transportation service they recommend (VIP service), they will charge you $42 one way just to go 5 min. So basically, you're stuck spending money at either Kolohe's or at the Market place if you try to cook your own food, or you will have to spend $60 just to get to Safeway on a cab. The Market Place only has things like eggs, cheese and milk if you want to cook anything. They have other minor things like can food and microwave popcorn, ketchup and mustard. Go to Safeway immediately and get some food, if you can. Or bring lots of food & household goods from home. We will never stay here again. Disney actually bought nearby property and will be building more resorts here. The beaches are beautiful and the water was calm so it's great for family with little kids.

I actually started laughing because I could not see ANY water. Not even a pool. OK so with discussions from a manager, Mark, he \"did me a favor\" and did get me a room where I could see a sliver of water. The bell man never showed up to move my bags. I did it myself. After struggling for 2 nights in the new room on a sagging damp mattress with broken sides I did call the desk and they did send up a new one. But AGAIN: this should not have happened to begin with. When one is paying hundreds of dollars a night for a room, they should make sure the furnishings are top notch. The furnishings of these rooms are getting very tired. The room suffered from side to side as well as noise from above. When I called the desk for late checkout I was threatened with a 75 dollar fee and room key cut off. Bad attitude with a sing songy voice from Emily. I could not get into my room until 4 but they wanted me out by 10. In the end I won the argument. But when you are paying hundreds of dollars a night you should not be having such arguments, ESPECIALLY when in the end a late checkout WAS possible. You must rent a car to stay here. It';s an 80 dollar cab ride and there is no public transportation. Also you would be captive to their \"company town\" restaurants and Mini-Market paying extortionist prices for small crappy products. So they screw you for 27 dollar a night parking! Total rip off. Of course the pools appear nice and the beaches were immaculate. But that to me is to be EXPECTED. How would I fix this place? FIRE HALF THE PEOPLE.

My wife and I have two Marriott time share properties in Florida and Las Vegas. We traded one of our timeshares for a one-bedroom villa at the KoOlina resort. We really like Marriott because there is a consistent high quality to all of their resorts. KoOlina is no exception. First the service. We were welcomed graciously at the front door, the front desk and the valet who brought our luggage to our room. Each day we were greeted by every employee, whether passing in the hall, in the elevator or at any of the desks (front, consierge, pool side , valet or restaurants). The villa was equally impressive - a large bedroom with a comfortable king bed. The bedroom had it's own terrace (lanai) fwith a view of the mountains and down to the lagoon pool. The living room had a large pull out couch, two large chairs a TV and a wide terrace facing the ocean. The dining room sat 6. We were on the 8th floor at the end of the buiding and had catheral ceilings throughout the villa. The rooms had digital AC/Heat controls and also large ceiling fans - so we were able to keep the villa at a very comfortable temperature. There was a kitchen with granite countertops, side by side refridgerator, stove, microwave and dishwasher. The grounds are kept pristine. There are lagoons with fish, two swimming pools with a beach area for children. There is also a lagoon right on the ocean. It is shaped like a horseshoe with the narrow end by the ocean. The ocean waves break before coming into the lagoon so it is great for swimming, snorkeling, or just floating in the water. KoOlina is a full service resort that is at least a half hour by car from Honolulu. The good news is that it has everything onsite needed to have a great vacation. The bad news is that if you want to do sightseeing, the resort is a distance from everywhere. It took 45 minutes to drive to the North Shore where the surfing contests were (25-30 foot waves). Honolulu was a half hour drive without traffic. During the morning and evening rush hours, that time doubles - traffic is a nightmare. Waikiki Beach (40 minutes away) is worth the trip. It's the Rodeo Drive of Hawaii - you see people walking past stores in bikinis and carrying surf boards. At the KoOlina resort, we ate at Chuck's Steak and Seafood restaurant. There is an included salad bar that was so-so. My wife and I both had the sirloin steaks which were very good. There is a mushroom side order that I would highly recommend (whole mushrooms in a rich brown sauce). We also had lunch at the cafe on the beach - sitting at oceanside. Food was very good. Overall, KoOlina is a first class resort - with friendly, helpful staff and exceptional facilities.", "Date": "December 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "United States", "Title": "\u201cHome away from home\u201d", "Author": "AnotherOpinion", "ReviewID": "UR22300457", "Content": "My family and I recently visited this resort and had a wonderful experience. This was our sixth trip to Hawaii and our first to Oahu. We chose this resort because we needed accommodations for a family of four and did not want to stay in Waikiki. We stayed in a beautifully decorated one bedroom \"villa\" which was just right for us. We had a full kitchen and an in-room washer and dryer which was most convenient. There are numerous outdoor barbecue grills that may be used by guests who so choose. The grounds are spacious and the beaches are sheltered which was perfect for the kids and adults alike. We also enjoyed the pools, which were lushly landscaped and kid-friendly. A plethora of daily on-site activities are listed, however we chose to explore the island on our own. The resort is about 30 minutes from the beautiful windward side of the island and 40 minutes from the north shore. Honolulu and Waikiki are about 35-40 minutes away, but beware heavy traffic at rush hour. We chose to dine in the room and at simple local restaurants and can recommend Hapa Grill, KOA pancake house, and L&L Drive Inn all about 10 minutes away for family fare. Everyone we met in the service industry was wonderful, from hotel staff to rental car staff to waitstaff at local restaurants.

Either the Marriott pays people to say nice things or there are more people out there that are elitists who are so blind that they can not see the seething underbelly of a company that utilizes practices where the staff are indentured servents. Perhaps the fake landscape and the piped in scents have eroded your humanity and you can not see that the staff are only nice to you because if they are not nice and as fake as the landscape then they will have to join the increasingly larger population of homeless lining the beaches. First, I do not trust the Marriott as there was a gimmick everytime we turned around. It started after I booked the trip and bought the plane ticket. I had purchased a package deal and was never told that there would be additional charges. In all, I was charged 25% of the package cost in additional charges. I couldn't do anything because I had already paid and bought the ticket. But it felt unfair. We get to HI and I will say that Ko Olina was beautiful, initially. Beautiful flora and pools, nice smells and decent rooms. The staff are absolutely wonderful and everything is taken care of. So that is the initial impression and the elitists that love that place and will go back again apparently were only capable of seeing that. Marriott is all about keeping all the money at the Marriott. If you do not book everything through the Conceirge then you will have to deal with the local people trying to make a buck (who can blame them) and pay even higher prices for a fake tour that has been so sanitized that you never get to take in the culture and ambiance of HI. Then we sat through the presentation which is not high pressure but asked to speak to a manager because we were astounded at the seediness of the Marriott. We sat down with a manager who said the following (I am not lying here and I was stunned). They do not like white people here on the island. We have built all these homeless shelters but they just won't go into them, they stay on the beaches and we are trying to push them further north. Stay away from the camps. I was so stunned and never before in my life have I been so ashamed at being white. This man came to HI, was part of the massive commercialization that has raised prices so high that the people of the Island can no longer afford to live in a home on their own island. This same man and the Marriott have convinced people of the Island that this indentured servitude is good for them because it gives them a job and benefits and if they do not do everything they are told then they will have nothing. That this man would think that I am part of his hatred and prejudice. After that we went to the \"complimentary breakfast\" the next day. Now first off, I have never stayed anywhere that the complimentary breakfast was not offered daily. Here it is Sunday and Monday. So we get our plates together and start to eat when the staff person comes to us and says that is the buffett and will be $13.99. I said the sign said it was on the first floor she said that was right but they had to move it. So I was offered the choice of paying or watching this food being thrown away. I was sickened by this cavilier attitude towards waste. I was already stunned that there isn't any recycling beng done. So we paid. Then the next day we saw the complimentary breakfast. People had to listen to a presentation to sell more stuff for over an hour so they could have a free half muffin and fruit with coffee and juice. With the Marriott, there is a catch for everything. They are slimy. Places like the Marriott take from the people and the land and give nothing back that does not serve them. Those who associate with this company are no different. One more thing, if you are as outraged as I am, please donate to a reputable charity in HI that serves the people of the Island and the many, many homeless that have resulted from white greed and avarice. Then I implore you to be as awakened as we were and support the homeless in your local community.

We purchased the vacation through a fund raising event on a whim so we weren't quite sure what were getting ourselves into. Other reviews on this resort were very helpful, so we thought we would return the favor. Bottom line, we had a great time and wished we could stay longer. Here are some more details: Facility: The grounds are beauitful. We enjoyed both pools and the shaved ice you can purchase at \"The Maze\" Hut. There is a nice walking path that runs along the lagoons and connects to the JW Marriott. Good for running or walking. Hotel Room: We stayed in a 1 room villa on the first floor. No view except a peek of the golf course over the wall. Not a big deal. We didn't spend a lot of time in the room anyway. The room iteself was awesome. It was big and luxurious for 2 people. There was a full kitchen, stocked with dishes, flatware, utensils, pots and pans etc. Everything you would need if you want to save some money on food and cook yourself. There was also a washer and dryer which was nice. They even have a \"starter kit\" filled with a box of detergent for one load. If you can upgrade to a villa from a lockout , I would highly recommend it. Con on the room: The pillows were a bit flat. Activities: We were given a chance to \"pre-book\" some activities before we arrived for a slight discounted price. We booked the \"Fia Fia\" luau and an afternoon snorkel trip on the Ko'Olina Cat. (Catamaran). The luau was fun and entertaining. Food was good. The Ko'Olina Cat was by far our favorite activity. We did it on our last day there and we would have gone on a second trip if we had time. The afternoon trip offers more of a chance to snorkel. We saw several sea turtles and lots of fish. The water was warm and the staff on the boat were great. They guarentee that you will see dolphins or you get to come back for free. We actually didnt see any, which they said is rare so we got a ticket for a free trip on the boat next time we come (good for 2 years). Food: We took a trip to Safeway (exit 1B on H1) and bought breakfast food and snacks to save a little money. We did eat at Chucks which was just ok for us. I ordered a steak and thought it was a little fatty. Salad bar was good. Our favorite was Roy's. The service and food were both excellent. Pricey but worth it. There are grills on the hotel grounds (nice ones) if you want to BBQ on your own. Misc. Rent a car. The hotel is 20-ish miles from the airport and if you want to do any sight seeing around the island you will need it. We made a day trip to the North Shore, saw Pearl Harbor, and went out to dinner one night in Waikiki (fun shopping there). Self Parking at the hotel costs $21 a day, more if you do valet. Watch your speed on the highways. Lots of cops out there and weird speed limits in places. If you want to take home chocolate covered macadamia nuts, try Walmart. There is one in Pearl City. They come in cases w/ 6 boxes each in them which was nice. We brought 2 cases home.

When we first stayed there we thought it was amazing, unfortunately this time we were not as impressed.. Location: For many this is a negative, but I enjoy the remote location. It is close enough to go into Waikiki for dinner and an easy drive to the N shore. I love the lagoons and snorkeling. Check in: Quick and easy, bellman brought our bags to our room even though we opted for Self Park. Which leads me to parking\u2026the spaces are so small even with a midsize car it was a squeeze and there isn\u2019t a sufficient amount of parking spaces. Room: We were in a 2BR in the Kona (original) tower. It was a Penthouse; it had high ceilings and an extra balcony off the Master BR. The view was called Mountain, which was actually Marina and some of the power plant in the background. All in all the view was not bad. For some reason when I stay here, due to the layout, I feel like I am constantly walking around in circles! The 2BR is spacious, although sleeping 8 would IMO be a little tight. The beds are not as comfortable as they used to be and the pillows could use replacing. We also had a roach infestation, yes it is Hawaii and I can handle a few bugs but not larvae on the stove and floor\u2026Engineering came and set bait but it took a few days before it did any good and even then we still found a couple of dead ones each morning\u2026YUCK! My biggest pet peeve with this property is there are no screens on the windows and doors. In the weekly activity guide there is mention of mosquitoes and they ask you to keep doors closed, but with the trade winds blowing, I would really rather not sleep with the AC on. Marketplace: Convenient for snacks and prices on some basic groceries were not too bad. We bought the mug that gives you unlimited coffee, tea and sodas. I am an iced tea drinker so I refilled it constantly, plus you can take to Kolohe\u2019s and have it refilled. We like iced coffee, so we would fill in the evening for the next morning. Dining: The prices for food and drinks at Kolohes have increased significantly in the last year or 2. But it is convenient and the food is pretty good. It is a great place for sunset and a mai tai. Mario makes great drinks, a couple of the other bartenders use well when the recipe calls for top shelf. We did not eat at Chucks. Roys is our favorite, yes it is pricey but you can do pretty well having appetizers and salad. The JW also has a few dining options which are pretty good. Pool and Beach: Didn\u2019t use the pools at all this trip but spent most of our time at lagoon 3 or snorkeling 1 and 2. There were a lot of families and kids Sat-Mon but the rest of the week it felt less crowded. The construction was not a problem, the newest building looks to have some amazing views and a great pool.

We had views also of the marina which was nice. We had 2 full showers, one was a normal shower/ tub combo. I think you only get 2 full showers in the \"accessible\" room. 2 showers is great with a family of 4. We had a problem the 1st night with the AC. It kept kicking off & on all night.

Our 5 yr. old slept in the reading nook area on the little yellow couch. She had plenty of room. We just used the bedding meant for the sofabed. Our 8 yr. old slept on the rollaway, which was free & we are not owners. The Marriott website says no rollaways allowed, but call the hotel directly & you will be able to get one. The kids both slept in the reading nook area. There is no curtains in that area so we hung a blanket on the window and kept the room divider open for ventilation. We went to the free torch lighting ceremony at the hotel. They only have it once a week on Tuesdays. We all had a great time. The show lasted about 45 minutes.

We had a full kitchen that was well stocked, a dining room table that sat six, living room area for the kids to sleep in, a small sitting area that led into the bedroom which had a king sized bed. Everything was well decorated and plenty big enough for us. The kitchen came in handy. On the first night we went to the market and stocked up and avoided paying the usual high costs of breakfast and lunch at the resorts. Also, although we didn't use them they had grills for making steaks, burgers, etc. that were in the common areas. The resort itself was very nice. There are two pools, one with sand on one end which my younger daughter loved playing in. The lagoons are well protected making for easy swims. The lagoons are almost too well protected, since it doesn't feel like you're in the ocean. Our kids like playing in the waves, but there weren't any waves. There are two restaurants at the resort, Chuck's which is a steakhouse and Koheles (not sure I'm spelling that right). Chuck's was a pretty standard restaurant with steak and fish. Koheles has a buffet on Friday and Saturday night. The buffet was pretty standard (crab, prime rib, chicken, etc.) but one good thing they had for kids was a special kids table at the buffet with mac & cheese, chicken nuggets, PB&J and jello. We thought that was a nice touch. The Ko Olina area also has a Roy's at the golf course and a few restaurants at the JW Marriott. There's a shuttle that runs around the resort area which we took a couple times which comes in handy. Couple random items: Ko Olina is very isolated which has it's positives and negatives. We spent one day in Waikiki and it was just a big city with a nice beach but not very quiet. If you want to get away from everything, Ko Olina is a good option but if you want to be in the middle of everything this is not for you. This is very much a family resort. There were kids everywhere, so if you want to be at an adult resort again this is probably not the best place. The staff was very friendly and helpful at all times. The concierge helped with reservations for dinner and booked the Ko Olina Cat for a dinner sail which was great. Although there is construction next door on a new tower, the hotel is already done so we didn't hear anything the whole time we were there. There is some mild airplane noise (not in the rooms but outside). Both commercial and military jets seem to fly over quite a bit. We thought the resort was nice, and if you can live with the few items we mentioned you'll have a great time here.

I was so impressed with the valet parking...it is expensive ($25/day vs $20/day for self parking) but we always had our car when we requested and the valet parkers were always willing to carry up items to our room...they were so nice! The room itself was a 1 bedroom villa and it was gorgeous. We were on the 5th floor overlooking the pool. We could see a bit of the ocean as well. The grounds are spectacular and so much nicer than the JW Marriott hotel down the way. We rented a cabana one day which was a fabulous way to spend the day. They brought around little drinks of water and towelettes occasionally. I love the fact that you can leave the cabana, go back to your room for lunch etc and the cabana is always untouched and ready for you when you get back (no worries that it will be given away). We had dinner one night at Chucks and the service was incredible as was the food. We used our \"marriott dollars\" we were given for attending the timeshare presentation and it paid for our dinner ($100). The presentation in and of itself was fine. When we signed up for this trip in October I was working just about full time in the Mortgage Industry....we all know how well that is going right now, so we knew that buying a timeshare was not an option. Aaron was our presentor and he tried very hard to make the presentation pleasant even knowing full well that we would not be purchasing. It was not a hard sell but I did sense that his conversations with us were scripted or just over-used. I am sure it is not an easy job to sell these to people but he could have smiled more (if you are reading this Aaron....you have a great smile...you should share it!) and it would have made us and anyone sitting through one of these presentations relax a bit more. Oh well....it worked out just fine. My only complaints were the oceanside bar and grill left a lot to be desired. The drinks were extremely expensive and I really didn't think my Mai Tai was all that great. We ordered the combo appetizer plate and it was also not that tasty. Our waitress seemed a bit annoyed when we finished and asked for our check...she kept saying \"are you sure you don't want another drink? You really want to leave????\" . I loved everything else. Did I mention how friendly everyone was? Patrick down at the beach services booth gave us an awesome map and outlined a trip around the island for us..even giving us some great LOST scenes to check out (the TV show). He was kind enough to write his cell number down on the map in case we got lost or had any questions. The drive around the island ended up being one of our favorite memories of the trip.

The suite had nice wood trim and high recessed ceilings. The staff was very friendly and helpful. This resort has one main beach lagoon with (chairs & cabanas) and two other lagoons leading down a path to a hotel on the same development, the JW Mariott.

One of the pools has a beach shallow end for small children . Nice. There are two restaurants onsite . Chucks ( pretty nice) with veiws of the ocean at sunset. The laggon , casual with even better veiws of the ocean. And I will say that the Mai Tai drink I had at the lagoon bar was the best drink I have ever had. Gotta try it. Anyway my kids loved it. It never seemed that crowed even at 100 % occupancy. We went on the sunset cruise w/ Koolina cat. We went on horseback rides at Turtle Bay, shopping at north shore , swam w/ the dolphins at sea life park , visited Pearl Harbor and snorkled in Hanauma Bay. Two great activities right at the resort were the Fia Fia Luah . ( Worth every cent) and my familys favorite activity the star gazer night.

The resort is new and the furnishings top notch. Now that we've gotten the \"4 Seasons/Ritz Carlton\" itch scratched (see previous reviews), we've found that our travel style really meshes nicely with a semi resort/semi condo style facility. We absolutely loved the full kitchen and washer/dryer in our extremely spacious unit. There is nothing like making a leisurely breakfast for the kids while we eased into our day. It's away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Honolulu/Waikiki, but seriously, it's less than a half hour drive to get to that part of town. We prefer to commute in to visit those areas and relax in our little paradise at Ko'Olina. The staff was not up to par with Four Seasons staff, but that's to be expected given this price point. None the less, almost every staff person we interacted with was very nice and helpful. We liked the kids pool, and now with Phase III of constuction under way, we understand that the water slide and lazy river is not too far off. As for dining, it's walking distance to some world class restaurants (Roys, Azul, etc.) but the price point for these is not for the faint of heart. For those who'd rather save their money for activities, there is a neighborhood strip mall about 3 miles away that has everything from fast food to some decent restaurants that cater more to the locals than to tourists. But the prices are great (1/4 what you'd pay at the resorts), and the food was seriously good. There's also a supermarket so that you can stock up your kitchen with the essentials (think beer, water, snack foods, fruits, etc.) Parking is very convenient. Self parking is very near and they also do valet if you are so inclined. We've been coming to the Ko'Olina resort area for years because of the wonderful lagoons. If you have small children, this is a \"must visit\" location on Oahu. We're talking perfect lagoons without waves! If your kids are a little older, there are some good beaches to visit that are just a short drive away. The Bad- The restaurants directly on property still need a little work. The little grill by Lagoon 3 is good, but the prices are a little steep for what you get. Not bad for lunch. We didn't go to Chuck's steak and seafood so I can't comment on that. Pool service also needs a little work. After watching the scene for some time, I came to realize that because there are so many families, there tends to be very little heavy drinking going on. So if you're far away from the bar, it does take some time for the server to get to you, if at all. This was easily remedied with a nice tip after our first round. After that, we saw the server quite frequently. The Ugly- I think I still need to get used to the Condo style of chamber service/housekeeping. Our housekeeping service was very late in coming on two days so we passed (kids were sleeping). We could have complained, but we were so happy with everything else that I was mellowed out anyway so no big deal. She took out our garbage and gave us fresh towels. Conclusion - We've been doing the lavish vacations for about 6 years now and are starting to scale back a little. We still like luxery and fine appointments, but we could do without the snobbery and stratospheric restaurant prices. We'll gladly pay high prices for high value (e.g., superb dining experience, fantastic foods, etc.), but not for something that's simply a hotel cafe (as we found in some of the more expensive resorts.) We found that the Marriott has created something here that hit us just right. We had tons of space for our growing family (1 bedroom villa), still had some \"wow\" factor in the room appointments and resort amenities, and had a kitchen and washer/dryer. We will definitely be back in the years to come.

We loved getting a good lunch and a number of Mai Tai's at Kolohe's bar and grill which is right on the beach. Chucks Seafood and Steaks is also very good and prices were not bad. I like the walkway that goes around all four lagoons in Ko Olina. One way is a mile and a half walk, and was perfect for walking off dinner, or going to explore one of the other lagoons. The JW Marriott is at the other end of the walkway and has several great restaurants. If you like sushi, then Ushio Tei at the JW is a must. There was still some construction going on, but we barely even noticed it. The staff at the resort was great, and you cannot miss the \"luau\" on Tuesdays called Fia Fia.

Unfortunately we had three days of rain and clouds so we could not fully enjoy the resort and all it had to offer. Ko Olina was very far from Honolulu and Waikiki but that was one of the reasons that we chose it. We wanted to experience Oahu but without the hustle and bustle of the city. Because of the rain, there was little to do around the resort so we did do a far bit of driving into the city to keep us busy. If it would have been sunny we would have taken advantage of the beautiful pool and lagoons on the property and probably would not have left much. We stayed in a mountain view penthouse which was a very nice room and large bathroom. There was a small welcome gift box that offerred a variety of items including popcorn, sample detergent, etc. We did eat at the pool side restaurant, Kolohe's, for the breakfast buffet and once for dinner. The breakfast buffet was pricy but the omelet station was delicious and we ate enough that we did need to eat lunch. We also ate at the steakhouse which was also expensive but good. The small marketplace at the resort also had a variety of snacks and drinks as well anything you may have forgotten at home. The property was well maintained but I was a bit disappointed with some of the ponds. Maybe once all the construction is completed they will fill them with Koi. The construction was not an issue during our stay. We did not hear it or really see it but it was just days after Christmas and rained the entire stay. The pool was nice although too cold during our stay to use. We did use the hot tubs several times. The JW is the neighbor property and a nice stroll down a beach side path. They had sting rays and beautiful fish in their ponds and were worth the walk to see. Overall, a great property! We would have liked it more if our weather was better.

We were traveling for the purposes of relaxation and were less interested with night life and sightseeing, although we did make it to a few places. Overall, we were very impressed with Ko Olina, I'm hoping this review will be helpful Rooms: We stayed in the guest room which is the lock off portion of a time share unit. We were traveling on a time share promotion and while it is sometimes possible to upgrade to the one bedroom unit, we were unable to do this. The lock of portion of the unit was just fine. It was spacious, with a queen size bed, seating area wtih couch, end tables, coffee table, chair and TV. There was also a balcony. While you probably won't get an ocean view with this promotion, ask for a room facing some greenery, because \"mountain view\" may mean you overlook a parking lot. The beds have a plush down comforter, decent sheets and plenty of pillows. Very comfy. There is also a small kitchen type area with a refridgerator, microwave, toaster, coffee maker and silverware,bottle opener, etc. There are also glass plates, paper towels, etc. The bathroom is a nice size with a curved shower rod for more space in the shower. Food: Everything is VERY expensive in Hawaii. There is a very limited selection of dining options at Ko Olina. There is a beach side grill (Kolohes), a steak and seafood restaurant (Chucks), a Roy's across the other side of the resort near the golfing, and Azul, fancy/upscale pricy restaurant at the Marriott Ilihani down the way. Our best meal was by far the breakfast buffett offered at Kolohes each morning from 7-10am or so. Its all you can eat for 17.50 and has made to order omelettes, oatmeal, fresh fruit, granola, yogurt, waffles with fruit toppings, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage patties, pastries, bagels, you name it. This was delicious. We also tried the standard Kolohes dinner food and it was okay. Kolohes has an all you can eat buffett on Fri/Sat evenings with crab legs, prime rib, pork tenderloin, lobster pasta, desserts, etc. This was 37 dollars a person, and it was good, but we enjoyed the breakfast more. After our few meals, we went to the local Safeway and stocked up with groceries for the room. We had plenty of room in our fridge for groceries and there are cabinets to store food. This is a great way to travel on a budget b/c dining out at Ko Olina is not cheap. We also tried Duke's in Waikiki - this was delicious, and you must go to Leonard's Bakery in Waikiki to try the Malasadas (a donut), out of this world! Beach/Pool: Ko Olina has several ocean lagoons (4), we spent most of our time at number 3 as this is where the most activity is. There are beach toys for rental such as snorkel equipment, boogie boards, peddle boats, etc. The beach is well maintained and very pretty. Compared to the Caribbean, it is not nearly as pretty, but the water was clear, sand soft, and its very scenic with the rock piles out at sea. Great place for kids to swim as it is roped off before you get out too far into the ocean and the waters are very calm, no waves. There were always plenty of chairs but no shade. If you walk to lagoon 2 nearer the Ilihani, there are some standing umbrella type things on their beach for shade. You can use any of the four lagoons so I recommended checking them all out as some are more quiet than others. The water was just right. As for the pool, the kids seemed to love it. No slides or anything yet, but I hear that is in the plans. Service: The staff at Ko Olina are friendly and the service was well above average, it was super. Everyone was kind and willing tto help. The concierges went above and beyond to give you directions and assist with planning activities. Activities: On Monday night the hotel held a Mai Tai party on the lawn (tickets were given for free at check it), this was great. A time for the guests to mingle, good drinks, and they had BBQ pork sandwhiches and snacks. We also visited the North Shore (I was not impressed) and the Dole Plantation. If you are a pineapple fan, you must visit. This was unique and fun. We went into Waikiki for a day, the beach is crystal blue, and looks quite different from the waters at Ko Olina, very big waves, lots of surfers and sight seeing. Its crowded, but worth a visit to the beach and restaurants on the strip. Once you park, you can walk to just about everything. Overall, we had a great time. Ko Olina is secluded and not much going on at night, but a short drive to Waikiki will offer more to do if that's what you are looking for. The sales presentation was low pressure and didn't hurt our trip one bit, no big deal. The grounds are beautiful and I liked this hotel much better than the Ilhani (we just visited it for a bit while walking), but ours felt newer and the pool was much nicer for kids. Take walk to the Ilihani and check out the huge sting rays in their waters inside the resort, very cool. As for the construction, we did not notice it. I'd be happy to answer questions.

There is a Roys at the golf course (which we didn't try) and some more upscale choices at the JW Marriott (walking distance along the lagoon path).

There are 4 protected lagoons on the entire complex with a lovely walking trail winding along the shoreline. It's a very easy walk on a wide paved path--wheel chair accessible. The entire complex is gated and you feel very secure. The lagoons provide good snorkling and swimming. The pools are gorgeous, much nicer than the photo on the website showed in March. There are wonderful hibiscus everywhere, orchids in the palms, plumeria, and so much more. One of the pools has a nifty sandy area at one end that is very shallow and good for even the smallest tots. There are some great activities for kids and a wonderful show called Fia Fia you will love. Early in the week there is a juice punch/mai tai/snacks evening activity to get you familiarized with the resort and give you a taste of the Fia Fia show. This is free and a must go. Another new building with an incredible pool for kids and kids at heart opens in 2008. I can hardly wait to take my grandkids back! The six of us fit very nicely in the main unit with a fold out couch in the living room, a king bedroom and the two little ones in an enclosed lanai type area.

The weather is better at this end of the island than it is in Honolulu. Not so cloudy when there are clouds in Honolulu and gentle evening breezes. There is nightly live music at the beachside grill and even a few dancers on some nights. It is not a long drive into Honolulu if you want to sample the nightlife or go to a restaurant there.

Ko Olina just has a friendlier feel and most people are ready to chat for a while or joke around in the elevator or at the grill. The flea market at the stadium is easy to get to and much more fun than the International Marketplace in Honolulu. It just isn't as neat anymore and prices are much better at the flea market.

It's pretty much a straight shot down H1 to get there - anyone can handle it. Yeah, there's some traffic in Honolulu, but we managed ok. It was just my wife, me and my 21 month old daughter on this trip. We had a one bedroom, which was plenty of space to spread out. In fact, there was a small room off of the master bedroom which also had access to the living room that served as an excellent place to put the crib for my daughter! It was perfect so that once she went to bed, we could be in the bedroom, living room, or both/either and not disturb her. The room was furnished very nicely. I think the resort is about 5 years old and we stayed in the oldest tower. Either the room was recently renovated or there is no wear to speak of. We asked and were lucky enough to be moved from a third floor room right above the designated smoker's area to the 6th floor (of 14) at the end. We could see the sunrise AND sunset. Awesome! The pools were nice (a bit cold perhaps?) and there is a zero entry kids pool with a sand like substance that many kids loved (mine didn't). We stayed March 8-16, the week before Easter week and we never had to look for more than a few minutes for a good spot under an umbrella at either of the pools. Same story at the Lagoon. There are also 4 hot tubs at the resort, one for adults only, one for younger kids, and 2 where both kids and adults are allowed. We only ate at the poolside restaurant, which was typical resort: limited choices, expensive, but good enough food. We are vegetarians and the choices were limited for us. We're used to that, though. The lagoons near the resort and surrounding areas are nice - but very man made. If you love nature, this will seemed contrived and \"Americanized\". But to get an area where one can swim, snorkel, etc on this part of the island, it was necessary. I didn't spend much time there as my daughter preferred the pool. There is a 3-4 mile paved walking path near this lagoon, though, that was excellent. Walking, strollers, jogging are all easily done. It feels safe, secure and very very pleasant as the grounds are well maintained and the ocean is within shouting distance. It was one of the best parts of the resort, in my opinion. There was construction during our stay, but it honestly did not affect us one bit. When we bought our timeshare in Aruba in late 2006, there was construction there. It was not a problem but was more intrusive in Aruba than Ko Olina. There was also a shopping center about 3 miles away where there was everything you'd need from a small selection of restaurants, pharmacy and a grocery store. Bottom line, this is a very comfortable, Americanized, \"safe\" resort. If you like the Marriott properties and the things they do best, you'll like this resort.", "Date": "March 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis", "Title": "\u201cNice resort out in the boonies\u201d", "Author": "ksassy", "ReviewID": "UR14128794", "Content": "The Ko'Olina is a nice resort with man-made lagoons for swimming and OK snorkelling.

I actually used it to read a little while my husband was still sleeping and the kids were sleeping in the living room (in-laws took the 2nd bedroom). I was able to close the doors to the sitting area shutting off the living room and the master and had the little room to myself to curl up on the huge seat and read in peace. The resort was a good size. It was at 100% capacity, but it didn't feel like it. There was plenty of room at the pool and the beach. The beach is beautiful. The lagoons keep the waves away and it's easy for the kids to splash around without worrying. As for restaurants, this is where I feel it lacks. There are only 2 on the grounds, unless you walk up the beach walk 1.5 miles to the hotel, they have 4 or 5. The 2 restaurants are Koelho's (good breakfast buffet), the Fri & Sat Prime Rib & Seafood buffet can't be missed...great crab legs and lots of other dishes to choose from. Chuck's Steak House is the other. This was just OK. Nothing to write home about. With the construction going, they will be adding more restaurants and some shopping. The construction was not distracting at all to us during the day. You hear in the background some beeping and the hum of the machines, but there's no loud banging or anything like that.

You can freely use any of the 4 lagoons, although, the one to the East is a public lagoon, with a few more patrons.

There is construction continuing on the 3rd building which you could hear while sitting on the beach but the sound of the ocean helped to block out the noise. Our 2 bedroom unit was very spacious and tastefully furnished. Several bulbs burned out in the bathrooms but the problem was solved immediately. We had mid week tidy service. Activites were plentiful although most were not free. One could not possibley get bored. The Welcome Mai Tai party was fun and entertaining. I'm not sure if this was for owners only. The fitness center and locker rooms were clean. The restaurants (2) on the premises were good and the Ilihani was a 10 minute walk around the lagoons offering 4 more for variety. The only downside we saw was the pools - too small. I can't imagine during the summer at full occupancy that those 2 pools could accomodate the numbers. The upside - January 2008 - the third building will be finished with a huge pool with slide. I think that will attract most families and take the pressure off the 2 originals. The 4th building will not be finished unitl 2010 with an all adult pool with swim bar. Can't wait for that!!!!! The resort will provide transportation to the local grocery store (Safeway) so you don't have to spend alot of $ at the MarketPlace which isn't totally outrageous in price. We had the use of all the Marriott Ilihani's amenities. The Tennis Garden is located on the rooftop of their parking garage and was a bargain for $36.00/wk for unlimited play. One never has to leave the premises to have an enjoyable and relaxinfg vacation.

As an owner at the Marriott's Aruba Surf Club, I had only high standards in mind for this property as well. We stayed in the larger side of the unit so we had kitchen and laundry facilites. The room was clean and well decorated. Our air conditioning was a problem but they attended to it quickly. I wa disappointed that when they did our weekly tidy service (the one you get for free) they did not change the linens as they do in Aruba. They would have for an extra chargeI later found out. They also took our dish towels and never replaced them and we had bad blender. However all of this was fixed quickly. The staff was extremely friendly. Some were not so knowledgeable though about the restaurants and what they serve. You truly are on a rather remote part of the island so you are limited to going back and forth between the JW and the Ko Olina to shop or eat unless you have a car. We did but found that venturing out for the two days we did was worth it but having to deal with the traffic was not. My fiance' plays golf and was in heaven playing many of the courses. I sat by the lagoon and did a few spa treatments at the JW. We highly reccomend that you go to Roy's for dinner. We also enjoyed theseafood buffet at the Kohele (sp?) it's the restauant at the Ko Olina that looks out onto the water. We had breakfast there as well one morning and also at the JW one morning. We heard great things about Azul's but didn't get to try it. I missed being able to just walk to different places outside the property like we can in Aruba. But did love the trail that runs between the two properties for exercising on or taking a walk on after dinner. We loved Hawaii, weren't too thrilled with Oahu. We didn't realize it lacked some of the lushness and exotic scenery that the other islands provide. It's there but you need to take a drive to the other side of the island to find it. We ended up buying a time share in Kauai because it has the above mentioned scenery and the ability to walk to things. But we also know that Marriott has great properties so we take trust in that. We are a couple in our early 40's without kids. There were families with little ones on board as well as older couples so a good mix. Construction was never an issue. It's happening all around not just at the Ko Olina.

We had been stowed in the construction wing-one worker actually confided that they often put East coasters there because we tend to wake up earlier, due to the time difference, and dont notice the work as much. As soon as we were conscious, we managed a room change- we stayed in the older building, overlooking the pool and the ocean- much nicer. The property is truly gorgeous- private chair cabanas are available at the beach- VIP service is 55 dollars for the day- well worth it- includes bottled water, portable radios, sunscreen and unlimited towels-there is no waiter service on the beach, so we took our beverages from lunch down with us. We had planned on a trip to the Safeway to stock up on our own water and breakfast, as our unit came with a full, amply equipped kitchen-Room also have washer and dryers in room, which was a great convienience! Valet service goes for 26.00 a day, by the way- self park is 20 a day-So, we called for our keys, and after an hr of waiting, found that they had lost our car keys. We were furnished with a driver, however, and Cliff was really helpful, took us wherever we wanted to go until they found the keys-three days later. What can I say? The view is gorgeous, so one kind of gets the feeling that they just don't try as hard-loads of marketing going on-'Events' offering free coffee and raffles are thinly veiled attempts at data gathering- Marriott did comp us quite a bit due to our bad experiences- The catamaran trip out to Dolphin watch is not to be missed-3 hrs of fun! The lagoons are quite safe, and beach is clean. One thing they don't tell you however, is that there is a law in Hawaii that says all beaches are public, and the Cabana rentals are open to the public. One morning I reserved an end Cabana- over on a private side- a visiting family from another hotel requested it and was told that it was already reserved. They set out their blankets and baby toys all around the cabana, threw soda cans around and proclaimed that they were claiming the beach for 'Redneck Nation'. We were given another cabana and had a nice day anyway, but beware! All in all, it was a nice place, but a bit overrated in my opinion.

We could not get a 1BR unit for the dates we wanted, but we paid their Internet prices anyways since it seemed to have all that we wanted. We are a couple with two young children (under 3). Its the perfect place to stay in for kids that age group. Check-in was easy. They were supposed to have given us some kind of voucher for a gift/tickets to an event or such but apparently they forgot so we did not get the freebie. We had requested a high floor and a crib. Got neither. Did not mind or insist since running to the pool and back was quicker being on the 2nd floor (almost same level as pool). We had a parking lot view but that was OK too since we parked right by the fire door next door to us and entered and exited through that all the time. Also, we might have worried about the kids playing in the lanai if we were on a higher floor...so it was fine. The unit was spacious, well appointed and perfect for the family. The living room has a sofa-cum-bed, 2 large chairs, a dining table (6-seater) and a flat screen TV and DVD player (our kids watched their favorite videos on it everyday!) The bedroom had a nice comfortable (Queen?) bed, flatscreen TV and a (hot) tub and dressing area (mirror, sink etc). There is also a small sitting area adjacent to the bedroom between the living and sleeping area. The common bathroom accessible from both the bedroom and living area (kitchen?) has a stall shower, toilet and sink. There are towels aplenty, and they bring more if you need. The kitchen has a huge refirgerator, cooktop oven, stovetop microwave, sink, dishwasher, and some basic utensils (good quality stainless steel). There is dinnerware for 6. We utilized the kitchen optimally (eating out at the most once a day!) Housekeeping cleans everyday for renters, I understand that owners only get a tidy service midweek and cleaning at the end of the week or end of the stay? Never heard construction noise from our room, from the pools or the lagoon (we were on Lagoon 4 and never ventured out to the other lagoons or to Ihilani). There was a person at the end of the hallway (by the elevator) offering a snorkel trip for two aboard the Ko'Olina Cat if we sat thru the timeshare presentation. We did not think it was worth our time. Had we gotten the preview package (all stay at 50% price) we would have, but $200...naah! The marketplace had bagels and coffee and some pastry for breakfast. We ate there a couple of times. Their \"starbucks\" was way below average. When I returned my latte for a regular coffee, the lady who prepared my espresso drink was visibly upset and said maybe they make it differently where I usually get it..?! I saw everyone there with the $25 refillable mug...every single one! The store by the pool (salt water pool) is reasonably priced. We bought our kids' beachtoys, floatees and some other stuff there. Their shave ice is kinda OK too. We did not get to Matsumoto's so we can't compare, but we did try it at two other places, and this was wayyy better, and more flavor choices too (and clean may I add). The sandy area by the pool was perfect for kids to play in while parents relaxed. Even adults seemed to enjoy this pool! The other pool did not have young children, not sure if they were not allowed or this one was just easier/safer to get in and out of. There were volleyball and basketball nets in the pool. The locker room/restrooms (accessible only with your room keys) were super clean and always smelled good. (The room and property does look like it does in the photos) The folks you borrow towels from gave us a wristband on some days and not on others...not sure how that works...it was supposed to identify guests from outsiders. I saw people with bands and without. Everyone had as much fun. They give you a card with your room number on it which you can produce for any expense on the property and they will bill your room. Do not lose it! We did not eat at the restaurants or interact much with the staff (the guy at the fish feeding was boring and seemed more interested in getting us to fill out raffle ticket forms - data for timeshare sales database I'm sure, than letting us feed the fish.) but after having flown Hawaiian airlines coach class, any hospitality would seem wonderful. We rented the water hammock. Good fun. $10 for 30 mins. There is some fish in the lagoon so we did not venture out to the crowded (but oh-so-worth-it, I hear, Hanauma Bay). We could have gone to their Ho'Ike show, cheaper than Paradise Cove Luau, but we missed it and went to the latter. We are vegetarians so it was a damp squib. Also the very young kids don't have much to do. Our having been to the Polynesian Cultural center as well made it a repeat experience for us. The good thing was that it was right next door and it was on a lagoon so the kids just played in the sand - some more. As for getting around the island - if you plan to do that a lot and have young kids, stay in Waikiki or even I'd say on the south or east. We visited Koko Head for water activities (parasailing, bumper ride, banana boat), Kailua for swimming, PCC, Dole, North shore, and downtown HNL, all from 40-60 minutes away!! Its not much fun to keep driving with young kids, the ride back home with tired kids AND adults is NO fun. So if you want to do a lot of island-exploring with or without kids, this is not your place. But for more relaxing, swimming, sunning on the beach/lagoon/pool with a very nice accomodation and a few extra perks, this is GREAT!

There was fresh juice in chilled dispensers and fresh flowers out. We were treated with respect at the front desk and placed in the Kona tower looking out towards the marina. Our room was imaculate. They have these \"vacation essential\" packs in the rooms, with samples of dishwasher detergent and things like a Gilette razor and Oil of Olay. It really is nice to have a washer and dryer in the room to put your swimming suits and sort in. We ate the first day at Kolohes on the beach. The entertainment was really impressive and it is the best atmosphere at night with all the torches lit. The lagoons are, I think, the best part of this resort. The sand is perfect and they have showers and foot washes everywhere. It is nice to have a grassy and shaded spot to get out of the sand. The beach cabanas were numerous on our trip and we never had a problem finding one to rent. The snorkeling was fair. I think the fish are still moving in. We liked going out on the Ko Olina Cat, catamaran. It was seriously the best. They take you just north of the resort to a pipeline teaming with fish. We saw turtles, dolphins, and all sorts of fish. Worth the money! The pools are nice when you want a break from the beach. There are BBQ' s with all the tools for you to cook your own steaks. It is sooo nice to smell the burgers and shrimp while you are laying out on a pool chair! This side of Oahu really is like being in the country. It is far from the rat race of Waikiki, but close enough to civilization. It is only a 10 minute drive to Kapolai to go to the Safeway to get things for your fridge. There is also a cineplex there for movies. A Walmart is only 15 minutes away, with everything else. The north shore can be reached in 40 minutes flat. Miliani Town was our favorite for restaurants. It is on the way north. Much has been written of the construction. It really was minimal during our stay. We were out exploring the island during the day, so we didn't notice it much. It would not deter me from coming here. They are mostly in the later phases of construction and there wasn't much heavy machinery sounds. Mostly welding. All construction stops at 5 o'clock. Besides, construction wont last forever, and this will be a prime spot when it is done. It is a perfect spot for families. We did not take our children, but spent the entire time wishing we had. (Well, maybe not the ENTIRE time :) ...) If you are with the party crowd, try closer to Waikiki. Much has been said about the time share aspect of Ko Olina. We were only asked twice to listen to a presentation. It IS part of the deal here, but it is not like going to an \"Amway\" or \"Hoover Vacuum\" convention or anything. Pressure was very light.

Pleny of room to spread out with two families. Sofa sleepers are a little bumpy but fine for kids. King in master and queen in guest room are very comfortable.

Go to Roy's (across the street at the golf course) for a nice upscale fish (try the ahi) lunch or dinner. I cannot say enough good things about the lagoons. Lagoon #3 is about 200 yards from the lobby with beautiful, clean white sand - rent the water hammock. It's $10 an hour and tons of funs to jump on, hang out on in the lagoon. Two pools and four hot tubs open so far, all are great. Bigger pool with slide is due to open in the next year or two.

We only ended up sleeping at this resort one night and after seeing our room, the property, and the construction, we switched to the JW Marriott's Ihilani Resort & Spa, which was fantastic and I highly recommend. We booked the room at the Marriott's Ko Olina Beach Club through Interval. Once the room was booked, I called the Marriott and Interval to confirm several things, as I was concerned about the construction. I was assured by the hotel staff that that my room was in the \"best\" tower and that the construction would not be a problem. Upon checking in, however, the lady at the desk informed me that my view was the construction (although if I strained the neck I could see the ocean, therefore I had an \"ocean view\" room). Upon seeing this, I asked to speak with a manager. The manager offered me another room which sat on top of the parking garage and on the main road leading into the hotel. I asked if people complain about the noise and she said, \"we do not get as many complaints about the road as we do about the construction.\" This was not a comforting thought. Because of this, we got a room at the J.W. Marriott. Although the people at the Marriott Ko Olina Beach Club were nice, they were unaccommodating regarding our room situation and did not help us. I highly recommend you do NOT honeymoon here. I will say, it seemed like a great place to take young children, when you would not be concerned about the view, noise, or construction.

While there, we stayed at the Marriott Ko Olina Beach Club Resort. It was absolutely beautiful, and we had a wonderful time there. We were a party of seven; me, my husband and daughter, and my brother, his wife and their two daughters. My daughter and niece are 2007 high school graduates and this was their graduation trip. I think it was one they won't forget. We toured the North Shore, not our favorite thing, but very authentic Hawaiian. There was more poverty there than I had imagined. On the drive north on the H2, we stopped at the Dole Plantation. There was a very nice gift shop where we observed a pineapple cutting demonstration. The pineapple was scrumptious. Also while at the North Shore, we stopped in at Matsumoto's Store in Haleiwa and had their famous Shave Ice. It was one of the highlights of our trip. Also while in Haleiwa, against most of our group's wishes, we stopped at Giovanni's shrimp truck . The shrimp scampi was very good. We had a fun day, but after taking a look at most of the North Shore beaches, including Turtle Bay Resort, we all agreed that our very own Ko Olina Beach Club was the very best place to be, and the North Shore was a \"been there, done that\" sort of day. We attended the Paradise Cove Luau which is located very close to the Beach Club. We had a blast. It was fun, festive and very relaxing. If you decide to do a luau this was a great one. They have three packages to choose from, and we did the Royal Ali which gave us 4 drink coupons and allowed us to have great center seats and a server (as opposed to standing in a long buffet line). We loved it. This event was one of our top two picks after all was said and done. Most of one day was spent at Pearl Harbor which was a special day for all of us. Our uncle served in the Navy during World War II (he was not at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941), but because he served and he has shared his stories with us, we appreciated what we saw there. Later that day, we strolled through the International Market Place. This very charming shopping area is a great place to pick up souveniers at a reasonable price, and the Lava Flow drink at Coconut Willy's is to die for. Also the band there was very friendly and made it a point to get acquainted with the audience. They tried to sing songs that had something to do with the place their visitors were from. It was fun. Then later that evening, we had dinner reservations at Duke's Canoe Club at the Outrigger Hotel. Our table was \"on the rail\" with a great view of Waikiki beach. Reservations at this restaurant are advised. The food was good, with very friendly service, and strolling musicians. Great salad bar. Another day we had planned to snorkel at Hanauma Bay, but when we got there the parking lot was full. It is important to get there before 10:00am. We were disapponted, but it all turned out fine, because we found Sandy Beach Park instead. We had an absolute blast at Sandy Beach ... later we found out that this beach is known to be one of the most dangerous beaches on the island (lots of broken necks, backs, etc.) Our girls (all teenagers ... 17, 18, and 19) had an awesome time. They were the only girls surfing the waves with all the guys. This stop is at the very top of our list of fun things to do. If we ever are back in Oahu, we will definitely spend another day at Sandy Beach. After our day at the beach, we drove back through Hanauma Bay, but decided we were too tired to snorkel. This will have to wait till our next trip. The last two days of our trip were saved for the Beach Club and some rest and relaxation. We rented the cabanas (beach chairs with a tent over them) both days and I would highly recommend this if you are planning a day at Lagoon 3. Even with the sounds of construction in the background, I slept better on the beach there than I do in my own bed...ha! Seriously, for some the construction sounds might be annoying, but for our bunch it was not a problem. The girls loved the beautiful pool areas, hot tubs, excercise facility, sauna and steam room. They met friends and had a very good time at the Resort. Our condo was on the 4th floor of the Kona Building facing the pool. It was a 2 bedroom, 2 bath unit and was just beautifully decorated. We are Marriott owners in Branson, Missouri, and we love the facility in Branson, but it doesn't begin to compare to the elegance of the Ko Olina Beach Resort. It was a spacious unit with an extra-large balcony which we put to good use each and every morning and late evening. We previewed the property and received a certificate to Chuck's Steak House there on-site. There was no pressure by the sales agent, Tracy. She did a wonderful job explaining our options for purchasing at Ko Olina, and both my brother and his wife, and my husband and I actually considered buying. We did not buy, but would certainly entertain the idea of returning to this lovely resort. I could go on and on about our visit, because it was a memorable time for us all. Aloha to you, and mahalo for your patience with my rambling.

The Marriott is a timeshare resort, but we didn't get a lot of pressure (one request and one decline). We booked a one bedroom for a family of four. One master bedroom with a queen fold-out in the living room. We we told we couldn't get a roll-out bed, but in fact we ended up with two (for two young men 21 and 18 years old). Anyway, everyone at the resort was great. The concierge pointed out some great places to eat and park (in Waikiki) and were more than helpful. The private lagoons at the resort make your own private beach. The JW Marriott is a ten minute walk up the beach if you want something upscale. Now the really good part is that you don't have all the masses of Waikiki. At Ko Olina you are 20-30 minutes out of Waikiki so you can go to dinner and shopping. The town of Kapolei is two miles away with a Safeway, fast food and sitdown. So you are away from the crowds, without being isolated like on the North Shore. I drove to the North Shore in 55 mins, and Kailua on the east side in about an hour. And oh by the way, the Ko Olina golf course was really good. If we go back to Oahu soon, we'd probably stay here again. Only one negative, the resort area is building up so construction is going on - after a while it just becomes white noise (if you stay on-site during the day).

They each were very different and had a different prime prospect consumer but we enjoyed them all. We are late 30 somethings, DINKS. (double income no kids) We really liked this time share resort. The location has not much built up around it. The guy at the golf course told us that the Japanese investors had big plans and the market went bad so the real estate didn't get developed entirely years ago. Construction is underway next to the hotel but it did not bother us. Our room was quite expansive. I think there are differnt formats so be sure to read what you are getting. Our room had a kitchen, table with 6 chairs, a pull out couch, king size bed and the bath had a tub & a large shower. I think by the reviews there are two kinds of rooms. We did have a garden view of the golf course across the street but we didn't pay for the beach view. This place had a lot of Marriott owners and there was a cocktail party with prizes that we went to. It was sort of cheesy but we enjoyed our free mai tais. The guest servies/ concierge has free leis and post cards. Also they gave us a great map and good directions to the US Arizona. The check in was backed up when we arrived. They gave us a key to use at the locker rooms so we could go to the beach whilst the room was cleaned. They had good luggage attendants. We parked in the self park garage. I think it was around $7 a day. The front desk person was extremely friendly. We ate in a lot at this resort since we had a kitchen. There is a Safeway up an exit or two. We did eat at the pool bar and the salads were good. This Marriott is walking distance (a long walk) to the JW Marriott Ihilai resort. The feel of that resort is less family resort and more honeymooners and retirees, etc. It was a much pricer resort. We ate lunch at the Ihilani on day. It was a bit pricey for most folks but it was good. I made a special request for grill fresh fish and they made my food to order. We saw some Japanese weddings on the beach and the resort. There is also a chapel on the grounds at this resort. At the Ko Olina Beach Club they had excellent facilities for families. The buildings and grounds seem fairly new. The beach lagoon is safe for children to swim. (no big waves) They have a lagoon pool. A padded jungle gym. I worked out in the gym facilities everyday here. They were fairly nice and had a good selection of weights for a hotel. We had dinner at Charlie's steak house and it was good. They have a nice salad bar and in retrospect if I knew that I would had just gotten salad bar and soup. We ate here and were able to watch the luau show. I'm glad we didn't pay for the luau it was a bit cheesey. We have been to real luaus and hotel ones. This one had a MC that talked too much. You do get a discount on golf if you play at the Ko Olina golf club. My husband played and I rode along. There is a Roy's located at the golf club. We didn't eat there as I've been to Roy's before. We found out that there is a marina that is walking distance to the hotel and catamarans go out from there. We didn't do this because we had a boat trip planned in Kauai but it would be convient to go from the Marriott. We would stay here again and will likely go here when we have children. We recommend driving to Lanikai (get a map from the concierge) and going to the beach & park there. We had a picnic lunch. We brought our our cooler. It is a beautiful beach and it's not crowded like Hanauma Bay. We drove H3 then headed south. There is a Hawaiian ice place in a white and red checkered building around Waimanalo Beach Park on the way to/from Lanikai. The best Hawaiian ice we had the entire trip. It's a little dive but good. Apparently it's on lonely planet as they had a sticker on there window. Sorry I can't remember the name of it. I believe that road is 427 the 444 the 693, etc. and heads down the coast. It's a nice drive on the east side of the island. We also stopped and watched surfer's at Sandy Beach.

The beach club is a time share property, so just expect that they try to sell you a unit. Probably a great deal if you have a family. The villas are great. They are spacious with a kitchen stocked with the essential cooking gear. The bathroom was huge and all tile. BBQs outside. There are a few pools and hot tubs. The gym is very nice and there is a 3 mile running trail along the beach. There are multiple lagoons with no current or wave, so it is really easy snorkeling. Pros: pretty, clean, great units and spacious. You can easily fit a family whereas in a hotel room, that would be tight. Cons: lot's of kids (but maybe that is good for you), no poolside service. I'm used to hotels that come by the pool and hand you pinapple, clean your sunglasses, ask you if you need a drink etc. There isn't any of this here. Yoga, snorkel rental, any activity etc isn't included, which seems to be the theme these days unless you go to a super high end resort (and pay 3x as much). But, if you have a family, this really would be great. It's not too far outside Waikiki so you can still go there for the shopping, eating, etc. BUT it's 20x more relaxing/pretty than Waikiki. You have tons of space on the beach, and you can relax out here in Ko Olina. You can walk next store to the JW Marriott that has a few more food options and shops, or there is a shuttle. There is a lot of construction going on, but it didn't bother me. You might want to go here now before the construction ends and there are more hotels with crowds. They're building some fancy condo's and there is also going to be huge hotel, The Grand Ko Olina, (similar to the Grand Wailea). Or, you can wait - soon they'll have a ferry that goes between Ko Olina and Waikiki which will be awesome. Lovely place.

This, in my opinion, is not a 5 star accommodation. The rooms are nice and fairly spacious but are really quite generic. The towels are not fluffy and soft but very thin and scratchy. The toiletries are not nice either. They have a strange scent. I recommend bringing your own shampoo and soap. The large tub is not a jacuzzi tub and you will have to bring your own bath salts or bubble bath. The rooms are not cleaned every day but the trash is emptied and your towels are replaced. Personally, I think the floors should be vacumed and cleaned every day and the bathtub should be cleaned daily as well. The room we had provided a beach front view but there is construction going on next door so you see the vacant lot and parking for the construction workers right out the window as well. The food is very average. We could not find a chicken sandwich anywhere on this property. You have to go to the neighboring Ihilani hotel if you want a nice lunch or breakfast.

We really enjoyed our trip but there were a few things that we were told we just had to do and we were disappointed, so I'll share these with you as well. First the resort: Anyone staying here should rent a car, parking is easy and it makes for easy sightseeing and shopping. The front desk will give you quick directions to Kapolei if you need groceries, gas, etc. The property is beautiful and very well maintained. Although this is the dry side of the island, the resort is tropical. We ate at the steak house at the main building and enjoyed the food. The beach bar is good but we enjoyed lunch moreso from the pool grill that opens Thurs to the weekend and somewhere around noon, we loved their macaroni-potato salad. Everyone was very friendly. If your flight is long after check out, pack a bag with toiletries and change of clothes, hang out at the beach/pool and take advantage of the access to the locker room with shower and hairdryer. If you rent a convertible wear sunblock! We got comp tix to the Fia Fia Luau for attending the timeshare presentation. Kathie Rust was the person assigned to us - she was great. Very nice, really listened, no overkill. The luau was just ok. We didn't like the food and the show was mostly about tribes from different polynesian islands (their dress and dance). This came highly recommended by the girl at the welcome desk. She also highly recommended the drive to the north shore (ok, not great). It was a nice drive. We went to see the surfers and got lucky because it was a very windy day and waves were 17ft high and so they were out. Make sure you travel with a map. Signage is poor and I couldn't find the names of the beaches so guessed alot as to where we were. The North shore beaches do not appear to be conducive to swimming, and no one was in the water that day. The welcome desk girl highly recommended the Shrimp Truck (I read about it in books as well), we were not impressed. The real problem is you have to peel your own shrimp - which isn't easy when your shrimp is covered with sauce. Try it, if you like, just make sure you have lots of napkins! We drove through Haleiwa and, as directed, HAD to stop at Matsumotos ice shop. Not being great fans of the snow cone, we found the syrup to be extremely sweet and tossed ours. Again, if you're into that sort of thing you may love it! We felt like tourists in NY buying hot dogs from a street vendor, NY locals really don't do that. While we were up there we checked out the sacred site Puu O Mahuka Heiau, which was just interesting. Frommers listed it as having one of the best views - we found the view to be very limited. Highly recommend: When in the Honolulu area, definitely take the Tantalus drive to Puu Ualakaa State Park. You drive through a residential area and then a rain forest, which is beautiful. The state pk has a fantastic view of Diamond Head and Honolulu, it must be a secret because we were the only ones up there! We had it all to ourselves! It is VERY windy up there. When you leave the park you'll have to go back the way you came, as the road is closed ahead. Pearl Harbour is a must. We got there early (8:30am), as suggested, and the lines weren't bad at all. We got to look around for the 1 hour wait to take the boat across to the memorial. We also visited Mighty Mo and enjoyed that very much as well. We took the Ko Olina Cat Sunset Sail which I'm not sure I would recommend. The staff were very nice and attentive, but they take you along the shore, where there are power plants, so ahead the island looks nice but not most of it. What was fantastic - aside from the sunset - was that we were lucky to come upon a school of spinner dolphins. The captain immediately drove up to them and we had a wonderful time watching them. It was a great trip, but were it not for the dolphins.... I can't help but think that a sunset sail along Waikiki would have been nicer. All in all, if you plan to visit Oahu, and don't want to do the crowded city, overcrowded beach thing, by all means you will find a relaxing, comfortable vacation at Ko Olina!", "Date": "May 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "SF", "Title": "\u201cDon't belive people that say its quiet here - its not!\u201d", "Author": "Kevbosf", "ReviewID": "UR7553565", "Content": "If you want to go to Hawaii for peace and quiet - DO NOT STAY HERE!. We stayed our 5 days for the package and then moved to the JW Marriott down the road - it was fantastic. The Lack of Peace - back to the vacation club - say you want to relax and read a book - and we were a couple with no kids. There are two pools - both are filled with screaming kids and believe it or not - many locals with their kids. Ok so then you decide to head to the beach. That is where the two new towers are going up and you will hear hammering, constant beeping, and the joy of having a backhoe 50 feet from your reading spot. Anyone that has ever been to a construction site knows it is anything but quiet. The fact that you would pay to have a massage within 100 feet of construction work is beyond me. What most people here did not mention is that there is ALSO construction on the other side of the resort - on some new condos going up. Our first day there we realized that the only way to get any peace and quiet at this resort was to leave. We went down the road to the lagoon by the JW - which was the only spot nearby that had any peace and quiet. So if quiet is what you want - this is NOT the place to be. Once the construciton is done years from now maybe.... Food - We found the beach bar and grill to be marginal at best. The only good thing on the menu was the pork quesidilla and the weekend buffett. Chuck's Steakhouse is the \"nice\" restaurant at the beach club. We found the steaks overpriced and not very good - and the staff wears sneakers so why even bother getting dressed up to eat there. It was not \"nice\" in our opinion. The Area - there is nothing in Ko Olina area except Ko Olina. We have been to Maui and Kuaui many times and we always enjoyed walking to other restuarants and shops. This resort is nowhere near finished and there is nothing outside of the hotels. The front desk lady told us if we wanted to see \"nice\" areas to go to the north shore. By the way - on the south side of the resort is a Marina next to a large power plant or industrial plant - for many people the plant is their view if not the parking garage. What was good? - We found the staff to be great - they were super helpful and friendly in every way. The bar and grill staff was funny and friendly and the shows were great. The rooms are also a highlight - huge wonderful suites with great finishes and plenty of room to relax. (which is important when the only quiet place in the resort is your bedroom) Marriott has done a nice job and when it is all done someday it may be a great place to hang out and relax. BUT BEWARE what other say here - it is NOT QUIET. We were upset that we wasted five days at this resort since we both work high stress jobs and wanted to relax. For the same money there are SO MANY OTHER PLACES you could go. The JW down the street was very nice and relaxing. Go to Maui or Kuai - and if you like the Vacation Clubs go to Wiaohai in Kuai - it is peaceful and you can walk to a ton of restuarants.

We arrived Sunday, April 28, 2007. I am not going to discuss tourist attractions as I really want to concentrate on the resort for this review. This is a beautiful resort. It is a Timeshare Resort. It is on the website and you definitely know it when you get here. Not intrusive, but a timeshare just as well. We purchased our week from an owner here. Yes there is construction, but the noise from the construction is not intrusive. As a matter of fact, I sat outside at the bar and grill for lunch today and had to concentrate on the construction noise to notice. I noticed the fighter jet more than the construction noise. Remember this is an island and no matter where you are, you will more or less be in the flight path of commercial and/or military planes. Also, all of the construction is not Marriott Construction. Anyone who is sensitive to noise should stay up on the North Shore or another island. Whether one stays in Honolulu or at the Ko Olina, there is going to be some type of noise. We have a 1 bedroom villa in the Kona tower that is equipped with sitting and dining area, full kitchen, washer, dryer, etc. The furnishings are lovely and well maintained. I did upgrade (for $10) the tidy service to a full cleaning and added an additional full cleaning ($45) making a total of 2 full cleanings for the week. We left the staff a tip each day on the pillow in the bedroom when they did the full cleaning and we had no complaints I will say, if you expect to see the ocean from floors 4 and below, forget it. You will need to be on the 5th floor atleast. We are on the 4th floor with a Mountain view and I have to tip toe to see the ocean. Yes, there are cranes in the view, but hey I still see the mountains and when I really want to see the ocean, I just go down to it and get one of the many available chairs and just enjoy the view. Yes on one side of the resort is a chemical plant, but while on the resort, I didn't see it. I don't know if it was because our room wasn't on that side or what. I just know it is there because I saw it as we drove in. In reference to meals, I have not had a bad meal while on the property. Yes, it is pricey, but what hotel isn't. My husband had a fish dinner and I had a shrimp dinner for appx $50 (including tip) total. We pay more than that at Outback! Drinks run about $10 when it is not happy hour. By the way, I don't know why folks are saying the valet parking is so expensive. We valet parked for $5/day. My husband didn't want to, but I said it was worth it to me to be able to have someone have my car ready when I wanted it. We would just tip the valet. The staff upon check in was a little slower than I am use to, but I really think it was because they wanted to make sure everything was correct and because they have more information to give you than front counter reps with traditional hotels. All were very nice and were as accommodating as they were able to be. The concierge was exceptional. All directions were on the money and not one time did we get lost. The distance from Honolulu is not bad at all. There is traffic, but I drive in Atlanta on a regular basis, so it's all relative as far as I am concerned as traffic in ATL is a bear! We drove back this afternoon in about 30 minutes. I honestly don't understand some of the reviews of this resort being too far out. Going to the North Shore is a little further. We went to the Polynesian Cultural Center (very nice) and it took 90 minutes to go up there. Unless you want to do everything in Honolulu, you will have to venture out. But believe me, it is well worth it. All in all, we are having a fantastic time at this resort. It is not as happening as in Honolulu, but I wouldn't expect it to be. Here you will find people who want to enjoy a nice calm vacation. If you are so stressed that you can't stand noise, you can't stand to hear a child cry, and that you expect everyone to jump at your every command, not only is the Ko Olina not for you, but the whole island of Oahu is not for you. Folks are really laid back here and enjoy life. Look I am one of those type A personality people, but here I have learned to relax and to remember, I came to be on vacation! BTW...while you are here, try to get a message by the sea or use the very nice workout facility. And if you want to do something a little higher end, just head over to the JW Marriott next door.

She kept on focusing on the view outside the sales suite, and the great deal it was and we kept on asking to actually SEE a full unit which we never got around to. After asking twice, we gave up and asked for our additional dining credits and left. 2.

We stayed 5 nights at Koolina using their timeshare sales promotion, which was a great deal. The rooms are beautiful and new, the two pools are great for kids. Make sure to get the $100 upgrade to a \"master\" suite, 1 br unit with a kitchen/washer & dryer, it's very spacious. Granite countertops, tumbled stone in the bathrooms, nicely furnished. The non-upgrade lock off hotel rooms are small in comparison, but still nicely furnished. Go for groceries in Kapolei at the Safeway which is just off the H1 freeway three miles from the resort. The resort has alot of BBQ's which are well maintained. There were lots of families enjoying all the amenities of the resort. The beach club facilities appear to be better than the JW Marriott Ilihani up the road. Go there for the morning fish feeding to get your souvenier laminated fish card. Be warned that there is major construction going on at this resort. There are five giant cranes on both sides of the property and the constant \"beep, beep, beep\" of the heavy construction vehicles. The area will be under construction until at least 2011. If you schedule your stay over the weekend, there is not much construction activity those two days, which is when you will want to use the lagoons, otherwise it is very noisy until around 5:00 pm when the construction stops. The noise is mostly blocked out in the pool area by the buildings, lots of kids and music. We had an \"island view\" on the 2nd floor, which wasn't horrible, but you could see cars going by. All our requests for upper level ocean view were impossible because they were fully booked. They reserve the bottom 4 floors for the sales promotions, if you are an owner or exchanging you have a much better chance for a high floor, ocean view. My in-laws had a lock off unit situated right over the parking garage with a view of the industrial area, think power plants, not Hawaii. Anyway if you can get past the construction and possibly poor views, the rooms and resort itself is very nice. Koolina is about a half hour from the airport and honolulu. Recommended stops: - Polynesian cultural center on the North Shore, about an hour and 15 minutes of straight drive time, which is an all day event.Get an entertainment book for Hawaii and save $40 at the PCC. - Dole plantation to check out the pineapples growing and get a Pineapple whip ice cream treat. - Arizona Memorial. We stopped in after 10:00 and got tickets for 1:30 I thought they might have been sold out by then, but it wasn't a problem. - Bishop's museum - planetarium show and the \"Science on a Sphere\" show were very good. Would have liked to have seen more. - Hanauma Bay on the East shore for snorkeling with turtles. - Train from Ewa beach nearby that runs through the Koolina property on Sundays. Take an early walk along the lagoons, do your touring (or relax by the pool) during the week days then enjoy the sunset and happy hour back at the lagoons after the construction workers go home.

We felt so safe-the waves aren't as strong as it would be if you're in an open ocean beach. We didn't even have to go far for snorkeling. We saw a lot of fish just around the lagoon. They swim side by side with you. (Hanauma Bay is another good site for snorkeling.) We had lunch one day at the beachside restaurant, and they served excellent lunch. At that time, they had the \"Prime Rib Special with seafood\" for $16.99. It was very good and an excellent deal for the price. Yummie!! We planned on visiting a lot of places in Oahu, but had to change our plans when we got to the property. We opted to relax rather than go out. We were able to get the Vacation Package of 6 days/5 nights with a car for $649. An excellent deal if you can get it. The catch is you have to attend a 90 minute time share presentation. We loved the property so much we decided to buy a time share. The neighboring town of Kapolei offers a lot of dining options, grocery stores, and source for other things you might need. It's only about 10 minutes away . We saved a lot of money by either dining there or buying take out foods and eating back at the hotel. There are also a lot of bbq grills you can use.

We are Marriott Vacation Club owners on Maui and love that property, but this property is head and shoulders over Maui.

The Villas at Ko Olina are beautiful with top of the line fixtures, and the most comfortable beds you will experience.

We were here over Easter week, the property was fully occupied and we never had trouble getting three lounge chairs together in sun or shade, the place never seemed crowded. A Nice thing about Ko Olina is that there are two restaurants on site, the pool restraint which serves B'fest, Lunc, and dinner - food pretty good, typical resort type prices. There is also a new steak place on site that just opened, we did not try on this trip. A lot of MVCI's don't have restaurants other then the Market Place, so this is a nice change. The JW Marriott is right next door and they also have several restaurants with charge privileges for Beach Club guests. The famous Roy's is also just across the street, so there are plenty of places to eat. Don't worry about the drive to Honolulu, 20 minutes tops - no big deal - but you will need a rental car.

Lagoon 1 is where they do the fish feeding at 7:30am every morning. Lagoon 2 is rumored to have visiting turtles-we didn't spend enough time at that lagoon to see any. Tip for future travelers-past lagoon 4 there is a marina that has a little store. The store has very basic breakfast for under $5 and the store prices are cheaper than the resort store-saves a little money. Also, the JW Marriott has outdoor pools that house sharks and sting-rays. Really cool for the kiddies to see. Personally I thought that the JW was very sterile and cold. Just my personal observation.

They gave great snorkel tips around the area and kept us informed of fun events at the hotel. (You can feed the fish in the lagoons on the property in the morning. The staff gives out cards to identify the fish that come to the feeding.) If your goal is to just party in Hawaii this is not the resort for you. I would recommend Waikiki. However this resort is not dead. There is a seaside bar to enjoy a couple Hawaiian cocktails. It is simply a nice play to unwind and relax. The lagoons are beautiful and easy to swim in due to the wave breakers that are in place. We were also able to snorkel and see quite a few fish. There are three lagoons so if one is murky for a day you have two others to try. I plan on going back to the Ko'olina very soon.

We have three small children, ages 7, 5 and 1.5 so were looking for a facility that had kitchen-equipped suites, a nice calm beach and good pool facilities. After much looking, we decided on the Marriott Ko'Olina Beach Club and we are very glad we did. We have stayed in a number of Marriott vacation club properties in the past, including another in Hawaii, and found this one to be the best. Sure, it does not have certain amenitites such as room service, that full service hotels may offer, but then again, how many full service hotels provide a full kitchen and bar-b-cue facilities? So long as you know what to expect, I cannot see how anyone could be disappointed in this facility. The lagoons and the pools are very nice and large enough that they never seem overcrowded. When we were in Oahu, they were experiencing very significant winds which created very rough surf over just about the entire island. Despite this, however, we always were able to find a clam spot in one of the four lagoons (often the one right in front of the hotel) that was suitable for swimming. In addition, the pools were warm and offered a great deal of variety for our kids who had a great time. A lot has been written in the reviews about the remoteness of the location. This is for the most part true, but so long as you have a car (and I don't believe anyone who comes to this place would not have a car), you can find just about anything you need within a five or ten minute drive. The Marketplace store on site is also a decent place to pick up supplies, which we found to be reasonably priced (by Hawaii standards). If you want nightlife, you might have to drive in to Honolulu, but that was not a bad drive, particularly if you avoided peak business rush hour times. Unlike many hotels in the area, parking is included and if you want to upgrade to valet parking (we did and found it a wonderful convenience) the cost is quite cheap (I think about $5/day). There is certain some construction on the properties located on either side of the hotel, but apart from the visuals associated with a construction site (cranes and heavy equipment as seen from our balcony), we were not bothered at all by it. The staff was extremely helpful and without exception very friendly. They honestly seemed like they cared about how our stay was going and wanted to make sure we were happy. The on-site Luau option was a bit pricey (something like $70/adult and $50/child) but we found to be well worth it. The buffet supper was quite good and the entertainment varied and interactive enough to entertain our little guys for the entire time. Local attractions are mostly nearby, Hanuama bay is about a 1/2 hour drive as is the north shore. We really enjoyed the Swap meet at Aloha stadium, which was a fantastic place to go to pick up local souvenirs, etc., at sometimes ridiculosly low prices. The beach at Hanuama bay was a big surprise as we thought the place to be mostly focused on snorkeling but it turns out that this is one of the nicer beaches in all of Hawaii. The short hike up to Waimea falls was also a great thing to do, with a nice wide walking path suitable for small children and strollers. When you get to the falls, you can even go for a swim in the waterfall pool -- cold water, but very great experience. They even provide you with life jackets for the little ones. We would not recommend the Dole Pinnapple Plantation as we found it to be quite gimmicky. All in all, this was a great spot.

We arrived Saturday and returned on Tuesday and barely had any traffic getting into town (obviously we're smart enough not to drive during morning rush hour...hopefully you'll be sleeping during that also). The general commute to Waikiki was about 25 minutes (big whoop...don't let people scare you by saying it's a tough commute because it's not). The resort has a beautiful lagoon, spacious rooms (unlike the broom closests in the hotels at Waikiki), a golf course, and they even built a football field for the NFL stars that play in the Pro Bowl (that's why I was unable to book the JW on this trip).

No!\u201d", "Author": "cooldoctor1", "ReviewID": "UR6590176", "Content": "Ko Olina Beach Club is superb, and I will give you info. It is located on the same property as, but is different from, the Ko Olina Ihilani\u2014which is a hotel. See my report from that hotel dated Jan 2005. I will give you info here not on other reviews. First, the construction is never great to have around you, but as long as you don; face it, you\u2019ll be fine. Ask for a room that does not face the construction. I disagree with the reviewer regarding facing the pool; the pool is wonderful, palm tree-lined, and grotto-like. It is a pleasure to look at, and is nicely tiki torched and lighted at night. Although lower floors do not see the ocean because the pool and palms are in the way, who cares\u2014it\u2019s gorgeous. And not at all noisy. No planes or kid noises to a great extent, and we had a second floor unit facing the pool. It was a great, happy and sunny place. The staff is impeccable. The ocena and lagoons, a one minute walk from your room, as clearly wonderful. A recent review mentions the deceiving photos of the \"blue pool\"---that's the hotel Ihilani, as featured in Blue Crush (a great movie, rent it!). You have complete access to that hotel (saw Glenn Frey of Eagles staying there last year, and Pro Bowl Footballers stay at Ihilani) The condo, Ko Olina Beach Club, is better tha the hotel for room size and less hustle bustle and a better, yes, better, swimming pool, and hot tubs (three). I will now get to some things people do not write about as much, but might concern you. Location: ideal. It is about 30 minute very pretty drive to Waikiki beach, and you must have a car at Ko Olina. BUT, I hate driving, esp. on vacation, so you avoid all \u201chard\u201d driving by staying here. The roads in this manned and gated complex go around the golf course and hotel (Ihilani and Ko Olina Beach Club) and are 25 mph affairs. Even when you get off the ground, you drive on the least traveled part of H-1, which could whisk you right to Waikiki if you desire (traffic gets worse the closer you get to it), or you can pop off on Kunia Road exit (8 miles) to a very untravveld and pretty road through pineapple country to the North Shore, Banzaii Pipeline, Hailewa, surf shops, etc. This exit has Wal-Mart, small eateries, Denny\u2019s, and tons of shops. It is very nice and about 10 minute drive from report to Kunia Road. Remember that name: Kuni Road. You'll use it a lot to eat and get all over the place. It's easy and cool. From Kunia Rd, you can get anywhere on the island. For instance, you can back route it to H-3, which take you to lovely Lanaki Beach and Kailua Beach\u2014worthy stops, indeed. Remember, the entire road around the entire island is only 90 miles\u2026 so you can get anywhere from here. If you do not want a car at all, or cannot drive, do please stay at Waikiki Beach. Great for walkers, and the city bus in HI is wonderful, clean and takes you around the entire island for about $2 (4 hours plus to round the whole island though). But if you are looking for a nice condo, washer and dryer in bigger unit, with a parking charge of $10 daily but free access to your car in the garage and always spaces (no valet necessary), gated in every way so ultra-secure, then Ko Olina Beach Club is it. Plenty of cheap eats minutes away. Off the Beaten Track: Take a walk on the wild side, and drive north to Mahaka and Waianae, some of the poorest parts of the island. Great surfing beaches, but plenty of beach tents from homeless, but you must drive through Mahaka Valley to see two superb golf courses with condos, million dollar homes, and the prettiest view on the island between two mountains and ocean in distance. Check out true Hawaii at Waianae and Mahaka, north of Ko Olina on H-1. Finally, one tourist tip\u2026the best, and I mean the very best, view of the entire island\u2014one that makes Diamond Head Crater seem like a low shoe rack at Payless Shoes, is the road to Tantalus and the Pa\u2019aku State Park at the top. Totally free, totally drivable and views are stupendous. Check out Punchbowl Cemetery also for free and fun sights in the \"quiet\" part of Oahu. Conceierge will give you info. Enjoy Ko Olina.

Especially the lovely lady Tina at concierge, she saved my days couple of times by suggesting tours that fit our need perferctly. 5. nice restaraunts at JW Marriott, which is about half a mile away on paved, lit ocean fron pathway. nothing special about the only restaraunt onsite, except that they made above-average pina colada :) 6. if you're a runner like me, you won't be able to resist suiting up and running along the path way along the lagoons, it's a bit short, but with everything so beautiful, you wouldn't mind making a couple of roundtrips. 7. Ko Olina marina is right next door, couple of excursions depart from there, again, the concierge desk can be very helpful there. My impression of the common forum complaints - 1. flight path - I found it fun to watch jets flying over the hotel, the noise is totally an non-issue to me (and I'm very sensitive type). 2. construction - it is being done on both sides of the existing buildings, the time is limited, I believe 8-5, and the noise is not that noticable with the ocean-waves, but I did find myself having to conciously avoid the cranes when I'm framing with my cameras. While it's something you can totally ignore and still have a great time, it's a bit annoying, especially if you expect a \"perfect\" vacation. cons - 1. location - the hotel's 25-30 minutes drive away from Wakiki, on a good day. If your itenary includes Hanauma bay, you're at a disadvantage competing with the big crowd 20 miles closer than you. 2. most tours/excursions leave from Wakiki, so definitely get a car.

The grounds are very nice, the beach lagoons are great, especially for those with children, and the rooms are beautifully appointed. We had a guest room which is basically kind of like a \"guest quarters\" that is attached to a larger suite but can be rented seperately. It was really nice and had an ample kitchenette for quick breakfasts or lunches in the room. There is a Safeway store 3 miles away in Kapolei so we got cereal and juice and sandwich stuff etc. The pools are really nice, although if you are a sun worshipper you will find them too shaded by all the lovely palms. The hotubs are WONDERFUL. I don't know if the rock is fake or real but they are made of some sort of \"lava rock\" and a nice departure from the typical hottub. The beach is nice and has lounge chairs. You are not allowed to take alcoholic beverages on the beach - which is not big deal unless you'd like to sip a cool one in the heat of the afternoon. Many people take drinks there anyway and the \"enforcement\" is selective. One of my friends went to get a beer and was asked where he was sitting and he said \"the beach\" and he was denied service! Yet many others had drinks on the beach. There are two big downfalls of this resort - although both of them may be temporary. One is the construction noise. I realize there is nothing they can do about this since additional buildings are still being built - but I'm just mentioning it if you are thinking of going there in the next few months. It's quite loud in the morning - although not as noticeable from the beach and pools as it is from your balcony if you are beachside. The other is the restraunts - although the food is really good - it seems quite overpriced. I'm not a cheapskate when on vacation, but you really can't get a meal for less than $20 or so per person for breakfast and closer to $40 or higher for dinner. Every couple days they have a luau or a buffet - $60 per person - although the Christmas buffet at the Naukoa Terrace WAS incredible!! They really need at least one \"general purpose\" family eaterie where you can get a decent breakfast, lunch or dinner for 10 - 15 bucks or so. Having said that ... the prices aren't really THAT out of line with the rest of the Honolulu area. We \"gave up\" one night and just went to a local Denny's and it was still $50 for three people. All in all this is a beautiful resort and a great place to unwind. The peacefullness was a stark contrast to the hectic busyness of Waikiki where we stayed the first two nights.

I stayed there during the 2006 Thanksgiving week. My entire family of 7 loved it. The check-in process needed serious help (too slow), and the parking structure was inadequate. Don't plan on early check-in or late check-out. This isn't a standard Marriott property, so your elite status means squat. They're quite inflexible on that end.

We booked a 2BD 2BA, and it was plentiful big. The condo itself is divided into thirds. The first third is the master suite, with seperate bath and shower. The second part is the living room and kitchen area. Most of the units have at least two DVD players. The final third is the guess suite (which can be locked off and is essentially its own hotel room). All the kitchen amenities you need are provided, including the ever so importnat wine and bottle opener. There are THREE pools. One does not have a sand bottom, and the other two do. Also, one of the sand bottom pools has a depth of no more than 2 feet. You can actually put your lounge chair in it and sit down. That is perfect if you have kids. Also, there are acitivites for kids and adults daily. Then, there are FOUR lagoons you can choose from. The Ko'Olina itself occupies #3. The JW Marriott occupies #1, and laggon #2 and #4 are not too far. The lagoons are all connected bu a jogging path, and I am going to say that they are about no more than 1/3 of a mile from each other. What is nice is that each lagoon has its own character. One will be more crowded than others, and then one will have busier water than another. Altogether, the sand is soft and views are spectacular. Bathrooms, showers, and even snorkel gear canoe rentals are available on-site. Oh, and each lagoon is preceded by a grass knoll. This may not seem like a big deal, but when you just want to stay away from sand for a day (it happens) or you are trying to get sand off you feet, guess what? The grassy knoll comes in handy. It is true that there are not very many places to eat on site, but construction is on the way (DEC 2006) for a Chuck's Steak House and full service restaurant. Or, the bar and grill is oustanding for being just a bar and grill. Also, there is usually some type of buffet going on in the late afternoon to early evening. If you can, take the VERY CLOSE hwy to Exit 1B and you will find Safeway, K-mart, McDonalds, Chili's, Burger King, Taco Bell and pretty much every other joint you want to eat at. This resort is 45 min. from Waikiki (remember weekday morning traffic rules--traffic is west to east in the morning and east to west in the late afternoon and can be VERY BUSY), but if you are going to Oahu to visit Waikiki for more than two days then ditch you rental care and stay at Waikiki for goodness sake. Really, you are better off at any one of the four lagoons at Ko'Olina than Waikiki beach, and I say that having stayed at least 7-days at both. The Ko'Olina Golf Course is a wonder. Take advantage of the twi-lite rate if you can, $95, but varies. Also, the Roy's restaurant there is outstanding, but not cheap. Overall, the resort it outstanding. The Ko-Olina area itself is really growing up. A 2-bedroom condo will set you back AT LEAST $995k. That is for an appx. 1200 sq. ft. area including car port. It is secluded, but with a car you are pretty much able to get anywhere you need on the whole island. The airport is about 30 minutes away. It amazed me that some people complian this resort is in the flight path. But, the entire island is in the flight path. Silly! That is how you get there!!! ps-please excuse any spelling error.

We went on a time-share presentation package, before I go futher about the resort, I want to say the presentation was very nice with no pressure sales. We did not buy, and was still treated surperbly during the rest of our stay. Check in was real nice and easy, and the front desk staff were all extremely nice and professional. We stayed in a one-bedroom ocean front suite. We found the room to be very nice and spacious. Full kitchen, dining room, large bedroom with king bed, one bathroom with a tub and sink, another with a shower/toilet/sink. There was a flat screen t.v. in each room with RCA jacks, and a DVD player in the living room. There was also a washer/dryer hidden in the kitchen. In some of the previous reviews I read about some housekeeping issues. Because the rooms are considered Condos, they only provide daily \"tidy\" service. But to be honest, I felt the room was serviced just was well as if I was staying at a JW. The beds were made, bathrooms cleans, and garbage dumped. They only thing I don't think they do is wash your dishes. I felt the maid service was excellent. If you forget to bring your own DVDs, they have a DVD Kiosk at the market place where you can rent them for $5, or you can go to the town of Kapolei, about 10 minutes away and rent them at the Block Buster. The resort grounds were beautiful. There were two chilren friendly pools with very shallow depths at the ends. There is a sea water lagoon directly in front of the hotel at the beach. The resort has activites for all age groups throughout the day. Some are free, some have a nominal cost. As for meals, the resort has a BBQ type grill that is open near the pool area during the day, and the Kolohe's Bar and Grill at the beach which is open all day/evening. I believe there is another buffet type restaurent (we never visited it.). The Kolohe's Bar & Grill was very good. The entire staff were very friendly and professional. The price is not cheap, but typical for such a nice resort. Dinner for two with drinks will cost about $50 w/tip. Cocktails on the resort cost about $9, but during happy hour they are $7. There is also the \"Marketplace\" on the resort which carries all your basic vacation needs, souvenirs, sandwhiches, and salads. Since all the rooms have a kitchen you can also drive to the City of Kapolei which is about 5-10 minutes away. There you will find every fast food restaurant you can think of, a couple of pizza joints, a grocery store, drug store, post office, and video rental store. You'll have to pass by the area on your way in/out of the resort each day. I read some previous negative reviews about the airliner and construction noise. I did see the airplanes overhead, but only head the jet noises if I focused on them. As for the construction, again I could see the cranes, but never really noticed them or heard any construction noise unless I focused on listening for such noises. For the most part I was having fun, and neither of them ever bothered me. My only two negative comments, and they are both very minor, is that you usually have to wait to check in till about 3-4pm, so if you arrive in Oahu early, do some sight seeing, go shopping, do something to burn some time. Or if you go to the hotel they will let you use lockers so that you can start enjoying the resort grounds and pool until you are able to check in. The only other minor complaint is that the A/C is a little loud in the bedroom, but that might have just been in our room. Overall, we considered this one of the nicest resorts we have visited.

The rooms definitely swayed a bit {we were on 9th floor]! They had auxiliary lights on in hallways and stairwells and 1 elevator was working in our tower. Power was out from just after the quake at 7:07 until almost 3pm, but that was not Marriott's fault. My one complaint about this event, was that while they were able to grill burgers and such for lunch...they were charging full price for food. Now I understand it is a business and the quake wasn't there fault, but hey-- you have a captive audience and the food is going to spoil if you don't use it...so how about a price break? Oh well, what are you going to do? I had found a great price online with a timeshare presentation and an economy sized car. DH and I talked it over and thought it was worth the 90 minutes for the price we got. The timeshare turned out to be okay, very low pressure and we got out in 90 minutes without buying. It almost seemed like a good idea, but after thinking about it and talking with my sister who has a timeshare, we decided because they were practically impossible to resell, we were glad we didn't buy one. They make is sound great, very tempting and like a great deal, but when you factor every cost in...it wasn't as cheap a vacation as they made it out to be when you factored in all aspects of buying in. We left saying we would think about it and they never even called us back about it. We checked in and got an upgrade to a penthouse room, but it faced the golf course -- not the ocean. As we had already learned in other stays, ocean view was nice, but not necessary. The room was beautiful with 12 foot ceilings! It had a microwaves, toaster, mini-fridge and came with dishes, glasses, silverware, a box of guest amenities [everything from granola bars to coffee to dish soap and laundry detergent], in room safe. The building we were in is only 9 months old, so everything was nice and fresh and new. The colors were soft, tropical and made you feel relaxed. We had a sleeper sofa a chair, end table and coffee table in the little sitting area. The room is actually the lock-off of the two and three bedroom timeshare villas. There was no resort fee, free chairs and umbrellas on beach, free self park. In the villas, which have full kitchens, there are washer and dryer unit. But for the rooms like ours, there were free washers and dryers available on a couple of different floors in each tower. That was great; since we were in need of laundry facilities by the time we reached Oahu. There is building going on, but it did not bother us at all. The 2 pools are small, more to come with the new towers. We got two $25 gift certificates which had to be used for food or at shops, could not be used at check out which was a bit of pain. We arrived mid- afternoon and grabbed some sandwiches from the Marketplace shop at Marriott which did the job and didn't break the bank. On our first night we had dinner at the Kolohe's Beach Bar & Grill at the Marriott as it was there and we hadn\u2019t had time to explore the area as of yet. Had burger, salad and soup. Okay. A nice feature: barbeques that you could use near the pool allowed us to cook and eat in for 3 nights. We were so busy off and exploring,we never even made it into the lagoons! There were LOTS of kids [both preschool and school age] which we were surprised at...thought they'd be in school at this time of year. It made using the pool tough as they were throwing footballs and \"horseplaying\" in the pool. There is a town about 10 minutes away with Safeway, Long's Drug and a variety of average places to eat. While we wouldn't go back, it has more to do with our not really caring for Oahu as we did for the other islands we visited this trip.

My parents are members of the Marriott but this is the nicest one that I have been to. The grounds were beautiful and clean. The rooms are very spacious and clean, well planned and fully stocked with kitchen supplies. There is a grocery store in the nearby town that I would definitely suggest going to, as there are not many places to dine on the resort property. The only problems that we had with the resort was the location, lack of activities and dining facilities. However, as far as location, I think that this part of the island gets the most sun so it probably is the best location for a resort. The drive to the North Shore and Honolulu (Waikiki Beach) is not far at all. It takes about half an hour to get to either of these places. I would definitely suggest renting a car if you go to this resort, as you probably will want to see the rest of the island. The east and north coasts are beautiful and you would definitely want to see them if you go to Hawaii. As for the lack of dining facilities, they are working on a new restaurant right on the property which I don't know when it will be done. The poolside eating location that is currently there is good, but not too extensive and not a good place for a nice diner. If this is what you want, there is Roy's down the road and you can also go to Azule which is located at the JW Marriott which is not very far away (10 minute walk down the nice lit path that goes along the lagoons). This didn't present a problem to myself and my husband but is something to beare of. The lack of entertainment was a bit disappointing to us, but if you are into doing something like that, I guess the only suggestion that I have for you is that Waikiki isn't very far away and you may as well go there for an evening of fun. It's always got lots to do. As well there is a luau at Paradise Cove which is maybe a 2 minute drive that apparently is fun. We were told that the one at the resort on Tuesday nights is better, but if that's the case I wouldn't spend the money on Paradise Cove because the one at the resort was a big disappointment - I would definitely not suggest going to it. Go to the Introduction Night on Monday and you'll basically see the same stuff without paying for it. Or, just watch it from the outside and cook your own meal. It is NOT worth the $80 to go to it.

The resort is set next to a mountian range and industrial port. It's about a 25 minute drive to Waikiki (the island's most popular tourist spot) so even if you have a car, recognize it's not the kind of quick ride into the city from the hotel. H1 (the highway you must take) is often congested & backed up at all times of the day & evening, so be prepared for that as well. I'm 19 & live on the opposite end of the island. My parents came to visit for the week from the mainland & booked just the 1 bedroom villa for the week. I've been on many vacations with them since i was young but have never enjoyed the styling of our hotel as much as this one. Now this is not the hotel, its referred to as the Beach Club. The hotel is on the same compound but about a 2 minute drive/10 minute walk before the Beach Club. The \"Hotel\" looks noticibly older but still not bad. The open 2nd floor Lobby was very enjoyable at night with the cool breeze. One thing i disliked was the color choice inside the room with awkward use of green & yellow here and there, especially on the rails of the balcony. Also, during the day, there are airplanes flying quite low over the resort about every- 5-10 minutes. I couldn't imagine all of them coming from Kauai (the only Hawaiian island in the direction the planes come from) so they must mostly be from Asia and possibly Europe. Those were probobly the ONLY things i disliked about the resort, which is obviously quite petty. I like the idea of the sitting room for the master bedroom but found it too small to be useful. The design of both pools & even the ocean setup are great. The rocks further into the ocean allow gentle waves to break at the edge as opposed to some of the larger ones stopped at the rocks. The breakfast and lunch (which is the same menu as dinner) are very good and ALL the staff are extremly pleasant and friendly (as are most of the poeple native to this island).

In addition to Ko Olina, the sprawling Marriott oasis is also home to the J.W. Marriott Ihilani Resort, the highly rated Ko Olina Golf Course and four beautiful man-made ocean lagoons. Ko Olina Beach Club amenities include two swimming pools, Jacuzzi, health club/fitness center, golf academy, children's/adult's activities, on-site shuttle/transportation company, spa services, tour desk, beach rentals, business services & internet (wireless and kiosk), game room, jogging trails, tennis (Ihilani Resort), BBQ grills, and ocean-front wedding chapel. Food/Beverage: Kolohe's Beach Bar & Grill is an open-air restaurant with a casual oceanfront setting. Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, Kolohe's serves sandwiches, salads, appetizers and desserts. Several dinner specials are offerred after 5:30 P.M. and there is live entertainment nightly. We ate at Kolohe's twice and thought the food was average at best. The Marketplace is a combination deli, coffee shop, mini-grocery store and gift shop. Sandwiches, pastries, soda and Starbuck's coffee can be purchased at the deli. Grocery items are very expensive so we shopped at the local Safeway. The Marketplace does offer coffee/soda mugs for $25.00, which includes unlimited refills of those beverages for your entire stay. Ka 'Ulu Poolside Grill is open during lunch hours and serves hamburgers, sandwiches and salads to go. Komohana Terrace offers theme buffets Thursday through Sunday night. Currently, Ko Olina does not have a full service, sit-down restaurant. One is under construction with completion expected in December, 2006. Restaurants located at the J.W. Marriott Ihilani include Azul (Mediterranean), Ushio-Tei (Japanese) and Naupaka. Azul and Ushio-Tei are upscale while Naupaka offers informal dining for breakfast, lunch and dinner. There is also a Roy's Restaurant at the Ko Olina Golf Club, with free shuttle service provided. With the exception of Kolohe's, we did not dine anywhere else on site. Villas: The Ko Olina Beach Club features two and three bedroom units with \"lock-off\" capability. We stayed in the smaller side of a two bedroom lock-off; basically a studio with sitting area, L-shaped convertible sofa, small private lanai (patio) and efficiency kitchen (small refrigerator, micro-wave, dishes and utensils). Our unit was furnished with a queen-size bed, color T.V./D.V.D. player, radio, small wall safe, ceiling fan and hair dryer. The unit was fine, although our view of the ocean was blocked by the lanai of a larger unit next door. We did not tour the two and three bedroom units but saw them on Marriott's information channel. They appeared to be spacious, beautifully appointed and equipped with full kitchens and a clothes washer & dryer. Ocean Lagoons: The four man-made lagoons on the Marriott property extend from the J.W. Marriott Ihilani to just west of the Ko Olina Marina. One of the lagoons (#3) sits directly in front of the Ko Olina resort. All lagoons feature clean, gently sloped sandy beaches and afford safe swimming in the calm, protected waters. Snorkeling is very poor within the lagoons, however we did spot a few turtles in Lagoon #2. Tropical fish may be more prevelant in Lagoon #1, as the Ihilani staff conducts a fish-feeding there in the morning. Surrounding Area: The town of Kapolei is about 3 miles east of the resort. There you will find an abundance of fast-food restaurants, Chinese, Japanese and Italian restaurants, Chili's and Outback Steakhouse. Kapolei also has a Safeway and Long's Drug store. Hawaiian Waters Adventure Park is also within a five minute drive. The area west of the resort is an eye-sore. Although there are some nice beaches like Yokohama, the beach parking lots and areas between the main road and the beaches are inundated with people living in make-shift tents, camper shells and old vehicles. I did not feel comfortable leaving my vehicle unattended in these areas, so I didn't. I was also cautioned by a resort staff member to stay out of Waianae (8 miles west of the resort), as it was a \"rough town\". Haleiwa, on the North Shore, is about 25 miles from the resort. From there it's a short drive up to Turtle Bay, passing Waimea Bay, Sunset Beach and Shark's Cove along the way. Summary: The Ko Olina Beach Club Resort is well-maintained, has beautiful grounds and an exceptionally friendly staff. It's a little bit off the beaten path but a good choice, especially for a family who plans on spending most of their time enjoying the resort. I would consider returning to Ko Olina but with an upgrade to a larger unit. Additional photos of the resort are available upon request. Would also be willing to try and answer any questions. sceneisle48-loscabos@yahoo.com", "Date": "September 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kirkland, WA", "Title": "\u201cThe sheets need to be thrown away\u201d", "Author": "graciep", "ReviewID": "UR5814523", "Content": "We stayed at the Ko Olina 9/11/06 - 9/16/06.

Several weeks ago the Wall Street Journal did a column about hotels that are paying attention to travellers comments about sheets/beds and upgrading. Perhaps this hotel needs to read this article. I was stunned to find that the motel near the airport that we stayed for the last night, had better sheets. Overall the room was dirty. When checking under the bed for any items that may have rolled under, we discovered another guest's trash. The restaurant by the ocean should have/could have been a lot better.

A few quick notes for anyone planning on visiting the hotel. 1. If you do not have kids, DO NOT go. The resort is full of families with kids under 12. That being said, this place is great if you have kids. The pools are very well suited for younger kids with lots of shallow areas and islands. The ocean is also very shallow with no waves, so kids like it. Along with the kids comes the expected noise. So if you are looking for a quiet time by the pool you are not going to get it. 2. The beach area is very small. Although there is a nice path to walk along that connects the beach club to the JW you cannot take long walks along the beach. That brings me to my only really serious problem with the hotel. 3. There is construction and lots of it! Any time you look either to the left or right of the resort all you see are cranes and large dump trucks. And yes the trucks are loud, the beeping sound of trucks reversing was a constant by the pool. As well the path connecting the beach club to the JW gives you a nice tour of the construction sites. It is too loud in many points to even hear yourself talk. 4. The big plus of the place is the rooms. They are fantastic, nice big TVs, new furniture, great beds. Only problem is that I didnt come to Hawaii to sit in my hotel room. 5. As far as food goes, there is not too much around. The beach resturant is exepensive, but not too bad. If you dont have a car while you are there you will be disappointed. We ended up driving to Wikikii a few time. 6. With regards to the traffic, we did not experience any. If you try and avoid rush hour it is only about a 25 min drive into town. Bottom line... If you are a family this is a great place... if you a honeymooner dont bother!", "Date": "August 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Morton Grove, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cDon't miss a tour\u201d", "Author": "passionatpenquin", "ReviewID": "UR5615656", "Content": "This resort is truly paradise.

Others have commented on the lack of amenities and we would agree so I won't address that. When we checked our villa ended up being a very small room with a short double bed. The deck was so small that there was barely enough room for the table and chairs and no way for someone to get to the second chair without crawling over the table. The view from the deck, if there was one, was completely blocked by a palm tree that was right in from of the deck. There was a wall extending out a ways from the north side of the deck that completely blocked any view in that direction. The kitchen (mind you no eating facilities on the property--except the snack bar by the pool) consisted of a tiny microwave, a coffee maker and a small refrigerator. We stayed all of 20 minutes and went to check out and find another place. The reception people appeared surprised. They offered to refurn us $500 of the $700+ that we'd paid for the package--but we haven't seen that yet. But they told us we couldn't keep the car and had to turn it back in. We did that the next day after driving into Honolulu and getting a room on Waikiki (which I like much better than out there), and it only cost be $85 to have the car for one day.

Currently, the resort consists of 2 towers, with 2 more towers being constructed. The resort is away from Waikiki, which can be a positive or negative depending on how you look at it. Because it\u2019s a timeshare and it\u2019s located away from Waikiki, the resort is primarily comprised of families. PROS: (1) Room. We received a 1 BR villa and it was extremely spacious. The 1 bedroom could have slept 4 since it included a pull out couch. The villa included a large bedroom, living room (with pull out couch), dining room, separate tub and shower, fully stocked kitchen, washer and dryer and balcony. If you are able to upgrade to the villa, it\u2019s probably worth the cost. (2) Pool. The resort had 2 pools. We never had a problem getting a chair at the pool. In addition, there are a few jacuzzis around the pool, one of which is adults only. (3) Grocery store. There is a Safeway grocery store that is a 10 minute drive from the resort. There are also a couple chain restaurants in the same shopping center. So while there aren\u2019t a lot of dining options at the resort, you can cook your own meals. There is also a convenience store on-site, which is useful if you forgot to pick up something at Safeway. (4) Fitness center. There is a nice fitness center on site. It includes cardio equipment, machines and free weights. (5) Activities. There are a variety of activities for kids (and adults) throughout the day. For the poker players, there is a Hold \u2018Em tournament on Thursday nights. Also, the Ko Olina golf course (directly next to the resort) was a nice course, but pretty windy. (6) Timeshare presentation. We attended the Ko Olina through a special package from Marriott Vacations, even though we were under no obligation to attend the timeshare presentation. However, we ended up attending the presentation and we received 2 free tickets to go watch the dolphins and snorkel (a combined $200 value). At no time did I feel pressured into buying the timeshare. The sales person was not very pushy and the presentation was extremely informative. If you are offered a package to go to the Ko Olina, go ahead and take advantage of it. You get a great price on a vacation and a bonus gift if you decide to do the sales presentation. CONS: (1) Dining options. Since the resort is relatively new, they don\u2019t have all the dining options of a more established resort. The resort hosts a buffet dinner during Thursday \u2013 Sunday. Other than that, the resort is limited to 1 restaurant that serves lunch and dinner and a few \u201ctake out\u201d type food stands, all of which were reasonably priced. On the positive, immediately next to the resort is a JW Marriott and Roy\u2019s. You can reach both places by walking or taking the resort shuttle (which runs every 30 minutes). As mentioned above, you can buy groceries at the grocery store and cook meals in your villa. The resort also has 8 grills that are available for guest use. (2) Views. Not that it\u2019s a huge deal, but if you don\u2019t get a pool/ocean view, you\u2019re stuck staring at the parking lot and a refinery. (3) Windy. Once again, it\u2019s not a huge deal, but the resort is pretty windy. Most of the week I was there, 4 of the grills were shut down due to high winds. Also, the wind makes the golf course pretty difficult. Overall, I was extremely pleased with my stay at the Ko Olina. If I were to come back to Oahu, I\u2019d definitely return to the Ko Olina.

We we offered a time share presentation package and upgraded for $100 to the 1 bedroom suite that had the full kitchen, dining table and separate master bedroom. This is basically their villa minus the lockoff room. I have to say, if you ever get one of these presentation packages, that includes the car rental and the $50 gift certif's, take it! The accomodations were the best we've ever stayed in. They don't do \"room service\" at these places, but rather \"tidy service\" which was good enough for us. They put us on the 10th floor, that overlooked the construction but since we were there over the weekend, there was none for 2 whole days. Otherwise, yes, you could see the refinery, but everywhere else was blue ocean and lots to be seen from our floor advantage. As far as the resort, one word sums it all.... WOW. The 2 pools were a tough choice for our 6 year old, so we swam in both of them. On the first night, I just layed down in the first step of the pool, about 1/2 way submerged looking skyward towards dusk, with live music in the background. it couldn't get better than that. There are two places to eat pool side, one is sit down and one is \"carry out\" and both were not bad and prices were fair. of course, we used the gift certif's towards all purchases. They do have a sit down buffet, but $$$$ so didn't do it. On tuesdays they have \"FIA FIA\" you know, the polynesian show. Tix are again $$$$ about $70 per adult and $35?? for the children. But the show is really good. The building is right above lagoon # 3, and on the first day, we saw turtles towards the west side of the lagoon towards the rocks, every day, feeding about 3:30 pm. There were two there, during our stay, and I have to say that was the highlight for me personally. The lagoon had lots do rent, and some fishlife. Lagoon # 2 is supposed to have more to see if you want to snorkel. Since we had the full kitchen, we did head into Kapolei to the safeway to stock up and prepare a few meals ourselves. The drive is about 10 min. and open 24 hours, so very convenient. We ended up driving there almost every day however, to eat out.

We read all the reviews ahead of time so pretty much knew what to expect; we were also enticed by the 6-day, 5-night promo for $750. However, we asked to be upgraded when making the iniital reservation and told that was not possible, and that it was not possible to extend our reservation (for the regular rate) in the same room. So we decided to move to an ocean-view room for our last 3 nights and booked the reservation accordingly. Unlike the previous poster, we asked for an upgrade upon check-in but were told we could not upgrade with the package. When we moved to our \"ocean view\" room, after the hassle of packing everything up & out, we were disappointed to find that we were booked on the 4th floor, with a view of the pool and tree tops. No ocean view. We had specifically requested a high floor at check-in. We went back to the front desk and after some checking and explaining that the higher floors were reserved for \"owners\", the clerk had us look at another room in a different tower - still on the 4th floor, but we decided to be open-minded and checked that one out. That room was also NOT ocean-view - the view was of the hillside adjacent to the property and the large construction cranes. We went back to talk to the manager, who basically said there was nothing else he could do. He agreed to adjust our rate back to an island-view rate. So ... that is all to say BEWARE of the \"ocean-view\" designation - if you are on floors 3-5 it will not be an ocean view. Despite the disappointment in the views, the rooms were OK - we had a standard guest room - it was very small but nicely appointed. Having a small sink, microwave, and fridge was very handy, we had a simple breakfast in the room each day and saved a lot of $$. If you book a 1 or 2 bedroom condo, you will have a full kitchen, which would have been even better! The grounds are very nice - well maintained, nice pools (our two kids, ages 8 & 11, spent hours in them), nice beachwalk joining the marina and the two hotels. The kids enjoyed the \"MAZE\" activities each day (such as origami, hula lessons, PS2 tournament) and we even booked them into the Keiki Beach Club at the JW Marriott for a nice adult day, and they enjoyed that, too. I agree with all of the other reviews stating that it is a very nice place, but I doubt we will return. They have big plans for the area, but for now the food choices are very limited and the lagoons, while great for swimming and OK for snorkeling, do get a little boring after several days. We didn't mind driving around to other parts of the island, so the remote location wasn't a detriment (except for lack of dining options). The second tower just opened the day we arrived, so I think they are still adjusting to the larger numbers of guests - the beach cabanas and poolside chairs were full before 10am during the weekend days. I will say they did a good job of making up for some slight problems we experienced - our fridge petered out one day and they replaced it immediately and credited our account $25 for the groceries that spoiled, and offered us a free cabana rental when we came down early one morning and they were already booked up.

While my wife and I did not bring our 9 month old and 31/2 year old we almost wished we did because the lagoon's were like a lake. The only downside is there are not many options for food and the cafe on the beach next to the pool is very mediocre, we found ourselves walking next door to the Marriott hotel and eating at their poolside cafe where the grilled fish sandwhich was to die for. For dinner you can go to the Marriott hotel next door, which I don't advised since the restaurants are overpriced and above average but nothing spectacular. Although on the other hand walking to dinner our last night and whathing the sunseet was one of the highlights of our trip. We headed into Waikiki for later dinners around 8p.m. and found it no problem. We also went into the local town where the Safeway is and had Boston North End Pizza which rivaled great pizza I've had in Manhattan. All in all a beautiful resort, and if you're going to stay in Oahu the best option I've seen away from the hustle and bustle but close enough to get a glimpse if you want to.", "Date": "June 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "SLC, Utah", "Title": "\u201cBest Place on Oahu to stay hands down!\u201d", "Author": "elcapoalto", "ReviewID": "UR5147517", "Content": "I just returned from my first trip ever to Hawaii. I was expecting it to be fun, but this property turned this trip into the BEST vacation I have ever been on! I have worked in the hotel business for 5+ years and also had to travel for another job, so it takes a lot to impress me. The staff was top of the line. I was checked in by Sunshine (yes that's really her name) She was extraordinary pleasant and patiently answered all my questions. The bell staff was equally friendly and held our bags for us so that we could enjoy the day until we could check-in. All of the staff was helpful and did there very best to remember who you were. We ran into Sunshine later our first night at the Safeway, she immediately recognized us and said hello, she even let us use her Safeway card so that we didn't have to spend a small fortune on our groceries. Tracey at the hotel operator desk was always polite, friendly, professional, and friendly. They all did their best to make you feel like you were in your neighborhood back at home and surrounded by friends. The property itself was amazing. You walk into an open air lobby and can see the ocean and the pools. The breeze was very refreshing and the quiet Hawaiian music help set the stage for a very soothing vacation. There is a peacefulness at this property that you can't find in Waikiki or Honolulu. The rooms were nice and well appointed. We stayed the first part of our stay in the new tower (#2) and the last half in the original tower. Both were nicely furnished. The older tower doesn't have the newest Flat screen (not flat panel) TV's like the new tower, but other than that all of the other amenities are pretty much identical. As they have not completed the entire property there are something that aren't there yet. There are only two of the four or five pools that will be there, and where the marketplace (sundry shop) is right now there will eventually be another restaurant. The lagoons don't have the best array of fish to see yet, but in time they will be teaming with fish. The beaches are perfect for just sitting and watching the gorgeous sunsets or taking a swim. The entire property is kept very clean. We went to the JW Marriott Ihilani hotel to eat one night, the food was decent, the ambiance fare, but that property pales in comparison to the beach club. This was the only time in my life that when it came time for the vacation to be over I wasn't ready for it to end. I will definitely be back to this property, it is a good way to get away from it all and really enjoy your stay on Oahu. This property gets two enthusiastic thumbs up, five-star, a perfect 10.

(Don't confuse the Beach Club with the JW Marriott Hotel next door. The Beach Club is new and is a Timeshare.) I received an offer in the mail for a 5 night stay at the Beach Club and thought it sounded like a good deal, tho I had NO intention of going to Hawaii (I had been to Maui once a few yrs. ago.) but the more I looked into it the more I liked the sound of 5 days on the beach of Hawaii....so I booked it! I had read the reviews on this site, prior to going and most were positive, but I learned valuable info. from both. I did not know when I received the offer that it was for a Timeshare as it never mentioned that. I found out later that because I live in the state of Minnesota they can not say it's a Timeshare! So, I was a little leary about being pushed into a presentation and offer to purchase, but still thought it was too good of a good deal to pass up and I was RIGHT! A long time friend of mine went with me and we upgraded our room (for a mear $100.00 one time fee) and got a spectacular, finely decorated, clean, new room with a full kitchen including washer & dryer! I knew, from reading on this site, to stop at the Safeway for groceries on the way in, which we did. I also knew that the resort was a little way from the \"action\", but since I use to live & drive in L.A., the 30 minute drive into the \"cities\" was nothing! I did hang out one day/eveing at Dukes in Waikiki and found that I was really happy to NOT be staying in the cities and enjoyed the peace of the beach on the 4 lagoons at Ko Olina! it's true most of the people at Ko Olina are families or married couples, but I didn't mind and they also told us that the 4th building will be 25+ with it's own pool, jacuzzi's etc. We stayed in building 2, which is brand new (matter of fact they are still putting furniture in some of the rooms). Now, I can see where some ppl. could be turned off by the resort. The resort is SPECTACULAR in MANY ways, but if you do not understand that it's a new facility (and a timeshare) and because of this, some things aren't available YET, you could be disapointed by a few thing. Here are a few things to remember:: 1) The lagoons are beautiful and spacious with white sand beachs, palm trees, lounge chairs, bathrooms and cabanas to rent. But, if your expecting to go out to the rocks snorkeling and see beautiful hawaiian fish you will be disappointed. Reason being the lagoons are man-made and the rocks were placed there. There are fish there, but not many as I saw in Maui, but they are starting to live in the rocks and over time they will thrive. You can rent snorkel, paddle boats etc. from the hotel, which is nice. 2) The only restaurant at the Resort is the grill by the ocean. The menu is sparse, but does have salads, sandwiches, kids menu and good drinks. You can walk on the nice paved path, by the ocean, to the JW Marriott where they have other options. I also hear Roy's on the golf course is good, but we didn't make it there. The Marketplace at the Resort does carry many grocery items, including frozen pizzas, salads, ice cream and all beverages including a coffee bar. They do have dinner specials on several night that is buffet style. I didn't do this either, but it looked and smelled good. There is also the option to go to the Laua on Tues. eve. for a price. So again, stop at the Safeway on the way in as the Market place does have decent options but you will pay more. Oh, there is a Steak Dog cart outside the Marketplace that myfriend kept saying she wanted to try, but we never got there either! (There is just so much to do and see!) 3) It's a Timeshare, so do not expect full housekeeping services. They say that they will change towels, provide tolietries, load and unload the dishwasher, but to have the place vacumed or sheets changed it would cost . (I can't remember, but it was something like $6.00) Now, one time we left a few dishes in the sink and they were washed, but on another occasion we did a dishwasher load and they weren't put away. None of this bother me and I prefer to have my own space and not use the housekeeping unless needed. The room is like a very nice apt. so I felt like it was mine and therefore I could clean up after myself. So, if your expecting your sheets to be turned down at night with a chocolate left on the pillow you will be disappointed. 4) I saw that someone complained about the security and video survelience. I see this as a sign of the times. It is a 5 star resort and they want to keep it that way. I went to Maui and never went out at night except to other \"tourist\" hot spots because I din't feel safe. I can say I NEVER felt threatened at Ko Olina in anyway. You can walk around at night and feel at ease, which was a big plus for me being female. One night I ran into a young girl who had drank WAY to much and was hanging with 2 young guys she didn't know. Her brother got her drunk then left her by the pool with these 2 boys, at night! Well, my friend and I hung with her as she was in no way able to control herself. The staff at Ko Olina saw us and asked if we were ok. My friend explained the situation and they kept their distance, but went in surch of her parents. She was all worried she would be in trouble, but the staff handled it VERY well and even gave my friend and I tickets to the Laua to thank us. Now I'm not a parent but I would be happy to know that they just didn't turn their back on her thinking, \"Oh it's Hawaii everyone is drunk\"! which I what I have encontered at other places. So, you have to stop at the gate at the beginning of the propertyand tell them where your heading it's not that big of a deal. After day 2 the gate people knew who we were and they were always friendly. The property is gated, but this doesn't mean others can't get in, but it would deture ppl. who are up to no good from entering. They do allow ppl. not staying on the property to come and enjoy the lagoons etc. and I met 2 ppl. who were doing just that beacuse they heard the property was so nice. 5) We didn't encounter any construction problems, but you should ask when you book if it's going on as they have 2 more buildings to build. Here are the PLUSES and they outway the minuses by a LONG shot! BEAUTIFUL - BEAUTIFUL - BEAUTIFUL! The property is landscaped beautifully with a golf course across the street. So one side is the ocean and the other a golf course! The resort has 2 black bottom swimming pools, one that is sandy, 4 jacuzzis with one of them close to the beach. The fitness room is very nice and the locker room has a sauna and steam room. They provide towels for the gym and pool/beach. The staff is so nice! Everyone is welcoming and always happy to help you out. We even went the wrong way once in surch of something and when we flagged down a staff member driving a golf cart to ask for directions they gave us a ride to it! The staff rmembers you and asks how your stay is going and if you need anything without being pushy! Matter of fact I was VERY surprised that they wern't more pushier! After I found out it was a Timeshare I thought oh No we will have to hear them pitch us the entire time, but I was way wrong! They left a msg. upon our arrival telling us we had a welcome pkg. waiting for us. Again, since I thought I was going to have to hear them tell me that I needed to take a tour I waited to pick up the welcome pkg. till the next to the last night. This was a BIG mistake! By then I decided I did want to take a tour because I wanted to see what they had to offer and knew I had friends who would be interested. So when went down to get our welcome pkg. and signed up for a tour the next morning, before catching our plane. (Again, I thought this will be my way out! They can't push to hard when they know I have to catch a plane!) Come to find out our welcome pkg. included a $25.00 gift certificate each and beacuse we did sign up for a tour we also received $50.00 more each! Total of $150.00 to spend on our last night! We spent it on our meal and then shopped for souveniers at the Marketplace, but I wish I would have gotten them earlier, so my food for the stay would have been free! As they continue to build (total of 740 villas when completed) they will also be including more dining options, pools etc. So, I thought I was being sly to do the tour the next morning and then off to the plane! Little did I know that I realy did enjoy the tour and found the woman I dealt with to not be pushy in anyway and even asked what can I do for you, what do you wan to know? I have always liked Marriott's and learned about their partnerships with others and the travel options etc. Now, growing up in Florida when Timeshares first started I had a VERY NEGATIVE feeling towards them. I was always told....run as fast as you can...it's a SCAM! During our tour I found out that allot has changed and they answered all my questions and concerns. The more I learned the more Iliked the idea of being an \"owner\". so mush so that my friend and I ened up making the purchase! We did a split purchase on a 2 bdrm. mountain view every other yr. I could get into all the other great reasons to invest and what you get, but I think this review has been long enough! The long & the short of it is this. If you received the \"special offer\" and have any interest in going to Hawaii, DO IT! You will never again find such a great deal! Upgrade your room (for $10.00, it's well worth it) Oh, we also got a rental car in the deal, which I upgraded for $124.00 / 6 days for a convertible Mustang w/ a full tank of gas! If you have no intention of purchasing, STILL GO, you DON'T have to take the tour, they won't hold it over your head! But, I do reccommend you signup for the tour, get the gift certificates and see what they have to offer. Either way you stay in a wonderful place with a wonderful room and a wonderful staff! YOU CAN'T LOOSE! If you would like further info from me on my stay please send me an e-mail.

There really is nothing to do at this resort besides lay by the small pool which is chock full of kids or at the lagoon.

The 1- and 2-bedroom villas are spacious and nicely decorated in a tropical theme. Don't bother with the guest rooms--if you are not staying in a villa you might as well stay in a hotel and get hotel amenities. The villas are completely furnished with a kitchen, plates, microwaves, and so on. If you have kids they will appreciate the extra space. There are two pools, neither of which go over 4 feet. One has a sand bottom with a beach entry, perfect for toddlers. The other has a terraced floor that progresses from 6\" to 4 feet and has an island in the middle. Older kids like this one better. They also have 4 jacuzzis that are tuned down so kids don't get cooked. Giant shaved ice cones are served for $4. Dining options are poor, therefore you should go stock up at the Safeway in Kapolei and do you own thing in the kitchen, which may more comfortable for you anyway with kids. The lagoons are great for kids. There is some snorkeling but it's not great. There are daily activities for kids, like arts & crafts, making root beer floats, ping pong tournaments, etc. Not really adult stuff. There is an emphasis on security at this place--I guess they want to make sure locals don't sneak in and use the facilities. Again, parents with kids may appreciate this, while others won't like the hassle. The housekeeping service is inconsistent and poor--they don't vacuum or sweep up sand unless you pay extra, and they don't always do even the minimums. This is one of the biggest negatives.

Apartment was nicely furnished. View was truly horrible. We looked out at (1) a parking garage (2) an industrial area complete with several refineries. We\u2019re from New Jersey and my older son made a joke about getting a \u201cGarden State view\u201d instead of a \u201cGarden view\u201d (though the hotel told me it was a mountain view). Hotel said that lots of guests had complained. They couldn\u2019t move us but in the end credited us with $100 because of the awful view. The property and in fact the whole area around it is under construction. I suspect that even some of the better views will be in jeopardy. There was very little to do in terms of resort activities (as compared to other resorts where we\u2019ve stayed) Perhaps one activity per age group per day? There are two pools, pretty, but nothing special, and a beach cove. Perhaps if you are a lie around the pool all day person it would be ok, but we\u2019re only good for a few hours of that and otherwise like to do things. We went off property and did activities in Honolulu and spent one rainy PM at the movies. Note that getting to and from Honolulu around rush hour is a disaster. We had a tour of Shangri-La scheduled at 8:30am and needed to leave by 6:45am. We ate largely off property, occasionally in the room. One son had a hamburger at the grill. We had dinner at Roy\u2019s, which was okay, but not nearly as good as the original Roy\u2019s near Hanauma Bay. The tone of the resort is a bit weird. When you enter through the gate there are signs informing you that you will be under surveillance. At the timeshare presentation (we didn\u2019t buy) they emphasized that you are under video and audio surveillance all the time including at the beach (via fiber optics) and that, while the beach is nominally public they limit access to outsiders by restricting beach parking. (This is actually pretty ridiculous because there is lots of parking available throughout the resort area.) Then, when we were at the beach (a nice cove, but no fish to be seen), my husband and the boys built a sand castle and one of the beach guards came over and said \u201cNice job, make sure to knock it down as soon as you leave to prevent beach erosion.\u201d We have built sand castles all over the world and this is the first time anyone has ever said anything like this. There is no way a sand castle is contributing to beach erosion (although my husband did say it gave him a feeling of power :-). Even if it did, would knocking it down help? This guard was quite authoritarian. The extra space at the Marriott was nice, but we\u2019ve achieved this in the past via a home rental for comparable or lower $\u2019s. The pools and activities weren\u2019t comparable to other resorts (e.g. the Hilton Waikoloa where we went next). The view was horrible, rendering the lanai pretty useless.

The resort is much better for children then Waikiki. Much more private, newer and clean. The children had freedom; the parents relaxed. The only possible downsides: there is constuction going on. Two more buildings are planned. The second wing of the second building is still being fitted out. The construction did not cause a problem. The view will not be so great from half of building 1 once construction starts on building 3. Also, all of the \"mountain view\" rooms in building two and most of the \"mountain view\" rooms in building 1 do not have a pretty view at all.

We have 3 kids, ages 6-13, and they enjoyed every aspect of the place. There are two pools, a beach-entry pool with a large sandy wading area which is perfect for toddlers, and a larger pool with a center island surrounded by deeper areas. The landscaping is beautiful, and the service without fault. The poolside service areas have plenty of towels, cold water, toys, and games. At the lagoon you can rent kayaks, cabanas, water bikes, etc. There are four lagoons in the develpment which are usually calm and clear, with a fish feeding in the morning which brings in many of the local fish for easy viewing. The rooms are the usual marriott condo size - 2 bdrm around 1200 sq ft, they're furnished with a beautiful hawaiian plantation style and are equipped with w/d, full kitchen, marble bathrooms, sitting area outside the master with floor to ceiling windows to take in the view. The downside - The location is about 20 minutes away from Honolulu, and about 45 minutes away from our favorite beaches on the Kailua side. Trips to honolulu and the airport have to be timed around rush hour, which is almost as bad as any large city. The tradeoff is in the peaceful atmosphere though - much better over Waikiki and kind of hard to find in Oahu these days. There are many casual restaurants, a Safeway, Longs, cinema and Kmart just a few miles away in Kapolei. Bottom line - it's a great place to relax and get away from it all, but not recommended for the first time tourist to hawaii as it's too far from all the sightseeing (except Pearl harbor).

We found the service and staff to be top notch, they go out of their way to be friendly and helpfull. We were totally impressed that they had preprinted directions to a everything we were interested in going to from Costco to the Northshore to Hanama Bay to the Aquarium at Waikiki Beach. The logoons were interesting but due to extemely high wave action the water was not as clear as we had seen on a previous visit. Note: Jellyfish can be a problem in the lagoons due to a lunar cycle they are usually present from the full moon to 8 to 10 days after EVERY month. We did not experience any problems with jellyfish since the cycle had just completed. Lagoon 3 is where the resort is located and it had rentals for snorkal gear, kayaks, and even new learn to surf lessons. The beach has private two person cabanas for rent or free lounges. There usually were lounges available whenever we wanted them. They also feed the fish every morning in lagoon 1 at 7:30, it'w worth the walk down to try it out. The pools are very family friendly with two large pool areas they never felt crowed even over the prime holiday season. The workout room was excellent and never really crowded. The restaurant choices on-site are a little limited but the food was good in both. The JW Illini Marriot had more choices and down the road about 5 miles were a number or restaurants plus a Safeway. The property does have two gas grills and utensils to grill with so you can pick up some steaks or chicken at the grocery store and have a nice picnic at the resort. One of the highlights of our stay was on New Years Eve the JW Marriot has a fireworks show over Lagoon 1. It was far better than we anticipated or expected. They supposedly have the fireworks every New Years Eve and for those of you lucky enough to be there its worth the time to go see the show.

Kmart has reasonably priced souvenirs, by the way. Also, our mid week tidy did not include sweeping, evidently. Everywhere else we went on OAHU was packed with tourists.

The place is awesome, especially for families with kids. We were in a 1 bedroom 1 bathroom villa with a full kitchen and dining area/living room with a separate master bedroom. The place was near empty Tuesday through Friday but finally picked up some on the weekend. We had the pools and lagoons nearly to ourselves all week with great weather. There are two big pools that are both tropically themed. Both have zero entry which is great for the kids and one has a little sandy beach at the entry point. There are also 4 large hot tubs in the pool area. Try a shaved ice down by the pool. $4.00 for the biggest shaved ice you'll ever see! There is also a great workout room by the pool area as well as a full sauna and steam room in the adjacent locker rooms. The hotel sits in the Ko Olina development which is a 640 acre resort which when finished (more hotel, housing, restaurant development) is going to be great but alot more crowded. The lagoons are great for swimming and kids. The hotel is next to lagoon 3. There are 4 lagoons with lagoon 1 being the biggest lagoon, but 3 has equipment rentals (kayaks, pedal boat etc.) We went to the Hawaiian Gardens Water park (exit 1B) one day and is was a blast. It is about 5 minutes driving from the hotel and had enough attractions for both adults and kids. It's about 25 acres so it's easy to navigate through. They had a kids area, big and small slides, wave pool, lazy river etc. In town (5 min exit 1A) they had everything you need (Safeway, Longs, Kmart, fast food, as well as the Outback Steakhouse, Hana Sushi, and lots of other restaurant choices. The drive over to Waikiki was easy (H-1 to the Nimitz Hwy) and took about 35 minutes (at 10am). With the crowds and congestion over in that area and Honolulu it was great to get back to the Ko Olina.

No noise from the construction next door (building is almost completed). This resort is isolated but we knew that before we traded. However, it was nice to drive 25 minutes to Wakiiki and then leave the rat race back to KoOlina. This is a new resort so it is currently lacking enough restaurants. This will change rapidly over the next few years! Only complaint was the golf course. The course was beautiful but we were not told that the greens had just been areated and for $160 you expect manicured greens! Also, beleive it or not, you have to PAY FOR RANGE BALLS!!! $160 green fees and they nail you for range balls!!! I have never paid $100 + for green fees and then then had to pay for range balls (I play a lot of golf folks)! One final thing about the golf course which you may find hard to beleive. Around the 10th hole there was a large barrell of small water bottles. We assumed that like most good courses that they were there for the players (especially at $160 green fees) so we took a couple bottles and moved on. When we finished our round I put one of the bottles on our car while we loaded our clubs. A few minutes later this guy comes running out telling us that the \"Pro\" told him that we took water bottles from the tourney!!! What tourney? There was no sign by the barrell. The he asked us if we had more bottles in our bags (we're talking about small water bottles here folks)!!! I told him we not aware that they were for the tourney but he seemed upset that we took their water. We later called and complained to the Manager and he offered us a future discount. I told him we had no plans on returning to his course! Anyway, a sad experience to an otherwise great vacation.

For those guests who gave the Ko Olina a \"harsh\" review, you should try staying at other time share resorts before you are so critical. First of all, the nature of timeshares is that you do not receive daily maid service unless you request it and then at additional cost. The Ko Olina is very secluded, however, if you have visited Waikiki and observed the \"wall-to-wall\" bodies lying on the beach, you might appreciate the beauty of Ko Olina and its manmade lagoons. The southwest coast of Oahu makes accessibility to Oahu's reknowned north shore a breeze. The north shore beaches are a great adventure. Turtle beach is exceptional for swimming with great sea turtles (FYI- no bathrooms or food/drink at this beach so be prepared). Sunset beach is also beautiful!! Ko Olina is also approx. 30 minutes away from the old surf town of Haleiwa. We recommend Haleiwa Joe's for eating. Reasonable prices, great service! Any documentation we received or read regarding the Ko Olina emphasizes that the resort is ONLY in phase 2 of four phases of construction. Construction noise is to be expected and was minimal during our stay. We thought Ko Olina's version of a luau which was called \"Fia Fia night\" was very good. If you've ever been to a more authentic luau you probably would enjoy this one much more! The food at Fia Fia was pretty good and the entertainment was enjoyable!

When I complained again, I was told \"if you can see the ocean from any locale in your room..it's an ocean view\". The manager told me that they reserve the better views for 'owners' only.

Our stay started on a sour note immediately when we checked in. I received our room keys, parked the car, and was taking my luggage up to my room. As soon as I exited the elevator, the front desk clerk was waiting for me to tell me I was given the wrong room. There I ran into the man who was given my room by mistake and he told me he had been having problems with the front desk staff from the moment he checked in and was extremely upset with them. We were taken to our new room and were told a bellman would be sent up with our new keys within 10 minutes. A half hour later we had still not received our keys and my wife went down to the desk to get them. She returned with keys that didn't work and had to go back a third time to finally get it right. The rooms they rent as hotel rooms are only 1/3 of an entire condo. There is a connection door to the other 2/3 of the condo and you can hear just about everything going on in that room. We were woken up twice in the early morning by someone calling the empty room about six times over a half hour period. The noise from the hallway is also quite loud and the interior walls don't keep any noise out. These 1/3 rooms are smaller than a standard hotel room but do have a mini fridge and microwave as well as a balcony with a small table and chairs. The furniture and bathroom are also very nice. The housekeeping service was poor. Sand on the tile floor was not swept and the carpets were not vacuumed. Our fridge also stopped working and we were told that if you set it too cold it would automatically start to defrost itself. We set it lower, but the problem continued. It would be cold for part of the day, then warm when it defrosted itself. The property is nice, although much is still under construction. There are still two more buildings scheduled for the resort, plus a Ritz Carlton that will go up next door. Construction noise wasn't much of an issue, though. The beach areas are nice. There are five man-made lagoons that stetch between the Ihilani hotel and past this resort. All have calm water and a large beach area and there is a lighted walkway that connects them. Although all are public, there weren't crowd problems at any of them. Overall this is not a terrible place to stay, however for the money they charge this is not the level of service I would expect. I would not return here for $300+ and was certainly not impressed with their \"5 Star Service\".", "Date": "July 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cVery nice place, pretty room, nice staff, great for children\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3621652", "Content": "Well first I have to say that we picked this Mariott because we had 4 free nights to stay in a Marriott and we had already stayed in the Waikiki area.

I agree with the folks that wrote about seeing this side of the island, north of Koolina - I wouldn't bother venturing out - it is run down for Hawaii. If you plan to visit Honolulu, I would stay over on that end and go east of the city which is lovely.

The room (we were in a smaller \"lockout\" section) was new, clean, nice, but not great. It was basically a large hotel room, perhaps a nice step above a newer Courtyard. We ate on the patio every morning and I had to trip over my wife's chair to get myself back into my little corner to eat. There are mosquitoes on this part of the island, and this prevented us from opening the patio door at night to enjoy the breezes. Disappointing for an ocean front setting.

You must have a car if you expect to see any of Oahu while staying at this hotel. After breakfast and a very pleasant walking trail along the beach, we headed out to the north shore, the east shore, Waikiki - anywhere. There is simply not much to do or see near the resort other than the expected Marriott sponsored activities (pool, golf, beach). The beach \"lagoons\" are so buffered from the sea they almost seem to be wading pools. Perfect for families with children. Disappointing for those wanting to play in the surf (go to Sandy Beach). We never ate at the Resort. The food seemed overpriced for a captive audience. Our best find was \"El Fuego\" at the shopping center by Safeway. This is a fast food joint and we had an excellent seared Ahi that rivaled fine restaurant fare. Dinner for two was $18 - of course you eat on styrofoam. In short, we had an extremely pleasant stay at the Ko Olina. It might be better suited for families than couples. There sure were a ton of kids there during our stay.

This property is NOT the JW Marriott as other reviewers have mistakenly stated. This is the time share building. I won't be back to this property.

The 1 bedroom rooms have a full kitchen, dining area, pull out sofa bed and nice balcony, the guest rooms that adjoin the 1 bedroom units (lock offs) have a refrigerator and bar area, small balcony, bed and sofa bed. The resort gets 4 stars primarily because it is a timeshare and NOT a fine class hotel (like the JW Marriott located on the opposite end of the property).

Here are some tips to save some money while in Oahu and the Beach Club. The first thing I did was to order an Entertainment Book for Hawaii. It listed all the islands but there was plenty of Oahu restaurants and activities. There were discounts for Polynesian Cultural Center, Dole Whips at the Dole Plantations, and not to forget many of the restaurants that had buy one, get one free. We also stopped at the Kmart and bought a big cooler to keep in the rental car. Each morning, we would fill up the cooler with ice and drinks for the day. This saved so much money and we never had to stop and pay for drinks. Also, take advantage of the coupons in the airport brochures. Make sure you find Sean O'Reilly at the cabana stations. He will give you great ideas of what you need to do on the island. He has a special recommendation for a beach that is great for body surfing. We also grilled burgers on the outdoor grill one night which is near the towel station. The beach club is beautiful, as well as the rooms. Make sure you buy some laundry detergent while you're there and do a little wash. I was convinced that I wasn't going to do laundry on vacation but was glad I did when I came home and most of the clothes were clean. Remember that the washer is small, so the loads really need to be small. If you are traveling to the North Shore on your way to the Polynesian Cultural Center, make sure that you stop at Ted's Bakery. They have a wonderful selection of pies and cakes at reasonable prices.
