On arrival we told it was breakfast and lunch and they would not change it. Despite having numerous restaurants in the hotel the food was not suitable for us (we do not like spicy food). The swimming pool area was disappointing, the beds were broken and the pool area was very dirty/dusty (this would have been from the building work going on all around). We were not provided with towels for the pool. The bedroom was clean and spacious but out dated. We had plenty bath towels. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Room service was good. However we did ask several times for milk cartons to make tea in the room - which never arrived. The noise from the nightclub/disco, which started at 9pm, continued every night throughout 7-night stay until 3.00am every morning. We were put into a very nice room on the first night of our stay on the 2nd floor. The noise was so bad we requested a move the next day and were moved to a \"quieter\" part of the hotel. This was not much better. The glasses actually moved across the table top with the vibration of music. How this hotel can allow this happen is beyond me, when are people supposed to sleep. I would not stay in the hotel again and I would definitely not recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cTerrible sound system in mini party room of Time Out Club\u201d", "Author": "maheshjaigadkar", "ReviewID": "UR123015867", "Content": "I visited yesterday to time out as it was a farewell party for our ex-boss.

Even the band outside the mini party room was very good and really excellent and amazing performance by the musicians. The sound system was at its best and blasting. There was a karaoke system in the mini party room which was with Indian Karaoke Songs. I am being a professional singer tried to perform on that karaoke and checked the system but it was only having mono sound from the mike and not echo system or professional system required for singers. We have asked for technician but surprisingly a lady captain visited and she informed that there is only a mono system. We were really upset about this and we told this to lady also but she was not concerned about it and left from there.

Hotel is located nowhere,close to the petrol pump facing the busy street and locked access for at least 3 years. Reception is trying to be organized and quick but they have lack of problem solving skills. For the size of the room and bed i can rate 8/10 and thats the only plus. Breakfast is average but rich and you can eat well. When dark will come yr trouble will start. On the mezanine there is a Time Out caffe a golden hen for the management and terriblle noisy night club. They turn the bass on maximum always and when you are inside the room you think that ceiling will fall down on you. We complain to the front desk but nobody cares,maximum you will get will be to be transferred to less noisy room but thats only excuse. There is no less noisy rooms. In fact management dont care about guests as Time Out caffe makes triple money than the rooms turnover. My advice! Try to avoid this property,even with the tricks of cheap 4* rooms.

However, Ramee Hotel has a separate policy, which charges you the first night for any cancellation within 7 days, which was applied. Although I contacted both the hotel and Agoda, they refused to remove the fee - even though the booking was a mistake, and had been cancelled within one hour of making it, and was still 5 days away from the first night stay. It is ridiculous that they cannot make an exception to a situation that was clearly a mistake, and essentially made $65 for doing absolutely nothing at all. If there is even a chance that your travel plans may change or shift, do NOT book with this hotel. They are looking for any excuse to charge extra, and are very inflexible and unhelpful.
