It shows that the family that runs the hotel is dedicated to the guests are doing well, they were very engaged and helpful. For example they drove us to the train station and picked us up again so we did not have to bring our car to Venice. VERY convienient!! :-) The hotel is beautiful and very clean. Nice activities around the hotel. We will definetly go there again. ! :-) The surrondings are beautiful, typical italian.", "Date": "July 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel Not Actually in Venice\u201d", "Author": "CukiAtlanta_Georgia", "ReviewID": "UR16846323", "Content": "This is a great little family owned hotel but it is not actually in Venice. It is located in Meleo which is a good distance from Venice. I was booked into this hotel as part of a tour with Trafalgar and it was probably my favorite hotel during our tour. The room and the bathroom were nice. The hotel has a nice little bar and a great backyard patio to sit around with friends, family, etc and enjoy the fresh air and a drink. The hotel also has a swimming pool which was not opened during our tour (it was a little to cold yet) and a tennis court. You can see the owner playing with his children sometimes and I thought this was rather nice. Also, the bar service was really great and friendly. The only draw back I can see to this hotel is its distance to Venice. If transportation to Venice is not a problem - (I haven't got a clue how to get there because I was on a tour bus that took us), I would not hesitate to stay here. Our dinner was included with our room and it was decent - standard pasta, etc. I wouldn't say it was a gourmet meal by any standard but it did provide sustenance. Also, the breakfast which was included was adequate. Again, I would definitely stay here if I had a car. If not I would call the hotel in advance and find out how you go about getting into Venice. If it is too difficult, this might not be the spot for you.", "Date": "June 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "san jose, ca", "Title": "\u201cnot for DIY tourists due to distant location and lack of public transit\u201d", "Author": "aimetravel", "ReviewID": "UR14470401", "Content": "Husb and I stayed here as part of a trafalgar tour in sept 2007 for one night. The hotel itself was clean, large, and nice, looks more like a very large villa, but Due to location being very far away from Venice, it is on mainland, and no apparent public transportation, I canNOT recommend this hotel for independent tourists. If you had a car to get to the hotel, you cannot bring the car into Venice proper so you would have to deal with paying for parking etc. I did see parking garages for when you enter Venice, but I do not know the cost nor how many spots are available and whether you can find a spot. I think if you have a car and don't mind the distance and the trouble of parking when going to Venice, it would be a nice hotel to stay in. Pros: large bedroom and bathroom clean food very good at dinner. but buffet breakfast was only ok. best thing about it were the little wrapped cookies. Cons: Location on mainland. Not even close to Venice. Not accessible without a car. We were on the tour bus, but I did not see any public transit anywhere nearby the hotel, not even a bus stop. I think you would need a car. only internet access was computer in lobby and they charged too much for it, by the hour. the vending machine selling drinks eats money and doesn't give you anything. 2 of us in our tour group tried purchasing different items and it dispensed nothing.", "Date": "March 23, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Sport Hotel All'Ancora", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d497247-Reviews-Sport_Hotel_All_Ancora-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$169 - $169*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Armando Diaz 120</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Meolo</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30020 </span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "497247", "ImgURL": "http://www.venere.com/img/hotel/4/7/5/2/112574/112574.jpg"}}
