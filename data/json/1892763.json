We received a room which overlooked a construction site and the noise inside the room was unbearable even with the windows shut. We went back to the reception to ask for another room facing the front of the hotel and we were greeted with a very unfriendly reaction - the staff at the reception was really surprised we asked for a different room and explained the noise will stop in 4-5 hours and that the next day was Sunday, so the works will have the day off. We did insist on getting another room and we managed to receive a key for a room on the floor above but which had a really bad smell, the window was locked so no chance for fresh air either. We therefore decided to keep our initial room as they were even more reluctant when we went down the second time to complain about our room and motivated those were the only rooms available for the period of our stay. The bathroom is literally part of the room, separated only by a glass door with no privacy whatsoever and the bathroom sink is outside the bathroom in one corner of the room. The breakfast is quite poor and not well supplied during the hours they serve breakfast. If you wake up early and get to the restaurant around 8, you might get all the variety, but an hour later - just leftovers not being refilled.

Near to it is a Bungy jump area and a bus stop where you can join the City Sightseeing hop on hop off bus for only SGD23. The hotel has a nice bathroom but with a small double bed and a small blanket for a couple. My husband and I are the normal size Asians but if you're a Caucasian with a big body and long legs, you may feel uncomfortable. We had backaches due to the bed. Buffet breakfast is the usual cereal with milk, bread, jam, butter, chicken curry, rice, hotdogs and like banana, papaya or watermelon. One night at about 10 PM, the fire alarm sounded. Since we are in the third floor, my husband took the stairs to find out from reception if there's a fire, they said they are checking on it. As we were about to sleep, we have to call them and find out if there's really a fire. They never even bothered to explain. I would like to commend one of their front office receptionist, her name is Ida, a Filipino. She was very accommodating and even bothered to check the internet and print the location of the catholic church where we have to attend a Sunday mass. Other than this, she extended her kindness by teaching us the way where we want to go. Restaurant Tip: If you want to try the authentic local Singaporean dish, try Bak Ku Tek. It's about 5 minutes walk from the hotel and almost right in front of the Pedestrian Lane. They serve good food at SGD6-8 per viand, a cup of rice cost SGD0.60. There's also a food court at the basement of Central Mall. The cheapest I've seen is worth SGD4.50 for crispy chicken with a cup of rice.

I was very disappointed to see that a respectful hotel like the Best Western can have rooms like the first one we booked. 2/The second room was larger, but the shower was very unpractical, the sink was outside the bathroom and just after using it we noticed it was leaking. We didn't want to change our room again and alerted the staff of the leak but they didn't do anything about it. 3/ We had a terrible night's sleep because the room was very poorly soundproofed (we could hear all what was happening in the corridor and the surrounding rooms) and because we were woken up by two false alarms at 6am in the morning. When I called the front desk to ask whether we had to leave the building, they didn't even apologize! 4/ In the morining, we found out that we were sleeping with a lizard in the room.

Some authentic Singapore dining places full of locals just around the corner or head south four blocks and your in China Town. For a 3 night stay it was perfect, any longer I would consider somewhere a little larger, but if your out and about like us it was great", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGet you're money's worth!\u201d", "Author": "kyrise", "ReviewID": "UR104922640", "Content": "We had a pleasant stay at this hotel for 4N & 5D.

And this hotel was within our budget, other hotels wanted us to take 2 rooms for our family. Pretty much all that has been said about the hotel is true - eg breakfast, noise at night from the 2 pub / music lounge situated on either side. The noise did not really bothered me. The beds and the way the room is furnished is very homely type. Have a look at the pictures. There was one particular staff at the reception which deserves special mention. She was very helpful and very motherly like all the more making me and my family feel like we're staying in someone's home rather than a hotel. The shower door seal at the bottom is not good and the shower floor is not high enough so water spills over outside of the shower area and wetting the bathroom. This and the swinging door which I can't lock properly was the only really minus points There's no room service but if you out all day exploring Singapore why would one need room service?

Also, there are 2 MRT stations at a short walking distance, which is also very convenient. The staff are very polite and helpful (especially Devi at the front-desk). The wi-fi is free and easily accessible all over the hotel. There were 2 main things I did not like: the hotel is located right next to a bar that plays extremely loud music till 6AM - every night! Because of this I was unable to sleep. The breakfast spread is good, but the presentation and taste are very poor (I ate just once). This hotel is a good option for back-packers & budget travelers, as the price (for Clarke Quay) is very competitive.

The hotel is well located between Chinatown and the CBD and we walked to most of the major sights of the city. The hotel is small and our room was compact (a superior room). The decor was not really to my taste but at least it wasn't bland! The room was clean and well furnished with a fridge, wireless internet, flatscreen TV etc. However, as others have commented, this hotel is very noisy. As the hotel is not carpeted it is easy to hear footsteps and doors closing in to other rooms. The biggest noise problem is the nightclub next door which is open until 6AM. This kept me awake for two of the three nights I was there (and I'm not a particularly light sleeper). On one morning we decided to have a lie-in as we had slept so badly and left the do not disturb sign outside our door only to be woken at 9AM by the housekeepers having a long and loud conversation right outside our room! Breakfast was OK although not great (a buffet with quite odd things on, such as spaghetti bolognaise and chips). Staff in the breakfast room and the front desk were all friendly and efficient. I liked the individual nature of this hotel and know it's not the hotel's fault that it is so noisy, but I can not really recommend it to others based on the noise.", "Date": "March 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA good choice, on eastern edge of Chinatown\u201d", "Author": "Arandale", "ReviewID": "UR96891359", "Content": "Smallish bedroom, but good value considering the quality of the furniture and fittings, the hotel's location close to the city centre and helpful staff.

The location is excellent, with a subway station five minutes away and both Clark's Quay and Chinatown within walking distance. Our room was small and had only limited storage, but everything worked and the room had everything you need. There was free wired and wireless internet which worked well. There was no view from our room - just a wall and windows. The washbasin was in the room with the shower and toilet in the bathroom. Not all that unusual but as the room was small, it did make brushing your teeth something of a public event. I guess it's a function of the size of the room. Breakfast is included but the choice is limited. Fresh fruit and various kinds of bread for toasting were the best choice. There were other choices including rice and curry but they didn't look very appetizing, so I never tried them. Tea and coffee were OK but the orange juice was a bland cordial. There are no public rooms,other than the breakfast room, so when it rains and it rained a lot when we were there, you are pretty much stuck in your room. The front desk staff were were very helpful and friendly. There are a couple of nightclubs on the street nearby and although we could hear the music, it was never a problem and didn't keep us awake.

We liked the location. Its very central and as the MRT is less than five minutes away one can basically travel to anywhere in Singapore. We didn't expect that the Riverfront area is so nice to go out to during the evening. There was a misunderstanding about the promotional rate but the hotel staff solved it quickly and professionaly to our satisfaction. The staff was also very helpful and hapily answered all our questions. The breakfast was ok (although most of the time we went straight to Maxwell food court). What could be improved is the shower: leaking and when you have shower the whole bathroom is wet.
