You get what you pay for, so for a low price it was a good deal. There is a spa/hamam in the lower floors, but there was nobody there when we tried to go in. Here are the pros and cons: PROS - Great location - five minute walk to the Grand Bazaar, 15 to Blue Mosque. Yes it's several blocks down the hill, but no big deal for us. - Decent restaurant with buffet breakfast (included) and dinner (extra charge, but reasonable prices). - Nice staff. Most spoke little English, but the front desk folks spoke it well. CONS - There's a mosque right across the street, so bring earplugs if you don't want to wake up to the 4am call to prayer. - The A/C didn't work. No big deal for us since it was cool most of the time, but it might get miserable in the summer. - Very small rooms. We booked a room for two adults and a child and they literally had to wedge the extra cot in between our bed and the wall. - Thin walls. Not only could we hear the people in the next room, but there was a wedding reception in the the restaurant one night, and the music could be heard in our room (we were one floor below). - Wireless Internet in the rooms is spotty. In our room, the signal was weak if you stood by the door, non existent as you backed you went into the room. We had to go into the hall. This is definitely not a 4-star hotel, but if you're looking for a low-cost, low-frills hotel (place to sleep, not to hang out), this is it. Assos offers an airport shuttle for 30 Euro - don't bother. From the airport to the hotel is only 30-35 Lira (about 15 Euro) and no chance of being left/forgotten as the other reviewer mentioned. The airport has a line of cabs waiting, and they should all be metered (less chance of getting ripped off). Additionally, you can take the tram system to the hotel for two 1.70 Lira tokens (you make one stop to change trains). The train stop is right at the top of the hill from the hotel. It does take a little longer and if you're not familiar with the area it might be difficult. Returning on the tram is easy if you're comfortable riding metro/tube systems (we did it with our son no problem). It is a bit longer in the tram (about an hour compared to 20-30 minutes in a cab).

The bathroom had an all singing, all dancing shower cubicle, spa and massage features etc. Our only criticism, it was a bit small, perhaps should have been a single rather than a double and whilst being next to the dining room has some advantages, the noise from it is not one of them.

We got there at about half past one and they let us check in early which was great! Rooms were clean and tidy although the bathroom was a little small, and you had to climb in so not great for older travellers. The room had everything you need, clean sheets and towels which is all you need really. Your given shampoo and shower gel although i recommend you take your own. Hotel staff were very helpful and friendly and everything we asked for we were given, i.e we asked for an iron and we were given it for the 5days which was great as we got to use it at our own leisure. We were out most days and came in and out all day which was fine. the room was cleaned everyday. On the beds are just single sheets as duvets and a cow patterned blanket (which is a little itchy). Breakfast was not amazing but wasnt horrible either, boiled eggs, bread rolls jams honey etc. with salami and chicken was fine nothing made us ill although was the same everyday. Although the view from the 6th floor restaurant was stunning! you can see the coast and the sea of marmara. It has a swimming pool, sauna and turkish bath. I had a massage which cost me \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20 which was a bargin for a full body massage! I would recommend going to the male and not the female as i went to the male and had an amazing massage he was gentle and friendly but spoke limited english. However my sister went to the female and found it very painful at the time and for a few days after. Overall its a great hotel, wouldnt recommend any of the tours though as they charge you an arm and a leg. The tram is at the top of the hill and takes you everywhere you need to go and singles are about 75p (1.5 turkish lira). We found it at least 70% cheaper doing everything ourself.

The only good thing about the hotel is the location, it's near many of the major tourist sites but you'd have to be fairly fit to stay here as it's located half way down a hill. The location isn't the cleanest, many of the roads nearby are very dirty! The view from our hotel room was of dirty streets. 2. The rooms are okay, the main thing is that they were clean but the views weren't great. The rooms were of average size. They were fairly basic and of no way a 4 star hotel as stated in many websites. There were no tea/coffee facilities. No iron or ironing board. No tolietries. There was a minibar placed in the room 3 days into our stay though it was empty so you can say we had an empty fridge not a mini bar! We then bought our own drinks and subsequently placed the drinks in the fridge and was accused of not paying for the drinks when we were checking out a week later. We explained to the staff at reception \"THAT THE DRINKS WERE OUR OWN DRINKS, THAT NO DRINKS WERE PLACED IN THE FRIDGE IN THE 1ST PLACE\" it was horrible, the staff didn't believe us and all we could was explain over & over again that they were our drinks. We had to get the bell boy to confirm our story as he had witness the mini bar placed in our room without it being filled. Only when he confirm the story did the manager believe us. It was shocking behaviour to say the least! We didn't even get an apology! 3. Only 2 of all the staff spoke broken english, all the other staff didn't understand a word, so whenever we asked about something, we were always kept waiting around as the staff had to find someone who spoke english. 4. The breakfast was basic, the same thing everyday! eggs (either boiled, or scrambled- it alternated day to day) bread, yoghurt, canned fruit, sliced salami, sliced cheese & fried potato, juice & tea/coffee 5. The hotel can arrange different types of tours, we went on a mini cruise up the Brophorus river for 35Euros. We were told it was to last 4 hours (8am-12pm) but the coach picked us up late at 8.30, the driver then had to pick up other tourists at other hotels which continued until 9.15. We headed to the spice market where we had 30mins or so to shop before heading back on the coach to the marina. When we finally got on the boat, that part of the tour lasted 1hr 30mins & they dropped us off at 11.30. For the money we paid, it wasn't worth the tour as the following day, we took a ferry to the Asian side of Istanbul & only paid 1 Euro & did our own thing. Overall it was an okay holiday. It was spoiled due to our stay at the hotel. We did make the most of it though. I would advise anyone travelling to Istanbul to research the city and really plan what you want to do as we were lucky that the rest of our holiday was okay because of that - it was a shame as Istanbul is really a beautiful place!

A great location within walking distance of so many attractions. I am writing this review mainly because there are no other reviews for this hotel at present. This is quite a long review so be patient! Now, I am no expert in hotels and my view is that I simply want somewhere clean and safe to stay, without any prententions. The Assos has its faults. During a heavy rain storm water dripped through from the lintel above the window, the cleaning lady placed towels on the window sill to absorb the water. Another guest said she had experienced the same thing - maybe a problem with that side of the hotel? The decor is 70's style. There is air conditioning in the rooms which you can adjust to your needs (warm or cool the room). The bathroom was clean, bath and shower with hot water whenever we needed. There is a computer available for guests to use in the lobby area so can check your e.mails! I found the staff are very helpful without being \"in your face.\" Breakfast is continental buffet style and there is a restaurant though we never used it. The hotel is situated on a steep street within a community - people are busy going about their daily lives right outside the hotel so you get a \"warts and all \" view of how ordinary people live. It is not picturesque but it is real. The views from the windows are of the surrounding houses, roof tops, car parks, peoples kitchens, living rooms etc. We were able to walk around the neighbourhood without feeling threatened in any way. The Hotel is in such a good location (you could say this about hundreds of hotels in Istanbul I suppose) but this was a real plus. Travel up the road (500 metres, quite a steep hill) at the top you are on one of the main avenues with the tram line that leads to Blue Mosgue/Hagia Sophia, although the walk is much more enjoyable. (Basically you turn right and just keep walking). This road has many banks and a few money changers if funds are short. The Grand Bazaar is also on route on the left (cross by the tram stop and walk straight ahead) as well as other historical sights. Suliymaniye is situated behind the University (top of the hill and across the road). Another must do - once on the main road at the top of the hill, turn right. Walk for about 700 metres. Cross the road and near a mosque on the side of the street there is a sign indicating the former location of the Medressa. This is now a delightful area where you can try a waterpipe. Walk through the gates (tombstones to either side) go straight to the end. Hopefully you will meet Farouk, he will invite you to sit on one of the couches under the hangings and coloured lights (all for sale!) and here you can order tea, coffee, and a water pipe. Sit, relax, smoke. I am a non smoker but have to admit this really was a pleasure. (Ask for the apple tobacco) Now, going down from the hotel, you seem to be entering a poorer neighbourhood. Eventually you come to a dead end - turn left and keep going and you arrive at a square surrounded by restaurants specializing in fish. I found these to be very tourist orientated. Clean, smart, efficient. You'll be accosted with various \"special deals\" because you are a \"special\" customer. Personally I was not impressed as the special price offered me had no relation to the price on the bill at the end of the meal. As soon as we sat down, a bottle of water was produced and our glasses were filled (without our asking). This was later on the bill at 9 lira. I guess you need to be aware at tourist restaurants and it seemed to be a slick operation designed to part us from our money. I preferred to find the places where the Turks themselves were eating. Ordinary, yes. Unsophisticated, yes. But real places where the waiters seemed genuinely pleased that you had chosen their place to eat and where the prices were what the locals themselves paid. I would gladly stay here again. I would recommend this hotel for anyone wanting a slice of real Istanbul without the frills. It would perhaps not be a good choice for someone with difficulties in walking due to the steep incline of the hill. Assos is not a \"fancy\" hotel but as I said at the beginning, it met my criteria of somewhere clean and safe to stay and should be perfectly acceptable for someone looking for a mid range hotel.", "Date": "October 30, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Assos Hotel Istanbul", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d1161506-Reviews-Assos_Hotel_Istanbul-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$94 - $387*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Mithatpasa Cad.
