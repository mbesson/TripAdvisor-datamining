The price was great: $200 + $20/day valet fee (unlimited entry/reentry). The location was excellent \u2013 only 5 blocks from the Walk of Fame. It was so close to everything, I couldn\u2019t believe it. You could see the Hollywood sign from our hotel room. My husband joined the membership rewards club when he booked the hotel and this was our first stay at a HIE. Upon arrival, the desk clerk warmly welcomed us and told us we were on the VIP (8th) floor. He had a VIP bag with a bottled water and a few bags of chips and granola bars in it, as a welcome gift for the VIP club member. WoW! A simple, yet nice gesture. To get to our room you had to take the elevator to the 5th floor, then walk down the entire hallway and then to another elevator to the 8th floor, which was (strangely enough) in another part of the building away from the main population. It was a nicely sized room. Everything was modest, but comfortable; king size bed and sofa pullout slept all 5 of us in comfort. The complimentary breakfast was excellent, with hard boiled eggs, pastries, cereal, toast, waffles, yogurt, hot/cold drinks, etc. It was such a huge money saver for the 5 of us in this economy, especially around the Hollywood area, where prices are jacked up. We asked the front desk how to get to the Hollywood sign, as well as other attractions. We were quickly given a map, along with recommendations that turned out to be great. Even the valet (I forgot his name) was polite and pleasant \u2013 quick to serve. I would definitely stay here again!!", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jaegerspris", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "Josefine F", "ReviewID": "UR128756568", "Content": "This hotel is very nice if you want to explore the city of Hollywood. the hotel is 2 min. walk from walk of fame and the highland center.

I liked the hotel overall more particularly the breakfast included. Very good selection and decent quality. Not much fruit other than bananas but hell, I'm on vacay so who needs fruit lol. The room we had (on 5th floor) overlooked Highland and Franklin intersection and the street noise was not an issue. The room itself was okay. Nothing fancy- your most basic hotel room, but it was clean. There were four of us, my husband, me and my two older teenage girls so space became an issue really fast in the smallish bathroom with one sink. The cleaning staff did a great job keeping up with the mess thankfully. Location wise, it is a short jaunt down to the intersection of Hollywood Blvd and Highland. There was a convenience store, a pizza place, Subway, Sushi place, and a Starbucks in the strip mall across the street. Not too much outside of this. Although we didn't use the actual pool, it looked like it could have used some basic cleaning. It was not a big pool area but there never seemed to be too many guests using it either. My girls used once to sunbathe and it was nice. Front desk staff were great, as were the valet staff who we got more familiar with in our week of coming and going. Overall for the money, it was a good value. If I was going again with just my husband and I, I might opt for the Roosevelt or somewhere altogether different than the Hollywood area.

Make sure to arrange for the Super Shuttle, for trips to the airport. You will save a boatload of money, vs. cabs.

I must admit we had high expectations of this leg of our trip, being Hollywood after all! Unfortunately, we soon realised that Hollywood Blvd is not all we hoped. We found it to be quite dirty, seedy and definitely did not feel safe walking around late at night. The hotel is only a few minutes walk from the heart of Hollywood so it is easy to see the famous sites. We arrived the day before the Oscars so the street was mostly blocked off but it was good to see everything set up and we walked along the red carpet at Kodak theatre (no celebrity spotting, sadly!) We hired a car which was great because we could venture out of the city along the coast and we spent a day at Malibu, Universal studios, Warner Bros studios (HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!) and Six Flags theme park. There is also a great shopping centre close by called The Grove which has lots of nice restaurants. Back to the hotel, we found it a bit challenging to drive out of the carpark as North Highland avenue is extremely busy all the time. There is a small supermarket/liquor store and pizza restaurant across the road which came in handy. The breakfast at the hotel is very nice and the staff are helpful. Our room was average, overlooking the dreary streets of LA. I think we were just disappointed overall because we hoped Hollywood would be nicer, but in terms of the hotel itself and the location, we would recommend to anybody keen to visit LA. I think given the little time we actually spent in Hollywood, if we returned we would stay elsewhere further out. I highly recommend hiring a car to get around.

This Holiday Inn Express has been built next to another hotel, which used to be the Holiday Inn in Hollywood - now part of a different hotel group. I stayed at this hotel a few years ago, so I knew the area well and was happy to give my business to the newer Holiday Inn Express. It is very close to the main Hollywood/Highland Metro (underground) station - just a short walk up pass the expensive Renaissance Hotel - so you are very close to all the sights, shopping and dining areas. You can't stay at a better location. My Platinum Priority Club membership was acknowledged with a room upgrade. My room was on the front of the building and yes, there is road noise that starts around 5am/6am in the morning. The room was medium-sized, with a brightly-lit bathroom and kitchenette. There was a sofa and dining table, which led into the bed area. The under-window-mounted air conditioning unit worked well, though was noisier than wall-vented systems. All the fixtures and fittings were in good condition, well-maintained and the furnishings were comfortable. The free WiFi service worked well. This hotel is unusual in that the \"main floor\" is on the 4th floor, which is where you'll find the breakfast room, business centre, fitness area and outdoor swimming pool. Breakfast was the usual hot and cold buffet breakfast. If you know what to expect, then you won't be disappointed. I prefer the healthier options on offer at Holiday Inn Expresses in the UK, but I was still happy with the selection I found here. The staff here are very personable and make you feel very welcome. There's a snack shop just behind the reception desk, where you can buy a small range of items that you can prepare in your in-room microwave. In the evenings, security is enhanced to give guests extra peace of mind. I didn't drive, but the hotel has a good-sized undercover car park.

Room has coffee maker which I personally don't like - I'm a fan of the good old electric kettle. I enjoyed the breakfast as they served various types of healthy oatmeal (incl. plain) along with standard stuff like brown/white bread, cinnamon buns, scrambled eggs, juices, tea, coffee, yoghurts, milk, pancakes, some meat stuff etc. The breakfast area is not very large - so it could get full pretty quickly. It was not a problem for us as we would get very up very early at 6 and crave for food (time difference) :-). The staff is very helpful with directions. Hollywood walk of fame (kodak theatre, chinese grauman etc.) is to your right when you come out of the hotel and hollywood bowl is to your left (easily walkable). Lots of eating points inside Hollywood and Highland mall - it is a very touristy area. So be prepared to get bombarded with people looked to sell you stuff. We just ignored them. You will also find a grocery next to HollyWood and Highland mall and other eating points nearby. The hotel is a bit pricey but I guess it was worth it as the other hotels next to this hotel did not look very attractive from the outside. If you are coming from the airport, just book a super shuttle in advance (32 dollars for two people) to take you to the hotel. Alternatively, you can take the flyaway bus to Union station and then it is a red line metro to Hollywood and Highland AVe station followed by a short walk to the hotel. Los Angeles is a huge spread out city - a bit tasteless for some people. So staying at this hotel provides easy access to Universal Studios, Hollywood Walk of Fame, Chinese Theatre, Amoeba Music, Highland center, Kodak theatre and Sunset Strip. Rest is far far away. If you are looking to go to Santa Monica or Venice beach - you need to take the 60-90 min bus (733) from Union Station. Be sure not to take this bus in peak time (5-6:30 PM) as it is crammed with people and they don't speak English very well (esp. in Venice). The bus stop is \"Main and Grand\" for Venice beach. I would not advise staying at Venice beach after dark but it is a great beach (better than Santa Monica). Do take a jumper with you as it can get cold at the beach. The hotel can arrange LA tours - a bit boring but that's the best way to see LA in a short space of time.

The hotel was a 15 minute taxi ride away from the airport approx $35. We arrived early and although the room wasn\u2019t ready reception staff were welcoming and happy to check us in. The hotel is located less than 10 minutes walk from the Kodak theatre and the Hollywood walk of fame. There were plenty of restaurants and shops in this area including a Hard Rock and it was easy to entertain ourselves for a couple of hours. On our return we checked out the hotel quickly and found the pool which was in the centre of the building a couple of floors up. We were given a note with login details on for the free wifi and also told we could use the business centre free of charge, this included printing of boarding passes. We usually stay at much more expensive hotels where you would pay for this service. Our room was darker than pictures portray but perfectly acceptable. Bedlinens were a good standard and the bathroom clean, amenities included shampoo and separate conditioner which was good. The air conditioning was a unit built into the front of the building and although a bit noisy it was efficient. Our room faced the main road and on a Saturday night /Sunday morning the noise from traffic was minimal despite thousands of people leaving the Bowl. Our main reason for choosing the hotel was its proximity to the Hollywood Bowl. Reviews had told us it was at most a 15 min walk and they were correct. I had a hip replacement last year and in the middle of a heatwave and up a slight hill we still managed without any problems. Breakfast next morning was better than other Holiday Inn expresses we have been to. The room had a bright feel to it. Coffee and orange juice of low quality were available along with cinnamon rolls, bagels, cream cheese and there was also a pancake making machine. The lady helping there went out of her way to be curteous and helpful when the machine needed replenishing and kept the serving areas tidy. Overall this is a basic hotel which works very hard to be the best it can be.

Here's the rundown: Pros: - Great location - 5 min drive to Universal Studios, very short walk to Hollywood Bowl, Hollywood Blvd (Walk of Fame, Grumans, Mme Tussauds), Sunset, Vine). - Well Maintained property - rooms in excellent condition - ultra clean. The hotel smelled great throughout the property. The housekeeping staff should be recognized for their efforts. - Breakfast - comes with the room reservation. Standard breakfast fare - nothing gourmet or outstanding, but it is included, filling - does the job for starting off the day. Tables limited around 9am. - Outdoor Pool - A bit small, but nice to have it around to take a quick dip in. Our kids had a great time enjoying it. - Amazingly fast Check-in / Check Out process Cons: - Most amenities (laundry, pool, etc) not available for use after 8pm. The hours should extend to 10 or 11pm. - The Guest Laundry Room is not sufficient - there is only 1 set of machines for the entire hotel. I wasted up to 3 hours of my vacation time waiting for the machines to be available. Also, I had to purchase our laundry supplies - at other hotels, the laundry supplies are complimentary. The dryer took forever to dry clothes which exacerbated the wait time. - The complimentary WiFi / Internet was way too slow. Another hotel guest echoed my frustration with the performance in the business center, also my husband didn't bother using his laptop since the WiFi was so slow. - The front desk staff didn't not mention any further benefits that we could be eligible for since we are Priority Rewards members. We could have used the extended checkout. Also, the front desk didn't seem interested that we were staying and didn't suggest any dining or touring/attractions to visit. I usually get recommendations from the front desk when they ask if we were there for a leisure trip. Also, it would help if the parking was free for hotel guests. - It was also very difficult by car to enter and exit the hotel on highland avenue. There should be a way for guests to be able to enter the hotel directly instead of turning up side roads to get in. This was very stressful and unnerving during our stay. Although I listed the cons above, I would definitely stay again the next time we visit L.A. It would be great if management focuses on these items - I would've rated the hotel a 5 instead of a 4, if not for these issues.", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur", "Title": "\u201cGood value and location\u201d", "Author": "thwong", "ReviewID": "UR117684651", "Content": "Upon arrival in LA after a 20hr flight from Malaysia, we (a family of 2 Adults and 3 children 8,10 & 14) had a pleasant stay in room 520 which had 2 double beds, 1 sofa bed and 1 bathroom. Tho we arrived at the hotel quite late at 10pm, the front desk staff and valet were very helpful and cheerful. The room faced Highland Avenue but was quiet enough, clean and roomy. The decor is contemporary and modern. We booked directly with the hotel as we wanted to be sure about the type of room given. The rate of USD234.99 before tax included hot breakfast with eggs, sausages, gravy, pancakes, pastries, bagels, cereals, fruit, yoghurt, juices, an assortment of gourmet coffee and more which was delicious and more than enough for us. The breakfast attendants were very friendly and helpful. Note-there may be insufficient tables for breakfast between 8.30-9am, so better to be early. There is parking but it is only valet parking of USD 20 per night and additional to the room charge. But parking is charged in most LA hotels anyway and the rate is reasonable. There's a small pool and free use of the computer & printer which I found useful for printing google maps etc. I also found the onsite coin laundry a big help as we were on a 18 day road trip (our wardrobe had to be limited to ensure our luggage could fit into the rental minivan and to save luggage space for future shopping). The cost per wash at $2 and per dry at $3 was higher than at the San Diego and Anaheim hotels we later stayed at but nonetheless a great convenience. Hollywood and the location of this hotel is excellent. It is within 5 minute walking distance to the sights and souveneir shops along the Walk of fame and restaurants, bars and shops at Highland & Hollywood mall. As we ate late sometimes (past 10 when most restaurants close) there are lots of late night places to eat nearby - a Mcdonalds, a 24hr Mel's diner few blocks down with own parking lot, a chinese Le Oriental Bistro a few blocks down, an In& Out and Ihop at Sunset Blvd which is a few minutes drive away. (Note: there may be a few aggressive homeless people on the streets late at night.). Although Hollywood may seem out of the way from downtown or West Hollywood, it was an easy drive from the hotel to the sights we wanted to visit such as Universal Studios, Disney concert hall, LACMA, tar pits, Petersen Automotive Museum, the Grove, Farmers Market, Beverly hills and Griffith Park and Observatory. Note:Parking is available at all these places. Overall, we found hotels in Beverly hills and West hollywood generally more expensive and could not accomodate all 5 of us in 1 room.

We thought the hotel was furnished to a high standard. We are from England and consider the Holiday Inn to be of a similar standard to a Premier Inn. Check in was simple and we were happy with our room. The room was of a very good size with two double beds and a nice big bathroom. We hired a car during our stay and the valet parking was good. The car was always collected very quickly. However, we think the price of parking the car was quite expensive, but I suppose it is Hollywood! The location of The Holiday Inn was perfect. It was right in the heart of Hollywood with just a short walk from The Hollywood Walk of Fame. During our stay we travelled to Disneyland, Universal, Warner Brothers, the beaches, Griffith Park, Dodgers baseball etc. and The Holiday Inn is ideally located for all these places, with good access to the freeway. We felt safe at this hotel and one night when we came home late, felt reassured to see a guy in reception who just guarded the hotel. Breakfast was adequate. There was a good choice of cereal, pastries, cooked food and pancakes to cater for all tastes. However, the room breakfast is served in doesn\u2019t cater for the sheer volume of guests. Unless you get to breakfast ridiculously early, or late, you are often left waiting for a table to be free. The room was constantly crowded and made for breakfast to be quite stressful. It was nice to have a pool at this hotel, although as it was in the middle of the hotel building, there was a lot of shade and it was difficult to lie in the sun. Every time we went out there, usually late afternoon, people were lying on the loungers in the sun, so we were stuck in the shade. Still, you don\u2019t really come to Hollywood to sunbathe. Towards the middle of our stay we had a problem with ants in the room. We suddenly saw lots of ants walking from near the window down towards the table. We mentioned this at reception and the person behind the desk was very apologetic and said there would be someone up that day to solve the problem. The volume of ants had decreased but there were still ants by the end of our stay. Some had even made their way to the bathroom and bedside cabinets. Not nice!

The room was very clean with standard amenities, it also had a nice flat screen TV, comfortable chair for sitting, and a nice work area desk. The one room downfall was the wireless internet, though free, the connection was extremely slow and horrible. The desk clerk said it was because of everyone getting on it, I don't think everyone in all the rooms was getting on at exactly the same time. The hotel has a very friendly and helpful staff. The breakfast was very good, with a great variety of food, pancakes, sausage, bacon, cereal, danishes, coffee, juice, milk, better than most free breakfasts at similar hotels. I can't comment on the fitness center, or pool, as I didn't use either. I did walk out by the pool and it looked like a calm area, and was clean. The business center is free to use, and the internet is wired and way better than what's in the rooms. There's also a small store next to the front desk, that sells drinks, candy bars, chips etc... and also has a microwave for guest use. Like I said, the area is good for walking to many nearby attractions. I highly recommend seeing a show at the Hollywood Bowl, as it's an amazing venue---but bring your own food and drink in, and don't park there! It's a 10 minute walk from the hotel. There's some restaurants close by, and others within walking distance up and around Hollywood Blvd. I did notice one thing about the hotel, if you're on floors 6-8, you have to take two elevators to get to your room. You go to the 5th floor from the lobby, then from there take a second elevator. It seems a little inconvenient if you're staying on one of those floors.

It was small, half the size of the any images I have seen. Had one tiny window at the top of the wall that looked out to a brick wall under some stairs. Unsurprisingly therefore the room was very dark. The television was old and when you turned it on was automatically on volume 99 out of 100 everytime, the signal was also pretty poor. The fridge was so loud I had to take the plug out of it, not that it was problem as there was nothing in it anyway! Luckily though the room was fairly clean, it all seemed a bit old and outdated though. The keys to the room had not been activated after we had checked in so we had to go back down to reception from the sixth floor, which takes a while in itself as you have to take one lift then walk through the corridors round to the other side of the hotel and get another lift down. In the morning we asked reception to book us a taxi, they asked if we wanted a yellow taxi or a limo service, we replied a yellow taxi presuming that was the normal LA taxi. Then a Black 4x4 pulled up and the Valet said this was our taxi, we questioned them saying we had asked for a yellow taxi and they replied yes this is it, so having only been in LA a few hours we took what they said and got in. As we thought it turned out to be a Limo service and cost us $25 where the same journey on the way back cost us $13. The driver also explained to us that he was in partnership with the hotel. What a coincidence... All in all a pretty awful stay at a hotel I was thinking would have been one of the safest options of knowing what you were going to get in Hollywood.

The location of the hotel itself was fantastic--just a hop away from Hollywood Boulevard and near the metro and the 101. The staff were very nice, especially the helpful valets and the wonderful lady who runs the free (and bountiful) breakfast buffet (which includes eggs and bacon in addition to the usual continental stuff). Parking isn't free, but at $20 a day, it's a good deal. You do need to drive a lot in LA! Overall, shockingly good find. Absolutely would recommend this to anyone desiring the most luxury that no-frills sort of places provide.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Hartford, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cVery nice place to stay\u201d", "Author": "esil6", "ReviewID": "UR85184730", "Content": "We recently stay here for 4 days while visiting Hollywood.

Again, just a pleasant experience. LA is so huge that when you are only there for a few days, you have to commit to an area and explore it. We were close to many attractions that most people were coming to the area to see. It was a 5 minute walk to Starbucks and the Walk of Fame, and free tapings of the Jimmy Kimmel Live show. Just a bit further walk let you visit LA Ink and Pink's for a hotdog. Everyday you can see the HOLLYWOOD sign in the hills behind you. The other hotel in the area that looked nice was the Roosevelt. Most of the others I didn't think were anything special. Also, no hidden charges - free WI-FI, laundry facilities, etc. We had a blast and were very happy with our choice of hotel.

If you are planning on doing tours with Starline Tours these also leave from Grauman's Chinese Theatre, you can arrange a pick up from your hotel but as they visit quite a few hotels it might add another hour or two onto your day, it was easy to be able to walk there. You can also jump on the subway from Hollywood Blvd to Unviersal Studios which is about two stops away, then you walk across the road and get a shuttle up the hill to Universal Studios. We thought about walking and Im so glad we didn't as it was quite steep and was a lot further than I thought it would be.We got a taxi back that evening as we were so tired and it was about $20 I think to the hotel. We enjoyed this hotel, the rooms were clean, a little darkish but great for sleeping. we had a Queen Executive suite 2x Queen beds and a double sofa, as we were traveling with 2 Adults and 3 teenagers this suited us perfectly and allowed us to have just the one room which although cosy saved us a lot of $$. We booked direct on the Holiday inn site and got a great advance rate of $195.00 , I asked to be on a high floor due to trip advisor reviews I had read about the street noise. The air conditioner was quite noisy but we got used to it and were so tired from our daily adventures we went straight to sleep each night. The boys had a dip in the pool one day and used the gym a few times. Beds were very comfy, even the sofa bed.The room had a mini fridge, coffee machine, free Wi Fi but that didn't work very well at times but was free. Breakfast was also included which was great as we usually didn't want lunch so saved the cost of two meals. The breakfast included scrambled eggs, bacon, bagels, muffins, yoghurt, fruit, cereals, juice tea and coffee. Staff were always pleasant and helpful, you also get a free USA today newspaper which you pick up in the foyer. There is a laundry on the 3rd floor but only has one machine and dryer but was really handy. Across the road from the hotel is Pizza Shop, Subway and a mini mart which was well stocked and not too outrageously priced . The last day of our stay we discovered a pharmacy/supermarket on Hollywood Blvd about one block past the Chinese Theatre it wasn't huge but was cheaper than the mini mart for snacks. The area was a little dirty and some strange characters around but we had no problem the whole time we were there. The only issue we had and it wasn't with the hotel, they seem to use a private taxi service (un metered) I guess they get some kick back. So if you want a metered cab make sure you stipulate that. The private cab we had took us to our next hotel in Venice Beach ($80) which was fine. We mentioned that we were going to the airport in two days and he asked us if he could take us, we had to be picked up at 5.20am. He gave us his number and we confirmed the night before by phone with him. Well he didn't show up and at that time of morning it was hard to get a 5 seater cab, fortunately we were lucky and still made our flight. I can't find the card with his name on it but when I do I will add his name to this review. Like I said nothing really to do with the hotel other than they use his service.

Because we'd never been to L.A./Hollywood (we live in Houston, TX), I started my hotel search from scratch. We knew we wanted to be within walking distance of Hollywood Blvd to see all of the amazing sights. I found the Holiday Inn Express Hotel & Suites - Hollywood Walk of Fame online. The website really caught my attention (BTW, we love the song that plays on the website by Kascade), and believe it or not, I read ALL 251 reviews about the hotel. The website was very informative regarding accomodations and price, so I booked it. I had a couple of additional questions, so I called the hotel directly, and was provided the additional information - Thank you for that! We arrived around 10:30 a.m., however check in is at 3:00 p.m. This wasn't a problem at all. The young lady at the front desk was very helpful (she actually remembered talking to me on the phone), she offered to watch our luggage while we walked over to Hollywood & Highland Center for lunch. (Note: we felt VERY safe walking around in that area - EVEN AT NIGHT! ) When we returned, we checked in to our rooms, which looked EXACTLY like the pictures on the internet. Very modern, large flat screen T.V., refridgerator, etc. The complimentary breakfast was absolutely delicious. We knew we wanted to \"venture\" out and go to Universal Studios, 6 Flags Magic Mountain, Rodeo Dr, Venice Beach, etc., and we knew we couldn't walk, so we used the private car service provided right there at the hotel - \"Daniel\". WOW !!!!!!! This guy is AMAZING!!!!! Daniel was extremely courteous and very polite. Fabulous \"customer service\"!!! He's very knowledgeable of the Los Angeles/Hollywood area, so he was able to recommend great things to do and places to visit. My 16 year old daughter can be a little \"indecisive\" at times, and she changes her mind in a moment's notice (sigh), but Daniel never complained about last minute changes or detours. - THANK YOU DANIEL FOR MAKING HER 16TH BIRTHDAY A MEMORABLE ONE!!!! And thank you to the entire Holiday Inn Express (Hollywood) staff for your warm welcome to Hollywood and your wonderful customer service.

Negative points: Room was very stuffy because windows do not open much. Many rooms only look into a wall (not good if claustraphobic!) Busy street - traffic very noisy - we had to turn on the air conditioner all night so it would drown out the road noise. Police sirens, helicopters & fire engines much of the night. Hollywood is generally quite a seedy area - lots of homeless people, beggars & weirdos wandering about, but most of LA seems to be like that these days! I noticed that the Magic Castle Hotel, very nearby, is on a quieter street and gets very good reviews, but it charges a lot more. Recommend eating at The California Pizza restaurant, upstairs on the corner of Hollywood & Highland. Greek Pizza scrumptious. Recommend not booking any LA tours until you arrive as they offer lots of discount vouchers in the main street, as well as deals for seeing multiple attractions, such as a tour plus wax museum. This hotel was also selling two day passes to Universal studios for the price of 1 day (but note that it is much cheaper to take local bus than to buy a pass that includes transport).

We used the airport shuttle service (supershuttle) which was really good value and worked out simple and well organised. We used the tourist bus to get an over view of the city and spent some time at Venice beach which was lovely. We also used the metro and went to Union station (beautifil and good for people watching) and then on the Gold line to Little Tokyo (great places for lunch)/Mexico quarter.

A big mirrored wardrobe containing iron, ironing board and spare bedding. A safe with a combination of your choice, sofa, dining room table, microwave, coffee maker and fridge. The bathroom had a hairdryer. The shower was so powerful, you didnt want to get out!!! Really beautifully furnished, the carpet was lovely and clean and of good quality. And obviously, the room had an air conditioned unit.. The cleaners came every day and changed the beds and towels, and also left the place spotless and tidy. The breakfast was very adequate, there was a hot area which had scrambled egg, bacon, hot scones and some other oaty thing!!! You have a large selection of bread, bagels muffins etc. A choice of fruit juices, tea and coffee. Yoghurts, cartons of milk...lots of choice. This was a fantastic hotel and I really would think seriously, if you wanted to stay in the center of Hollywood, stay in the Walk Of Fame. We were a 5 - 10 minute walk from the Kodak Theatre and a 5 minute car ride in the opposite direction to the Hollywood Bowl. When you walk out of the Hotel, you look to your left and you see the Hollywood sign. I can do nothing but sing this hotels praises. Yes, you have to pay $22 a night to park your car there, but as you are so close to the center, I think all hotels will charge. If I have to make a negative comment, it is that our room was at the front of the Hotel and the traffic is unrelenting 24hrs of the day. But there again, we only noticed it the first night because after that, we did so much sightseeing and walking, we were too tired at night to notice!! Right across the road from the Hotel, there are several shops including a Subway and a doughnut shop. Washing machines and tumble dryers are on all floors.

So I am going to get those two things out of the way first so I can get onto the good stuff. We were on our honeymoon and when we booked, we included this information with the online booking. We arrived after a long flight and waiting for a shuttle bus for ages, and it turned out that checking into this hotel was the most stress free and fast thing, which we were very pleased with. We were given room 305, and we rushed to our room and pulled open our curtains to see what kind of fantastic view we had \u2013 only to be confronted with a concrete wall and hardly any natural light. When we looked up, we could see the side of the pool. Still, we tried not to be disappointed, not even in the morning when we were trying to catch up on sleep after an 11hour flight, only to be awoken be the constant sound of scraping cheers on the floor above \u2013 what we later discovered to be the breakfast room. These sounds started around 6.30am every morning and we were as a result, woken up by these noises every single morning of our stay. Luckily, we had lots of things planned so we tried to roll with it and just get on with things. If you make it to the breakfast room for 6.30-7am you will be able to have a calm, quiet breakfast. If it\u2019s later, say 8.30am, be prepared for a very busy room, sometimes with no seats available. But don\u2019t worry! You can always have a take out breakfast. I\u2019ve read other reviews about the breakfast by the way and how anyone can complain about this FREE complimentary service is completely beyond me. Every morning, there was; coffee, a selection of juices, milk, 4 different cereals, yoghurts, boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, toasts, bagels, cinnamon rolls, I could go on and on\u2026.there is so much there and lovely staff members who are constantly replenishing and cleaning and smiling. What\u2019s to complain about? Our room itself was very comfortable, fantastic bed, lots of room, cleaned every single day, fresh towels, etc. We also had a fridge which was handy and we were close to the vending machines and elevator so there were pluses to room 305 too! We felt very safe indeed in this hotel and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I have to make a comment about the staff. We experienced at least 4 different front desk staff during our 7 night stay and each and every one of them was helpful, polite, and obliging. Whenever we saw any other staff they were as polite and cordial. I wanted to mention this as it\u2019s clear they all work very hard behind the scenes to make your stay a memorable one (and despite the view and being below the breakfast room!) our stay was very memorable. I would stay here again in a heartbeat with a moment of hesitation. Hollywood & Highland shopping centre is a 5 minute walk away, Hollywood Boulevard the same, the Metro station is right there too and is clean, safe and fast. $1.25 one way to go to Universal Studios \u2013 it takes 10 minutes tops to get there. There is a Subway more or less across from the hotel and the hotel also has snacks downstairs and meals you can warm up in their microwave and take to your room. Coffee and papers available in the lobby at any time.

Having being familiar with the brand I had some idea of what to expect, but this turned out to be by far the roomiest H.I. Express accomodation I have ever stayed in. We booked three seperate rooms for four nights, all three rooms were spacious, lots of space for all belongings and plenty of space to move around. One of the rooms even had a lounge area plus a small dining table. The rooms are not glamorous, plush or luxuruious they are basic but just plain roomy and comfortable. We were all well impressed. Overall it was a good experience. Front desk employees were prompt and polite. Check-in was quick and easy. Comfortable bed and pillows, clean linen and all the other standards you would expect from a good 3 star tourist hotel. The free internet came in very handy on several ocacaions. The laundry facilities were a real bonus. The hot \"buffet\" breakfast (whilst lmited in choice) was more than sufficient to satisfy our group at the start of each day. Onsite parking cost extra (US$25 per day), this didn't bother us but it is something that you have to keep in mind if you plan to use the parking facilities at the hotel. Valet parking is available, but if you want to save yourself the cost of a tip then try self parking. For airport tarnsfers we went by private van with Go Shuttle.

Be warned of the way they drive tho, it was a slightly frightening experience after 11 hours on a plane! We didnt have a car there so did all organised tours, one through VIP tours and one through Starline Tours. The VIP tour was a tour of LA including Hollywood, Venice Beach, Downtown LA and Beverly HIlls. This lasted approx 3/4 day and was really worth the money.

Hollywood itself seems to be quite overrated but the hotel was a great place to call home for six days. Check-in was easy and all of the front desk staff we encountered during our stay were pleasant. Had a nice chat with the girls while they were watching the Super Bowl during the quieter moments of the day. They even helped us plan our trip to the San Diego Zoo (and remembered us well enough to ask how it was when we returned). The room was quite spacious though perhaps a little dark with no proper lights, only floor and table lamps. Bathroom was nice and the bed super comfy...not much street noise either and you'd never know that busy Hollywood Blvd was close by. Free buffet breakfast every morning was a Godsend - nice supply of toast, bagels, cinnamon rolls, various cereals, milk, yoghurt, scrambled and hard-boiled eggs, bacon, sausage, juice, coffee, fruit, and more...fabulous! As a tip, it's probably a good idea to swipe a couple of paper plates, bowls and some cutlery from the breakfast room in the morning as although there is a kitchenette in the room, there is nothing to eat your food on or with. Only had two problems during our stay, both of which were handled by staff very, very quickly. Once our room key stopped working and it was immediately replaced by the girls on the desk, and towards the end of the trip our toilet backed up but the maintenance man was quick to fix that also. The free Wi-Fi was horribly slow at times in our 4th floor room...that's probably the only real complaint I would have. The small business centre was more than adequate for those times where we had to email home. We didn't have a car for the whole duration of our holiday but as tourists we made good use of the hop-on hop-off buses that most major touristy cities have. The company we used in Hollywood started from outside the Chinese Theatre so that was very convenient and the information they provided, as well as the variety of loops to take you to Downtown LA, Santa Monica, the hills, etc were great. Ordered in a couple of nights from some of the restaurants listed in the hotel's booklet...good experiences all round. There's a convenience store and Subway across the road (if you can ignore all of the scary people hanging around at night), and the sushi restaurant, Shinto is to die for!

Impressed by breakfast assortment and change of meat daily. There was even peeled boiled eggs and delicious warm cinnamon rolls!

Room could have been cleaned better, found food on telephone and mildew spot on shower curtain. Beds were comfortable and everything worked fine. Dissapointed that 2 cardio machines were broken in gym. Front desk gave me a small discount upon check-out for our A/C experience. Free Internet was great. Self parking same fee as valet. Our rental car scraped the top of the garage ramp everytime between 1st and 2nd floor. Make you turn wide because it is a steep ramp that just flattens sharply.

The pool is on the same floor, although to cold to use it. Also have a business center with two computers to use. We arrived later at night so was a little difficult to find as it was already dark.

There's a small shopping strip directly across the road with a Convenience Store, Subway etc - very handy. Our room faced onto Highland St which was predictably busy traffic wise until the early hours. Heavy blinds helped, and it wasn't really a problem and you shouldn't really expect quiet in Hollywood! Parking was $20 overnight, but very convenient. Enterprise Rental car is a short walk up the road (worked well for us as it was our 1st night in US). Price was surprisingly cheap given it's location.

Rooms clean and decently sized with desk, big chair, large TV, fridge. Bathrooms clean with standard cinnamon scented amenities. Wireless worked in one room but not the other. Hotel provided us with ethernet cable during stay. Parking an additional cost but worth it because safe and connected to hotel elevators. Area has large amount of traffic and with events at Hollywood Bowl would have made finding our own parking incredibly frustrating. Stayed three nights and location was perfect for our L.A. visit. Breakfast was standard HI Express fare and tasty. Seating is limited given size of hotel. Get there early if you don't want to miss the cinnamon rolls. Pool and weight room. Tried all-in-one machine for weight lifting, kinda confusing but okay. Sister liked elliptical. Laundry machines satisfactory. Halls can kind of wind around, especially above 5th floor but not too bad once you learn your way. Area ideas include: The Hideout, inside the Hollywood Heights Hotel, is just a few doors down from HI Express. Went for dinner, service and food was excellent - try the sweet potato fries. The mini strip mall across from the HI Express has a decent Subway (with fresh avocado) and a small grocery with a Pizza Bella pizzeria inside - these are above average options for late night noshing - take food to your room though. Another pizza place in the neighborhood is just off Hollywood,at Yucca and Ivar, called Village Pizzeria. This serious NYC 'za is awesome. Create your own slice and save room for the italian ices. Finally, if you're a make-up junkie like me, there is a Sephora just a few blocks walking distance within the enormous open air mall along the walk of fame called the Hollywood & Highland Center.

The pool was quite small, but it was warm and very clean and very well received after a hot day out and about. The hotel was about 5 mins walk from Hollywood Boulevard where you could get transport to most locations. One day we took the metro to universal studios which was only one stop away. The tube was clean and not busy. We then took the free shuttle bus from the metro station to Universal Studios. The second day we took the metro bus from hollywood boulevard to Santa monica and had a fab day...if you go try Bubba Gumps the shrimp if awesome! We walked from Sanat Monica to Venice beach it was a nice walk but it took a good hour. Venice Beach is nothing special and once you have seen it you are ready to go back to Santa Monica! The bus service was great and cost only $5 each to hop and ond off all day. We also took the Bus to Beverly Hills, Farmers Market and The Grove all for $5 all day travel what a bargain.

We were glad that other Trip Advisor reviewers had warned about this though as it helped us be on the lookout for it. You can walk to the Grauman Chinese Theatre and the Hollywood Walk of Fame easily (10 minutes) and Paramount is close by.

The location was great, with spacious & clean room as well as sumptuous breakfast. However, if my friends/family or I were to visit LA in the near future, I will not return or recommend this hotel at all. Due to some last minute changes, we booked a Suite on the first night and a Standard Room for the rest of the nights. On the first night, two strangers knocked on our door repeatedly at 4am and tried to force it open. Being a light sleeper, I was woken up by it but thought it was probably just my imagination. Minutes later, when the nuisance continued, I woke my husband up and he talked to the men. The seemingly drunk men insisted that we should open the door as they believed the person they're looking for is inside our room. As tourists, we were scared for our lives. Security was obviously lacking there. We called the Reception, police came, we heard some loud noise outside and found out the next morning that the guests in our next room were asked to leave. Our following day was ruined as we didn't have a good night rest and were too tired to enjoy our itinerary. One of the Reception staff was friendly but gave us the wrong directions to Warner Bros Studios. We hard to learn this the hard way, where we walked aimlessly for 30 mins searching for the place, when we could have come off the bus much earlier. So do double check whatever directions/facts before you leave for your intended destination. Also, as we wanted to do web check-in for our flight home which is past midnight and this can only be done 24 hours before, we requested for usage of computer the night before at the Reception. The Reception staff on-duty wasn't very happy that we interrupted her 'sleep' and was grumpy throughout the 10 minutes we were there. We would have gone to the Business Centre if we could, but the printer was faulty there and we had to print our boarding passes as part of the process. Those were just little hiccups which we can afford to forgive and forget. But what happens next is rather intolerable to me. When we went to the Reception on 17 May morning to be transferred to a Standard Room which we've booked for the next 3 nights, the Reception upgraded us to remain in the Suite although we did NOT ask for it or complain about anything. Little did we know the real trouble began here. Upon returning to my country, I realized that I've been charged an extra US$90 for the taxes of room upgrade that we didn't ask for! Bearing in mind that I wasn't even asked to sign or authorize any transaction when we checked out. When questioned, the Management explained that I've been charged for the extra balance of taxes on room upgrade. I replied to inform the whole situation - that the upgrade was given voluntarily by the Reception staff without any requests from neither me or my husband - and even gave a detailed table of amount paid. It has been over a week and I'm still waiting for a reply. Desperate for a solution, I've also emailed the Holiday Inn Guest Relations but to no avail. Lesson to learn here is well, I don't know....maybe decline any complimentary upgrade given or to be safe and trouble-free, don't stay there? The after-sales service definitely needs some serious bucking up. I hope the Management will kindly reply to my email, rectify the situation promptly and reverse the charges for something I did not ask for. I am a fellow hotelier too and know that it is of utmost importance to leave a good impression to all guests, whether they return or not in the future.

On arrival we were allocated a room on the 3rd floor, then the gentleman on reception mentioned the breakfast room was on the floor above this - I queried if we were directly below it (as we had just been in a really noisy hotel and I needed to get some sleep!) and he said 'no but tell you what i'll upgrade you anyway' - how nice. We had just booked a standard king room but he gave us an exec room instead which had a bit more space. This was very kind of him and he was very helpful the whole time. The room did face the street, which was very busy and noisy, but as we needed the aircon on both nights (it got up to 102 at one point) it drowned out any noise anyway, so it wasn't an issue. The room was very nice and spacious, with a sink and fridge in the sitting area. The bathroom was very small but clean and everything worked well. The 2 main reasons we booked this hotel were (apart from the good reviews) the fact that you got internet access and breakfast as part of the price. The internet access was available in the room/ wi-fi and in the business centre (2 computers in a room beside the pool which never seemed to be busy) we didn't ever have any issues getting connected in the room. The breakfast room overlooked the pool and the cereal/ toast/ eggs/ sausage were a good start to each day. The hotel offers valet and self parking but they both cost $22/ day so we opted for valet, not that it made much difference as it's a tiny car park just off reception. But the car park attendants were always quick and friendly. The hotel is a 5 min walk (only that long due to traffic) to the Hollywood & Highland shopping complex which we ate at both nights (uWink & California pizza kitchen) and the walk of fame is on the other side of this.

Special kudos to the valet, Luciano, who was especially friendly, helpful, and always smiling! So, let me highlight the pros: The hotel is new and nicely maintained. It has a good breakfast (with some hot food items) and a nice heated outdoor pool. The rooms are nicely appointed, with nice large flat panel TVs and comfortable beds and work space. The staff are all very pleasant and helpful. Now, the cons: If you plan on traveling a lot by car, I would suggest a different hotel. Parking in the hotel garage is $22 per day, and traffic in this area is particularly heavy and it is located near a busy intersection, making it exceptionally difficult to get back to the hotel by car. It is virtually impossible to turn into the hotel by turning left across traffic, because there rarely are openings in the traffic (seriously, I was there four days and saw the traffic at many different times of the day; it was crazy how difficult it was to get into the hotel from the south). You pretty much have to always come in from the north-- so you can make a right turn into the hotel garage. So, on future trips to the area, I will choose a hotel that is more car-friendly. But, other than the car issue, I highly recommend the hotel.", "Date": "March 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cClean new hotel, friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "Dottybug", "ReviewID": "UR26619175", "Content": "We stayed here from 3/14 - 3/17. The hotel is easy to get to off highway 101. Highland Blvd. is a very busy street so turning left out of the hotel parking lot is almost impossible, you have to go another way if you need to go north on Highland, like if you are going to Universal Studios which is not far up 101. The hotel is very new and is therefore very clean. The staff was always friendly and always greeted us warmly with a smile - the front desk staff, the parking attendant, the maids and the breakfast buffet custodian, everybody. The lobby is tiny and only consists of the front desk. Everything else is on the 4th floor, which is good for security purposes. There is a convenience store and a few food places across HIghland, but I felt a bit uncomfortable going there because there are bums that hang out in the parking lot. However they did not bother us for handouts or harass us in any way, it's just a little disconcerting that they are around. The location of the hotel is very convenient to Hollywood Blvd, practically around the corner from the famous Graumann's Theater. Be aware that it is an uphill walk back to the hotel from there, but it is only about 2 - 3 blocks. You can find lots of places to eat there too - we went to the Disney Soda Fountain for an ice cream treat right at the corner of Highland and Hollywood, yum! Our room was an executive queen suite, which was a very large room for a family of four and probably fit 6 comfortably. It was offered to us at the same price as the standard two queen room so it was a good deal at the time. There is no separate living room, just an arched wall separating the beds from the sofabed. The sofabed, being new, was in good shape and not lumpy or uneven. When opened there was still plenty enough space to maneuver around. The queen beds were wonderful and I liked that they provided lots of pillows on the beds. I added photos of the room so you can see how it looks. We were on the 4th floor which was THE BEST, get a room there if you can because all the amenities are there - business center, pool and FREE breakfast buffet. Our room was in a corner of the building and was a few steps from all the amenities and I felt safe letting my 12 and 9 year old daughters run out to breakfast alone to grab a bite in the morning while I finished getting ready. Even though our room was right along Highland Blvd, we never heard traffic noises, and like I said it's a very busy street. I wasn't expecting much from the breakfast buffet because it was free but I was pleasantly surprised. Every morning, there were eggs, bacon or sausage, an array of bready items (bagels, bread, muffins, pastries, cereal), juices, milk and coffee/tea. A very decent start to our day. We really enjoyed our stay here and would definitely recommend this hotel.

There is no room service, although there are soft drinks and snacks on sale in the lobby. If I had any complaints with this hotel, it would be that the friendly young people working at the desk seem to be under a lot of pressure to sell pre-packaged city tours. Perhaps this is part of their compensation. At any rate, any request for directions around town had them pulling out their color pamphlets and recommending the most expensive, five-hour tour, and encouraging us to book now, now, NOW!

They were just average. The wireless internet in the room rarely worked. They gave me a password to access the wireless, but it didn\u2019t work.
