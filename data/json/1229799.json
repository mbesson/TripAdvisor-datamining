We had breakfast included which was very good. They had made to order eggs/omelettes with yummy pastries. I really liked the coffee machine they had. The room we had on the 8th floor was huge (for Europe)! Loved the king size bed and big bathroom. I loved the modern look of our room. I fell in love with the mural in the bathroom. See my picture.

Less well known than other Parisian landmark hotels, The Renaissance offers a conveniently located, intimate--yet full-service--hotel in the heart of the city. The rooms were generously proportioned and nicely appointed, complete with wi-fi, mini bar, coffee maker, safe. and other necessities for travelers. Our rooms were quiet and very clean. The bathrooms were well-stocked with supplies, while the showers provided an ample supply of hot water. But the one attribute that made this home-away-from-home so memorable for us, was the hotel and concierge staff. From the day we made our reservations to the last good-bye, we were well cared for by the Renaissance team of, \"Destination Experts\". Xavier, Remi, Chloe, and Guillerme were unfailingly helpful in our quest to make the most of our time in Paris, but one concierge--Cedric--went above and beyond the call of duty, using his insight to assist us with reservations, research, and recommendations to help ensure a rich and rewarding vacation experience for our whole family. His assistance in planning our events was invaluable, and his dedication and professionalism were noteworthy. He gave us exceptional service, and we would welcome the opportunity to stay at The Renaissance Arc de Triomphe again in the near future.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver.

So happy we did! Concierge: a couple of days prior to our arrival, we received a welcome email from the concierge. They promptly replied to all my emails about transportation to and from the airport, museum passes and restaurant recommendations. While we were there, everybody was very friendly and helpful. We also purchased the Paris museum pass and river cruise tickets from them. It was a little more expensive than buying it elsewhere but it was very convenient to just have it readily available. Additionally, they were able to reserve us a table at Guy Savoy (which is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel) 2 days beforehand. Rooms: we had a mid level floor room. One of the main reasons I booked here was because the rooms were considerably larger than the other hotels I was looking at. Spacious and very clean. Nice sized bathroom. I know people complained about the half door shower but we didn't have any problems with it. We also had a small balcony which included a small table and one chair. Nice to have but our balcony also faced a bunch of other balconies so not much privacy. We actually ended up spending more time sleeping in the room and coming back to change/rest than we anticipated so it was nice to have a comfortable, larger room to relax in. They also had turndown service every night and left chocolates and various items (Eiffel tower keychain, post it notes, etc...). Like the others, we also received a complimentary bottle of champagne, chocolate dipped strawberries, a candle and book the first night. Location: right down the street from Arc de Triomphe and very close to the Charles de Gaulle Etoile Metro. We explored all over Paris using the Metro system. Next time we may try to stay at a different hotel just to experience another area... But would definitely come back here if we decide to stay in the same area again.

My wife and I were in Paris for a few days to celebrate our wedding anniversary. I mentioned this in an email to the hotel along with our arrival time and a request for a room on a high floor (to stay away from the Paris street noise). All of our requests were met. We checked into our room at 10:30 am and were booked on the top floor of the hotel. A few hours after checking in, they delivered a nice bottle of champagne, some chocolate covered stawberries, a small heart shaped candle, and a small book on the best places to kiss in Paris. That was over the top! I've had other hotels deliver wine or champagne or just a fruit basket, but never this much. The rest of our stay was great. Breakfast was included (Marriott Gold level) and was tasty. Usual beakfast buffet; everything was fresh and hot. The location is very convenient. We walked miles around the area. We used the Concierge to book restaurant reservations and a half day trip to Versailles. Both were excellent. The restuarant, Chez Gabrielle, was close to the hotel and was very good. I had the sea bass and my wife had the scallops. Prices were reasonable for Paris. Back to the hotel. The room was modern and comfortable. Several have commented on the shower setup, but you can limit the water leakage with an extra towel on the floor. I liked the 2 showerheads. Wireless internet was easy to access, but a little slow.

The bathroom was large - even by US standards and again looked brand new.

A couple of notes for US travelers: This property is excellent - don't be afraid to email them your questions or needs as they went out of their way to work with us. Also, if you have never been to Paris - take your food budget and double it - Paris is very expensive and about 25% higher than New York based on my experience. Excellent - just expensive.

The Champs Elysses is a three minute walk-Paris on your doorstep! We were in Paris for the rugby match so didn't actually spend as much time in the hotel as we would have liked. The proof of the service in this hotel, however, materialised when we ran into difficulty. We checked out the following morning and spent the day sightseeing. That evening we were making our way out to CDG when the entire RER B line went down and was suspended for the evening. We attempted a mad dash by taxi but our flight had departed. On returning to the hotel, they quickly found us a room for the night and assisted us in rebooking flights for the following morning. On returning home, I needed proof of what had transpired in Paris for my travel insurance and e-mailed the hotel.

Yes, it is fun to return after a day out and find a little surprise from the staff (wine, chocolates, post it flags, etc.), but it was better to be able to control the temp--we liked it warm when we first returned home, then turned it down a bit. Bathroom was great--lots of room for toiletries. Took a wonderful deep bath one night to warm up after walking, as bath salts are provided. Slippers and robes were also a nice touch. Wish there had been a third chair to lounge in, as my sitting area ended up being the bed. The room was not at all cramped--spacious despite 8 suitcases!!

The breakfast in the restaurant was only so-so, and I would suggest that you frequent another local restaurant if breakfast is not included and you are expected to pay the full 28 euro price. (There is a Starbuck's and a McDonald's within a short walk as well as other typical French sidewalk cafes.) The dinner we had there was delightful, if a little pricey.

Preferred the Paris Marriott Champs Elysees Hotel\u201d", "Author": "surfinginflorida", "ReviewID": "UR124312234", "Content": "When we were choosing which Marriott to stay in Paris, we had a hard time choosing between this one and the Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe, so we stayed at both. In this review I will compare the two because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure many travelers are faced with the same decision. Check-in: We tried to get early check-in to both the Paris Marriott Champs Elysees Hotel (Marriott) and the Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe (Renaissance). In both cases, we had to wait for our room because they were getting special rooms available for us (overlooking the Champs Elysees at the Marriott, and a room with a curved window at the Renaissance). No problem, we left our luggage and explored Paris. When we returned (in both cases around 6:00), we were not in the premium rooms promised at either hotel! The rooms were nice; they just faced the courtyard instead. At the Marriott, our luggage was in the room, along with a welcome gift (1/2 bottle of wine, bottle of water and desserts) and our Marriott Rewards gift (1/2 bottle of wine and a fabulous cheese platter). At the Renaissance, we had a welcome gift (bottle of wine and some fishy-tasting crackers) but had to wait for our luggage and rewards gift. Rooms: Both rooms were nice, a little on the small side and comparable with amenities. The Marriott was elegant, with a nice garden tub and separate shower. The furnishings were elegant, the bed was not as comfortable -- it felt like there was quilt serving as a pillow-top on top of the mattress. The Renaissance was understated luxury -- more trendy furniture but a very comfortable bed. The bathroom did not have a tub, but had a nice rain shower head. The Renaissance was cleaner. Service: I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think there was any comparison in service. At the Marriott, you would never touch a door \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the bellmen/doormen were extremely attentive and helpful. The front desk and concierge were also great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it was nice to have our luggage taken to our room without request. My husband is a platinum Marriott member, and after reading the reviews of the Renaissance, we were very disappointed with our service. The front desk was great, but that was the extent. We would come home at night, and rather than opening the door, the bellman just stared at us (I thought he was a security guard trying to act hard). It took over two hours to get a bottle of wine that we were promised would be delivered in five minutes. Unless we greeted the reception area personnel first, we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t acknowledged. Not typical for a Marriott, being French isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a good excuse. Location: Marriott is in a better location. There were several homeless people sleeping on the grates near the Renaissance. Restaurant: Breakfast was much better at the Marriott, as was the service. The Marriott was relaxing and bright and cheerful. The Renaissance was more suited for the evening, and the morning servers acted like they had a late evening out. If I went back to Paris, I would choose the Paris Marriott Champs Elysees Hotel over the Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe. Even though the Renaissance bed was more comfortable and I enjoyed the trendier atmosphere, service is #1 and the Renaissance just wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there.", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portsmouth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding service levels\u201d", "Author": "Tim M", "ReviewID": "UR124263173", "Content": "From the welcome to the farewell, service standards at this modern hotel are as close to faultless as one will probably find in the real world.

This time I went to Florence, Rome, and Paris. I couldn't wait to write this review for this property because I was impressed with the customer service that my family and I received. Check-In: We stayed at this property for 3 nights. I requested an early check-in because our flight from Rome was early. They were able to accommodate my request with no problem. In fact, I received an email prior to my arrival confirming my reservation and asking if I had any special request which I did. I requested a feather free room. During the check-in process, the lady told me that they made sure the room was feather free. It was a very smooth process. Complimentary Gifts: I'm a Platinum Elite Marriott Rewards member. One of the benefits I selected is a half bottle of wine and chocolate. As soon as we got inside the room and our bags delivered, the phone rang asking if they can go ahead and deliver the welcome gift. I said sure and literally less than a minute later, someone was already knocking at the door. To my suprise, she had 2 regular bottles (NOT half bottles) of Bordeaux, 4 mugs, and lots of chocolate. I am a wine lover so I couldn't stop smiling. As if that was not enough, the next evening, someone knocked at the door again and when I opened, a very nice young lady asked if they could offer me a complimentary pre-chilled bottle of champagne! I thought they made a mistake because I already received my welcome gift but she assured me that she has the right room. Wow! Breakfast: Their breakfast is very good. I received 4 complimentary breakfast buffet (worth 28 euros each) as one of my elite status benefits. There's oatmeal, eggs, sausage, mushroom, smoked salmon, halibut, mackerel, pancakes, fresh fruits, juice, capuccino. My kids liked the sample smoothie at the reception so we ordered a bigger portion as well as hot chocolate from the staff. They were very attentive and delivered right away. That's not the best part though. The next two mornings, I was greeted by my name (I'm wondering how they remembered me because there are quite a bit of people staying there) and the staff remembered that my kids liked the strawberry banana smoothie and chocolate so they just delivered it to us without even asking for it. How is that for personal service? I've been to many hotels all over the world but that level of personal service is not common. (Well, another hotel that had the similar service was the Renaissance in Makati, Philippines.) Concierge: As stated, I only stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. Our time there was limited. We asked the concierge for some directions for the Metro and other point of interests. He went above and beyond of what we asked him. He basically arranged our itinerary for us. He told us where to go first to minimize the number of metro transfers that we had to do, where to shop, what to see, etc. It was the next best thing to having a personal tour guide. Our day was extremely efficient and we accomplished a lot because of his help. There were other times we asked for the concierge's help. Valet - On our last day there, my wife wanted to go to a pharmacy to buy a cosmetic product. She approached one of the valet attendant and asked what time the pharmacy opens (we didn't realize there were a couple in the area). My wife was extremely surprised and impressed when the attendant said \"I'll go check for you madame\". Then, he ran to the pharmacy to check. Again, wow! That was totally unexpected. I can go on and on but the bottom line is that this hotel is great! If you're in Paris, stay at this hotel! You won't be disappointed I used to stay at another high end Marriott in Paris (not too far away from this location) but from now on, I will be staying at this property whenever I'm in Paris.

In general, the hotel is in a phenomenal location - 2 blocks from the Arc de Triomphe; in between 2 different Metro lines and several blocks over from the Champs. (For those flying in to CDG, the Air France bus (Les Cars Air France), stops 2 - 3 blocks up and one street over - with limited luggage it would be a very manageabe walk...having said that - we took cabs from and to the airport - early saturday am in and around 3:00 on friday returning and both fares - with and without traffic - were right around 40 euros...I believe the bus is 19 each way...there were two of us so for the extra euro? I like the cab myself) The rooms are very contemporary and very clean - they do show a bit of wear since last year but nothing overt (scuff marks here and there, a bit of peeling paint on the ceiling in the bathroom). The breakfast buffet (included with Marriott status) has not changed at all and that is fine - eggs, bacon, sausage, several types of coffee, fruits and breads - free? It's a great deal...for 28 euros? eh... Why do I say this was almost as good as the last stay? We got off to a little bit of a rocky start - while the hotel staff was very accomodating in checking us in to our room at 10.30 am (vs. 3.00 pm ck in) - it took 3 phone calls and personal trip downstairs to get our luggage delivered over an hour later...things do happen and we were perhaps a wee bit grumpy from the traveling to get there...so I consider it a wash but I was a little disappointed with that... Having said that - I have absolutely no other complaints about our stay there (and if you read the review on my Bellagion stay in Vegas a couple of weeks ago - I will say it!) The staff is wonderful and accomodating - the concierge's are truly helpful. If you reference my review from last year you will see my glowing reference to the Bosch espresso machine in the room - sadly - unbeknownst to me that was an upgraded room; while the room we were in had a kettle with instant coffees provided, it was not the Bosch and I missed it!

The hotel is located convienently just about 3 blocks from the Arc De Triomphe and the Champs Elysee. A taxi to the hotel from CDG airport is about 45 Euro (not during rush hour). Or a cheap and also convienent alternative is to take the Air France bus, direct from the Airport to the Arc De Triomphe for about 13 euro, and then walk three blocks. Note, when you take the Air France bus, take the bus from the airport that stops at the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Etoille.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Charles De Gualle Etoille is the name of the metro stop at the Arc De Triomphe, so those names are often used interchangeably for the location. Also the metro here is very convienent, because metro Line 1 stops at the Etoille, which can be used to get the Louvre, and many of the other touristy sites in Paris. And for those of you that can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t live without McDonalds and/or Starbucks, both are within 2 blocks of the hotel as well. The hotel itself is has a modern architecture and style with a bit of French / Asian fusion flair. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 8 stories tall, and the street side has a set of curvy/wavy windows that glow at night. The lobby is surrounded in dark wood tones, with red and yellow lighting that are meant to simulate candles. The lobby itself is small as most Paris hotels are, but is typically very well staffed. There were often not one, but two doormen that would open the doors to the hotel upon my arrival. Off of the lobby is the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant, Makkasar. A French/asian fusion restaurant. As the hotel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a concierge lounge, Gold and Platinum members get a free breakfast in the restaurant on weekdays. The breakfast is a full American breakfast that was really quite good. The breakfast included eggs, pancakes, sausages, oatmeal, mushrooms, potatoes, fruits, yogurts, cereal, and typical French pastries. I had e-mailed the hotel a couple days before arrival asking for an early check-in at 9am. When I arrived at 9am, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite ready, but was ready within 15 minutes of my arrival. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really nice to be able to check in early after a long flight from the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so this really earned the hotel extra points in my opinion. Most hotels in Paris are pretty strict on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no check-ins before 3pm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rule. As a platinum member, I was offered my choice of welcome gift. I picked 2 glasses of iced tea, and chocolates. The iced tea was a very interesting cinnamon flavored tea. But I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a different type of iced tea each day. Heading up to my room, I went in to one of the two hotel elevators. Each elevator glows in a different color\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 one glows with blue neon, and the other glows with red neon. The blue elevator is a bit more soothing than the red one. The room itself was relatively spacious, and continued with the dark wood tones from the lobby with bright pink accents on the bed. The room had the standard amenities, king bed, desk, desk chair, side chair. The room has a mini-bar that is only half-full, which leaves room for any beverages that you might want to keep cold. Two interesting items for sale on top of the mini-bar were an umbrella, and a power plug adapter. My sleep quality in the room was great. The room itself was very quiet. The bed was comfy. The air conditioning was cold when I wanted it to be, and warm when I wanted it to be warm. Unlike many Paris hotels, the air conditioning and/or heat works all year round here. Many older hotels in Paris will only offer heat *or* air conditioning depending upon the time of the year, which is always sucky on those hot days in the middle of winter when the air conditioning doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. The bathroom was nice and new, although a little dark as far as the lighting was concerned. The tub/shower had the typical French half/glass curtain. I always find these weird, because water seems to get everywhere when you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a full curtain in the shower\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. But maybe I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just a messy shower taker. One of the coolest things in the room was actually in the bathroom\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 in the corner there was a piece of art with half of the Eiffel tower on it, then a mirror that reflected it, and made a whole Eiffel tower. See the video to understand what I mean. My room faced the interior courtyard of the hotel, so it also had a small balcony with a table and single chair. I always like being able to get fresh air in to a room, so the balcony was nice. The hotel really went overboard with the turn-down service each evening. My first evening, the turndown service included the regular chocolate you might expect, but also a bottle of wine, some olives, chips, and a small metal notepad. Each night the chocolates and office supply item were different, and there was also a printed weather forecast for the next day. My 2nd evening, there was the chocolate again, and also another notepad, but this time with post-it notes inside. And on my final evening, again the chocolate, and a paper holder to be used on a desk. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never been in a hotel with office supplies as part of the turndown service\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but I was always excited to come back to the room to see what was going to show up that evening. Much better than the just the standard mint on the pillow. Each floor of the hotel has its own small ice machine, that in addition to dispensing ice, also dispenses filtered water. My only real complaint staying here is that the internet was extremely slow. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if they were having issues, but it took like 15 minutes to download a 5 megabyte file. For a high-end hotel, this is really something they should fix. Overall a very nice hotel, in a convenient location in central Paris. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also stayed at the Marriott Rive Gauche, and the Renaissance Trocadero, and this one is my favorite of the three.", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Petersburg, Florida", "Title": "\u201cTerrific hotel and stay\u201d", "Author": "Al_travel_10", "ReviewID": "UR120856405", "Content": "Was able to spend 2 days at this hotel recently and it more than lived up to expectations.

We were close to the Charles de Gaulle-Etoile Metro station with many subway options (or you can take a beautiful walk to the Eiffel Tower or Louvre, as we did). The main downside is that you're in the touristy Champs Elysee area, so there's less available in terms of inexpensive bites and bars.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salisbury, Maryland USA", "Title": "\u201cUsed all my Marriot points and it was worth it!\u201d", "Author": "Karenkinm", "ReviewID": "UR120769779", "Content": "We had only 2 days to spend in Paris so we needed a central location to make the most of the time we had.

The room was lovely - very clean, very quiet, great bathroom, very very comfy bed which was wonderful after a long flight from Miami.

(With one minor exception at departure) Traveling with my daughter and her 10 mo. old baby boy held multiple challenges. We had finished a 4 city tour of England arriving Paris for a quick tour before embarking on a road trip to visit friends in Central France. Upon check in, our front desk agent pointed out they did have availability for a 2nd night if we desired to extend our stay. One look at my daughter's weary face, minding the baby and our luggage, I asked her opinion and she was thrilled with the prospect of resting in the same place for 2 nights instead of moving on after just 1 night. I know this seems like a silly detail, but it felt like he was reading my mind and anticipating our needs without my having to say a word! Refreshingly gracious personnel always succeed in winning loyalty, whatever your travel circumstances. This gentleman certainly won mine. Every member of the staff here spoke flawless English and clearly was at the service of their guests. I must have really looked stressed at our check-in, because in the evening, the front desk mgr. sent us a complimentary bottle of champagne along with a variety of snack crisps ~ another winning move that really helped my daughter and I relax after a busy day. It is genuinely kind gestures like these, though small details, that can create an awesome, welcoming visit vs. an average/good hotel stay. THIS RENAISSANCE is AWESOME! The room was spacious and the porta-crib was already in place for the baby's much needed morning nap. We had a mini-balcony overlooking a quiet courtyard which we preferred over the street facing view. The bathroom was roomy & state of the art with every convenience and amenity. Their renovation was thorough and impressive! Delightfully located just 4 blocks down the slope from the Arc de Triomphe says it all. Everything is either a leisurely stroll or cab ride away. Superbly convenient, especially if it is your very FIRST visit to Paris! Our plans, sadly, had to be altered due to a feverish, teething infant and the hotel staff, once again went above & beyond offering an additional night at the same rate which we gladly took them up on. One of the concierge had experience as a nanny/au pair and offered suggestions for the baby's discomfort and to call a Doctor, if we felt it was necessary. In the end, we decided not to proceed with our trip to Central France and instead chose to return to England on the Eurostar. I had already picked up my rental car, though, and this caused a panic if we were to make our scheduled train, how could I return the car to the agency AND make it to the station on time? Our decision was very last minute, granted, but I begged the concierge to assist in having the car delivered to or picked up by, our car rental co. He declined on both counts. I managed to get the car back to the agency in mid-day traffic, but it was a brutal experience that added more stress to an already dreadful situation. Everything worked out in the end, thankfully, and baby recovered. We are thankful for all the care and assistance of the compassionate staff at this Renaissance.

The hotel is very modern with minimalist decorating, so if you are looking for traditional French decor, this is not your place. I stayed in a Paris Sky View suite that had a large king bed with a very large balcony that overlooked the street with great views to the Arc and the Eiffel Tower in the distance. The bed was comfortable but took up most of the room space. Also included was a Nespresso coffee machine and a very nice bathroom with robe and slippers. The best part of the room is the view and that is what you pay for. There was nightly turn down service in which they left a little gift each night; this was cute and much appreciated. The breakfast buffet was included in the room rate and included a good array of hot and cold items including yummy smoothies. I did not eat any other meals at the restaurant so I can't comment on that. Again, a convenient location to many attractions, especially if you like to walk in one of the world's best walking cities.

I decided to try out this hotel for the trip. The photos and pictures seems to suggest at the very least, decent accommodations. As for the price, everything in Paris is ridiculously expensive so compared to other hotels, the rate can be considered as competitive. Arriving The pre-arrival welcome and follow up is good. As it was my first trip to Paris, I asked the Concierge a lot of questions. While not always the best answer, at least they bother to reply very promptly with quite complete information. Few days prior my arrival, the hotel sent several emails to check and ask if I have any specific request. I requested for a bathroom with walk-in shower. The treatment I received when I actually arrived was considerably less welcoming. I arrived by taxi and had to toll my own luggage bags into the lobby while a bell man just stand and pretend not to see me looking at a piece of paper. I supposed he is the bellhop in charged for calling cabs and not to handle luggage. The check-in process was a bit better and quick, I went up the guest room myself. On entering the room, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bottle of Red wine and a box of chocolates offered with compliments from the hotel and also a welcome letter. The Room Once again please be reminded that this is Paris and everything is ridiculously expensive. So despite paying Euro400+ a night, and booked a what the hotel called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Prestige Room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually very small, not more than 30m2 and with the large bed taking up much of the room. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a walk-in shower as per my request but no bathtub. The fittings used are of the cheap Ikea quality. The bed is too soft for me, sort of sinks down. And the working desk is very small. The TV only carry local channels when I browse through. Most of the furniture and fittings are of medium-range quality and the hotel website did a good job to make it look more appealing than in real life. Basically, this room is functional if one only used it for sleep and bath and nothing more. I also notice the usual missing amenities such as mineral water and dental kit ( which can be requested ). The toiletries were never replenished. No slippers provided. Basically the hotel only provide the bare essentials. In Asia, we will call this 3-star. But well, this is Europe and Paris, one of the most expensive city in the world. One more note, the internet is free for my room type, but it's very slow. Common Areas and Location Nothing much really because all the hotel has is a restaurant + lounge. The lobby is non-existent really, basically just a place for guest to check-in and check-out. But then, most hotels in Paris are like that. There is a lounge though with quite nice d\u00c3\u00a9cor and a restaurant which we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother to try. The hotel is well located though, within short walk distance to the Arc de Triomphe and the shopping district of Champs-Elysee. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also near a metro station but use this with upmost caution as metro stations in Paris are infested with pickpockets and scam artists. Service Service is well, just basically OK but I think this hotel runs on minimum staff. Request for ice got a call back to say all service staff are busy and would I mind taking it myself from across the guest hallway? And on a way more serious note, I unfortunately become a victim of pickpocketing in Paris by one of those low-life scumbags in a Paris Metro. The hotel did provide the address of the police station to report the incident but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about it. I also think this happened so often that they are kind of ambivalent about it. While the pre-arrival letters and email sound very welcoming, the actual delivery of the service is lukewarm. Just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect too much. I was also charged 67 Euros to make a 10 mins emergency phone call, a ridiculously exorbitant amount. Conclusion I suppose if you only need a place to sleep and take a bath, in a good location, this hotel does delivers. However, for the price, I think one can do a lot better by either pay less for more economical accommodation or slightly more to stay at a real luxury hotel. The Renaissance seems neither here nor there. I rate it a 3 out of 5, ie just adequate and think many of the rave reviews here in Tripadvisor are suspiciously over the top positive.", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat staff, excellent location..definately 5 *\u201d", "Author": "TAS75", "ReviewID": "UR117587454", "Content": "This is one of the best hotels I have had the pleasure to stay in, from the moment we arrived we were treated like royality.

When we got back to our room after dinner, a bottle of wine and chocolates were waiting for us, the bathroom was refreshed, and nougat and a small Renaissance luggage tag was waiting on the beds. That was a nice touch! The room was very nice, with a Bosch espresso machine, small balcony with a chair and a table, fabulous beds, air conditioning very good and quiet, modern and impeccable bathroom. We did not have breakfast in the hotel restaurant, after all there are a lot of nice choices in Paris including Laduree or Paul on Champs Elysees, but the restaurant looked nice.

It was expensive for a room that was a little smaller than I'd hoped for and with no good view. But overall the comfort, amenities and great location made up for it. I thought the decor was visually pleasing. The bathroom was a decent size, although the shower was strange-no shower curtain or containment of water. So half the bathroom is wet when you shower. The staff were polite and helpful in the beginning and when I called before my arrival to confirm my reservation.,At the time I checked in I mentioned that I might require a late check out, and was told by the person on duty at the time I could check out by 3PM no problem. But later on during my stay dealing with diffrent employees,I found that they were not so polite and helpful when I wanted to make sure it was noted on my file Checkout by 3PM. At first I was told there were no rooms available-all sold out b/c the weekend was starting (Friday afternoon) so I'd have to check out by 12PM. Since I had an appointment at 11:30AM there was no way I could get back to the hotel by 12PM to check out. An employee told me directly something along the lines of, \":we want to make money and sell all our rooms so you have to get out\".I told them it would be a major inconvience to me if I had to check out before leaving for my appointment and I couldn't make use of the room for at least 15 minutes just to gather my things etc after returning for my appointment. I politely asked if they could allow me to check out just a bit later, no later than 2pm. Then despite being told that they were completely booked earlier I was told I could stay in the room until 6PM if I paid for half of another night's stay. I thought they said no rooms were available. This didn't surprise me. But I still don't like it especially when I am paying a lot for the room. I know customer service and PR skills are non-existant these days. Everyone is just after money and looking for any way possible to nickel and dime customers these days. Requesting a later checkout on previous trips normally was not a problem and the hotel staff was glad to do it. The staff here could have at least pretended to be nice to my face especially since this was a very expensive stay and it's supposed to be a 5 star hotel. Of course these days most people are not genuinely nice or polite, and they could care less about you, however they can just offer lip service. I don't care whatever negatives or negative attitude they have towards someone just as long as they pretend to act nice while I'm doing business w/them. Also after my request for a late checkout, all of my other requests were ignored, such as when I asked for a set of utensils, they were never delivered.So while service was not up to 5 star standards, I did enjoy the room and everything about the hotel as long as I didn't have to deal with staff., better service was expected especially at this price point. Overall I'd stay here again, but I wouldn't expect much in they way of customer service especially if you have a special request.

One of the concierge staff recommended a tourist trap restaurant to us (a restaurant identified on tripadvisor as being a tourist scam). After that, we found our own places to eat through tripadvisor. 3. Room Service breakfast was not great. My suggestions if you stay here: -try the croissant takeout place (Croissantiere, I think) a few doors down Avenue de Wagram towards the Arc de Triomphe -I highly recommend Chez Gabrielle, a small restaurant, around the corner from the hotel on Rue d'etoile (about 100 euros for a three course meal for two with half a bottle of wine and bottle of mineral water). -Do get a Paris Museum Pass (I ordered mine online and it came in the mail without a problem) since the lineups at the Louvre and the Musee D'orsay can be over an hour. You may not save that much money on admission, but you'll be very grateful to avoid the long lineups. -For lunch at the Louvre with a refined atmosphere, good views and fairly good food, try Cafe Marly, in an open-air colonade near the Richilieu entrance. -Do try the private car tour recommended on the hotel web site.

The concierge had told us that the tickets would get us into every section of Versailles, but when we tried to get into the gardens we were turned away due to the fact that our tickets were old. The had been purchased before high season and therefor we had to get back on a line and pay an additional fee to get into the gardens. When we got back to the hotel we expressed our disappointment and we were basically dismissed and told that the attendant at Versailles was only trying to take advantage of us because we were \"tourists\" even though everyone there is a tourist. The concierge told us he would look into it and then he never contacted us again was we actually didn't see him there for the next 2 days. I finally got a hold of a computer and sure enough the tickets that were sold to us by the concierge were old and were NOT the correct price. The hotel buys these tickets in bulk and they will go to any lengths to sell them to their guests even if they have to lie to them. Please BEWARE. Do not buy tickets from the concierge at this hotel. Since they even failed to contact us regarding the situation,we were left with a bad view of this hotel that would not and could not admit their mistake. They also kept our money with no explanation or apology. If anything they took advantage of us because we were \"tourists.\"", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Westchester County, NY", "Title": "\u201cA very good hotel\u201d", "Author": "Nameless64", "ReviewID": "UR105173554", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Renaissance in mid April 2011. In many ways this is an excellent hotel, but there were a few demerits. Positives: location is a few short blocks from the Arc de Triomphe, close to two Metro stops, one of which is the Charles de Gaulle/Etoile stop that includes links to the RER system. It is a reasonable walk (ten or fifteen minutes) to the beautiful Parc Monceau, and just a few blocks from the Salle Pleyel, one of the major concert halls in Paris, where we saw a wonderful concert by the Orchestra of the Paris Opera. The staff was just about universally friendly and accommodating. In particular C\u00c3\u00a9dric, one of the concierge staff, was quite helpful. Directions and suggestions were happily supplied, with copious google map printouts and highlighted routes and the like. The daily housekeeping service was efficient and timely. The place was spotless. When one night the promised turndown service never arrived, the next morning we had a personal note of apology from the manager, accompanied by a (quite good) bottle of wine and a small box of chocolates. The room was spacious and had a view overlooking the patio area outside the hotel restaurant. There was a small balcony with one chair, a table, and an ashtray. The soundproofing was excellent, and we were able to sleep in every morning without disturbance. The bed was very comfortable. Wifi worked well. The shower was poorly designed, but otherwise the bathroom was roomy, with good water pressure. Although we were using Marriott points to pay for the room, we were never treated as second-class citizens. We received the breakfast buffet for free, thanks to our Marriott platinum status. Negatives: It's a good thing the buffet was free, as it wasn't very good. The hot food was consistently cold, whether the items had been out there for a while or came straight from the kitchen. The fresh fruit was excellent. Often we would be finishing our breakfast before any staff came by to ask if we wanted coffee. I got the sense that the waitstaff didn't really know what to do with a buffet. Perhaps they are unusual in France? In any event, I would never have paid the (quite high) tariff they were demanding for this mediocre petit dejeuner. The following is a suspicion; I could be wrong. When the aforementioned C\u00c3\u00a9dric wasn't at the concierge desk, I got the sense that the other concierges were directing us to restaurants with which the concierge had a prior relationship. i was twice told to give a particular place a try, and to \"give them my card.\" I felt like I was being exploited somehow. Again, maybe I'm just paranoid, but it made me uneasy. I would definitely return to this hotel, but I think next time I would do more research on restaurants on my own beforehand.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA welcoming, helpful, modern hotel in Paris\u201d", "Author": "Mgregori", "ReviewID": "UR104245592", "Content": "While our stay was quite short the experience was great.

A pleasant surprise for us is when we returned to our room from an evening of touring to find a bottle of champagne on ice, a candle and a small gift.

It was one of our better stays in Paris and it didn't break the bank either. This hotel was just given a 5 star rating by the French hotel government rating system, but make no mistake, it's not like staying at the Ritz... more like staying at a new Westin or Hyatt. You could be in Paris or Atlanta after you walk in the door. The location is very convenient to public transportation... you can take the Air France bus (they're called \"cars,\" which confused us after a 12 hour long flight) from CDG and get dropped off just a block away, across from the Arc. There are also two metro stations within two blocks... so if you don't mind going underground, you can get anywhere in the city easily. The immediate neighborhood is nice, middle/upper middle class residential, but not too fancy. There were one or two homeless men sleeping on the sidewalk on the same block as the hotel, but they did not bother anyone. It felt like a safe environment, even late at night. There are two categories of rooms... we stayed in both during our time at the hotel. There are rooms on the streetside with the spectacular curvy floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall windows... and the more conventional rooms on the courtyard in back, which have a small balcony and a chair (which I know some people would like). The rooms in back are cheaper and the courtyard in late winter/spring isn't all that attractive. Still, you can look over the rooftops if you get up to the fourth floor or higher. On the street side, you look through those undulating, quadruple-paned windows at the 6-story high block long french mansard-roofed residential blocks across the street (we could also see the very, very top of the Eiffel Tower if we craned our necks.) Those curving windows look fantastic in the daytime (and in the website photos taken at night), but we had to keep our curtain closed after dark... otherwise you are TOTALLY on display. That said, we'd still take them over the back rooms with the courtyard view. For Paris (and virtually anywhere else), the rooms in both categories are huge and tastefully decorated in a hip, not quite W hotel kind of way. We got a great night's sleep every night. The beds are really, really, really, really comfortable. Just as important, the street front rooms are soundproofed... and there are a lot of cars and busses passing in front of the hotel. The bathrooms are large and attractive... excellent water pressure in the shower and a cool Eiffel Tower art piece by the toilet (it's reflected in a mirror... you'll have to see it to understand). The staff was very friendly and accommodating throughout our stay (except for the guys at the desk on the street who never said hello to us once... not sure if they were valets. It would help if they at least smiled at guests walking in... they didn't). There is a modern Moroccan-themed restaurant and bar in the hotel (an odd choice, I think) that was empty all day and faces the barren-in-winter courtyard. We never went inside. We had breakfast every day at a very nice McDonald's a block away, which offers free wifi on the ground floor). On the hotel website, a restaurant they recommend nearby is the Relais de l'Entrecote. It wasn't good... we've eaten at the one in Geneva which was far better. You might want to try Relais de Venise in Porte Maillot for the steak/frites experience. Now to the negatives. One big one. The hotel is built on top of two furniture stores. The lobby is located behind the stores and is small, long and narrow... as a result, it's no place you'd want to spend time or meet people. You have to walk alongside a furniture store display window to enter the hotel, as the lobby is set back from the street. The entrance looks tacky and made us enjoy our stay less, which is too bad, because the rest of the hotel is well-designed and the facade from the second floor up is very, very cool with all those curvy windows. Another negative... because of those huge windows on the streetside rooms, the a/c could not keep up on a warmish day. We'd return if we could get another good deal (we booked on the Marriott site). To be honest, we were expecting more of a luxe experience. We 'd give it 4.5 stars if we could. Since we can't, we'll give it 5 for the huge rooms, the comfy beds and for filling a niche... an upscale modern hotel for people who like to stay at upscale hotels but can't afford the insanely high prices of upscale hotels in Paris.", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "roma, lazio", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "MiamiMarco", "ReviewID": "UR102450233", "Content": "The hotel is very nice, big rooms (difficoult to find in Paris) and close the tube.

I knew this when I booked the room. But still, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the point of points + money); 2) the room was small (not a big deal but for 140,000 points and 90 EUR per night, I expected more); 3) breakfast. Yes, included and served until 11 AM. But, it was not good. Examples: consistently-everyday- cold (not cool\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcold) food; one coffee maker for the entire restaurant.

I booked with Eurostar and emailed ahead to ensure our booking was correct. We arrived at night and I was a little disturbed by the thumping music from the restaurant as we arrived thinking we might not get any sleep. I was wrong, once in the lift, the sound disappeared. The hotel is modern and bright. A hotel choice for my daughter as she likes everything modern. Once at reception we were very well received and given a warm welcome. We were given a shopping package brochure which was free metro tickets and discounts, maps etc. A nice touch as I just booked the hotel with breakfast and was unaware of their packages. They swiped my credit card, gave me the room key and told us where the lifts were. The two lifts are very brightly coloured and very modern. We spent about 5 minutes pressing the button before going back to the reception to explain the lifts did not work. The receptionists looked very embarrassed as they had forgotten to tell us we had to use our room key in the lift as they had been programmed to only work with room keys to go up - a nice security touch - restaurant diners cannot get access to floors, but would have been more helpful to tell us about it. This was not a one off as we saw another couple having the same problem and another couple was joking with them that they had not been told either. Once is an error, three times is lacking. The room was bright, modern and light. Great flat screen tv and very comfy bed with bright white linen. The lounge chairs were better to look at than sit on, but not for my daughter who thought they were 'cool'. The bathroom was all dark slate and marble. Very very clean with no signs of wear whatsoever. The room was very quite. The windows being curved offered a great view. Breakfast would be my only real complaint. No-one was there to greet us or show us what was where etc. we came down at a reasonable time (9.40) and we felt a bit awkward as we did not know where to sit. After a couple of minutes we just sat down. I tracked down a waitress who made no attempt to explain how things went or where everything was. I had to ask for coffee but my daughter at that point was offered a hot chocolate. It all felt a bit awkward and I managed to source the cold buffet items. I had to again find a waitress as breakfast was included in my package and I did not know if that meant hot items (which were in an ajoining room, not with the main buffet items). I was then told that my breakfast was not included in the package. I tried to explain that it was and had been confirmed the night before. The waitress just stood and looked at me as if to say 'prove it'. So, in the middle of breakfast I had to queue in reception. The receptionist (obviously not the same one as last night) could not find where it was confirmed that breakfast was included and I had to ask if they wanted me to go to my room to get my papers down! I was told not to worry and they would look into it further. By this time I had gone off the idea of eating and just had my coffee, I had indigestion! The reception came back to me after 5 minutes and said she had made an error and that my breakfast was included. (so I did not have to feel like a thief after all!). My daughter had sat there for so long that she fancied something hot and when I asked another waitress if she could get a plate for her she asked me if I had paid for the breakfast!!! Not good customer service. Feeling like you have to prove yourself is not something I want to do.

We were there during the national strikes (trains and other public transportation). The concierge alerted us to this situation and, when we realized we would have to significantly modify our travel plans, he went above and beyond to help us. We'd planned to say 36 hours and ended up staying for 4 days. First, he directed us to great tourist attractions and restaurants. When our plans abruptly changed, he found us a hotel in another country (which wasn't easy given that there was a major convention in town), booked our train (when it was almost impossible to get seats), delivered the tickets to our room, and made sure we spent the absolute minimum amount of time stressing about our travel plans so we could spend the maximum time enjoying Paris.

There is a heavy use of dark coloured woods which make the hotel look quite sleek and sexy. Rooms are a good size, plenty of space to move around (and lay out your shopping, if you've done some damage!). The design in the toilet, in particular, the shower, is suspect, and quite often you might find yourself wetting the whole toilet floor while showering (there's no door to the shower, and and inadequate divider causes water to splash out).

I informed the front desk and received a polite, if tepid, apology- certainly not the level of reaction I'd expect at a 5-star hotel that made the same service mistake two days in a row. I was as upset by the blase reaction as I was by the service screw-up and asked for a manager, who did respond in a 5-star manner by apologizing sincerely, empathizing with my annoyance, and scheduling a free breakfast delivery for me in the morning. The gym is nice and has free drinks.

Once my husband and I entered the building there were three independent desks each with hotel representatives. The woman at the first desk did not acknowledge us at all when we walked in, but continued what she was doing. The woman at the second desk greeted us warmly and began the check-in process (it was at that time when a young man approached us and asked if we needed help with our luggage). After what seemed to be a somewhat involved check-in process, we were given the key cards to our room. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember the hotel representative telling us this, but the key is also used in the elevator prior to your floor selection (some people did not appear to know this and, throughout our stay, we frequently saw people struggling with the elevator). Although the desks in the reception area do not have signs, it appears that the first desk that guests encounter is that of the concierge staff. The concierge staff is very helpful, but it seems counterintuitive to have them as the first desk that guests encounter since the concierge staff does not assist with check-in or acknowledge guests if they are preoccupied with other tasks. However, when we did use the concierge staff they were efficient and helpful. From the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website, we knew the hotel was new with an ultra modern decor. Overall, the suite we were assigned was well appointed, although equivalent in size to a large US room, rather than a suite. We requested a suite with a balcony \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what we did not know was that (a) the balcony overlooked the interior courtyard of the hotel (i.e. no view), and (b) there was only one chair placed on the very narrow, tiny, triangular balcony. Lucky for us we spent very little time in the room. It appears that because we booked a suite and/or because of my husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Marriott status, a bottle of champagne was brought to our room after we arrived...this was a nice touch. On the last day, my husband found an electrical adaptor hidden on a shelf that the hotel appeared to provide for guests to use throughout their stay (another nice touch); however, that was never told to us (but since we travel with our own international adaptors this did not matter much to us, but could matter to others who may be in need of an adaptor). The bathroom was also very modern. We only had a small shower, but the large rain head was quite wonderful (and there was also a handheld shower head). In general the staff did a good job, but one evening before we left for dinner my husband called to have our room serviced. When we returned the room had not been serviced and we did not have clean towels for our morning shower. We had to call at 1 am and wait for someone to bring us towels. As for the doormen, they try to be very attentive, but it is quite likely that at any given moment you may not see any of them at the front of the hotel for a variety of reasons. One of the major reasons is that in Paris, they have taxi stands. If you ask a doorman for a taxi, he has to run to the taxi stand, wait for a taxi and ride back to the hotel. In addition, when a taxi is hailed for you either by your doorman or called for you (by the hotel or a restaurant), you are required to pay the fare from where the taxi originated as well as the fare to your destination. So it is a benefit that the hotel is conveniently located near two metro stops, one of which is a major connector to several lines. And there are two taxi stands near the hotel where guests can go and hail their own taxi. The staff tries to be very helpful and speaks fluent English which is great for those of us who speak little or no French. The hotel is conveniently located near transportation and has clean, well-appointed, nice-sized rooms.

Having read the reviews on TripAdvisor and other reviews, I felt sure that my expectations would be met and exceeded - sadly this was not the case and I was really disappointed at my overall experience which was barely satisfactory. When I booked the three night stay via the marriott website, I took advantage of a promotion which equated to the third night being free if paying with Visa. The standard room rate was 299euros per night and with the promotion, it equated to 200 euros a night which I felt for the location alone was well worth it. Having booked the hotel, I did not receive an email confirmation so had to email Marriott customer services to check that there had been no problems with the booking. This request was dealt with really efficiently, the booking confirmed and I was advised that the Hotel would email me also to confirm the reservation. This confirmation never came which was disappointing. I was emailed by the Hotel however a week before my arrival to ascertain what time I would be arriving and also asked did I have any other requests. I emailed the Hotel back and stated that I would be arriving mid-morning and an early check-in would be appreciated. I also asked whether I could be allocated a high floor room overlooking the Avenue de Wagram which I noticed was not an option when booking due to taking advantage of the promotion. I was emailed back very efficiently stating that my requests had been noted. I was really impressed with this and appreciated the gesture. I arrived at the Hotel about 11am and after eventually getting a porter to park my car (\"complimentary\") in the 35euros a day hotel car park, I proceeded into the reception area. I was dealt with more or less straight away by a very friendly, polite and courteous receptionist. She advised me that the request for a high floor and \"upgrade\" had been noted but sadly that the room was not yet ready and to come back between 1 and 2pm. Whilst this was a little disappointing, I fully appreciated that if a guest only checks out at 12 noon then requests for early check-ins cannot be guaranteed. As a result we went on an open top bus tour of Paris and arrived back at the Hotel at 2.30pm. When I approached the receptionist she looked shocked and said \"Oh, you are back...\" and then told me the room was still not ready. I was really unhappy with this and the receptionist invited us to the bar for a complimentary drink. This in itself was a nice gesture I suppose but waiting 20 minutes to be served two small beers that we had ordered via her was really annoying. The bar had one other customer in it at the time and the bar tender spent 15 minutes preening himself in the mirror and then took a further 5 minutes to pull 2 small draught beers - an absolute joke. We had one sip and were then advised that the room was now ready so we had in effect been allocated a room 5 minutes before the regular check-in time - great! I was really pleased however that we had been allocated a room on the 6th floor overlooking the avenue de wagram at no extra charge so this made up for the poor start. Whilst the room was modern and nicely furnished, I thought it was on the small side. It was well equipped however with mini bar; snack basket; tea/coffee machine;safe; flatscreen tv; pay per view movies; iron/ironing board. The bathroom also was modern with a hairdryer; toiletries and the standard dressing gown and slippers. I was disappointed that there was no bath. The room was clean although very dusty and the carpet looked quite worn/stained. A few moments after arrival in the room, a complimentary bottle of water and some chocolates were delivered along with a welcome letter - another nice touch! However, the following things relating to the room were very annoying and just not acceptable with a complete lack of attention to detail: 1) Shower controls did not work. The pressure was so poor that if you tried to transfer the water flow from the shower head to the overhead shower, you had to hold the button in the whole time with one hand and wash with the other hand 2) The shower screen which separates the shower from the sink is far too small so the bathroom gets totally flooded when you shower. This is not made any easier when you are trying to hold the button in and wash yourself at the same time! 3) On arrival there was a selection of coffee/tea/milk on offer. However, every time the room was made up they were never replaced so a call had to be made to Housekeeping every day to get them replaced. Even the mugs and cups were never replaced - simply taken away. The first day we asked it took an hour and even then we had to request it twice. On the second day we went down to reception to mention that we again had no tea/coffee/milk/mugs and the guy at reception looked at us like we had grown two heads! An hour later they were delivered to the room. 4) The mini-bar/snack tray was never re-filled throughout the whole stay - just not good enough! 5) The drinking glasses in the room were both badly chipped - luckily I noticed this before I cut my lips open! We did get them replaced but the chipped ones were back the following day 6)The air conditioning was very loud and totally ineffective so I can only presume that the Hotel can over-ride the in-room setting to save money. 7) There was no \"Do not Disturb\" sign within the room and despite asking for one this never was provided. As a result, we were constantly interupted day and night!! We ate at the Makassar restaurant once and I must say that this was a real redeeming feature of the Hotel. We did book a table (following 3 attempts to get through to reception) and I was surprised that the restaurant was more or less devoid of customers so it did lack atmosphere. We did wait at the restaurant entrance for 5 minutes before anyone noticed us which again is not good enough! The meal however was excellent and the young lady who served us was superb. She was very attentive, courteous and polite and really made the whole dining experience one to remember! I believe her name was Fanny and she deserves sincere praise for her professionalism and dedication to providing the very highest levels of service. The only downside to the meal was that the cocktail we ordered - a mojito, was not available due to the bar having no mint!! The bar seems to promote its cocktail menu yet doesnt have the basic ingredients to provide them. I heard a number of people order a mojito whilst I was having drinks in the bar and they all appeared equally disappointed that they were unavailable due to lack of a basic ingredient! My only other criticism of the Hotel relates to the lift! The lift appeared to have a mind of its own. The lift could only be opearted by first inserting the room key card which I appreciate is a good security measure but whatever button you pressed you could be going up and down in the lift for ages before the floor you selected was ever reached! The same applied when waiting for a lift - not only did it take ages but when you did get in after selecting the lift down option you ended up going up!? Exsaperating and so annoying! On our final day, we did have room service - namely a continental breakfast and an american breakfast and whilst pricey, was excellent and delivered as ordered. Sadly there was no milk with the coffee (sound familiar..?) We wished we had taken a room service breakfast every day as it was lovely - freshly prepared croissants and danish pastries along with a piping hot well cooked breakfast. Again, I cannot fault the catering at this Hotel, it is first class!! The check out process was really really efficient and the receptionist was lovely - a fine ambassador for the Hotel. The car was brought round by the very helpful and dedicated concierge and the bags were packed in the car by the highly efficient porters. I think on balance I would recommend this Hotel but give realistic expectations. I am sure that you could find a lot better for your money although Paris does appear to suffer from really poor customer service and a complete lack of attention to detail. This Hotel asks you to contact DTS whenever you need anything which equates apparently to Delighted to Serve - from my experience it really means Dedicated to Suffering!!", "Date": "April 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOverall a great pace to stay.

Therefore, whenever feasible and possible, given the purpose of my travel, I take accommodations at a Marriott or Renaissance. Why? Because 99% of the time: the staff members of that Brand treat me respectfully; my accommodations have been exceptional...spacious rooms, ultra comfortable beds; the room rates do not break the bank; food and service are exceptional; and the facility locations have met my needs. I have been to Paris several times and will be there again in late May and in June 2010 for business (and hopefully a little leisure). I have already made reservations at the Renaissance Hotel Arc De Triomphe and at the Marriott Rive Gauche Hotel and Conference Center. Even though I have never stayed at those facilities during previous visits to Paris, I am confident that I will be given great rooms, have options for wonderful food choices at reasonable prices, and will have an enjoyable and successful trip.

We were so frustrated at the staff's lack of truly putting in any effort in trying to resolve this issue (anyone can spray air freshener, but it doesn't alleviate the problem!) After dinner when we returned to find the room just as smoky as it had been, we once again went down to speak to a manager (who apparently had left). I reminded the girl how much we were being charged for the rooms and it was completely unacceptable to have part of our party stay in a room where you could barely breathe because of the smell.

We ate at many restaurants on Wagram Ave., and there was a wide range of choices and prices. We did not have one bad meal, and most were excellent. As has been mentioned, it is a very short walk to the Arc de Triomphe, Champs Elysee, and a major Metro station (CDG Etoile) with several lines and even the RER train to Paris Disney, which allowed to go back and forth easily in one day. The other direction from the hotel has an even closer Metro station (Ternes), but we only used it once to go to Montmartre/Sacre Coeur. Even though the hotel is on the western side of Paris, the location was a major advantage in that wherever we were, we could almost always find a very close Metro station that would get us back to the hotel without having to change lines. That was a big relief for the kids at the end of a long day of walking. We had a fabulous trip and the hotel was a major part of our enjoyment. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it.", "Date": "August 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "dallas,tx", "Title": "\u201cFabulous, spacious room in a great location!\u201d", "Author": "christyv20", "ReviewID": "UR37094394", "Content": "Our room was perfect.

The hotel is brand new and although the main entrance and lobby are nothing special, the rooms are nice and clean - very well thought out. The lighting was very well planned and we had a view of the top of the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe.

We were checked in by a lovely female receptionist called Sophie. She was extremely polite, extremely proffesional and welcomed us with a great big smile close to midnight. The hotel is located 2 min walk from Arc De Triomphe and Charles De Gaulle Etoile station. It takes 10 mins on the train to get to Eiffel Tower so location wise this hotel was so so convenient. Concierge staff were also really helpful and helped us always with maps and recommending good restaurants. They even planned a whole day for us. Rooms are very decent sized for a European hotel and bathroom was quite nice too. The only thing that lacked was as swimming pool otherwise this hotel gets 5/5 from me.

The service was perfect. Chloe (baggage porter) was so friendly and even ran down the block to grab us a cab so we wouldn't have to wait. Our doorman, a young Czech man, was so helpful and happy, running to the door to open it for us. The room was huge and the rollaway (for our teenager) was set up upon arrival. Free wi-fi and an hour late check out with no charge. The restaurant looked nice but my husband insisted upon eating at cafes. Sorry no reccomendations from what we found. But my teenager loved the Pizza Hut down the street (buy one get one free) and the McDonalds a few doors down. The Hop on Hop off bus service was great. Print your tickets online, walk around the Arc on Tislit circle and grab the bus at the Lido stop. We bought 3 day tickets with a boat trip and ran all around the city. After touring, we switched bus routes and hopped different busses to get to our destinations without going through the whole tour.
