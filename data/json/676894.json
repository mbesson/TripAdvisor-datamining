{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Terrible experience The rooms are damp with mould growing on the walls and the toilets smell. The swimming pool was so dirty unable to see the bottom, the spa pool was filthy. The meals were very bad and not available most of the time, the breakfast buffet was always cold and no a la carte. Room service very poor. The laundry even worse. The noise from the indoor tennis court (roof broken, poor condition) was terrible because loud music being played form 5 am by the staff. Shuttle only ran twice a day and not in the evenings. It's not possible to walk to any local restaurants etc as it's too far.", "Date": "Jan 7, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR336544231", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "aloysiusLondon"}, {"Content": "Can be better Stayed here for six nights as I was in Bali for work. Checking in was a bit chaotic and slow. Rooms are large as they are like apartments. Furnishings are dated but basically the place is clean. Free wifi available at the restaurant area. Quite isolated location but there is free transport to certain parts of Bali twice a day. My main beef with this hotel was in the reservation of the room. Initial reservations were made but no confirmation of booking by email/fax. I had to call and confirm it myself. Later we needed additional nights and had faxed to book, requesting confirmation by return fax. Again, no reply. I called multiple times (at least 10) to check but could not get hold of reservations. I emailed but again no reply. I wrote a letter of complaint to the GM but no reply. Eventually, I got an email reply to say that the rooms were confirmed.", "Date": "Dec 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR195630663", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "gabchong"}, {"Content": "terrible I stayed there when I went to Bali for a school trip. it seems like there was a change of management at the time when we stayed there. many equipments were left untidy everywhere. the room service was also very poor. when I called the room service and asked for an electrical plug-in, the receptionist said that they couldn't deliver it to our room, so my friend had to go to the front desk to take it.the sofabed in front of the TV broke down while we were watching TV. the fridge was empty, no minibars. bathroom was average. no bathtub but there's shower. and poorly, you can only have cold shower there.for breakfast, they only served fried rice, noodles, some fruits, and no milk, cereals or bread. the dining hall where we supposed to have breakfast was quite distant from the room and you will get some difficulties getting there while raining.it looks WAY DIFFERENT than it was advertised at the website. and during our stay, I noticed that our group were the only guests staying there. at night, beside the rooms, the hotel was lacking of light.", "Date": "Jun 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR677451859", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "tunachilli"}, {"Content": "Always love staying in this hotel!

Nothing specific to rave about as its location is in a residential neighborhood, not close to a beach or any major shopping areas. The price for an apt setup with kitchenette, DR area, LR and bedroom and bathroom and balcony (one bedroom apt) was great though. It gave us the space we needed for 2 adults and one 8 yr old. Disappointing was that the advertised Kids Club and playground was nonexistant as the hotel is still undergoing renovations with a switch of ownership.Clientale seems to consist mainly of domestic tour bus groups with the occasional western tourist.
