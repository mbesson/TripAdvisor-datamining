The rooms are nothing fancy but, clean, quiet and with fairly comfy beds. Its pure relief after a long-haul flight, to get a descent bath and some sleep. Noticed their niche is with transit passengers; so it would probably help if you requested for a room on the 4th Floor.

The hotel provided me with transportation to and from the airport (5 minutes away), it was very old and not renovated, but the room I was given was very clean. The linens were clean and even the bathroom had few and limited toiletries. The towels were worn out but clean. In addition, they offered me the room with 3 meals and a snack (although I was only there for four/five hours). I would stay here only under the same circumstances next time. The hotels is mainly used for transiting passengers and is far from main attractions in the city. One suggestion is to have a gift shop where stranded passengers like me can buy a change of clothes or a toothbrush as their luggage is half way on its way to London.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "poland", "Title": "\u201cbland dormitory\u201d", "Author": "keijo", "ReviewID": "UR122501145", "Content": "stayed in emirates assigned accommodation for 10hrs. agree with earlier reviewers, ask for a room near the lift. the furthest rooms are quite far away really. but if you're just looking to crash it's not so much of a problem. tried the room service, it was prompt and helpful. no free internet. plenty of channels on TV, good shower. not enough staff at checkin desk, takes ages, hence a tip for dubai stopover passengers; try to get ahead of the queues all the way throughout the process from immigration to your room. if you're at the back you may spend good half an hour waiting for your room. choose your seat on the shuttle bus strategically so you can be the first one to rush out.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cVery good overnight with Emirates\u201d", "Author": "JalanHidup", "ReviewID": "UR121978556", "Content": "Part of the overnight package with Emirate.

If you need overnight rest before continuing long journey than this is worth the free service from Emirates compare to staying at the airport or suffering extended long journey in the economy class.

But it is not entirely \"free\" since the ticket price was higher than say One World with Roayal Joradian and Quantas from BKK. And frankly speaking, I would have avoided Dubai altogether but Royal Joradanian do not fly every day to Larnaca. Dubai airport has now outgrown its original concept and it is overcrowded, difficult to walk with huge distances to go to get to passport control and then out to the free bus. It is made worse by the long queus for the passport check by the lazty local government officers who prefer to chat to each other than stamp your passport. So it easily takes 1+ hours to get out to the Emirates bus then another 1/2 hour when the bus arrives because there are not enough staff to checkin a full bus load. Then a long long LONG walk to the room only to fiind the card does not switch on the power because it is too transparent to be active. So another 10-15 mins to get someone to come with a different card that works to get lighting. Then the shock of the long narrow small and very smell room, with a toilet seat that did not fit properly, and no BBC or CNN on the TV. So for a 4 hour rest plus a shower it is debatable that this is worth it. The shower was also ackward as it was a handheld affair hanging very high on the wall but with no adjustment, so water sprayed everywhere. However, breakfast was OK, limited range but plently of it with very friendly and courteous staff.. .", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cSkip if you can\u201d", "Author": "Nicole_711", "ReviewID": "UR118445284", "Content": "Reason for staying at airport hotel is to break the journey and it is even sweeter when Emirates airline paid for it.
