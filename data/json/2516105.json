The location was great for us. Check-in was a breeze, and our room was spacious enough for the two of us. Unfortunately it faced Sunset Boulevard, which carries a substantial amount of traffic. After a few nights we moved to a room across the hall, which was much quieter. We had a nice stay here and I would have given them a higher review except for one thing - we had no internet service in our room. At first we were told it was because we have Macs. Come on people - Apple products will find wifi before you can even blink! We were in room 322 initially and then changed to 321 in the hopes of getting wifi. We got a quieter room but no internet service. I am surprised that no other reviewers have complained about this. In the second room my daughter was finally able to connect her MacBook to the internet via an ethernet cable. (Same cable did not work in the first room.) I had to sit in the lobby with my iPad when I wanted to get on the internet. For a one or two night stay, it would have been no big deal. But for eight nights it became more than an inconvenience. I will also point out that the wifi is unsecured - no password is needed to login so be careful when you use the internet there. I also wish that they had a workout room at this location. The other Comfort Inns we stayed in on this trip had them, and I certainly could have used it for this many days. Other than that we enjoyed our stay here. The breakfast area was nicely maintained and there was a nice variety of items available, which we appreciated with our long stay. As others have mentioned, there are only a few tables so we did end up taking the food back to our room a few times. I would definitely consider staying here again when I come back to visit my daughter.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in Silverlake!\u201d", "Author": "Eddie B", "ReviewID": "UR126469917", "Content": "This hotel is perfectly located in Silverlake (walk down to the Olive Motel to compare if you so desire!)

The parking garage is very convenient, the bed is nice and firm, the shower is reasonably good, and the wi-fi is free. The attendant at the front desk even went out of his way to help me print a document with their printer. My only complaint with this hotel is their ridiculous policy of resetting the electronic room locks every day, supposedly for security purposes. Three times I was locked out of my room because I was unaware of this policy, and each time I went to the front desk to have my room key reprogrammed. On each occasion, I provided my room number but was not asked for my name or ID, and yet my key was reset to open the room I specified. I could have gotten access to ANY room in this manner. How exactly is this supposed to improve security?!? When I checked out, I asked about this policy, and I was told that guests were losing their room keys with the envelope that indicates their room number. So in an attempt to solve that problem, the policy actually reduces the security for all guests.

But the giant \"Foot clinic\" sign (God, I wish I had taken a picture!!), sort of added to the charm, I suppose. There's excellent food and coffee options within walking distance. I highly recommend \"Local\" - about 2 blocks north on Sunset. And the vegan Thai restaurant that is right next door was supposed to be really good. I didn't get the chance to try it. The room itself (I stayed in a non-smoking King) was very spacious. The bed was pretty comfortable but the bedding and pillows left alot to be desired. Some of the furniture was worn and older as well. Overall, though, it was a well equipped room - large flat screen tv. dresser, desk, table with two chairs, microwave, coffee maker, closet with iron and board, and two large windows. I asked for a quiet room, so I wasn't bothered by any traffic noise from Sunset Blvd. The bathroom was modern and nice, but the sink was just outside the bathroom - sort of strange.

Vending machines in the carpark - spacious room - microwave and bar fridge. Ours had a view of the silverlake hills. - Windows that open - this is always a plus for me, nothing like some fresh air, also helps to gauge what kind of day it is outside, those LA mornings can be deceiving! - Generally clean and presentable - every morning there was a guy sweeping and hosing the front area and carpark. Its an older building with new renovations inside, most notable the bathroom - staff were friendly and helpful - especially one guy that seemed to always be at reception (didn't get his name!) he was training a new guy when we checked in and was patiently ensuring the new guy was providing a quality service. I read a few reviews on here about it being a dodgy neighbourhood but I didn't see it. Unless it's the big foot clinic sign that's putting ppl off? lol Its also close to a Laundromat and a few eating places and convenience stores The only gripe I had was less to do with the hotel and more with the other guests. The rooms aren't completely sound proof, so you may hear the odd loud tv, slamming of doors or running up and down the hall but im not going to be one of those ppl that mark the hotel down on the inconsiderate actions of others, and lets face it, youre going to get those ppl no matter where you stay.

Overall we were extremely happy with this hotel, we had been in Vegas a few days previous and for what we paid in a supposed \"upscale\" hotel there were NONE of the little extra's that the comfort inn offered for eg: free Wi-Fi, free local calls and a fabolous continental breakfast.

We picked this motel location by zip code, because it was closest to her apartment. We had just finished a 4 month long motorcycle trip across the USA, and had spent at least 100 of the past 120 days in motels across the country. This was the first Comfort Inn of this trip, however, even though we had visited Comfort Inns in years past.. First, I have to say that you cannot judge this hotel based upon it's location in W. LA - this area is what it is, and you shouldn't expect anything more than a barrio atmosphere. Be aware of your surroundings and you won't be in danger. We ate at a great Mexican restaurant nearby, named Casita del Campos about one mile from the motel, on Hyperion. Be aware that there is a charge for self parking your car in their lot. The motel itself looks as though it has been renovated. The furnishings are newer, our king sized bed was very comfortable and had 5 pillows. The bedding is clean as were the towels, and bath fixtures. The long review from the lady from NYC from September 2007, explains everything very well, as to room amenities, staff, breakfast, etc. The only complaint is that the carpeting in our room (#211) was filthy. I am also from NYC, and I don't scheeve easily, but our socks were ruined by the dirt, and we won't dare walk barefoot! I took one of the hand towels and rubbed it on the carpet near the bed, and was appalled by the filth it picked up. The carpet and room have a smell (probably caused by the dirty carpet) that permeates the entire area. The odor actually awakened my husband and I during the night. We sprayed the room with Febreze, but it did little to mask the stench. Unfortunately, we are at the beginning of our 2nd night here, (out of 3), and I don't know if I'll be able to tolerate the smell that long. I considered asking the desk clerk if we could change rooms, but I doubt that our room is the only one with dirty, smelly carpet. If you are considering staying at this Comfort Inn location, I would suggest you call the hotel directly, and ask them to put you into a room where the carpet has been recently cleaned.

I stayed here while attending a meeting at the Los Angeles Convention Center, but also wanted to be able to visit a relative in Silver Lake. The Comfort Inn, as others have noted, is really a mile or so south of Silver Lake proper, but you can be in the heart of that wonderful neighborhood in minutes. More to the point, you can be downtown in 15 minutes if (and this is important) you avoid the temptation to take freeways, which at certain hours will delay you hopelessly. Instead, take Sunset Blvd. to Alvarado St. and it's a straight shot to downtown. My room facing Sunset was slightly noisy due to car traffic on a Saturday night (ask for one facing the other way if this is a concern) but not enough to make a difference to me.

This is my last night in this hotel and I couldn't be happier with the choice. I don't usually travel alone, and though a New York City native, I did have some trepidation about staying alone in a hotel in L.A. I agree with all of the reviewers who mentioned the excellent security at this hotel. There are cameras everywhere and yes, the front desk is behind a glass partition. Rather than making me nervous by their mere existence, they really have made me feel safer. As for the rooms, I cannot understand how other reviewers have described this place as a basic, no-frills hotel. My room is extremely spacious, as are most of the others I've seen in passing. All the rooms I've seen have been renovated: the vanity is granite, with a new faucet. The bathtub surround is flat-panel stone, with NONE of the grout and tiles that can be covered with mold. In fact, the bedroom and bath are spotless. There's a small, quiet refrigerator and a microwave that sits on granite shelves, and both are also completely clean. The king-sized bed is covered in a luxurious-looking burnt-orange shiny quilted new-looking bedspread. The bed itself could be a little softer, but it's not rock-hard either; this non-sleeper has slept well. Even the entry doorsill and hinges have been replaced. There is a desk, armoire, table, and three chairs, and there is still a huge amount of room to walk around. The carpet is not old, but during my stay all of the rooms were having the carpets restretched and cleaned. The shower is good, with a new, adjustable showerhead. The lighting is good in the bedroom and bathroom, and there are two telephones. My only complaint is that the table and one of the chairs could use replacement. The lobby is small, but furnished with newer furniture in excellent condition, and the small breakfast room is bright and modern, too. A number of people wrote about the somewhat seedy neighborhood. Having driven back all the way on Sunset from West Hollywood to the hotel, the neighborhood does change - stores and restaurants are closed and largely ethnic, mostly Hispanic. It certainly does not have the glitz and polish and lighting of the areas I was coming from. But not once did I feel unsafe. I did not use the underground parking, because the lobby is at one end of a small strip mall with outdoor parking, and I was able to park one foot away from the hotel lobby. After booking this hotel by calling Choice's 800 number, I later did a comparison on Choice Hotel's own website among this hotel and four other Comfort Inns in the area. I was dismayed to see that this was the only one that did not have high speed internet service listed for the rooms. I was about to cancel my reservation, but then decided to call Choice to verify it. They made a direct call to the hotel and told me that they did indeed have high speed in all the rooms. I am using it right now, and it has worked perfectly. I did not have a chance to check out the actual breakfast - I either slept in or had to leave very early before they began serving. But on my first morning I asked the desk after breakfast was over if I might be able to get some bread for toast. No problem. The guy at the desk called and got the woman in charge of breakfast to come down and get me some food. She gave me a plate of bread and pastries and, of course, there is always coffee available. In closing, I must say that I am a snob about hotels. I absolutely cannot stay in an old room; I find it too depressing. And I'm squeamish and easily skeeved, and will not tolerate anything that is not immaculate. Also, I always stay in smoking rooms. This hotel room was not only one step away from being sterilized, it is also the only smoking room I've been in anywhere that doesn't have that nauseating, suffocating smell of stale smoke. And that goes for the hallways, too, despite what one woman wrote about it. I can sniff out smoke anywhere, at any time, but not at this place. They're certainly doing something right. This Comfort Inn has got to be the best deal in L.A. For $81 a night, you cannot get better. And I'd wager that your room in a high-rise hotel would not be any nicer. As long as you have a car and a map, it would be very short-sighted to stay somewhere else. If I return to L.A., this will be my first, and only, choice.", "Date": "September 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Germany", "Title": "\u201cVery nice!

It is a good value. Smoking: if you smoke this is not a problem, but even in the non smoking rooms you might have a stale smoking odor. I didn't encounter any actual smoke during my visit, in the rooms, halls or lobby. The odor is probably caused by past smoking in the halls that leaks into the room. Location: The location is convenient (if you have a car) midway between downtown Los Angeles and Hollywood. There is a bus on Sunset Blvd., but I recommend that you have a car. One last point: Don't confuse this Comfort Inn with the one near McArthur Park. This motel is in the Echo Park neighborhood.

I think if you find this neighbourhood fearsome you are a bit precious -- I parked outside and the car was fine, and at no point in my travels did I feel unsafe. I'm pretty sure most experienced travellers would feel fine. Everything was very clean. I was given a corner king room which felt tucked away and private. The TV had a lot of channels. The free wireless internet was appreciated -- that always seals the deal for me. (My room was too far from the access point to get a signal, but I was given an ethernet cable by the front desk, which is fine.) In the morning there was juice, all kinds of baked goods (frozen & thawed, but that's alright), waffle batter, fruit, etc. It was much more than what I expect from a continental breakfast. My only issue with the hotel was the rate -- I had a coupon from a local guidebook, but the rate was actually $10 more. The clerk said that they had raised the rate after the book was printed. In my view, the advertised rate should be honoured, as that was what brought me to the hotel. But really, it's a clean, relatively cheap place near some good neighbourhoods and the freeway.
