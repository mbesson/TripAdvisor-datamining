Everything was great except for the fact that the studios are tiny, one on top of the other down a long corridor, and some have interconnecting doors so that you can hear every word from next door. I was awoken early the first morning by the alarm of the person next door and had to listen to all his morning routine. It was more like sharing a room. They're a little overpriced for what you're getting - the courtyard studios do have little private courtyards, but they're really tiny and mostly with taller buildings overlooking them so not even private. I would presume the ocean view studios were nicer but I didn't see these as they were full.I'd say the best things going for this place are its location and the roof terrace, and that if you book, make sure to get an ocean view studio or apartment and not any of the others.", "Date": "Dec 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR824067988", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "GBtravelIt"}, {"Content": "Fantastic location This property says it's right on the beach at Coogee, and it is. There is a footpath and grassy park between your balcony and the sand. Ask for a balcony room with the beach view - sit out with a drink and watch the passing parade and the pacific. Our room was very nice, and had a handy little kitchenette with sink and microwave, crockery etc. Very clean and tasteful, your average sort of hotel room. My husband found the bed too soft, and there was quite a bit of noise from the pub next door, even late on a Sunday night. Quieter though on the Monday night. Parking is undercover and secure, and easy to find right at the end of Dolphin Street. Bus into the city takes about half an hour, and the stop is a 2 minute walk. No shopping to speak of in Coogee itself, but lots of great eating choices, and a good fish and chip shop right in the middle of the park on the beach. You can walk to Bondi Beach along the beaches and cliffs in about 2 hours, on a very good path. Coogee has 3 separate sea-pools/baths, and one is for ladies only.  I loved this property, and would like to stay for a week with my teenagers, as Coogee has a real beachy-casual thongs and bathers feel, while the city is only a bus away.", "Date": "Dec 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR510470655", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "reggiekelpie"}, {"Content": "Family Feel Property!

One is for the Apartments which are at the back of the property - away from the Hotel. No views from what I could see, just an apartment block built in an old carpark by the looks of thingsWe booked to stay in the Hotel, what a nightmare. The room was so old and rundown you could almost see the germs. The shower had missing tiles and the toilet was older than me. The double bed sank so low in the middle I had to use the single bed. The worst part was the fact the rooms are just above the actual Hotel where bands play until about 3.00 in the morning. There is no insulation at all so the sound is beyond imagination, TOTALLY impossible to sleep. Believe me, these bands are crap too so it is not like you are sitting awake in your room enjoying the music.When the bands finally finished the patrons came out onto the street, just under our window. They fought, argued, vomited etc etc and generally hung around until about 5.00 am.I am shocked this place has a license to accommodate people in the Hotel as it is impossible to sleep. Other guests were wandering the halls trying to calm down while the patronswere screaming and chanting to the music just below. I had gone to Sydney to attend a course and had to miss the Sunday as I had gone the whole night without sleep and had to drive back to Melbourne the next day. This Hotel ruined my weekend. I complained to them but they don't care as there is another 'mug' booking in to take my place every night.I STRONGLY recommend you avoid this place, it's a total ripoff and they don't care.", "Date": "Mar 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR760644942", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "blueblaze"}, {"Content": "I'd pass on the Coogee....

The position of Coogee Sands is awesome. There are plenty of shops and restaurants close by. Our room was well equiped and clean and the staff at the front desk were extremely helpful. We had to extend our stay by a night and they obliged and even gave us the same discount rate that we had been paying.

No other facilities like pool or bar but you don't need them - you're in Sydney! Unless you're really going to spend a lot of time in your room, I wouldn't bother paying for a sea view. The Palis nightclub is next door - be aware that if your in a room backing onto that, you may here some tunes during backpacker season.

Parking is free, which is unheard of in Sydney. The front desk are truly helpful and nice. We stayed in the Oceanview with the balcony. The room was a decent size and the views of the beach were quite nice. The balcony proved to be a nice place to have a few drinks before heading out for dinner. The furniture and carpets are a bit old, but are liveable. One thing I didnt understand was the elevator system. You would get off the elevator and then there would be a few stairs you would have to climb to get to your rooms door. Not too hard to do but if you have a lot of luggage it can get annoying.

The hotel is average if you are in one of the standard rooms, however, if you stay here, make sure you are in an ocean view studio. It is these rooms that take this hotel from average to fantastic. Awaking to the sound of the surf, pulling open the blinds to be greeted by what has to be one of the best views in Sydney. Sure for those from abroad - it will not be the same as a bridge / Opera House view, or the hustle of Bondi - but for a domestic traveller who is more than a little over aussie kitch, this is a great location.
