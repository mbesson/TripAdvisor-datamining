They followed this up with another hour of \"intermate time\", then finally at 3am they continued talking and laughing. None of this is a problem to me as they can do whatever they want in thier room, the fact that it kept us awake and we heard everysingle detail was not good. Ensure you to not get Room 109. Things turned very bad in the morning when we went to check out; 1, breakfast doesn't start till 9:30am! 2, the receptionist started dry-reaching during the check out process and then before they got to swipe my card, ran out from behind the desk and ran into the little ajoining cafe where they vomitted all over the floor and continued to vomit in the kitchen there. Once he returned to swap my card my partner joined me in the lobby and we left the hotel as he came back around to the cafe to clean up his mess.

The entire stay was positive and our favourite stay on our 3 week trip. Location: This hotel is conveniently located and close to good nightlife, the metro (for easy transportation), minutes from Gran Via, and it's so lively at night. Some would say it's loud but I never found it obnoxious because if I'm in Madrid, I'm there to have a good time. Besides, once you closed those shutters, there was no sound/no light and it was phenomenal. Suite: The interior decorations are gorgeous and so cute. The kitchen is perfect to use and comes with all the utensils already needed. The bathroom was very nice. The beds were so comfortable. For the time we spent in our apartment, it was perfect for what we needed. Staff: The staff was incredible. Beatriz, Antonio, all of them were so helpful with our questions and helping us with anything we needed. If we called for something, we would have it in a moment's notice. If we needed directions, never failed to help. The amazing staff made this hotel even better than it was. Even offered us great advice about wifi. :) I think the only downfall would be when we were on the balcony something was leaking from above (a/c?) but besides that, I loved this hotel.

The next day we spoke to reception and they said in fact that they wouldn't be able to give us a twin room as the hotel was fully booked! So the reception staff who had told us they would move us to a twin room for the second night was simply lying! The staff were very unhelpful and offered us no solution or compensation for not providing us with what we asked for. This was a shame as it meant that we had a bad first impression of madrid and had to spend time aruging with the hotel rather than getting out and seeing the city. The rooms are ok, but not as good as they look in the photos, and the ensuite bathrooms are rather odd (toilet is in a tiny cupboard) and the shower was on a raise platform in the middle of the room! I think that it was an attempt to be cool, but really they missed the mark! The reception staff told us they had upgraded us to a room which was two grades above standard - if that was the case I dread to think what the standard rooms are like! Although the hotel is in a good location I would not recommend it to anyone else as the service was so poor and unhelpful (and at times they were simply lying to us!). We did not get what we booked and they seemed not to care at all.", "Date": "May 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hanoi, Vietnam", "Title": "\u201cNot a good introduction to Madrid\u201d", "Author": "Snaz", "ReviewID": "UR62965613", "Content": "Location - Yes, it's centrally located to the Grand Via, however this a a fair way from other attractions.
