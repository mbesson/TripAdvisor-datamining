The front desk staff were very friendly and we got a complimentary bottle of wine at check in. We loved enjoying the wine and appetizers and watching the sun set on the Blue Mosque from the terrace -- we made sure to go up on the roof every evening. The terrace views are magnificent! I am a very light sleeper and the call to prayer in the morning never woke me up. The room was very clean and the bathroom was a normal size as far as European bathrooms go. I thought the hotel was a little pricey (but it was probably because it was a holiday weekend). I would definitely recommend this hotel especially during the warmer months when the terrace is open. If I was in Istanbul over the winter I might choose a less expensive hotel since the best part of the hotel is the terrace and it's not open during the winter; however, maybe the prices go down a bit in the winter... The Blue House is a wonderful place to stay!

Arrived on 7 Sept around 11:30 AM, were in our room's by 2PM. King size beds, 2 doubles pushed together. Better than a double, with small but functional bathrooms. The room service was excellent and the A/C worked! The front desk was helpful acquiring extra pillows for my wife and I. The breakfast, European continental, was ready by 6:45 daily. The server setting up the breakfast, had my ice bucket and large glass ready each morning, for ice tea. The view from the roof restaurant was fantastic. While on tour on Friday with a guide we had lunch at the \"Pudding Shop\". Our guide explained the owner also owns the Blue House Hotel. He was working the cash register. I went back after a great lunch and commented how pleased we were with the hotel. He asked for my room number and upon our return that evening a bottle of Merlot was waiting for us in our room. How great is that! On the back street of the hotel is a street with 2 blocks of great restaurants, easily missed. On the way is a minimart with cigs, wine, whiskey, etc. There's a laundry out the main door to the right at the end of the block turn left and on the left.

This hotel is located in the most touristy area of Istanbul \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Sultanahmet which is the Old City. Some people try to avoid staying in this area but I think it was a great place to be. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re steps away from the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia, which are both really great sites to see. This hotel is only a 10 min walk to the tram which will take you to any area you want to go to. The rooms were very nice and comfortable. I think this hotel should be listed as a 3 star hotel though. I think ive seen it listed as 4 stars on some sites. The staff were very accommodating and helpful and made any and all arrangements we needed. Breakfast was included in our package which was quite tasty. All in all we got a very homely vibe from this hotel and I would stay there again. As far as the sights go --- You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re about a 20 min walk (or a 5 min tram ride) from the Grand Bazaar which you must go to! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a huge indoor bazaar where you can get all sorts of Turkish goods. Try to go before 3pm so you have a better chance of negotiating. Although we went to the Topkapi Palace I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that impressed with it. They show you old jewels and clothes that the Sultans wore but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for me. We never ended up going to the Basilica Cistern although we heard it was cool. The spice bazaar was OK. I think the grand bazaar was better because you can actually buy stuff from there. Unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re interested in buying spices, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think there is much of a point to go here. Unfortunately we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do the Bosphorus Cruise because we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough time but we heard it would have been a wonderful experience. You should definitely try to go to a Turkish Bath while you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re there. Its an experience, to say the least. You get taken to a hot stone where you lay in a room that is like a sauna and then someone will come and bathe you and scrub you down. Its definitely awkward, but only for a few mins. Its one of those things you must do if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in Turkey. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use a tour guide for Istanbul and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think you need to use one at all. Its an easy city to navigate throughout and when you walk and travel throughout the city on your own you get to experience more. However, when you go to the Hagia Sophia I highly recommend you take a guide up on their offer to explain the history of the mosque to you. It is one of the most beautiful sights of Istanbul and there is such a great history there. We went in without a guide and immediately realized how essential a guide would be for this site, so we hired someone that approached us. As far as meals go \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is known that restaurants in Sultanahmet don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer great food, so try to avoid that area if you can. We had a great meal at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153360 Istanbul\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which I highly recommend. We really enjoyed smoking hookah at the hookah bars that are all around Istanbul, especially Taksim Square. We also enjoyed hookah in the outdoor restaurant which was right outside of the Blue House hotel. Nightlife \u00e2\u20ac\u201c You MUST go to Reina. This club was unbelievable. Im from New York City and ive been to clubs in many cities throughout the country and the world but Reina was a crazy experience. It was vegas status. You wont regret it!! by the way, because this hotel is close to the Blue Mosque, you may be woken up by the early morning prayer call. It caught us by surprise! We stayed in Istanbul for 3 days and 3 nights. I would say that was enough. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the kind of city that you can stay at longer and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find stuff to do. But if you want to just quickly check out all of the main attractions and enjoy the city for a bit, then 3 days is enough After our Istanbul stay we headed to Cappadocia and stayed at 40da Cave Suite, so check out my review for that if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re interested!", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "Aussierosie21", "ReviewID": "UR112563688", "Content": "Rooms although small were pleasantly decorated and very clean.

May be it is better to live in the new city and take transport to Topkapi and the Mosque. Lots of eating houses in the area. The view of the Blue Mosque from the upstairs balcony was fantastic, especially as the sun is setting with a backdrop of a semi-darkened sky. Possibly worth sneaking into the hotel just for a photograph. The hotel lift does not have any doors and would really think twice about taking children there.

I would suggest going up there for a cold drink and not to eat anything since there is better food to be found on the other streets among Istanbul. The other thing that I found very distasteful was having the waiter stand over us because he wanted a bigger tip and actually said that. That left a bad taste in my mouth for the whole meal which was around 98 TL for 3 people. Staff : The staff was nice sometimes and grumpy other times. I wouldn't say they went out of their way. They do have free internet though only one computer and they don't offer any free shuttles anywhere in the city so you are on your own. Breakfast was a nice buffet with the price of the room with fresh fruit, cheese, bread, eggs, bad coffee( they have nescafe ) and other items which I though was a very nice selection.
