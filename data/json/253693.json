Upon arrival, the room was not ready, but the manager waived us down the hall to another room and told us that he would bring new key cards up in a few minutes. Before he got back, the other couple used their keys to let themselves into our room. They went back down to find out what was going on, we never saw them again. The room was clean, moderately sized and well equipped. The staff friendly and attempted to be helpful, but a broken printer at checkout and lack of communication with the cleaning staff made things more difficult than necessary. It was a $15+ (cash) each way taxi ride to everywhere we wanted to go to in the city. There was no good way to walk to any attractions or the beach. The taxi rides got to be more expensive and used more cash than we had anticipated.

My main objection was with the bathroom; it did not have an exhaust fan. Thus, mold / mildew was built up on the ceiling over the shower. The proprietor tried to paint over it, but you can't get rid of mold with paint. We tried opening the bathroom window to vent the shower steam, but the outside air was just as humid as the inside. Also, the bed sheets were scratchy, cigarette burns in the bedspread, and the pillows were hard as a sack of potatoes. With that said -- if you stay here just know that you are not staying at a plush hotel...it's just a place to spend the night. The hotel was mostly clean, conveniently located with several restaurants within walking distance, and it was quiet; no street noise. The manager was very helpful, friendly, and accommodating. We dropped our bags off at 9am, returned at 2pm and our bags were waiting for us in the room. I had difficulty rating this hotel -- if you just need a convenient place to sleep...you'll like it.

I too had a reservation for Feb 25, but due to airline delays, I was unable my connection to San Juan. I called this hotel to let them know I will not be arriving, and was told it was non refundable. I had called and emailed many, many times asking for a confirmation. I never once received an email and was never told what the cancellation policy was. After being told that my nights room was non refundable, I told them that I will be needing a room the following Sunday after our cruise and asked if they could use those funds. I was told that I would need to speak to a manager. I never heard back. I called and emailed several times and never got a response other than it is non refundable. They were very rude about it and not willing to take responibility for not informing me of their cancellation policy or emailing me the requested information that I asked for several times. I did not book my reservation on their website, I called the hotel direct. I would have thought they would have told me the policy regardless of how I booked. I work for a major airline and interact with thousands of people a week who are travelling. I have a travel blog and many people are referred to me because of my extensive travel background. I go on cruises every 3 months and make a lot of recommendations. I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE. I advised them of this and they said 'they could care less.' Bad customer service travels faster than good and apparently they don't realize this. But, after reading the previous review, they are rolling in the money and turning people away. I dont understand how this hotel is staying in business. I have also filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. This is absolutely unacceptable. By the way, I ended up paing 3 times the amount to stay at another hotel the following Sunday. I didn't care how much it cost, as long as the Hotel Miramar doesn't get another dime of my money.

We had 4 rooms booked for our family. When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted outside by a baggage boy holding envelopes (5 to be exact) and 1 with our name on it. He told us \"sorry, but we are booked full and you will have to stay at our sister hotel around the corner\". When I told him that was unacceptable and I wanted to speak to the manager he told me \"the manager is gone for the day and won't be available until 7am tomorrow morning.\" I went into the lobby and went to the desk to voice my discontent. How can a hotel overbook when our rooms were booked almost a year ago, and if they overbooked the rooms 10 months ago, why weren't we notified so we could have made alternative arrangements? After 10 minutes of insisting I wasn't going anywhere until I spoke to someone in management, low and behold, they hotel manager appeared. Her name was Lourdes. We attempted to show her our confirmation papers on our rooms and explained we did NOT want to stay at the shabby looking hotel around the corner. She told us to bad, but the rooms were all booked and we could not stay there. When we tried to reason with her that we booked 10 months in advance, she just smirked and said \"oh well, contact Expedia and let them help you.\" She was rude to say the least, and not one bit willing to listen to us, or even look at the reservation papers I had. We paid in advance when we booked so our rooms were already paid for back in April of 2011. When we asked her if the supposed sister hotel she was pawning us off on was comparable with the Miramar she would not answer us. They never offered to show us the room in advance so we could determine if we wanted to stay there. With 9 family members standing outside in the street with luggage, we were forced to walk down the street and up a hill, carrying our own luggage of course to this \"sister\" hotel. My elderly mother who has trouble walking was with us, and after traveling the entire day from NY I wasn\u2019t about to search the phone book for hotels in San Juan, and pay yet again for 4 rooms. We walked to the Olympus Hotel around the corner. It wasn't the slightest comparable to the Miramar. It was a hotel straight out of the 1960's. The rooms were nothing like the rooms we booked at the Miramar. Also upon looking at the price guide on the back of the room door, they were also a lot cheaper. The only compensation Lourdes was willing to offer was a continental breakfast (which by the way should have come with our room anyway had we been guests at the Miramar). The Olympus (sister hotel) had NO amenities at all to offer. The hallways and the rooms had a VERY strong smell of bleach, which right off the bat made me wonder what might be crawling around the rooms, or the bed. Needless to say this has been the worst customer service I have ever received. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone based on the scam they are running. I say scam because I believe that is exactly what they are doing. Overbooking the hotel rooms at the Miramar, taking the people who may have paid a higher price on the rooms, allowing them to stay, and then shifting the people who didn't pay as much to the \"sister\" hotel around the corner where the prices are cheaper. Meanwhile, the Miramar has been paid up front for the room and is making money by throwing you a lower priced hotel, and throwing business to the Olympus. The staff was at least friendly to us at the Olympus. The staff at the Miramar seemed to be scared of Lourdes and not willing to answer questions when she was around. Shame on you Miramar for making our stay in San Juan such an unpleasant experience. If this is the way that you treat customers, it\u2019s a wonder anyone wants to stay at your hotel at all. I will make sure all of the cruise boards I am on know about this so this experience doesn\u2019t happen to them. My pre cruise stay in Puerto Rico was less than pleasant thanks to the Miramar.

The room was clean and comfortable and we had free wifi (which is always a plus). When we arrived the room we had reserved was not ready, but we were quickly given another ready room by the manager. He also remembered my name the next day, which is a plus - I felt at home. Also, I called ahead to the hotel to find out about the cost of a taxi ride to the hotel and a new staff person was able to give me info and direction about going to the taxi stand at the airport and they would give me a price for the ride before I got in the taxi. The only things I had issue with were the earlier morning knocks on the door by housekeeping, which I couldn't understand since checkout wasn't until 12pm. Also, it was quiet at night but the room door does not block out a lot of noise so I heard the housekeeping staff in the hallway in the morning.

The great parts of the hotel are its convenient location with a drug store, super market, and cafe within steps of the hotel. Want to go to Old San Juan ? Jump on the bus just outside the hotel. Cost 50 cents VS $20 cab ride. Clean and safe. There is a laundry in the hotel which we used so we had all clean clothes when we got to the ship. The roof top is pretty cool with a view of San Juan. Down side of the hotel is that it is dated, there was a slight odor in the room but I think it was just something they clean with. Again, bathrooms and room were clean and no sign of bugs ! big thing with my wife. Lastly there is a small cafe next to the hotel.

Of course they won't let you pack a lunch from the continental breakfast - go buy your lunch in town. Duh. We stayed at the Miramar twice, one night before a cruise and three after. We therefore had two different rooms. They were both large and spotlessly clean, and both had a nice microwave and bar fridge. The first (406) had a king-sized bed against a wall with a window, which was odd but there was nowhere else to put it. The security light outside shone under the curtain all night which I thought would bother me but we all slept fine. The second room (304) had two double beds and looked onto the next-door hotel which is currently being gutted. I had no complaints about either room. The air conditioning worked well but the unit in the second room was much newer and quieter. When we checked in the second time, the elevator was broken. I thought \"here we go\" but a technician was called and it was fixed within half an hour. Some other hotels might have left it broken for days so this was impressive. The staff were pleasant. Somehow our booking was made for the wrong days but it was corrected without any hassle or really any investigation at all. To this day I have no idea whose mistake it was.

Went with a group of 18, family wedding on the cruise. The taxi fare is determined at the airport. I think it was around $3-$4/person, $1/luggage. Rooms were big and clean. Beds were comfortable. They had a microwave, fridge, tv. The room size varies. The rooms ending with 1 and 2 are the biggest/best (e.g. 201, 202). Those rooms also have the best view, a lot of daylight gets in. My room was facing the wall of the next building. The tv size also varies. My friend's room had the smallest tv! it was probably 13-15 inch haha. Ours was ~30 inch. If I remember correctly room 202 had the big flat screen tv. Hotel has an elevator, but it's very slow. It's faster if you just take the stairs. The hotel has 7 floors. The roof has a couple of patio sets, very nice view. We brought drinks to the roof and hung out there all night. Gym is very tiny, you need a key from the front desk to get in. AC very good, very strong. windows do not have screens, but I don't remember any mosquitos, maybe it's because we're so close to the water, constant breeze. Ice machine in hallway. Two computers on the main floor with internet service (free). Internet connection for your laptop also free. I used their printer and they didn't charge me for the paper. There's a big supermarket down the street (one minute walk). They sell alcohol in the supermarket. A few places to eat. There's one place across the street and down a bit from the hotel with this wicked dish. Can't remember the name of the restaurant, but it looks like a bar/foodcourt, they have a jukebox in there. Can't remember the name of the dish (spanish name), but the dish has chicken&veggies in a tomatoey sauce on top of fried plantains. Oh my god it was delicious! We had it for lunch and dinner! Their papaya shake is also good. If you take a 15 minute walk, you'll reach a stretch of hotels lining the bay. They have a casino there, and also a noodle soup place! There are no nightclubs by the hotel, so it's pretty quiet at night. Breakfast is free, it's located in the tiny restaurant in the hotel lobby. Not that much variety though; pastries, fruit, cookies, coffee, tea, juice. For guests leaving for the cruise, they can check out 2pm. We decided to check out 11:30am and head to the cruise port. A lot of people were already there lining up to get on the ship. So it's not too early if you're wondering. I highly recommend this hotel, especially for people that will be hoping on the Royal Caribbean cruise ships. Also Princess cruise ships were at that port too. There are two cruise ports/terminals, one is at Old San Juan, and one is on the other side of the bay; Pan American Pier. Royal Caribbean uses Pan American Pier.

It's clean, does not smell bad, and the rooms have the basic amenities anyone would need: hair dryer, iron, ironing board, security safe, and most importantly, air-conditioning! The room we stayed in (7th floor) had a decent enough bathroom. My one complaint with regard to the bathroom is that the hot water would run out at the end of my shower (and I don't take very long showers). So if you're someone who does take long showers, be prepared to be a little cold toward the end. The rest of the hotel is not bad, either. The rooftop deck is actually quite nice and affords a great view of the city. The breeze up there is heavenly. Also, there is a little restaurant/bistro bar right when you walk into the hotel - this is where they serve the continental breakfast and then later some cocktails and food. We did not really try out the breakdast and only had some coffee and juice one morning, but it looked like it consisted mainly of some fruit, pastries, coffee and juice. The hotel does have a pared down version of room service. We did not try this out, either - really, if you are in San Juan, there are much better places to eat other than your hotel, no matter where you stay. I do have to mention that the location of this hotel is ideal to getting into Old San Juan - there is a bus stop right across the street that only costs $0.75 and takes you right into OSJ. Doesn't get much more convenient than that. Keep in mind that taxis in this city are a bit on the pricy side. As for the staff, they were generally friendly and helpful, particularly the housekeeping staff. However, I have to mention an incredibly uncomfortable incident that overshadowed everything good that I just said about this place. The morning that we were checking out, one of the male front desk employees (I don't know if he was the manager or not) was incredibly rude to a female guest and her husband. I really can't say I know what had transpired before my boyfriend and I got downstairs, but all I know is that we inadvertently found ourselves in the middle of a screamfest of epic proportions. First, the rude hotel guy berated another employee in front of the guests - a HUGE no-no. Then, he said something to the lady about her bill. Granted, the lady was not the most polite of persons, but her response to his inquiry really was not that rude and did not necessitate his outrageous reaction - all he did was escalate the situation. He literally yelled at her to \"SHUT UP!\" about three times, and obviously the woman was becoming more agitated as well and responded in kind. This went on for a few minutes - yelling...no, screaming back and forth - until this guy tells this woman and her husband that he did not need their money and that he wanted them out of his hotel and that he was going to call the police. He also told them a few times that \"this is NOT the United States! This is Puerto Rico!\" and kept yelling at the woman, \"WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE!?\" He literally kicked them out of the hotel - my boyfriend and I walked to a nearby supermarket to get some change for the bus, and when we walked back to the bus stop, the couple was outside on the curb, in front of the hotel. The whole thing was unlike anything I'd ever witnessed before and honestly, was one of the most uncomfortable experiences I've ever had while traveling. The hotel guy, no matter WHAT the woman was doing or had said, should never have reacted the way that he did or said the things he said (in the volume in which he said them). In the hospitality industry (I know because my father has been in the hospitality industry for almost thirty years), there is simply NO EXCUSE WHATSOEVER for this type of rudeness and behavior. It is baffling to me that this man had the gall to treat a customer - any customer - in such a way. IN FRONT OF OTHER CUSTOMERS. Simply inexcusable. This hotel may be adequate in every other way, but someone get this man to an anger management class or in another industry pronto. He should know that word gets around. In short - don't stay here.

First of all, for a hotel that is nothing close to a five star rating the rooms were way too expensive. We had one room for all four of us and it was certainly not great. We were charged for the four of us being in there and spent almost $360 for two nights. If it were up to me we would not have stayed there but my mother has been staying there for years and she is set in her ways. I checked and we could have stayed at Coral by the Sea, Comfort Inn, Coqui Inn or Howard Johnson for less than this. The price really bothered me but I decided to chill out and accomodate my family. Next, the room smelled moldy. Rooms should have proper ventilation and smell fresh. They advertised complimentary breakfast which we were told we could have and this was nothing much really and the gymn they advertised was a run down room with poorventilation on the 8th floor. Barey any of the equipment worked. Sunday morning wasthehighlight of the trip. We decided to pack a barrel and we were told by a receptionist that the barrel came and we could pack it. We were never told that we should have packed it downstairs so we took it to our room and packed it there.Sunday morning while my father and I were transporting the barrel downstairs, the hotel manager came screaming at us in an insulting manner and said we were damaging his new carpet and we should have used logic to realise we are not supposed to bring the barrel upstairs. Had we known this information first hand we would not have brought the barrel upstairs and none of the staff said anything about this to us. The annoying thing was the fact that the so called manager was insulting us and telling us we should have used logic i.e we are stupid. My father and I let him have it right on spot. I told him he was stupid and he has no right speaking to us in that tone. I also told him that we would never stay at his hotel again. As for the carpet, I asked him if it looked anywhere close to damaged. We used the smooth part of the barrel to turn it and if we saw a problem we would have asked for help. The manager was told that we would never stay at his hotel again and he replied \"good\"which means he has no remorse or shame for his stupid behavior. His behavior reflected poor judgment, poor managerial skills, poor customer serviceand overall stupidity and he was told this by my father and me. If youy are paying your money especially over $350 for two nights good service and high quality is expected all around. This hotel had none of that and is not on my list of recommendations. When I went back to work today I spoke with one of my colleagues and she said she didn't like that hotel. I wish she had told me sooner. I don't knowhow this hotel received a reward but the manager needs to go ASAP. Even though they spent money to upgrade it over the past few years they still have far to go to become a five star. I was so angry on Sunday that I was close to bursting.

Just back from 2/14 sailing on Serenade. Made reservations with Hotel Miramar on Ponce de Leon Avenue in San Juan about 3 months ago. We wanted to spend an extra day in San Juan before going on our cruise so the kids could see the town. Hotel reservations were made through an online booking company. During the online search I entered 2 adults and 3 children and their ages. It selects hotels avaliable for the criteria you enter. I booked Hotel Miramar and paid a small booking fee. I called 1 week before arrival to confirm the reservation. I told them I was making sure we had 2 double beds since we were traveling with 3 children. They assured me that was correct. Upon arrival the girl at the counter says you have 5 people? I said yes. she said our rooms are 4 people max. After making several calls to the owner she informed us we would have to rent 2 rooms. (by the way, the rooms were huge and the 2 double beds would have easily accomidiated our family.) We argued we had confirmed and had a print out of the online reservation and they simply blamed the online booking company. We waited about 2 hours in the lobby while trying to work out something. Finally we reluctantly agreed to rent 2 rooms for 2 nights but at $99 for the 2nd room we were being forced to rent. We paid the $472 for the rooms as we were exhausted and ready to get settled. The next evening the front desk girl approached my husband in the lobby and told him she made a mistake and forgot to charge us the 2nd night at $99 for the 2nd room and we would have to pay it at check-out in the morning. She was very apologetic stating she was only doing her job and what the owner was relaying to her. The next morning the owners wife was at the desk. She was quite harsh stating we would need to pay the extra night. My husband argued he had already paid above and beyond and it was not our fault the desk girl made a mistake. With a very bad taste in out mouth we paid the final $99 plus tax and informed her we would be posting this as a review with a warning for others. At the beginning of our vacation a hotel that should have cost us $322 ended up costing almost $600 and alot of stress!

You can walk to the beach, about fifteen minutes away. It is tiny, and across from the police station (that should make you feel safe..). You walk through the park where the homeless live, and it smells of urine and general filth. You can also walk through the tent city, where the protesters are set up to try to stop what they determine to be illegal construction. Seems that most of the beachfront has been bought up by chain hotels, and the buildings go right up to the water, and the tall buildings stop the ocean breezes from coming into the city, so the whole area is hot and stagnant.

And I forgot to take a picture of the bathroom next time :-)", "Date": "May 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fremont, CA", "Title": "\u201cHorrible Experience at the Hotel Miramar\u201d", "Author": "MissKareBear", "ReviewID": "UR7420063", "Content": "I stayed at the Hotel Miramar with my family prior to our Caribbean cruise. Thankfully, we were there for only 1 night. It is by far the worst experience at a hotel that I have ever encountered. We requested one room for a family of 4 and were given \u201cthe biggest room\u201d. Granted, the room is relatively spacious, but none of us felt comfortable at all to really get good sleep. For starters, we found hairs on the bed sheets, as well as stains on the bed covers. Because I tend to get cold at night, I reluctantly still pulled the covers over me. As I started to fluff the comforter I started to smell this\u2026odor. When I took a sniff I realize the odor came from the stained, dirty, and now stinky comforter. Needless to say, I just opened my suitcase and grabbed a sweater and slept in it instead to keep warm. The toilet itself is so dirty and filled with grim that I wish there were toilet seat covers provided. The bathroom itself just gave us a really unclean sense of feeling and I felt showering in it might get me dirtier. In fact, all of us opt to forgo the shower, so we can leave this \u201chotel\u201d as soon as possible and get on our cruise ship! Despite paying extra for the 2 additional people, breakfast was only provided for 2. I did not go for breakfast, but those that did, said it was mediocre at best and we all still went out somewhere else to grab a bit. The area around the hotel doesn\u2019t necessary feel unsafe, but I surely will not stroll around there at night with my family. Over, this was a HUGE disappointment of a hotel. I would never ever stay at this hotel again, and will not recommend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "April 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cMixed feelings\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5292122", "Content": "My family of four, one 16 year old, 12 year old and husband and I stayed at the Miriamar from May 8 through the 12. When we arrived we were tired and hot from the trip. We registered in and were told we had a room on the third floor. But guess what we had to walk up to our room and carry our luggage. Now if any one knows a women and a pre teen girl can bring a lot of luggage. So up we all went with all this stuff. Went into our room and to our supprise it was a room with a king. I did tell them we needed a room with double beds. Found the maid in the hall way and tried to explain to her we needed a bigger room, she spoke no english and my spanish is not the best. make a long story short we did get a room with two beds. We did notice the room did have a musty smell and the AC did not work well. The house cleaning was not at all good. The tub backed up and the maid never cleaned the bath room good. The tub had a ring around it and the beds were not made. The view from the top floor was great, you saw the water and the kids loved it. The breakfast was ok. The front desk staff were helpful and nice. Would we stay again, no. I would go somewere else.", "Date": "June 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cBudget hotel, clean, friendly and free continental breakfast\u201d", "Author": "mrchicago", "ReviewID": "UR5180253", "Content": "Knew the hotel was old so there was no surprise. However, when we arrived the elevator was being renovated, which meant a walk up to our room on third floor, sun deck and gym on 7. Rooms are large and clean with small fridge and micro. The staff was extremely helpful with directions and restaurant recommendations. A free continental breakfast buffet was served every morning in the restaurant (currently only open for breakfast). Hilton hotel is a 10 minute walk, casino 15 minutes, 45 minute walk to Old San Juan. You can catch a bus in either direction in front of hotel for 75 cents. This is not a luxury hotel, no room service, pool or beach. However, if looking to save some money it's the place to stay. Keep in mind, your view could be a vacant building or car lot. We had a good time. Take a bus to Marriott if you want to sit by the pool. P.S. We got an extreme bargain on this hotel.
