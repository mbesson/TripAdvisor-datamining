I knew going in that this motel was \u201colder\u201d and needed updating but was advised that it was clean and convenient and the price was too reasonable to believe. That should have been my first red flag. First off, the motel is not clean. Upon entering the room, I could tell that something was up when I entered the bathroom and it smelled so bad, like mold or something, I almost passed out because it was so contained in that small area. I had to clean everything myself with Clorox wipes before using anything. Everything in this hotel must be original from when it was built except the TV\u2019s and the swimming pool. I would bet anything that our room was not cleaned after the prior customer checked out. Paper thin sheets and blankets (must be original since they opened), hairs everywhere on bedding and yellow and blood looking stains on bedding and pillows. Tiny, dirty bathroom, rusty hinges and faucets , moldy smell, tiny abrasive hand towels are supposed to be used as bath towels??, (we were 4 people, with 2 tiny hand towels). We had to use our own beach blankets as bath towels. Table and 2 chairs are right up against the bed, barely any room to get by. if you are overweight, you're in trouble. The pool was small, one of the men in the pool was in his street clothes. There is a list of rules on the gate of the pool area. It is interesting how the Empress Motel wants to impose rules on their customers but don't feel customers should impose any rules on them or have any expectations of them. To top it off, this motel should be renamed the Empress Old Age Home. Everyone around the pool was elderly and were not happy to see younger folks with children. They were not friendly, gave us dirty looks, and just stared us down at the pool as if we were on their turf. They were annoyed if my kids were having fun in the pool and gave a stern stare at that. This is a pool people, not a library. If you want to nap, go to your room. If you want to read, go to a library. Don\u2019t expect people who paid to come on vacation to be quiet in a swimming pool, especially young children, remember that was once you. It's pretty bad when your children want to go home on vacation. WORD OF ADVICE, DON\u2019T BRING CHILDREN HERE, THIS IS NOT A KID FRIENDLY ESTABLISHMENT. SECOND, SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE; YOUR BUSINESS IS NOT APPRECIATED HERE. THEY DON\u2019T TAKE PRIDE IN THEIR BUSINESS BECAUSE IF THEY DID THEY WOULD UPDATE AND CARE ABOUT PEOPLE (NOT JUST COLLECT MONEY TO LINE THEIR POCKETS). They actually gave Ocean City, Maryland a bad name in our eyes. Don\u2019t know if we would ever visit OC again.", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oneida, New York, United States", "Title": "\u201cClean, cheap & quiet\u201d", "Author": "CandaceJoy", "ReviewID": "UR138830548", "Content": "I have been coming to OC throughout the years and have watched it become an extreme tourist attraction and prices have increased for everything including outrageously priced hotels! So when I saw Empress rated at the top of hotels in OC, I thought I'd give it a try--especially at $91/night and it turned out to be worth it. The reviews are accurate. I found it to be an older, yet clean motel. It doesn't have an elevator so be prepared if you have lots of luggage or problems doing stairs. Also, the mattresses are hard and covered with plastic. The A/C was great though and a welcome relief and it was so quiet at night and in the morning I never heard any noises. The pool is small and doesn't stay open late but it was still a nice relief from the heat. and about The location is also great being on 20th Street with mini-golf and Philips Seafood around the corner. Also rented bikes next door at Eden Roc for $6/hr. Even though it's not right on the boardwalk, if you get a corner room, they have a balcony that has view of ocean.

I did see a sign which stated \"only for guest\" and went on to use the waterhose with the thought in mind to rent two rooms at this facility for four days. The manager,owner or who ever it was that so rudely approched us and literally yanked the waterhose from our hands said \"get out of here\"!!! I felt awakered at that moment and angered by his reaction and asked him, \"Sir, how do you know we are not guest here\"? The rude man said I don't know! I then asked him if that is how he treats his guest and he said no. The rude man then said I don't remember you checking in! It was about 11:30 AM.. no one checks in around this time!!. I then in turn replied you are an \"A-HOLE\"!! He then replied why don't you go back from where you came from! I am hispanic and proud of it...

We have stayed in numerous places in Ocean City over the years and were totally impressed with everything about the Empress. This may be an older building but it has been well taken care of - the maintenance shows. Freshly painted, flat screen TV, and very clean. One evening (sitting outside our room) we witnessed the night manager checking every floor as well as the parking lot to make sure everything was secure.Everyone who worked there was very nice and it was refreshing to see a well cared for (family owned) Ocean City motel still thriving and that they have not let it fall into a high priced ruin like so many other places in Ocean City. If you are looking for a no frills, clean and fairly priced place to stay this would be it.

Very nice family run business. Room was standard two double comfortable beds, a table and two chairs, a dresser with two large drawers, microwave and small refrig, and nice new lcd TV. Bathroom may be considered on the smaller side by some, but I thought it was fine. Most importantly, everything was clean and kept up. That was very important to me as my immune system is very compromised from cancer, and the horror stories on this site for other places worried me. When people talk about \"the mildew and mold smell hits you\", that translates to me as a potential life threatening fungal infection. That is definitely NOT at the Empress. I did not get the impression in the rooms or anywhere else that any problems had been \"quick fixed\" or sloppily patched. As another review noted, the place is older, but is not rundown at all. Yes, the towels are smaller and thin (they're standard motel utility issue) but the nice cleaning staff will gladly accommodate you with as many as you want. The location is nice, as you are just a couple steps from the boardwalk/ocean without crossing any streets, and bike rental is right beside you. One suggestion might be to consider a Wi-Fi connection.

The hotel is an older model hotel but it is clean overall and functional. It has the basics \u2013 bed, bath, dresser and AC. They also recently upgraded to new AC units, microwaves, mini refrigerators and flat screen TV\u2019s. The beds are not the most comfortable because they are the less expensive line of spring mattresses and the towels are small but they each served their purpose. The housekeeping lady was really nice and did a good job. Since we were only there for 4 days, we didn\u2019t ask her to clean the room but we did ask for a new set of towels. She said no problem and brought them back to us within 10 minutes. She did check on us each day to make sure that we we\u2019re ok. The hotel has outside entrances (with real keys, not the credit card type key) and is a very short distance to the boardwalk between 19th and 20th street. This is more of a family oriented hotel and the owner, who is also very nice, really does a good job of screening the guests. (Unlike the hotel across the street who had a lot of high school seniors staying there.) We made use of the outdoor pool which was great. A bit cool because the weather hasn\u2019t been all that hot, but once I got in, I didn\u2019t want to get out. The pool was very clean and several times during our stay, we saw them checking the chlorine levels and cleaning the filters. We are already planning to come back next year and will definitely stay at this hotel.

While there are no bells and whistles and everything is very basic and the decor dated it is the cleanest place I have ever stayed. The maids do an amazing job and the place is always spotless. The value is great, you won't find a better rate. The location is also why we select this motel as it's on the ocean side so you don't have to cross any roads with the kids to get to the beack and it's just steps from the boardwalk also. The motel is 3 levels with no elevator so if you are traveling with small children a guest who cannot do stairs you will want to try to request a 1st floor room. We have always requested this to avoid dragging the kids up and down the steps and have never had a problem getting one. The motel also has a nice size pool (no life guard).

Very family oriented and quiet. The room was so clean, bright and smelled wonderful. The outside areas of the motel are also kept very clean. Front desk staff is friendly and accomodating. The rooms are non-smoking, but they provide \"butt buckets\" filled with sand to use outside of your room. Nice pool, but too cold to use it that time of year. Some people did, though, but I'm not that daring. It's really just a half block from the beach and boardwalk, and you can get a room with an ocean view, albeit from that half block away. The room had a mini fridge, microwave, blow dryer, tv and small table and chairs in front of the window. Dresser has only 2 drawers but there were two luggage racks in the room. There's no latch lock on the door to keep someone with keys out when in your room, just doorknob lock and deadbolt. There's plenty of parking in front and around the back. Others are right, the towels are small but they give you lots of them, and the shower water pressure is pretty low. There are vending machines for snacks and drinks in the hallways. Ditto for ice, but you have to pay for it. I assume the maids do a great job, based on the cleanliness of the room when we checked in, but we never used their services because they come quite early, too early in my opinion. All it took was that first morning to have one pounding on the door at 9am-ish and we put the 'do not disturb' sign on the door the rest of the week. It's a vacation and I don't necessarily want to get up and out that early. This might not be an issue for you, but in my experience I've never had maid service arrive that early.
