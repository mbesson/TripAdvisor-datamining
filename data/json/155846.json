It always struck me that the lobby and front of the hotel was much nicer than the rooms - that was certainly true in 2010 and unfortunately still is true. Lower rooms still have non-LCD TV's. Go to upper rooms to get LCD TVs. The hotel also needs a quick breakfast / lunch place within the hotel - there isn't one, but there are alternatives outside of the hotel.

The person who answered the phone was quite rude and said that because of how we booked, the options above were the 2 possibilities.

This time we booked two rooms, one double bed room for my parents and one what we thought would be a two double bed room for my family, which we had confirmed prior to arrival. Upon arrival the two doubles beds were actually two twins. After some discussion with the front desk we were able to get a cot to the room which was appreciated. We found our room to have fabulous view looking towards the northern mountains and city. The TV was not a flat screen one would expect in a Five Star, but instead it was a big tube TV one would expect to find in a basement rec room. Both rooms were clean and classically decorated but the bathroom tub and fixtures were out of date. In general, we felt like we had a 3 star room at a 5 star hotel as we have had nicer updated rooms 4 star hotels in the area. The little things we found missing this visit was no newspaper and the bed wasn\u2019t turned down at night, which they did at our last visit which was a nice touch at a Five Star hotel. Maybe it happens elsewhere in the hotel but not on our floor and this room. We found most of the hotel staff very kind and helpful from the valet staff to the doorman and the reception staff (with the exception of one that made us feel like we arrived in a chuck wagon, which we didn\u2019t by the way). If you like Robson, this hotel is right on its door step with easy walking to many restaurants in the area.

The lobby is nice, staff friendly and helpful, but the rooms are merely adequate-not at all what we were expecting from a 5 star, considering both the Pan and Hyatt (4 stars) were much, much nicer. The Sutton is run down, in need of a remodel, in my opinion. We also tried out the pool facilities. What a joke! I've seen airport hotel pools and jacuzzis that are nicer!

But if you are looking, on the other hand, for a very nicely appointed (i.e., flat screen TVs in the living room and bedrooms), well laid out apartment-style lodging at an unbeatable price, this most definitely is a great option. We paid in the low 300s per night for the suite, which was at least 200 less per night than a comparable suite would have been at the competition. For what you are getting at the Sutton, the price is truly terrific. The hotel has great staff, a nice restaurant, a good business center, and an indoor pool/spa that connects to an outdoor terrace, with tables, chaizes and a table tennis table. The hotel is very well and centrally situated on Burrard, near Robson - and best of all, there is a Japadog stand right outside the hotel!

Hands down my favourite 5 star hotel in Vancouver. Location: Excellent. Robson street and Alberni within a 3-5 minute walk. ots of shopping, great restaurants and things to do.

A little dated, but more dated in a 5 star hotel kind of way than Hilton dated. Very comfy bed and lots of closet space. Service: Amazing service, particularly from Miguel at the conceirge, who I am certain is the happiest person I have ever met in my life. Very responsive and helpful. The dedicated conceirge makes great reccomendations about bars, restaurants, art exhibits and general things to do. Made reservations and got us into a very difficult club to get into with a VIP pass. Was there for two weeks and never once did I have a complaint. Room service cleaned my room multiple times a day if I required. Food: Great lounge, the Gerrard. Excellent wine and scotch list. Not a huge fan of chocolate, but if you are the buffet is worth the trip. Fabulous room service. Breakfast was great (buffet). Really no complaints here. Amenities: Hot tub and pool area was generally very quiet and clean, albeit a little dated. Nice cabana area outside. Only complaint would be was that it was noisy due to the proximity of the road. Very private. The stairwelll on the way to the pool is a little inconveinient and in need to rennovations. Spa: Outsourced, but decent. Vancouver in general lacks in this area.

Nothing to set it apart from the crowd. My wife and I stayed here September 30, 2011 for 1 night. We live locally, and stay downtown occasionally just to get away from our teenagers for the night. This was our first time trying the Sutton Place. In my opinion, and even after considering the excellent location close to Robson Street, you can do better for the price at the Fairmont's or Hyatt or Pan Pacific (when you can get a deal at the Pan Pacific). You can do much better, but for more money, at the Four Seasons. We booked a Premium 1 bedroom suite online. When we checked in, our suite was in the long-term residence tower. These rooms are renovated older apartments, with full kitchens, etc. When we called to see if this was really the Premium 1 bedroom suite, the Front Desk advised us that it was the residence tower, intended to be more \"practical\" than luxurious (you can tell they get that question a lot). To you and me it means that the finishing and decor is notably less luxurious than the hotel tower, which is where we ended up after asking to be moved. Of course, the 1 bedroom suite we thought we had booked was no longer available now, so we had a Premium King room instead. The room was nice enough and had a nice view down Burrard Street. Something little is that the remote would not operate the TV from the bed (had to stand about 3 ft away directly in front of the TV). And one wall in the room angled into the room at about a 30 degree angle. Not a big deal at all, but still a little strange. Apart from not advising us about the lower quality of the room we were initially put in, the Front Desk service was very professional, especially when we asked to be moved. The Turn Down Service was friendly and Room service the next morning was quick and friendly as well. So too the valet. Service in the lounge, however, was indifferent, uninterested and rushed.

We chose a package that included breakfast in the morning and free parking as it was the same price as just getting parking added on. We arrived early but they had a room for us on the top floor which gave us a nice view of the area around (other buildings). We then started to unpack and try out the kitchen in the room. These weren't top of the line appliances but good enough for the basic cooking we were doing. There is also a grocery store across the street and a wine store attached to the hotel which made it simple to grab things for the room. It is also in the heart of the main shopping area downtown so it made it simple to do some shopping. Our first morning we were woken up by probably the friendliest staff member I have ever had at a hotel. He came in and brought us our breakfast which I might add was probably the best breakfast I have ever had in a hotel and I have stayed in every nice hotel in the U.S and europe by now. It was a treat to have and was very pleased we had chosen that option as I can't imagine the trip without his smiling face every morning and the great breakfast to start my day.

I phoned the front desk immediately to be moved to a room away from the elevator, To the front staff's credit, this was done promptly.

That being said, there are several four stars (Sheraton, Hyatt, Westin) that are steps away from the Sutton. These hotels have updated, swanky rooms and better amenities. The Sutton doesn't even have an outdoor pool, which is a bit of a shocker. The Westin has a rooftop pool! We also had the pleasure of staying at the Pacific Rim, Fairmont on our way home.

The room felt quite dated; the carpet somewhat worn, old flat-panel doors and casings that had been painted over. It was clean enough but felt more like someone had let us stay in their apartment than a hotel room, especially one that is in a five-star hotel. The bed was fine but wasn't exceptionally comfortable unlike the Sheraton or Westin that promote and market their ultra-comfortable beds. There was a little galley-style kitchen that would have been okay if you wanted to cook something or store food. We didn't cook anything so I'm not sure how well-stocked it was. There was a little living room with flat-panel tv and a small, round table next to the kitchen. Overall, it was more than adequate and comfortable for what we paid but I would have been disappointed had I paid full price. The restaurant with the breakfast buffet was very nice and the breakfast was lovely. We ended up getting a great deal considering they threw in the buffet breakfast (approx $80 value based on three buffet breakfasts). I found the front desk staff to be friendly, helpful and accommodating. Overall it was a good stay, no major complaints or issues but I guess I just expected a little more opulence for a hotel that is considered a five-star hotel.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cA great location and attention to detail\u201d", "Author": "Klug", "ReviewID": "UR115858446", "Content": "SP is a classic hotel.

Had a floor to ceiling window with a very nice view of the downtown area facing out towards the Waterfront. The catering staff for our meetings were superb - so friendly and so helpful.

We ended up going through Hotwire, having just had great Hotwire experiences in San Francisco & Boston. What a mistake. When we arrived we were absolutely shocked to see our room. It must have been an old converted closet- no exaggeration. You entered through the door, made a sharp left -hand turn (there was a desk pushed against one side of what seemed like a narrow hallway) and then a tiny little room with two twin beds crammed in. It was smaller than most walk in closets I have seen. We went back downstairs where we were treated extremely rudely. I asked if there was any way that we could at least get a queen bed, as this was meant to be a romantic escape with my husband. They refused to move us. Not only was the room tiny but I don't think it has been redecorated since the 80's. The bathroom was also extremely outdated.

I believe it is rated 5 star due to the amnities such as spa and such. We had a room with a view overlooking the tops of dirty, grimy buildings, gross.

If you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel stay for your trip I would strongly suggest you using hotwire or priceline.

Those people couldn't have possibly stayed at the same Sutton Place that I just stayed at. Check in was a breeze. The valet and bell staff were amazing. The bellman made sure that we were comfortable in our room, pointed out many of the amenities, as well as telling us of some great restaurants and attractions just right out our door. Yes, the valet is expensive, but the service and convenience of having someone else pull up your car was great. They were always polite and so willing to help out with anything. Our room was amazing. We had a corner room on the 19th floor. The views both during the day and the night were amazing! We just sat there and stared for hours it seemed. The room was incredibly clean and updated. Great flat screen TV with DVD player and sound system to watch movies. A fully stocked wet bar (which was overly priced so we didn't use = but aren't all wet bars that way). The closet was big enough to store our luggage to keep our room neat looking. We never heard a peep from our neighbors. Almost seemed like we didn't have any. We used our white robes that were provided. The bellman told us we could call for slippers if we wanted them as well. The bed was amazingly soft. Every night they offered the turn-down service. If the 'do not disturb sign' was up, they would slide a note under your door with the weather forecast for the next day. We missed our turn-down service both nights but called them later when we were stepping out for a walk. They promptly turned down our bed with chocolates on our pillow, closed our curtains, and left the lamps on ready for us to head to bed when we came back. Every call to the front desk or housekeeping was greeted with great service and questions promptly answered. Our room service we ordered on our first night was spendy but amazingly good. The hotel itself was very classy. To be honest, I sometimes felt like I was dressed-down as I wandered up and down the hallway, past the restaurant, etc. It seemed like such a high class hotel. A true treat on our vacation. But yes, there were a couple small down sides. First of all, the pool, fitness room, and spa were a ride down the elevator, across the hotel, then up the elevator again. Seemed like such a long walk for a quick soak in the pool. Especially in such a classy place. The pool was very nice and the whirlpool warm and relaxing. We were the only ones in it at the time so we enjoyed that relaxation. In that area of the hotel was the spa, pool, fitness room, business center, gift shop, and laundry room. Since it was on the opposite side of the hotel, we didn't visit that area much at all, except for that quick dip in the hottub. Our only other problem we had was with the noise from the fan from the heat turning on and off. The click kept waking me up that first night. Problem was easily fixed when I switched the heat from auto to always on. No more clicks and I slept great all night. We thoroughly enjoyed this place. I can't help but wonder the same thing that the previous poster said, maybe when you pay the cheaper rates from the bargain sites, you get the cheaper rooms with lesser amenities. We booked directly thru the companies website. We signed up for their rewards club before we booked our room to gain some of their perks. Whatever we did, it was TOTALLY worth it!

We were on floor 20 of 21, and the views were spectacular. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was clean, holiday decorating was superb, and the workout facility was nice. We had Sunday brunch at the hotel restaurant. While pricey, for a New Year's Day brunch, I felt it was well worth the splurge. For us, the best thing about the hotel was the service of the staff. The concierge's were terrific (nice touch on the birthday cake!!), they were thorough, personable, and remembered your name. In a hotel filled with many highlights, the concierges were the most notable. The surrounding area was great too - it is one block from the famous Robson St., 2 blocks from Pacific Center and the Art Museum, a 5-10 minute walk to Canada Place and the Lookout, a 10-15 minute walk to Gastown and Chinatown, and a 10 minute drive to the Capilano bridge (and about an hour back - traffic is brutal). The only area I would stay away from in Vancouver is Hastings Street (starting at Abbot and heading east). The only two criticisms I have of the hotel are the price of self parking ($42 CAD per day after tax) and our TV didn't work (the poor maintenance guy was overwhelmed). On a personal note, I would recommend renting a car for a day (one equipped for snow travel), leaving early in the morning, and driving to Whistler. Getting out and getting into the city are tough, as traffic is horrendous and there are only a few entrances in / out of the city.

I asked the concierge for directions to a restaurant that a friend recommended for brunch. I accidentally referred to it as Abigail's Place when it fact it was Abigail's party (he gave me a bit of an attitude about it); the worse part was the place was closed that day. He couldn't have told us that? We drove to Kitsilano neighborhood on an empty stomach and was annoyed that we were not told it was closed.

Check-in was smooth and efficient as was check-out. The service from every single staff member was excellent. There was one exception to the excellent service. Our toilet stopped working and it took two separate calls 8 hours apart to get it fixed. The rooms were somewhat small but okay. We faced the street and thus had a lot of noise. While the location of the hotel is excellent and very centrally located it is very close to a hospital and ambulances with sirens passed the hotel at all hours of the day and night. The excessive traffic noise did disturb our sleep. The restaurant was surprisingly good. Our service was indeed excellent, the food was served promptly and we were not at all rushed. The quality of the food was high and we both really enjoyed our meal. We decided to skip the all-chocolate buffet for dessert; we just did not need the calories or probably weight gain. The bar was cozy and the service and selection was again excellent. The only negative about the bar seems to be popular now but a put-off to me. The problem was the omnipresent wide screen television that caused distractions it what would have otherwise been perfect communications.

The carpets were stained and everything just looked over due for a refresh. On the morning of my wedding I was pestered by the house keeping staff about checking our mini-bar. Apparently they FAILED to check it BEFORE I checked in and after the PREVIOUS guests checked out - so I could have been charged for stuff the PREVIOUS guests took! If it weren't for my sister I'm sure they would have charged me for items I did not consume. The ONLY good service I received during my stay was from the valet and bell staff.

I was also told by the manager that I would have to forfeit my deposit, leaving me $250.00 short of vacation money. Might I also add that we were not given the option for a smoking or NON smoking room, so I asked both the manager and the woman at the desk if they charged everyone that smoked that $250.00 fee because their rooms smelt like smoke .. he said no.

I would have a glass of wine at night (wine that I bought) and they would take the used glass but not leave a new one, one day I left my towels hanging so I could reuse them (to save water) but when housekeeping came through they just left them hanging not straighting them out, they did not tidy up, so little things like that.

I felt like the amenities were fine (Gilchrist and Soames) and in line with a 4 star hotel. The decor could use a face-lift but really wasn't as bad as I thought it would be having read some of the previous reviews. I will agree however, the bed was old, low to the ground (it almost looks like the box spring is missing!) and hard. In this era of 'pillow menus' etc, even at Hampton Inns, it's strange to just have two standard pillows on the bed. If the bed and bedding had been more plush I would have then said this was a 5 star. The air-conditioning is a bit noisy but my husband likes white noise to sleep so it wasn't really an issue for us. The real reason to stay here is for the location which is Fabulous. Right on the corner of Burard and Robson which has some of the best shopping and restaruants in the area and Gas Town is just a short walk down the hill toward the water. Some reviews complained of being nickled and dimed in regards to valet, etc. Staying at a 4+ hotel involves tipping, taxes, sometimes a 'facility fee' (not here however) and valet parking so just know going in that you're getting a good rate on the room but the hotel stay is still going to cost you.", "Date": "May 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris", "Title": "\u201cComfortable stay - Great classic hotel - Central location\u201d", "Author": "BluMartini", "ReviewID": "UR62717674", "Content": "I am not a fan of the decor but the professional & efficient service of the hotel makes up for the lack of personality of the hotel.

There was a large array of snacks and liqueur offered at an exorbitant price.

There were dents and markings all over the furniture. This was obviously an upscale hotel that is now discounted because it needs a renovation. The furnishings were maybe Victorian style, I'm not sure. But it just looked kinda old to me. The heating was old-fashioned and made quite a bit of noise.

The 6th day of our visit I talked with James Roday, the star of Psych, in the elevator at the Sutton. Wow! He was really nice. Corbin was not so nice, but what can you do? If you decide to stay at the Sutton here are some hints. 1) Hang out at the bar and nurse a drink or two, you might see a star shine your way. 2) Be prepared for $30 a day for parking. Yikes! 3) Ask if your room rate comes with free Internet, ours did. Otherwise you will pay about $15 to get it. HOWEVER- there is a package for $16 a day where you get the Internet AND unlimited free long distance in North America and local calls. To get just the calls and no Internet it is $10 a day. Be warned the Internet is about 1-5 Mbps. It is soooo slow I could snag some of the unsecured signals that were floating around and get the same \"dial-up\" slow speed. 4) The indoor pool is NOT heated. Be prepared to freeze your booty off if you are not use to swimming in 73 degree weather. 5) There is a grocery store called Market Place IGA. It is great for all the little things you might have forgotten. There may be some sticker shock- the groceries are about double to triple to what we pay in the US, at least in the South. 4) The laundry area is on the same floor as the spa. They close at 9:45, but if you still have cloths in a machine at that time you can call the front desk and they will let you back on the floor. Don't forget to buy detergent at Market Place across the street. Alot of times the forgot to close the floor off and I did laundry well past midnight. 5) In the summer the sun comes up at 5:00 AM! We are use to 7:00 AM. Bring eye an eye mask with you. They have blackout curtains, but it still was not enough for me. 6) There is a fire station right behind the hotel on the residence side. Bring a loud fan to block out the sirens that go off at least a couple of times a night.. 7) Bring lots of DVDs for the kids. The channels leave something to be desired for young kids. 8) Try the steam room if you get the chance. It was great, but I could not stand to have it on for more than 5 minutes. I turned it off and just sat in the room once it was all steamed up. It steamed so much I could not even see a foot in front of me and I had to stick my head out the door because I couldn't breathe. Once I figured to turn it off, it was fine.", "Date": "June 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201cNice, but not a five star property\u201d", "Author": "AnotherHoustonian", "ReviewID": "UR32652586", "Content": "I am perplexed that this place manages to score a five star rating.

True to his word we found ourselves on our way downtown sipping Champagne in the back of this limo, Vancouver was making a good first impression. After taking us on a detour to see some magnificent houses in the wealthier neighbourhoods we were eventually dropped off at The Sutton Place Hotel \u2013 our home for the next few days. Centrally located the Sutton is right in the heart of downtown Vancouver (Burrard St.) and right on Robson St. \u2013 the main shopping thoroughfare. Peter our porter took us to the 14th floor and to our room which was at the end of the corridor away from the lifts etc.facing toward the harbour (I requested this room specifically from reading other reviews and they obliged).The room was big, clean and tastefully decorated and had all the usual mod cons and facilities any 5 star hotel should have \u2013 in fact my wife would have taken the bed with us for the rest of our trip it was that comfortable.. Our bedroom had a seating area & table which we used for breakfast - most mornings I would go to the market at the corner of the next block where I could get almost everything you could possibly want for breakfast be it hot or cold food, fresh fruit and tea & coffee and the morning paper. We would then have our breakfast gazing out toward the harbour from my 14th floor window. The room was made up daily and a chocolate sweet left on the pillow each night. I could not fault the hotel in anyway from the Fleuri restaurant to Gerard\u2019s bar which has an \u201cold English\u201d country pub feel to it. They also have a nice bar menu and do table service. The hotel had a pool and an extremely well stocked gym. I also used their self service laundry room which was quite handy. There is a beautiful Old Italian restaurant nearby we would never have found on our own only for the concierge who arranged dinner there for us in Caf\u00e9 de Medeci .It was a little pricy but boy was it worth it and top service also. It\u2019s just off a little side street on Robson St. If you plan on doing some shopping you\u2019ll be spoilt for choice, Robson St is responsible for our luggage to double from 2 to 4 pieces. All the usual brands are there and I\u2019ve never seen so many shoe stores on one street. Lovely bars/cafes/restaurants dot along this busy shopping strip. Now that we were all shopped out it was time to explore and first on our list was Grosse Mountain. It took a ferry and a bus ride to get there and the scenery was spectacular especially from the cable car which brings you to the top. Once there you are surrounded by incredible wooden carvings, everything from native wildlife to 20 ft statues of the guys that sowed the seeds of the trees that were all around us, I must have photographed them all. We watched the birds of prey demonstration which was quite interesting and amusing, one of the eagles involved landed on the head of the guy standing next to me, I have it all on DVD,. We saw one of the bears also but he was sound asleep and the lumberjacks show was also very good. Going back down the mountain in the cable car we were joined by some people who had just ran up it \u2013 we were to have our own mountain experience in a few weeks! On the bus journey back watch out for the stop for Capillano Suspension Bridge, and get off. You\u2019ll get $2 off the entry price by using the Gross Mt ticket stub This is a really nice place to visit and the views form the bridge of the river below it are stunning (it\u2019s the tallest suspension bridge in the world). Make sure to cross the bridge as there is a walkway high up in the trees on the other side and also there are some \u201cgiants\u201d there too. What a day, you would actually forget that all this wonderful scenery is right on Vancouver\u2019s doorstep. Stanley Park is a must do. I would recommend getting bikes from Denman St. which is nearby and make sure you have a photo I.D. and some only accepted cash. Stanley Park is huge and we spent the day cycling around it and there are too many photo ops to mention, totem poles, and the bridge etc.Youll probably see some wildlife too especially black squirrels. A great place to just maybe sit and watch the sea planes coming and going out of the harbour. The aquarium in Stanley Park known as Vanquarium was excellent too with some of the most unusual and stunning creature\u2019s ive ever seen and well worth a visit Well that\u2019s Vancouver covered I think.

The staff in the hotel was very courteous and helpful. Everything was commensurate with a five star hotel except the one breakfast I ate there which was more of a three star presentation. But I do not penalize this hotel for the restaurant because there were Starbucks galore and a plethora of other restaurants within 200 meters of the hotel. It is located just off the most popular street in Vancouver so everything is within a short walk including the waterfront which is a must see. One of the highlights of my stay was eating in a Chinese restaurant which sat hundreds of people and had about 20 cooks in the open kitchen manning woks and cooking up a storm. The place is Hon's Wun Ton House on Robson, near Stanley Park. Sit in the back facing the cooks and watch them go to town preparing food for hundreds of people. The food was good and very cheap. I think it is one of the best and most entertaining restaurants I have ever been in. A second must \u201csee and eat\u201d place is Mink Chocolate Caf\u00e9 near the waterfront.

Also, some of the fittings, such in the bathroom, looked a little dated. I stayed for about $170/night, which is good value I think.

They did, but at $100 more than what we paid. We noted to the front desk that we saw a 24hr. deal on their website for $70 cheaper and they told us we needed to book the room online\u2014they would not reserve the room for us by phone at that rate. When we explained that we were on the road and this was difficult, and we were already booked for two evenings with them, they didn't seem to care. Their site reservation system turned out to not work on our mobile phones and we ended up staying at the Fairmont two blocks away instead. It didn't seem very courteous to not extend the web fare for already booked and expected guests, especially as this was mid-week (I could maybe understand if it was a busy weekend). Once we arrived at Sutton Place, the valet and front door folks were very polite and helpful. However, on the few occasions during our brief stay in which we asked the front desk or concierge a questions, we found we got very short and circuitous answers. i.e. when we asked if we could check in early since we were in town earlier in the morning than expected, they said \"Check in is at 3.\" When we asked if we could simply store our bags at their hotel while we were out in the afternoon, then they said \"yes.\" I don't understand why they wouldn't offer this option from the first question. That said, the room was clean and pleasant enough and the hotel location is central to fun city spots. The bed was sort of uncomfortable and the pricey internet connection was on and off.

Another interesting place to visit is Granville Island filled with small shops, art galleries and restaurants, all within a short walk from the hotel, followed by an even shorter aquabus ride (a must do again). Check-in went smoothly after a very late arrival. (We called ahead to make sure they knew about the delay.)

We were upgraded to a suite, but we had to change hotels and when we attempted to check in at noon the second day, we were told to come back later. The taxi driver who took us to the other hotel said he had done the same for another guest an hour earlier. It's obvious that the Sutton place overbooks its rooms even for prepaid guests.

It is everything it is billed to be: good location for shopping, not bad location for business, although it is closer to the hospital and courthouse than to the downtown business core. Not particularly close to the cruise terminal, either; it will be a taxi ride away. The opportunity for views is not the best in town, but the hotel itself does have exceptional service and the decor is old world elegant -- botanical prints, fleur de lys motifs, furniture that looks like it has some history behind it. Yes, the bed is quite soft and may not be to everyone's taste because of that. I was upgraded to an executive suite, which was quite nice. However, the bedroom was windowless --- not my favourite, but some folks may find that adds to the ability to sleep outside the local time zone. There is loads of room for clothing storage (in the suite, anyway). Some things are \"hidden\"...the laundry bag is in a drawer rather than hanging in the closet, and the coffee maker is well hidden in the bottom of the mini-bar. Wasn't particularly happy to have to search, find, pull it out and plug it in myself, although I guess it did maintain the look of the room, not having a coffeemaker front and centre in the foyer! The bathroom is okay, but a bit worn looking. Grout was stained in the shower, the bathtub does not slope much at the back so leaning back is ... well, let's say the tubs are original to the property...I think about 20 years. The stall shower is rather small...I'd guess less than 36\" across. However, the bathroom scales lied beautifully when I stepped on them, so I can at least fool myself into thinking I've lost weight on this trip!

Upon contacting the reception they could not have been more helpful. A fan was immediately brought to the room and lessened the smell during the night. We were informed to have our bags ready in the morning and would be moved to a non-smoking room. In the morning we were moved, and also upgraded into a Grand Suite. The room was unbelievable.

It's probably the only place I've ever actively run round trying to tip all and sundry. The staff seem genuinely friendly and helpful, and it's not the slick insincere \"friendliness\" that you so often get in good hotels. I don't know Vancouver that well, and didn't spend much time walking round the near neighbourhood of the hotel, but it seemed to me that the location was fairly central but not exactly over-exciting or interesting. It's not like staying on Knightsbridge or Fifth Avenue, for example. If you are feeling ill it's quite good though, because there's a massive hospital two blocks away... Like everything in Vancouver, the hotel is a newish building, in two blocks: the main bit and then La Grande Residence which consists of extended stay suites. The spa and pool are in the basement of La Grande Residence, but you can reach them without having to go outside. Inside, though, it's another story. Very traditional public areas, lots of marble, moulded ceiling decorations, rugs etc, but still quite light and airy. I had my bags carried in by a very polite and well spoken doorman, and then was escorted to a standard room on the 19th floor by a very polite and well spoken bellman who was almost desperate to show me the room's facilities. The room was perhaps on the slightly small side, but not inconveniently so. One whole wall was floor to ceiling window, and the others were covered in regency striped wallpaper in muted cafe latte tones, and tasteful prints. The king sized bed had a carved wooden headboard, and a very nice old-gold silky bedspread (on which I later managed to splash maple syrup... oops). Just about everything one could want was in there without my having to ask: iron, ironing board, dressing gown, umbrella, hairdryer, DVD player and loads of extra pillows and blankets. Only thing obviously missing was a pen or pencil by the phone. The hairdryer was also hopelessly ancient and tiny, and the guest service directory rather tatty and needed to be replaced. They should also keep the minibar chocolate in the actual minibar to keep cool! Noise wise, although the hotel is on a busy street, it was pretty quiet in the evening from up on the 19th floor where I was. Things got a bit noisier in the morning rush hour though: I did wonder how the lower floors were with noise. I'd definitely ask for a higher level room if you can. The ivory marble bathroom was fine and reasonably sized, with soft white towels and lots of amenities including a sewing kit, lip balm, loofah, cotton wool and two kinds of soap. Also there were scales in the bathroom, which I've never seen before in a hotel, but was not tempted to use given the pancakes and maple syrup I packed away for breakfast. I could have done without the Lush-type bath goodies laid out in the bathroom, though, costing an astronomical $12.95 plus tax for a small bubble bath bombe. Food Didn't eat in the restaurant (which looked a bit hotel-formal and stuffy to me). Did order room service breakfast, which was delivered bang on time and beautifully presented by a waiter who addressed me by name. Cost $33, but it was excellent... and the water which came for the tea was properly hot. Other facilities There's a fitness room on the mezzanine of La Grande Residence, which seemed rather cramped... a combination of being a smallish room and being absolutely crammed with equipment. In the basement, there's a small but light and airy pool and jacuzzi and full length windows looking out to a rather grey looking concrete sun deck. The snag is that you have to walk down 2-3 flights of stairs from the changing rooms to the pool. On the mezzanine level is also located the Vida spa which offers all the usual massage and beauty treatments plus some I'd never heard of. Service in general I should explain that I had a bit of a long running saga going on that would test the most patient of concierges. I'd been trying to get a UPS parcel from the US delivered to the hotel so I could pick it up when I arrived - and to make matters worse there would be an unknown amount of import duty to be paid on delivery. The concierges I spoke to before arrival couldn't have been more accommodating, offering to receive the parcel and pay the courier if it arrived before I did. In the end, it turned out even more complicated, but they took it all in their stride without any eyeball rolling and sighing, which one sometimes does get with concierges elsewhere who think they are rock stars....(not naming any names, W Hotel in San Francisco....) The other thing I'd mention is that everyone calls you by your name all the time, whether concierge or bellman or room service. It was a little disconcerting at first, but quite soon it has the effect of making you feel like you are almost at home, because it's obviously genuine. Will definitely be going back.

Immediately after checking into our room, I discovered a yellow waterfall-sized leak coming from the ceiling fan in the bathroom--looked and smelled like urine--flooding the entire bathroom floor and seeping into the hallway carpet. The gal at the front desk said it happened periodically when the guest in the upper floor apartment takes a shower and forgets to put the shower curtain inside the tub. I highly doubt that would cause a leak of that magnitude. We were afraid that the entire ceiling might cave in. There was obviously some construction engineering issues that the hotel has failed to address properly. We were switched rooms, but we were unimpressed. The layout of the apartment was really bizarre--maze-like. The one bathroom that had a shower in it was so small that if one was to use the toilet or sink, you couldn't open the bathroom door without crushing the other person, and it wasn't even connected to the master bedroom. Overall, the bedrooms were small and tough to walk around the bed comfortably, and one of the bureaus was missing a big chunk of wood underneath the glass. Some of the furniture was outdated and flimsy. The surround sound speaker system wasn't hooked up properly to the TV so that it only worked in DVD mode, which the hotel engineer didn't know how to fix. The hotel provided only enough coffee in the room to serve one cup of coffee, even though the coffee maker was for 10 cups. One of the two elevators on our floor didn't work properly--it only lit up when you wanted to go down, not up, and sometimes you waited 5 to 10 minutes for it to light up at all. Even the bellhop was embarrassed about it since there were so many people waiting for the elevator. There were drunks in front of the hotel taking leaks in the planters--that was about 8pm on a Friday night. The only positive thing about the hotel was its location--close to shopping, restaurants.

We heard that the owner of the Sutton place hotels was from Singapore so perhaps he had high expectations for his hotels, wherever they were. We had a ~40 inch flat panel TV with surround sound setup in our living area and another ~25 inch TV in the bedroom. The location was also very nice, there was a grocery store and bakery next to the hotel, and was within walking distance of many stores (tourist as well as department and boutique) and restaurants. Robson St and Davie St we're 2-4 blocks away and Denman St was probably a 20 minute walk. We also went to Victoria's chinese restaurant about 4 blocks away (in the basement of the Hyatt hotel) which had good, authentic chinese food. We heard that the Singaporean owner likes to come here for meals when he's in town. The parking was somewhat expensive at $28/day but you had valet service (which I think was free unless you included the tip) at the front door. It was very nice not having to look for a parking spot, and being able to call down to the valet from your room to bring out your car.

First we checked in and the lobby was very pretty, the room we got was small and hot, the air conditioning was not working. Be aware of Parking they charge $25.00 a night Wow! The furniture in the room was nothing like what it looked like on the website, the furniture was all scratched up and old looking. Construction going on at the residences brings the whole feel of the place down, makes everything look run down. We decided to go to the pool just to get out of the room, no premium channels are included, only local channels which was a big disapointment considering wanted to watch one of the last episodes of the Soprano's. Got to the pool and the hot tub had a sign saying \"Out Of Order\", the regular pool was freezing, you couldn't even stay in it more than 2 minutes. For what they charge per night $250.00 they should be able to afford to heat the pool. No towels available at pool level, had to go all the way upstairs, the change rooms smelled like dirty feet, Yuk it was terrible. Watch out the floors around the pool are very slippery you could fall and hurt yourself. Needless to say we checked out within 2 hours of our stay and went somewhere else.

This didn't stop the hotel staff from treating us as if we'd paid full price. Check in was quick and friendly. Everytime we arrived at the front doors, the doormen were smiling and helpful. The valet staff were courteous and able to offer us suggestions to local clubs and restaurants. The concierge was helpful in booking us a reservation at Tojo's (side note: if you love sushi, go to Tojos - I am now retired from eating sushi as this was the best I've ever eaten). The rooms were quaint and comfortable. We had just stayed at a Westin which had advertised their beds as \"heavenly\". The Sutton didn't comment on the beds, but we found them to be like sleeping on a cloud. The notecard indicating the next days weather was a nice touch. Location could not have been better. We are shoppers, diners and club goers and found the Sutton to be perfect for all the above. Cab fares to some of the further attractions (Granville Island, Gastown) were very reasonable.

My room was high up in the hotel, had a great view, the bed was comfortable, the bath was lovely to soak in and the room service food was excellent.

I didn't walk around the hotel area very much but found that most of the shops were high end expensive fashion or tacky tourist souvenir type shops.

The beds were uncomfortable and sagged a great deal in the middle. The shower stall needed to be renovated, seemed clean, but very outdated. Secondly, the service was mediocre. The woman that checked us in was patently nasty. Upon arriving in the room we waited quite some time for our luggage to follow. But it never did. We called down to the desk to request our luggage for the second time and we were assured that it was on its' way. We waited another 20 minutes or so and decided to just leave. When we returned to the room in the early evening to change before dinner, our luggage still did not arrive! At this point we called the hotel manager. He was apologetic and had our luggage (finally) sent to our room. The staff, including the concierge and bellmen, were friendly and helpful. If you go to this hotel expecting a luxury experience then you wil be disappointed. If you expect a middle of the road experience and you aren't that picky, then the hotel is fine. However, if you are the type that wants the five star experience then wait until the Four Seasons finishes their renovation and stay there.", "Date": "August 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, Nice Hotel, Not 5*\u201d", "Author": "CasperUSA", "ReviewID": "UR5581476", "Content": "This is a very nice hotel but not 5* like other posters have mentioned. The room is well appointed but small- either 1 king bed or 2 single beds (around 225 sqft). The indoor pool and spa are nice/clean but small- don't be fooled by the photos. The fitness center is above average but not great. The restaurants looked good but are very expensive. The 5* rating must come from the service, which is terrific, because the amenities are 3* to 4* at best. I paid around $140/night (USD) for the room but would not pay more. Considering what other hotels in the area charge during the summer months I won't complain about my rate. But I just don't understand how this establishment can be considered 5*. If you want the latter, try the Pan Pacific, Four Seasons, or Fairmont Waterfront.", "Date": "August 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cForgot such service existed\u201d", "Author": "Wilkies", "ReviewID": "UR5577101", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel prior to an Alaskan cruise. Having spent eight days in the Rockies, arrived very hot and a little dishevelled entering the hotel at the \"exit\" entrance. From the moment the car door was opened for me to the moment we left the following day, thoroughly enjoyed every minute of our stay - just wished it had been longer. Sutton Place should be thoroughly proud of its employees, all were extremely helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Turned our car round for us and gave us detailed instructions on how to find the hire company. I would like to apologise though to housekeeping. As I said we had spend eight wonderful days in the Rockies and on our arrival at the hotel, started to re-organise our luggage for the cruise. It was such a beautiful day outside that we only half finished. To our horror, on our return to the hotel later in the evening, housekeeping had been to turn down the bed and leave a chocolate on our pillow. What they must have thought of the mess heaven only knows. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel. It offers the kind of courteous, almost old fashioned service, that we thought had vanished a long time ago. Well done to all.", "Date": "August 8, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Sutton Place Hotel Vancouver", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g154943-d155846-Reviews-Sutton_Place_Hotel_Vancouver-Vancouver_British_Columbia.html", "Price": "$196 - $383*", "Address": "<div class=\"blBox\">", "HotelID": "155846", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/23/3e/28/hotel-lobby.jpg"}}
