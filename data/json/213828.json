After reading a few Trip Advisor reviews, I had some concerns, and called Mr. Alex Blanco, the hotel manager. He was very solicitous and genuinely seemed to want to allay my fears. He said he would locate us on a high floor to avoid street noise, and try to put us in a balcony room with a pool or bay view, as opposed to the city view, which my reservation called for. This was three weeks prior to our trip. When we arrived at the hotel, which is located about 3 blocks from the main shopping area, we found that Mr. Blanco had upgraded us to a bay view room with two queens instead of two doubles. When we got to our room, I found that Mr. Blanco had left a beautiful silver Ritz Carlton picture frame for me on the dresser with a note telling me he was at our service during our stay and hoped we would have a lovely time on my daughter's spring break. I was surprised that he remembered our previous phone conversation so exactly, and touched with the thoughtfulness of the gift. The room had a wonderful view of the bay, which was gorgeous and sunny in the morning. The room was very nice, the beds comfortable and the bathroom small, but nicely appointed. The staff were all very pleasant, helpful and eager to confirm that we were enjoying our stay. the property itself was quite lovely. All in all, I was extremely happy and satisfied with our stay, and would recommend this hotel without hesitation. Mr. Blanco, of course, gave our hotel experience that extra \"Ritz Touch\", and made it even more enjoyable.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cFabulous...\u201d", "Author": "jdocarmo", "ReviewID": "UR126138261", "Content": "I would consider this hotel and recommend to it to anyone who is looking for a luxurious experience, a honeymoon or just a relaxing time.

A friend and I arrived for a 2 nite stay to relax and take in some Miami sights. Our room was not ready at check in time 4pm so we opted to go to the pool area and wait, the front desk clerk Katya said she would call me on my cell as soon as the room was ready. I had driven 7 hours that day and explained we were tired and hoped it would be soon. We went to the pool area and found dirty chairs everywhere and trash strewn about from leftover dirty dishes and glasses. We found a spot that was relatively clean and sat waiting for a waiter to get us a glass of wine. 20 minutes later one showed up. We ordered and wine came 10 minutes later. The wind was gusty and the plastic glass tipped o er onto my friend and a huge palm from fell on us, the waiter wandered over after the crash not to concerned, we were shaken a bit but tried to make the best of it. 90 minutes had gone by with no call from the front desk. We decided to pay our bill and check on our room. $40.00 for 2 glasses of wine, I paid the waiter and he said he could not make change and he would owe me, what?? Owe me? How crazy was that. Frustrated we went to check on our room. Oh it was ready but they had not called us. We were brought to the room and it was clean but missing robes, slippers, toiletries, wash cloths that are part of the amenities, we were assured they would be brought. The room was small with 2 beds, overlooked a roof, not great. We tipped Diego the bellman quite generously and he left. We went out for dinner and on our return we still did not have the needed items. They finally came later. Several times when leaving the hotel with packages in hand staff was near the heavy entrance doors just standing there with no offer of help to hold the doors for us 2 ladies! Even after the big tip. I was asked by the desk at check in what newspaper I wanted each morning, I replied the Miami paper, it was never delivered either day. At check out we decided to have breakfast before our long car ride. We waited 15 minutes for the waitress, and after another 10 minutes to get coffee, another 10 minutes for cream, another 10 minutes and 3 requests for juice. The staff looked so confused, what is going on at this hotel? I mentioned our issues to the desk and they kindly comped breakfast. Anthony was the the only staff member to give true Ritz service the rest need to be fired! At check out we called for a bellman and waited 30 minutes called again and they said they had forgotten to send someone.

There were 3 adults in our room. We confirmed upon check in that our room would have 2 beds and were assured it would. Then were told our room was not ready and they would call us, advised us to go to the pool. Which we did. We had just got in and were hungry so we tried to get food by the pool. It took over 30 minutes before someone took my order but they were glad to complain to me about the manager. We asked for help finding chaises to sit in as there were NONE. No one ever got us chairs, we ended up having to sit on the ground for 4 hours. We asked for towels and got more complaints about the manager from staff but waited at least an hour before we even got towels. Hours went by and we never got a call about our room so we went to check on it. Turns out our room had been ready for hours and no one bothered to let us know. We get to our room, guess what? ONE BED. We call the desk. \"Sorry that's our last room, we'll send you a cot\". You've got to be kidding me! Left with no other choice as it was new years eve we had to stay. Thanks for ruining our holiday trip Ritz Carlton, Coconut Grove. They send up a 5ft cot for a 6ft man to sleep in. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE! I didn't pay this much money to sleep in a tiny cot! My friend goes to the lobby to grab a snack before we leave for south beach because we have no desire to spend time in this hotel. The lobby reeks of some sort of rose perfume which made some of us allergic. I meet my friend in the lobby and sit. The waiter doesn't acknowledge my arrival, offers me no water, no menu...just ignores me the whole time as i am forced to watch my friend eat and am offered nothing. We go to get our car from valet and am shocked again that they want to charge us $15 every time we park the car. Valet was forced as they won't let you park your own car and there is so much construction around the hotel you can't park on the street anywhere nearby. We say \"are you serious? we are guests?!\" The valet replies \"oh you are staying here? Then it is $40\". What?! So visitors to the hotel pay $15 but guests pay $40? What a joke. The manager of this hotel runs it like it is a Days Inn. The manager was useless in terms of dealing with any and all problems we had during our stay. I have stayed at other RC hotels and the like and never had problems like these. This is a 2 star hotel with a 5 star name.

I've never been disappointed in an RC property before, but the RC at Coconut Grove managed to disappoint in a big way. We were in Miami for 2 nights with our 2 sons (older teenagers). We were in a very nice suite...however there was only one sink, which I found unusual. There was a lot of construction going on with another part of the building, so from some unearthly hour in the morning until late afternoon there was absolutely no peace whatsoever due to the constant outdoor construction with cranes, bull dozers, etc. Usually in an RC there are a few shops,....or at least one, where you might find toiletries, etc. This RC does not have a single shop. The breakfast was quite unappetizing. Pastries were clearly not fresh. The scrambled egg container had about 2 servings left and those looked like they had been in there for some time, so I sat down and just waited to see if they would bring out fresh eggs. After 20 minutes, the chef came out, checked all the containers, including the eggs, and went back into the kitchen. 20 minutes later....still no fresh eggs. (I was eating other things from the buffet while I waited.) I finally asked the manager to bring some fresh eggs, and it was only then that fresh eggs were put out. She did bring me my own plate, which was nice but should not have had to happen. The breakfast service was not good....our waitresses were not attentive. In addition, the fire alarms went off 4 times in 2 days. One of those times was later at night after we were all ready for bed. It turns out that this is a regular occurrence for this Ritz because the residences and the hotel are on the same system. Apparently any tiny thing can set it off. The trouble is, most of the staff just ignore the alarms. It's like the boy that cries wolf...what happens when it's a real emergency?

I think our first disappointment was that the hotel is far away from South Beach ( and I completely acknowledge that the hotel is not to blame for this) - so my biggest recommendation is that if you are travelling to Miami for some fun, party and good music - I would recommend booking other hotels on Miami South Beach. Return fare from this hotel to South Beach work out to be $70 ($30-35 each way) - so I think we would have been better off spending these $70 on a room closer to the main area. The other disappointment was that our check-in person did not inform us about the buffet breakfast - so we ended up ordering ala-carte in the room. There were no room service menus available - and we had to call up reception twice to ask for their menu- slightly disappointed here. There were road works going on in the area, so it's really tricky if you want to walk around the property a little - not something you expect if you are staying in a 5 star and paying 5 star rates- right? The beach closer to the hotel was really quite - so we assume all the fun happens in the South Beach area only.

Which is why I can't understand how the hotel gets everything else so wrong, despite managing the hardest part: good staff and service. The rooms are average and if you are unlucky to get one on the lower floors, way below average considering the room rate. They're just full of paradoxes. There's a lint remover in the room, but the bathtub doesn't have a shower extension (so what's the point..) and the safe is so small you can hardly fit a wallet and keys in it. The bathrooms are rather nice, but the toiletries are basic at best. The TV is massive and high end, but there isn't even a chest of drawers in the room. The pool area is really quite spartan, with a very small pool considering the size of the hotel. The breakfast buffet must be the worse I have seen in a luxury hotel. There is hardly anything there, not even sliced bread. Admittedly, you can order it from the waiter, but not of great use if you are in a rush. Continental breakfast is a plate, with 4 pieces of pastries on it, that's it. In all other hotels of this calibre, there's general a continental buffet option, which includes all cold items, like fruit or yoghurt. Not there: you either pay for the full buffet ($30 inc tax), or you have to order a-la-carte, which works out at pretty much the same price, for a coffee, some fruit and a pastry. I was really disappointed and seeing that there have been quite a few similar negative reviews prior to mine, I find it even more disappointed that there has been no management response to these reviews, which makes me wonder if management even cares.

I cannot emphasise enough what a great young man. He's whole demeanor is calm, relaxing, welcoming, friendly and he is a real asset to this hotel. I travel a lot & rarely have I come across a guy like this. I'm sure he's going to go very far in his career coz he has a way in dealing & speaking to people that is a real gift. The rooms are lovely, nothing too special but once you're all tucked up you cannot fault a single thing, great bed very high quality/thread count sheets, bathroom just amazing. They give you so much water and it's a small cost to the hotel but goes a long way with travellers. TV flat screen, room service excellent. Had the brunch on Sunday morning and though it seems a small selection, it's only because they are not putting out gallons of food: rather they refresh it constantly & it was fab-u-lous! Topping you up with free champs all morning. Nice gym, nice bar area, the only gripe would be swimming pool. They need to address this area: The chairs were more from a 3* hotel. I'd recommend this hotel hands down... ended up extending my stay I was so relaxed couldn't move! On way back home I tried Four Seasons::: which is perfectly nice but the Ritz is far more relaxing, intimate & friendly. I also visited the Ritz at South Beach & it's a monster of a hotel -- huge but the staff were lovely & it's bang on the beach. Ritz Coconut Grove is more boutique & everyone without exception makes u feel special. I found the staff in the dining room more than attentive so I was amazed anyone would complain about being kept waiting.

Room in always in immaculate condition after mid-day service -You're close to South Beach = close to the sun, sand and beautiful women - pricing is very affordable - Lastly, employees like William Baines. The guy is spot-on with everything he does for you. He was able to assist me in whatever I needed while i was there. Kind-hearted, focused, and a genuine person. He even played a better concierge than the ACTUAL concierge. Had an issue with my bill and he was able to fix it right away. William was absolutely great and if i didn't know any better, I'd say he lived there because he was in the lobby or behind the desk everytime I came down! If you're there ask for him!!

There are three parks for picnics, a cushioned running trail all on Biscayne Bay. Boat rentals for cruising, fishing are available. Just a short, easy, three minute walk into town for a brand new thirteen movie theater with the latest hits. Many restaurants such as Jaguars for Peruvian, Georges for French and a good, funky sports bar the Sand bar(try the Joey wings). The Grove will easily take up three days. Stroll through the art stores, picnic, boat, see a movie and dine around. When you are finished drive or better take a taxi to South Beach 20 minutes. Do the typical beach, drink, eat, shop. A younger crowd will enjoy staying on South Beach but you can still head over there for the experience while returning to the home town charm of the Grove. From the Grove location another 10 minute cab ride away is Coral Gables with the elegant Merrick Park shops and more dining on Miracle Mile. You can get to Miracle Mile on a free trolly and catch a taxi from there back to the Ritz in the Grove.

Like most Ritz Carlton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it is fairly costly to stay here, so for me here is a summary of the good and the bad: The positives The rooms are large and a good size, with very comfortable beds and pillows and large well equipped bathroom. But based on the location in the middle of a suburban area many have very unappealing views for the price. I was looking over to buildings and a roof top. The Fitness centre is large and well equipped The reception and front lobby service is very friendly and helpful. I had, for example, on checking in asked for a room without an inter-leading door to another one, and they handle it in a no fuss and open way. The negatives It is not in South Beach, which may sound odd but is important if you are on holiday or (like I was) attending a conference at the Miami Conference Center, as if you are planning or needed to spend in SoBe this location is not ideal. There is nothing much around the hotel, and you will need a car. The service and time it takes to get breakfast in the restaurant is very slow, versus the fast evening room service The overall attention to detail through the hotel is mixed, I had asked for my bathroom scales to be changed twice and neither worked, and you think that they would have at least have tried to ensure that the replacement worked. When booking, check you get a deal that has the valet parking and the breakfast included as they are expensive as extras. So overall it is a neat, up-market hotel that does a lot well but lacks some of the depth that other 5 star hotels offer.

We will never stay here again nor will we recommend that anyone stay here. First, it took them 3 hours to prepare our room upon our arrival. We were put in a temporary room so we could rest, but calls to the concierge to follow up on the status of our permanent room were never returned. Second, since this hotel is not close to a beach we were hoping for a nice pool, but sandwiched between buildings it was depressing at best. Also, aside from an outdoor mall of the Cheesecake Factory variety, Coconut Grove has nothing going on. So we were stuck--the hotel wasn't a place we wanted to hang around in and neither was Coconut Grove. As a result, we called the concierge to find out if we could use the facilities at another nearby Ritz during the day. We were told it would be no problem. So we spent $60 to take a taxi to the other property, only to find out that it was indeed a problem. We managed to finagle our way onto that property, but were pretty irritated that the Ritz got it wrong. Third, (a small issue but after the first two our fuses were pretty short) we were given wrong directions to a restaurant. We spent half an hour walking in the wrong direction based on the Ritz instructions. Fourth, we were charged a \"room service fee\" when my husband went downstairs to procure a glass of milk. That's just ridiculous. Fifth, after our irritation we asked the Ritz to call another hotel to find out about availability. Our call was warmly received, but no one ever bothered to call us back with a follow up. Finally, we made our own reservations at another hotel and went down to the manager to explain why we would be checking out early. When he asked what he could do, we suggested that he could comp our valet parking charge. Although he agreed, when our bill arrived the next morning, the valet parking charge was at the very top of the list of charges (along with internet fees which was odd since we didn't have a computer).

As a Viajero Global who has just turned 50, I've grown out of the full-on South Beach experience - in addition to which, THE thing seems to be conversion of hotel bars into night clubs which renders the hotel stay for anyone not participating in the party scene horrible.

My 4-night stay could have been designed as the perfect \"test\": > After putting my clothes in the closet, I found a sticky mess on the shelf which had soiled a shirt; in a matter of minutes, housekeeping sent a guy and a girl to clean it. > They said I should leave the shirt to be laundered the following day which I did but past the cut-off time for same-day delivery; nevertheless, the charming lady who picked it up asked me whether I would like it delivered the same day. > I was initially allocated room 817 which has a door to an adjoining room; as I discovered on the second day, this means you hear absolutely everything from the guests next door so I asked if I could change. This was no problem and I was allocated 720 which was bigger (with no connecting door) but without access to an external free WiFi available from 817. The laundered shirt was duly delivered the same day to 720. > The cost for the laundered shirt appeared on the bill but was removed immediately I pointed it out. > The $200 credit was NOT fully applied to the bill on checkout (the guy at the desk said they had complained about the systems glitch) but was deducted straightaway. Other observations: > The large pool is lovely and peaceful: receives the sun after 11.30am at this time of year. > I found service superb throughout the property: as others have mentioned, it's amazing they remember your name without it seeming fake; if you hablar espa\u00c3\u00b1ol, the housekeeping staff are incredibly friendly. > As a \"solo traveller\", I didn't feel out of place since a) the average age of the guests is older and b) it's used by people on business which gives it less of a suffocating \"straight couples only\" atmosphere. > You definitely need a car (Coconut Grove is nice but you'll definitely want to go to the malls or other areas of Miami): hiring from Avis at MIA took 45 minutes so I'll try Hertz next time.

It is down right tiny compared to its bigger sister resort on Key Biscayne. But the smaller size results in a much friendlier and personal experience. We were looking for a quiet and luxurious stay and that's exactly what we got. The room was very nice with a beautiful balcony view of the Bay with Key Biscayne in the distance. By comparison to other Ritz hotels, the room is slightly smaller, but every bit as comfortable and clean. We arrived late afternoon and were happy to find 24 hour room service. As usual, the room service food was delivered promptly and it was a delicious meal on the balcony enjoying the sun and the breeze with a great view. Breakfast room service was equally good. Did not have a chance to visit the restaurant, but we were told that it was excellant as well. The pool area is quite nice and very quiet. We enjoyed the pool bar and the chance to sit outside in the sun and enjoy a late afternoon cocktail. During our visit, the young man at the bar was very friendly, but not very experienced on preparing drinks. (Didn't know what a Rum Punch was, we made some quick changes on our choices and got him thru the items he wasn't familiar with. The staff was very helpful to a person. The staff at the front desk was quick to recommend where to go for meals outside the hotel as well as how to get there. There wasn't a request that they didn't immediately respond to quickly and with a smile. Coconut Grove was very quiet and very disappointing. The descriptions we read before we arrived made it sound like a charming shopping area full of interesting boutiques. Sadly, didn't find that to be the case. Instead, found very boring shops with lots of empty and closed locations. Don't know if this is all a result of the bad economy, but nothing worth seeing.

This was my first time staying in a hotel in Coconut Grove and I enjoyed every minute of it. Very quiet! Why not go 5-star in the quiet community of the Grove, compared to South Beach. I was super impressed with the chocolates that were laid out every evening. They even turned the radio to relaxing jazz and latin jazz stations. The beds were extremely comfortable and the room was super clean. This was my first 5-star hotel stay and I see why the Ritz-Carlton is at the top in its class. I felt out of place in a way, almost a spy to the very well-to-do class, whom I met in the lounge daily. This Ritz-Carlton has condo residences and usually the lounge is treated as their entertaining room. Everyone I met was very nice to me. No snobs, all down to earth. In a place like this, one can do \"power\" networking. The hotel is close to Cocowalk so you don't need a car, all within reach. The spa was fabulous as well. Ultimate treatment! The lobby lounge was wonderful. My first real Mojito was served to me in Bizcaya, their posh upscale restaurant. The breakfast there was fabulous! I spent every evening downstairs in the lobby lounge people watching, sipping on cocktails, mingling while listening to the live vocalist and piano player.

Unfortunately, we flew on the day of a blizzard back home and the airports were shut down. We were told by American that we would have to spend 4 days before getting another flight out. As horrible as that sounded, we thought we would try to make the best of it and stay at a Ritz. We generally frequent Ritz Carltons, and know and love their service and standards. Let me say by no means is this Ritz up to standards. First off we checked in at a very late hour. We got a handicapped room (no biggie) and was told that we would be switched to a suite gratis in the morning when occupancy went down. Mind you we didn't ASK for one, they offered. The room was fine, was up to ritz standards, very clean and in order. Also very quiet. The balcony was filty and when you walked out on it in stocking feet, your feet would be black. When we woke in the morning, we went to the front to inquire about our room change and were greeted with \"who said you could have a suite? we don't have a suite for you, who did you talk to, your just going to have to move out of that room and get another, but certainly not a suite\" I was dumbfounded by her demeanor. Certainly not the \"Ritz\" \"our pleasure\" policy. So in any event, they insisted on switching us to another room but a regular room instead of a handicapped. This room was quite different than the previous room. Dirty carpets, dirty bathroom and walls, rusty fixtures in bath. Basically it looked as if the housekeeper in this room (422) did not do her job very well. Plus to make matters worse, our neighbor we could hear as if he were in the room with us. Very annoying. Every day the Ritz states that they have 2 services to the room, one regular service during the day, and then a turn down at night. Our housekeeper would do both at the same time, and mind you the turn down was nothing special. But turn down is a way for housekeeping to refresh towels and give you ice, put robes out etc....this was never done, and as a matter of fact as our stay went on, the housekeeper did les and less to the room. It got to be where we would have to ask for toilet paper, and our bathtub was never cleaned out. We heard that the Sunday brunch was the BEST in Miami, and for 100 bucks per person it should be. We decided to go directly to the restaurant and inquire. The gentleman (guessing manager?) told us that the last seating was at 3pm. So we booked for 3:00 as we wanted to shop a bit before going to brunch. We were starving by 2:30 and decided to try to sit then. We were horrified when we got there and they were breaking down the stations. I quickly asked the woman who was sitting us and her reply was \"we close in 20 minutes\". 20 minutes? I said. I was told the last SEATING was 3pm. She quickly changed her tune and assured us that we would have plenty to eat. We went to the sushi station, CLOSED they placed a bunch of sushi out and took off. Then went to the caviar station, while it was still open no one was there to serve me. We quickly got as much as we thought we would need and sat down, and while we were eating, the guy manning the dessert station came out and said \"do you guys want any crepes for dessert?\" dessert? we just sat down. Well he wanted to know so he could break down his station. A complete joke. Staff at this Ritz were unfriendly (except a few) and uncaring. I found this especially true with the front desk staff. One day I asked where I could exchange some money, and was given a stern \"I have no idea\".... this is highly unlike Ritz, where they generally would say \" I am not sure, but let me find out for you\".... The clincher was upon checking out I said \"hello, we are checking out of room 422 please\" and the gentleman behind the desk did not say ONE WORD to me, not hello, not how was your stay, not ONE WORD....just handed me my bill and walked away. NICE. I really don't know what has happened to the Ritz lately, perhaps it was the buyout from Marriott?

The concierge/guest services personnel were exceptional. We booked a suite which worked well for the three of us as it had one and a half baths. One of us had to sleep on the sofa bed, which she swore was comfortable but I am not so sure - she told me that there was a significant extra charge for a rollaway bed, which is why we didn't get one (and which seems like a unfair extra charge - even regular Marriotts don't charge, and this is their luxury brand) . The room was spacious, the bed super comfy. Service was, as I said, very solicitous. The spa is pretty small, but adequate and the services were good, but nothing special. The pool is nice, but no view, and the pool staff were very attentive. One thing I should point out is that this hotel is about ten or fifteen minutes drive to Miami beach and South Beach, so don't stay here if you want a beach front location, or even one that is in very close proximity. It is in about a five or ten minute walk to all the shopping streets of Coconut Grove, lots of little shoppies and restaurants, nothing very special really.

I called back the next day and made the same request to the same person who this time had it taken care of and apologized it wasn't handled the previous day. You'd think they would be making the effort to keep these things stocked with the profit margin they have on the items stocked. 3) The final day we were there, they were \"testing\" the fire alarm system. We were given plenty of notice of this, but the problem was it literally went on for hours. Hours of flashing lights, warning voices, and noise. It seems like they could have taken care of this in much less time than several hours. It really was quite a distraction to our meeting. The only complaints I heard from my fellow group members were about the showers, which apparently leaked water all over the floor. In my shower, the caulking was completely stripped off one side, but these things happen and I'm sure someone caught it soon thereafter. My door lock was broken which I didn't mention to anyone, but on the second day I was there, a maintainence person knocked on the door and took care of it.
