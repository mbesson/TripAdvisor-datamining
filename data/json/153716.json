If you are arriving late at night or leaving early in the morning, it can be a good option. The hotel itself is located near the main food court with a direct elevator to the hotel lobby. The hotel itself is old and the rooms feel a bit shabby. They are gradually updating the rooms and the quality is generally improving. However, it does not compare well to hotels in the city at this price range (Mexico City has some very nice hotels!). However the rooms are clean and everything works. The internet is better than average for Mexico City, in my opinion. The staff is very friendly and accomodating. The food is not particularly good. Personally, I just go down in the elevator to the food level which has a large variety of fast food and sit down restaurants, plus a variety of stores. I have probably stayed here around twenty times and will continue to stay here as necessary. Please note that this hotel is in Terminal One. If you are taking a flight from Terminal Two (mostly AeroMexico and other Sky Team carriers), you will need a ticket or boarding pass to take the train between the two terminals and the guards are strict about not letting people without proper tickets.

Very convenient for early morning flights especially. The staff were generally pleasant and helpful but other than the location and staff, this really is a motel 6 or the like quality hotel/motel.

The mattresses and bedding looked like they had been recently replaced and were fairly comfortable. Worst of all was the smell. Mexico City can often smell bad but generally it is fairly mild, you get used to it and don't notice after a while (like in Venice). In this case, it smelled like there was an open sewage plant beside the hotel. If you had the air conditioning going full blast and the rooms consequently an icebox, the filtering seemed to block most of the smell. but we had to shut off the air conditioning because it was below 60 degrees in our room and our daughters were freezing. the smell was so bad it made me gag and woke me up throughout the night. Between the smell and disgusting state of the room, I hardly slept and was more than happy to leave at 5 am. This was definitely the worst Hilton I have ever stayed in (at any brand level).

I arrived in the newer Terminal 2 but the hotel is in Terminal 1. There are no information booths and you're lucky if you can find someone knowledgeable to speak English. We actually followed the signage to NM hotel in terminal 1 then figured out you had to take the \"airbus\" to Terminal 1 - not a short distance either. A ten minute ride to the other terminal and the \"airbus\" only runs every 15minutes or so. The \"airbus\" is a monorail and the entrance is in a secure area where you need to show a boarding pass or your hotel confirmation. NOTE: we only had 1 bag each and a carry-on - if you have lots of bags that you can't manage yourself it would be difficult to go to this hotel. I heard from a business traveler that the baggage people can only get your bags to the secure area of the monorail and then you have to drag your bags up the small ramp and onto the monorail. Baggage handlers were again at Terminal 1 once you exited the \"airbus\". Hilton lobby was modern feel with grand player piano in lobby bar and the staff was very cordial dressed in suits/ties and very professional. We didn't receive the upgrade to a king bed as they were fully occupied and double beds are very small. We actually slept separtely to have more room. I liked the Crabtree and Evelyn products in the baths. I used 30K hilton pts and as Gold member had brkfst included. I think the room would have run around $155USD and breakfast 253pesos pp. We did have an issue with the HVAC not cooling and they resolved within minutes of phoning the front desk by sending an engineer to punch in some code so that the temperature was actually what it said it was on the digital read-out. Zero noise level from the planes. the walls are concrete and we didn't hear any people noise except some doors closing loudly in the early a.m. Comfortable beds and pillows. We arrived at 3pm and after checking in walked the Terminal 1. There is a lot of activity, small shops, people, money exchanges, banks, food kiosks and a few nicer restaurants. We also checked out the Camino Real to see if it was better and I didn't get the impressions it was any nicer than the Hilton. In fact it looked a bit more tired with a less appealing common area. AT Terminal 1 I must recommend Casa Avilla Mediterrean restaurant. We had a lovely bottle of red wine, fish dinner, white linen service, all male staff and mostly male business people at the time we visited. However, to my surprise a Mariache band came through and we had them play a song - then the couple next to us, sponsored 2 songs of my choice and it was lovely and romantic. At the Hilton they had a complimentary fruit drink at check-in which was a nice touch. Hilton airport breakfast was excellent a definate 5+. Waiters were dressed in tux shirts and vests. The kitchen staff which popped out every once in awhile were in jumpsuits that looked like green color hazmet suits. So I got the impression that it was a very clean well managed kitchen. Beautiful dishes and presentation on buffet bar. Cheeses, cereals, smoked salmon, papaya,figs, various fruites, nuts, omelets to order, pancakes, extra crispy bacon, potatoes, 3 different juices, excellent coffee...everything you could want to start your day.

After spending several weeks in paradise where you are constantly exposed to fresh air and can sleep with your windows open this can be a shock to the body. This building is part of the airport and it is like being in a cube. Around 6 am you hear the roar of the planes, the sounds of showers in other rooms, and the sound of doors slamming as people are leaving. The air seemed stale and I could not wait to get out. The carpets appeared worn and dated and this is the first hotel I have seen in Mexico that has carpets. I had to get outside to get some fresh air which was taxi fumes and airport fumes. There is no place to go for a walk and relax. The only positive was the comfy bed, but sleep wasn't great because of slamming doors throughout the night and the stale air. The morning buffet was good but overpriced. The service was fine and staff were welcoming and pleasant. I was glad to get out of this bubble and on a plane. If you are traveling and need to stay in Mexico City for air line connections you may want to consider what is important to your physical and mental comfort.

There were 3 adults, two teenagers and my 10 month old baby in our party. Our connecting flight required us to overnight in Mexico City, so I booked and prepaid for 2 rooms for Jan 23rd through Hotels.ca. We arrived around 12:30am and were due to fly out at 7:25am in the morning. I had booked this hotel mainly because of its location right in the airport and because In general I have always had good experiences with Hilton (I used to stay frequently with them) . They assigned us rooms 203 and 207. Just as an FYI, both rooms are very small and while they have windows, there is no view of anything but a bamboo backdrop. I was not upset about this given we were spending such a short time there, but if you are claustrophobic, you may want to ask for a different view. In my room (207) the bathroom lights and TV were not functioning. We thought we could live with that given our short stay. Soon after we settled in, however, we noticed there was some sort of random banging (which ended up going on for the entire time we were there). The final straw, however, came at 4am, when an overpowering smell of raw sewage woke us up. It was still there when we checked out at 5:30am. My friend said the same banging and smell was in her room as well. On the plus side, the girl at the front desk was extremely nice and had us checked in very quickly. While a bit of a moot point, we did receive the automated wake up calls as promised (not always the case in Mexico) and the same girl even called us personally several minutes later to make sure we really were up. I have written about this experience to both Hilton and to Hotels.ca as I have have 2 upcoming prepaid bookings at the same hotel for a night on either end of an upcoming trip to Spain in February. I am concerned that one of the reasons we were assigned these rooms was because we had prepaid (non-refundable) through Hotels.ca and so Hilton felt as though they could stick us in the worst rooms...

The staff is friendly and willing to help and the beds are really comfortable. The heat works fine and there are TV Channels in English. To me, it's better to stay here than to get stuck on the Periferico in traffic, wondering if you're going to make your flight or be trying to get around in Mexico City at 4 a.m. Do keep in mind that there is a new airport terminal in the Mexico City airport so there are now TWO terminals and the hotel is in the older terminal. The hotel is located in what is called the \"International\" terminal, but we were flying internationally to the U.S. and went out from the new terminal. I don't know why and didn't ask anyone so I'm not sure what I'm missing there. But, should this happen to you, just know that the new terminal is NOT right next door to the old terminal. You can't walk there. You have to either take the tram, shuttle or a taxi and it's about a 5-minute ride on the tram. You can walk to the tram from the hotel and it's about a 5 minute walk inside the airport, but the hotel bellboys can only take you so far due to union rules (we were told) so think about this if you have a lot of bags. There is also a limit to the number of bags you can take on the tram and there is security at the entrance checking on that. The front desk at this Hilton should familarize themselves with the policy a little better also. Everyone knew there was a limit to the number of bags but no one knew what the number was. Also everyone had a different opinion on what was the best way to get to the other terminal so they should really all be better briefed on that. Considering that we would have had to get up at 3 a.m. and drive to the airport if we didn't stay at this hotel, I am pretty happy that it was there. If you are traveling with an infant I would recommend trying to bring your own pack-n-play. They do have portable cribs but I don't think they would pass the safety standards in the U.S. One of the other reviewers below had mentioned another hotel that is connected to the airport.

The staff is wonderful and is able to help with any request. Rooms are a bit small, however I had a king bed, desk and chair in mine with room to move around. The bathrooms were CLEAN and NICE!

Great business center with two computers and wireless connection available throughout the hotel. (no wired ports in the room) If you are here for a week as I was I would recommend booking a room with the breakfast buffet! It is great and custom order. If you want anything else just take the elevator down to the main hall and you have a mini city with everything you could imagine to eat. Local to American! You have it here! Workout facility is clean and nice. The only downfall I found was with the smoke of the airport. I stayed in a non-smoking room however there are no real smoking laws in Mexico City. Although the room was smoke free smoke comes in from the main airport check-in and the lobby. I don't think there is much the Hilton can do about this. This is the first hotel I have stayed in that I did not want to rip the comforter off the bed when I arrived! It was spotless! Room comes with a small electronic safe in the closet that is great for the passport and cash, however if you have a laptop, don't plan on leaving it at the hotel.

Most imporant: I have NEVER experienced a bad smell! My room smelled perfectly fresh each time. Upon check in I was handed a card-key within seconds of giving them my name - with absolutely no paperwork or anything. I went straight to my room. The first time it was slightly far, no big deal, and faced the inside. This was unique, actually looking down on people walking to their gates. Dead silent, though. The second time my room was 103, facing the outside, but right by the lobby. This was noisy, so I asked for a room further away, and was handed another card-key within seconds. This room, I believe to the left, was still close, and faced the outside. Planes taking off right outside my window. Slight noise, but not a problem (good windows), and still unique. The room was like every other Hilton I have ever been in. Some rooms, though, are larger than others, but absolutely comfortable in every way. I prefer rooms with character in old colonial hotels, but for one night before my 7:20 am flight back to the U.S., it was great! That's the key point. You are in the airport, minutes from check in. I went down early (4am - but I'm a bit nuts), checked in, and went back to my room for coffee. Most unique, you are right in the airport. To really appreciate it, you must see Tom Hank's film, The Terminal. When you step out of the elevator in the hotel lobby, you are in the middle of the restaurant area. Strange place to spend the evening. There are buses directly from and to the airport from a number of cities. I always go directly to Puebla or Queretaro, and directly back.
