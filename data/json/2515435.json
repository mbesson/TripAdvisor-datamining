This hotel felt luxurious, extremely well kept, the staff was very pleasant, helpful and welcoming, and the breakfast area was big in size and had a wonderful selection. The room was also top notch with all the upgrades. The hotel is not downtown, but its location is very easy to hop on the interstate and within 10-15 minutes you can be downtown or to La Jolla or Torrey Pines. Highly recommend this hotel!

It makes for an odd mix of guests. During our stay there were a couple of seminars or courses going on in the meeting areas, so the lobby was typically quite busy. That said, parking was never an issue over the 6 days we were there. The staff were very friendly and helpful whenever we had questions or requests. The weather wasn't the greatest when we were there, so no comment on the pool. Wi-fi was free and generally worked well, although they did have a system issue the morning we left. The location is fairly central to many attractions in the San Diego area. We found that we were about 25 min from Carlsbad/Oceanside, and 15 min from Downtown/Balboa park. 10-15 min to La Jolla. About 5 mins east of the hotel there are a couple of shopping centres with decent restaurant options and places to get provisions. It's close to Miramar, so we often saw and heard military aircraft, although the noise didn't interfere with sleeping at all. The rooms are basic but clean, roomy and comfortable, easily meeting the expectations of the star level of the property. In my opinion, they represent good value. Our room had a small fridge, a microwave, and a mini coffee maker. The breakfast buffet is more than a continental, and the offerings rotated throughout our multi-night stay. There were often eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, etc. There's also a waffle maker that is a high-demand item. The food quality is decent but not fantastic, but seeing as it's included in the stay I thought it was excellent value. They also have a little refreshment stand by the front desk, which was nice to grab a drink or fruit/cookie on the way in or out. *note* - management actively solicits Trip Advisor feedback via email after your stay, even noting that they've targeted you because you have gave good review to their internal survey they send out via multiple emails post-stay.

THE HOTEL: Like I mentioned above there is FREE parking and there is a lot of it! The outside of the hotel could get a paint job but nothing serious. The lobby is nice and the staff is nice and friendly. THE ROOM: The beds are SO COMFORTABLE!!! We've stayed in a regular king room (I believe it's called the Deluxe King) and have stayed in the King 1 bedroom suite. Both are really nice! The deluxe king room has a super comfortable bed, nice sized flat screen, desk, desk chair and an armchair. The dresser has a mini fridge and a microwave and there's also a coffee maker. The bathroom is pretty nice too...there is a timed heater lamp in there! The 1 bedroom king suite is nice too. There is a separate living area with a queen pull out sofa. There is an armchair, desk, flat screen tv, mini fridge, microwave and coffeemaker. The bedroom has the king bed (again super comfortable), dresser, flat screen and another armchair. The bathroom is the same. FREE WIFI!! FREE BREAKFAST: Their breakfast is so good!!!! The food they have ranges from day to day but they usually have eggs, cereal, DIY waffles, coffee, water and juice. They've also had hash browns, country potatoes and corn beef hash. The breakfast alone was enough to make us come back. All in all it is a great hotel and we will continue to book rooms here when we come to San Diego.

We had stayed in one of Carlson's CI&S's in the Minneaplis area a few months ago and they treated us very well so this seemed like the right place.

We had a loose connection on our main TV and within 3 minutes someone was by to fix it. He too was extremely up-beat and pleasant.

Finding the hotel is easy, it is surrounded by other hotels, at least one chain restaurant and business centers. Parking s easy, check in might have been the speediest ever. The rooms are of a very good size, nicely appointed and clean. The same goes for the bathroom, which left a very good impression. There was an AC unit outside our window which came to life every once in a while and rustled for a few minutes, but otherwise it was very quiet. The free WiFi worked great.

We had forgotten a laptop charger at the hotel and I called them to days after - I was not actually expecting much of a chance since often hotels are not overly interested in helping in these matters and was very surprised by the positive reactions of the staff - they called me back as promised, found the charger and shipped it. Very nice and unexpected - a big thumbs up! Positive: - Room (esp. bathroom) I would not have expected - they simply lacked the 'cheapishness' often found in non-luxury chain hotels. We felt very comfortable and had none of the \"better not touch that\" feelings one often encounters. - Breakfast - this was an actual breakfast and a good start in the day. - Staff and Service: Every encounter was very friendly and helpful. - Free parking, Wireless and breakfast. Negative: - Cannot find anything negative that would be worth pointing out - obviously it is not a 5 star property, but a very nice and clean 3 star hotel.

Very disappointed with this experience. Thankfully we were staying for one night only. The breakfast was good and plentiful and the parking free, besides that I cant think of anything good about this hotel. Definitely would not stay here again.", "Date": "June 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cWe loved it!\u201d", "Author": "Lissete", "ReviewID": "UR7489441", "Content": "This hotel is away from the main tourist spots but just about 15 minutes to everything by car. The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. They supply two water bottles each day for free, plus coffee & coffee maker in room. They also have free cookies & fruit at the front desk in the afternoon. The free breakfast in the morning is fantastic with a wide variety of food items as described in other posts. The staff is great and always ready to help. One warning though. We arrived late and they only had smoking rooms left. I was told that if I wanted to switch rooms the next day to just let them know. Our room did not really smell like a smoking room, so we decided to not go through the trouble of switching. The problem came when the people moved in to the room next door (7th fl is the smoking floor). Can you say Chimeneys? PLUS they would leave their door open so they could share the cancer with the rest of us! This is not a complaint against the hotel, just the other rude guests.", "Date": "May 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palmdale, CA", "Title": "\u201cI loved my stay at the Country Inn & Suites San Diego\u201d", "Author": "sulitster", "ReviewID": "UR7380232", "Content": "This hotel chain is probably the best kept secret out there. Their service is wonderful. Employees always smiling making you feel at home. I stayed at this hotel with family and all of us enjoyed their fantastic service. The great things about this hotel is the free hot breakfast, free internet access in the rooms and a computer terminal by the elevators for those without laptop, the free parking and the heated outdoor pool that is wonderful after a long day sightseeing or work for those business travellers. The hotel is not really convenient to attractions but if you have a car, then this is a minor inconvenience as downtown is only 14 miles away! The hotel is located off the 805 fwy and is close to many dining and entertainment facilities that can be reached by traveling east about 4 miles on Mira Mesa Blvd. For those who like to get to a mall there is the University Towne Center or UTC that is 4 miles south via the 805 fwy. I defintely recommend this hotel to everyone and will definitely stay here again.", "Date": "April 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel in Sorrento Mesa Area\u201d", "Author": "CMH-JFK", "ReviewID": "UR7231719", "Content": "I am very happy with the Country Inn and Suites. I got the room by booking on priceline for only $60 a night for one week at the end of March. On the outside, the hotel doesn't look like it will be as nice as it really is. When you walk in the lobby you are welcomed with a warm fireplace. The lobby area is just very upscale feeling. When we got to our room it definitely didn't disappoint us. It was a King non-smoking room. We got a rollaway since there were no two bed rooms available. We found out that the bottled water in the room is free. There is also free wi-fi and it had a strong connection. There is room service and a bar downstairs but we didn't use these amenities. The breakfast was free and consisted of waffles, eggs, bacon, juice, toast, cereal, yogurt, etc. It was definitely one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. Also, in the morning there is a USA Today newspaper delivered to your room door. In the evening there are free cookies at the front desk and they are very good. We didn't use the pool since it was too cool out but it did look very nice. With free parking and all the free amenities, this room was a GREAT value!", "Date": "March 27, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Country Inn & Suites By Carlson, San Diego North", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d80735-Reviews-Country_Inn_Suites_By_Carlson_San_Diego_North-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$123 - $194*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">5975 Lusk Blvd</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92121-2781</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515435", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/8f/17/8f17e70eb932d85b468c3f1eff2b8bdb5large.jpg"}}
