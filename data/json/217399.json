However, now that I'm here, I can say that my worries were unfounded. The front desk staff have been friendly and helpful. The room is as expected in an extended stay property, and is clean and in good shape. I have a non-smoking room, but noticed a cigarette smell in the bathroom. The smell seemed to be coming from an unused vent in the ceiling, so I covered it and the smell stopped. The cable has a good selection of stations, including Fox and ABC, which a previous reviewer said they didn't have. I needed extra hangers and a staff member was kind enough to deliver an extra dozen immediately to my room. They have high-speed WIFI for a small one-time fee and I've had no problems with it. Although some reviewers have complained about the noise from planes coming into Miami Airport, not many actually fly above the hotel. If you have on the AC/heating unit, you rarely hear anything from outside the room. I'm in a second-floor room away from 87th Ave, a busy street, so I don't get any street noise. There is street construction going on in front of the hotel and the trucks stage next to it, so there is some noise from those trucks, but not usually before 7am. I love having the park next door! It's easily accessed from the hotel and provides a nice place to walk in the mornings, with a 1-mile paved path around a small lake. There are a few restaurants within walking distance, but you have to stay on the west side of 87th, as there are no crosswalks for some distance in either direction of the hotel. Tony Roma's is next door, Mondongo's a half-block away, and a strip center with Dunkin' Donuts, Quizno's, etc. is on the other side of the park. There are quite a few eateries up and down 87th, as well.", "Date": "February 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "bahamas", "Title": "\u201cI loved my homestead experience\u201d", "Author": "nappyhappy", "ReviewID": "UR93247921", "Content": "I had planned to stay at Homestead - Blue Lagoon, but accidently booked Homestead Doral.

The property is close to the highway and I expected some noise but it was really quiet (I slept with the ac unit off).

After the location of my first hotel, I was pleasantly surprised by the exterior and location. It is right next to a park, with a path for running. It is also a 10 minute walk from USSOUTHCOM, and there is a Tony Roma's right across the street. The check in person was rude and harried. Wasn't very impressed. The front desk is only open from 7am until 11pm, so good luck if you get locked out. The room was basic, no extra amenities. Even though it has a kitchenette, they provide one pot, limited utensils, plates, and cups. The cleanliness of the place was dubious...I went out and bought a bottle of Clorox spray. Taking a shower, the tub was clogged, so I would be standing in 3 inches of water. The bed was hard and the linens old, with a dirty bedspread and gross velux blanket. Very few TV channels; while it had Showtime, it didn't have basics such as FOX or ABC. The other people that inhabited the building were not people that I would keep company with. While I requested (and got) a non-smoking room, people would smoke out in the balconies. They were loud, blaring music and fighting at all hours of the night. One of the key things to remember at this place (and other hotels in the Extended Stay chain) cuts costs by having your room cleaned once a week. If you need it cleaned outside of your one time, it's a fee of at least $10. This hotel is also right near the landing path of the airport, so the noise from the planes is considerable, but not unbearable. There was no fitness center onsite, but you could get free passes to the Bally's that was about 2 miles away.", "Date": "April 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201ca lot of noise from airplanes and cars\u201d", "Author": "lamakacha", "ReviewID": "UR53906636", "Content": "this hotel is right under the path of the airplanes coming and going to Miami Intern. Airport. Every single plane is a LOT of noise. It's a never stopping noise. Terrible!!! And not only the planes. Small trucks and big trucks too. Looks like it's a popular place for these trucks. They come any time of day, and of course with a noise. Another ugly thing: there is a field across from the hotel, where a really big and ugly trucks can park. This particular truck made a lot and a lot of noise early in the morning, and also produced huge huge fumes warming up the engine. The window in our room we kept open all the time, so the fumes filled our room...UGLY! Saturday, around 2am, a big family came, carrying a lot of luggage and making a lot of noise. Their room was right beside ours. So, we couldn't sleep for at least two hours, because they went somewhere and came back in 20 minutes with more luggage. The hotel is like a motel - two floors. If you're on the first floor, then you're a victim of some people on the phone who decide to speak outside for an hour, and you have to listen to everything they talk...very very annoying. Advise: if you like to be in quite, to really enjoy and rest, this is the last place to be. For families, it maybe ok. For business and just for relaxation - BIG NO NO ! On the other hand, room cleaning is Mondays for those who stay more than 3 nights. The service is very good. The place is clean, looks beautiful. It's possible to relax and rest, only at the certain times, when there are no flights. And the flights are as usual 4 times a day: 6am-8am, 12pm-2pm, 4pm-7pm, 11pm-12am.

I wound up staying here about a week. The night deskman was extremely rude and also would not give me a non-smoking room. He claimed there was nothing else available. There were also other guests at the front complaining of their smoking rooms when I checked in, but I thought it couldnt be that bad. When I got to the room, it smelled like the inside of an ashtray, the smoke smell was so strong I went to Walgreens at night after traveling all day just to buy Lysol and a Glade Plug In. After hours of trying to get settled in and sleep, this did not work. I called the front desk and requested another room, they still claimed nothing was available. At 3am my eyes were red and nose runny and throat itchy!!!! I had to call the front desk and threaten that I would have my CC company remove the charges because I literally couldn't breath or sleep and I would have to relocate to another hotel. I have had to stay in other smoking rooms before but this one was EXTREMELY bad. Not even opening the windows helped. I went to the front desk to get the keys for another room (suddenly there was availability), and the night deskman attempted to scold me like a child on how when I make a reservation I need to reserve a non-smoking room in advance. I was in disbelief!!! He was neither apologetic or even decent. He was upset that I had interrupted him at 3AM. I was the one moving my things in the middle of the night to the other side of the hotel with red eyes and a runny nose. This was the worse customer service I have ever received at a hotel in my life, and I'm a frequent business traveler. I would expect more from one of those \"charge by the hour\" roach motels. Needless to say, after that night I made it so I never had to go to the desk at night, and the women that were at the desk in the morning were extremely nice and helpful in every way possible. Also, the room that I was moved to was very decent and clean with a separate bedroom/living room. It had one of those motel smells, but this was a million times better than the previous room I had. The pool was small and very nice, especially in comparison to the hotel next door. There was hardly anyone at the pool. Next door there is a Sleep Inn and the pool was always full of families all day and night. There is also a BBQ grill at the pool with tables where you can cook and eat. The workout room was too warm and closet sized with only 2 machines. Luckily, I ran at the park down the street instead. Behind the hotel, about a block away, there is a very nice neighborhood park with lots of runners, golfers, bikers. It's surprising because you can't see any of this from the street, it all seems industrial and a bit ghetto looking from the main road, but if you walk down the street there are nice houses. The breakfast was comical. EVERYTHING was frozen and I would get to breakfast when it was ending everyday and the items were still frozen around 9am. There were frozen pancakes, english muffins, bagles, and bread etc., all hard as a rock. There was a toaster, but you had to microwave the breads before toasting them LOL. They literally had ice frozen on top of them as if they'd been in the freezer for weeks/months. There were 3 choices for cold cereal, and as I recall no fruit because I don't remember ever eating any and that would normally be my breakfast choice. There was orange juice and I believe apple juice also. Also microwave oatmeal. It was laughable, but at least they had something I guess. There were restaurants in the immediate area such as McDonalds, Taco Bell, a dine-in Pizza hut with salad bar(walking distance) and an IHOP (walking distance). I would only recommend this hotel for business travelers or people trying to save money with a family. I got an amazing deal on Priceline for this hotel. I would definitely stay here again but only at a severely discounted rate. Also, again, the desk manager on the night of my check-in, should not be in the hospitatlity business, PERIOD.

This place is not your average hotel. This hotel is substandard! They did have an airport shuttle but the driver couldn't speak english and I thought the old van they picked me up in wouldn't make it back to the hotel in one piece. The batteries in the tv remote were dead and corroding in the remote. The shelf in the closet was falling out of the wall. The place was noisy with the other residents blasting music in the parking lot from their car stereos. At night, some of the other residents were still blasting latino music from their room after 11pm. I called the front desk to complain and an answering machine answered and advised that the front desk was closed for the night. Apparently it's not manned overnight. It did give me the option of pushing 1 to be transferred to a person. I did so and the person who answered advised that no personnel was on site overnight. She said that if I could tell her which room the music was coming from, she'd call them by telephone and ask them to turn it down. I calmly explained to her that I was in bed for the night, not dressed, and wasn't going to walk the hotel to find out which room it was. Keep in mind this is an open air hotel where your room door opens to the outside parking lot. Not the safest of all the set-ups. Don't let your women stay here alone!

SECOND - we had a situation with our credit card - and the hotel's way of dealing with the situation was to lock our room in our absence.
