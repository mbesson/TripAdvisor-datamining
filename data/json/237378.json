It makes your stay very different, and I don't think I'd do it again. I love Venice so much that I want to be there and feel it. I want to wake up to the sound of church bells and the traffic of canals and people going to work etc. I want to end the day walking around the narrow streets and hear my heels clicking in the night. That said, the Lido is an experience. This hotel is quietly sited and is near to the vaporetto stop without being able to hear them all night. However, during the week we were there, a party of teenagers + teachers arrived and the place took on the feel of a youth hostel. There was running in corridors, slamming doors, screeching girls and shouting out of the bedroom windows. Not really what I wanted on my holiday.This hotel is obviously proud of its Trip Advisor rating as it is displayed in reception.If they want to keep it they have to function as a hotel not a youth hostel.

Our room did not resemble any of the photographs on the website. It was tiny... just larger than the size of the double bed! To make matters worse, the available space was not used well. The bedside tables were round and as they already had lamps on, there was no room to put anything else and the wardrobe was spacious but only had about 5 hangers in and no shelves to put anything. With no drawers or space under the bed to put our cases, we were constantly tripping over things! Had I known this I would have definitely upgraded to a superior room because it wasn't much more at the time of booking. Although the bed was comfortable the pillows felt like we were sleeping on bags of cement and we couldn't seem to cool the room down. Despite it being October and quite cool outside, the only way we could cool the room down was to open the window as it was so small and stuffy and the 'air conditioning' controls did not seem to work. Plus there are air vents from each room into the corridor which meant that we could hear noises from the corridor and the other rooms near ours really clearly, so we felt like we had to whisper all the time and turn the volume on the TV down really quietly! That aside, the room was smart and clean and the bathroom was modern. The breakfast was basic but nice enough; cereal, bread, meat, cheese, yoghurt, tinned fruit. The staff were pleasant and polite and most of them spoke good English. The hotel is located in a quiet area but only about 5 mins from the vaporetto stop, which takes you straight to St Mark's Square or Burano. There are plenty of bars, cafes and restaurants within easy walking distance of the hotel too. I had read not to expect too much for Venice hotels which is why we chose to stay on the Lido. Although the room was cheaper than many in Venice itself, it was not cheap and not worth what we paid. That said, we had a fantastic holiday. Venice is a truly unique and wonderful place.

Make sure you visit the glass making island of murano and the really pretty island of burano (google it!) which has all the houses painted different colours.

Located on the Lido di Venezia, a 10 minute Vaporetto ride from the main island, the hotel is set in a quiet location just off the main through road, a 5 minute walk from the Vaporetto & bus station. Check-in was straight forward & friendly; although other reception staff seemed rather officious during the stay. The room d\u00c3\u00a9cor was actually to a higher standard then initially expected, finished with cushioned satin fabric walls and colour coded bedding & curtains presenting an almost boutique feel. The small en-suite wet room was basic but reasonably well finished. That said, there were certain aspects (wardrobe & bathroom doorframe) that appeared well used & worn or just unfinished. The bed, while a good size & equipped with soft quality sheets & blankets, was far too hard for comfortable sleep. Admittedly, while firmness is down to personal preference (I actually don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind firm but well sprung), this was the extreme! You could actually bounce a coin on it, no problems! As per other reviews, noise from adjacent rooms and other guests (especially during the evening & at night) is a significant problem here. Doors are often slammed closed and conversations from other guests seem to reverberate around the stairwells and hallways. Typically, most travellers go to Venice to see the sights, enjoy the ambience & hopefully get some good weather. Fresh air plus \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclots\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of walking equals sleep. However, my sleep was all too frequently interrupted by the noise level. So be warned! Unfortunately, the rooms have do not have tea or coffee facilities, so no refreshments unless you buy them yourself. However, there is a Billa supermarket just round the corner with all regular priced products. Nor is there an iron in the room (or hotel for that matter), so those travelling light will have to make do with some creases. Again, as mentioned by others, the offerings presented at breakfast are woefully inadequate. Rest assured, I state this not hoping for a full cooked breakfast, but having travelled extensively through many other European countries, there are minimum expectations! A single croissant and bread roll were waiter served (per guest) when seated, with the rolls being so stale they resembled rocks! All other food offerings were presented on a trite and characterless buffet comprising sliced meat (just 2 types), sliced cheese (cheddar only), hard boiled eggs, tinned peaches & pears, a couple types of dried cereal, yoghurt, some packet biscuits and a selection of teas. The so called machine dispensed fruit juice looked & tasted truly awful, worse than a budget fruit cordial. The breakfast alone really lets down the whole establishment. The only positive each morning was the different types of freshly made coffee available, again made to order. As the hotel is only B&B (promptly reminded by staff as you check-in), evenings were spent trekking round local restaurants on the main strip between the Vaporetto station and the beach. Perhaps a cross-over review, but still relevant here. I challenge you to spot any differences in the presented menus? Seriously, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all identical bar the price. Most of the so called authentic dishes knocked up in the Mom & Pop pseudo restaurants are for the tourist trade tasting bland & insipid. Service is often below par favouring the Italian clientele but still expecting a worthy gratuity! Best value tip is to actually opt for the fresh pizza, cheap @ 6-8E & well flavoured. For much improved dining, head back over to the main island & scout around for a decent restaurant, yes there are some! Avoid the tourist traps, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay over the odds & you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find some great food & genuinely friendly service. Try Caff\u00c3\u00a9 Ristorante Canel Grande by the Rialto Bridge for the fresh lobster, highly recommended. Overall impression: Accommodation is comfortable with a reasonable degree of quality, certainly enough as a base to explore from. Some may say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too far from the main city, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in a much quieter location and exceptional value for money despite the negatives.", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAn oasis of calm near a crowded jewel box\u201d", "Author": "BillSeldon", "ReviewID": "UR86730285", "Content": "Venice is horribly crowded for most of the year, so the Lido offers a quiet location within easy reach of the city by vaporetto.
