We had a great stay here as usual! However, we did end up leaving 1 night early as we had a storm that knocked out the power at the Baldknobbers. They had no idea what the problem was or when it would be fixed! It was dark and VERY hot in our room and we knew we wouldn't be able to sleep, especially with a young child, so we just packed up (in the dark!) and left. I understand that this wasn't their fault, but they couldn't even provide us with any flashlights or candles to use so that we could just be able to see to use the bathroom! That is why I did not give them a 5 star rating. Not to mention that the manager couldn't even say she was sorry or even goodbye! I really felt, even though it was our choice to leave, that we should have been offered our money back for one nights stay.", "Date": "August 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Louis", "Title": "\u201cAffordable and Clean\u201d", "Author": "melz32", "ReviewID": "UR135004154", "Content": "We stayed one night on the way back from Arkansas.
