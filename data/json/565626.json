The room however, was about the worst hotel room I have ever seen. There was a huge wet spot in the comforter, my feet got black from walking across the carpet, and did I mention the 2 condom wrappers and the pill we found behind the night stand. This was seriously awful. For 20$ more we got a room at the laquinta on the other side of the interstate. Why is this dump still in business?", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Elkhart, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cOld and filthy\u201d", "Author": "Pickyonejustme", "ReviewID": "UR126457655", "Content": "I didn't stay here by choice. The \"nicer hotel\" next door where I originally booked my reservation was unable to accommodate me the first night of my stay (long and different story) due to a large group who did not check out that day. So they comped my room and put me in this place for one night on their dime. After 9pm, you cannot access the lobby and must use a small foyer with a night window in it to conduct business with the staff member. I will say she was very friendly and accommodating though. I knew I was going to be dissapointed in my stay when I observed about 20 semi trucks parked in the lot. Nothing against truckers but it gages, in my mind, the caliber of the establishment. On my way to the room, there were numerous bystanders hanging around in the shadows outside, which if I wasn't fully capable of protecting myself, might have me a bit concerned about safety. Of course my hunch was correct when I walked into the drab, extremely sparse and EXTREMELY dirty room. Carpet was absolutely filthy, the beds were old and uninviting, sheets had cigarette burns, pillows were dingy and flat, the dresser was worn out and badly weathered, the door had gaps all around it and was covered in dirty stains. The toilet had obviously not been cleaned as there were splatters of (yep, brown remnants) from the previous guest. Fortunately, I did not have to get close enough to that to concern myself during this very short night. The towels were a very unappealing shade of dirty white. The only good thing I can say about the room is the shower water pressure is excellent, but fine tuning the temperature is a challenge. If I had paid for this room, I would have asked for my money back and stayed elsewhere. As it was, I had got there late and this was my choice on someone elses dime. I just wanted to get some sleep and get out of there.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lethbridge, Alberta", "Title": "\u201cDirty\u201d", "Author": "JMargey", "ReviewID": "UR126113086", "Content": "Bathroom gross, flitters everywhere, flying around.

The other two times I was here the truck lot was full, tonight it'll be about 1/4 full. As empty as it is, they say the only room they have is on the 3rd floor, no elevator on-site, not an issue for me but could be for some. Room would somewhere between a Super 8 and a Motel 6. Clean, but aging. Free WiFi. Today it was still 75 degrees at 8 PM in mid December and someone was using the outdoor pool, but not I. There is a shuttle and driver but I've never asked where/how far they will take people. (I just looked at their website and it says five miles, so that does NOT include the airport which is 12 miles). travelersinn-phoenix.com IHOP, Carl Jrs, one other in same parking lot.

Though the property looks ok, and does have a nice pool area, there are other problems. The most important, is location. There are a LOT of bums and \"ladies of the night\" lately, and though the establishment provides a security guard, why would you stay at a place that requires one? More times than none, when you go from your room to your car, or to a nearby fast food place, you will be approached by questionable people, such as a street bum or local con-artist. The fact of the matter is, there are a lot of truckers in the area, and people needing money seem to gravitate to the area as well. The rooms do NOT have the usual amenities, such as shampoo, coffee maker, microwave, or clock radio, but they do have a 19\" TV.
