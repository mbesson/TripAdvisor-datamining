I only hope that they change out the windows to dual pane glass to cut down on the street noise. The rooms were clean and well appointed. They have an in room safe and refrigerator. Stop by the local mini market to get water as the hotel charges $2 a bottle. The Starbucks around the corner from the hotel is great for a small breakfast at a reasonable price. $20 for four of us.

We saw the rooms gradually get more and more dingy to the point where we no longer stayed here, but we came back when they started upgrading and remodeling. The location is wonderful, especially if you appreciate being right next door to Little Tokyo, with its Japanese markets, restaurants, and the Kinokuniya Bookstore. Many Japanese guests stay in the hotel, and the breakfast buffet has a couple of (so so) Japanese dishes. We are hoping that the Hilton chain will have sense enough not to destroy the unique Japanese flavor of this hotel. (Are they really going to call it the \"Doubletree by Hilton\" and let it go at that?) The hotel is also within easy walking distance (10-15 minutes) of the Disney Concert Hall, the LA City Hall, Olvera Street, the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, Los Angeles Union Station, the discount stores of the Garment District and Toy Districts, and the Japanese American National Museum. Freeway access is also excellent. We were disappointed in the buffet breakfast in the Azalea Restaurant. If the food was any good, then the $18 price might be acceptable, but it is very mediocre quality and showed a general lack of care in preparation. The way-overcooked scrambled eggs and the tasteless, soggy (even when freshly put out!) potatoes were especially nasty. Unfortunately it was too expensive to put together an interesting breakfast from the a la carte menu. The only sensible choice for us was the American Breakfast (eggs, potatoes, meat, toast, juice and coffee/tea) at $12, which is actually quite good and which of course benefits from being cooked to order. I complained about the buffet breakfast when I stayed here last November and the manager wrote me back that they were planning to improve it, but I didn't see any change on our current trip. Those potatoes are REALLY AWFUL! We found the hotel and restaurant service to be friendly and helpful -- no problems there. This hotel kind of nibbles away at you with extra charges, like $24 a day for parking and $10 a day for Internet connection. For parking, you can find cheaper places nearby if you look around, and I heard that the Starbucks just next door to the Azalea Restaurant has free Internet. For one minor gripe, I found it bizarre that you can't get a newspaper anywhere in the hotel. If you're lucky you might find an LA Times left in the vending machine outside (bring lots of quarters), or if you don't mind waiting in the long coffee line, you can get the New York Times, the LA Times, and the Wall Street Journal next door at Starbucks.

My complaint is with the terrible service I received from the front desk staff and not hotel amenities, although the condition of the room is a bit dated. The bathroom faucet would not stop dripping and the room ceilings looked like something from 1960s. When I first checked into the hotel on Friday morning (3am) the person at the front desk did not appear to know what he were doing. He seemed like he was arguing with the other person at the front desk about which room to give me. As a result, I was standing there at 3am for 20 minutes waiting for him to check me in. I understand if you are \u201cnew,\u201d but at 3am, the last thing a customer wants to do is wait for 20 minutes while you try to figure out what to do. Not to mention that I could barely understand what he was saying. When I had asked him how much the internet charge was, he told me $9.99 per day. The next morning at 8:30am, I was woken up to a drill (due to hotel renovation) in what felt like the room next door. Unfortunately, the drilling and construction work seemed to go on for the entire day. This means that if you plan to visit this \u201cbusiness hotel\u201d and try to work out of it, don\u2019t plan on it since you\u2019ll definitely be distracted by the sound. As a matter of fact, don\u2019t plan to sleep past 8am either if you are a light sleeper like I am. When I finally called down to the front desk to complain, the staff replied \u201c \u201cOh didn\u2019t you see the signs at the front.\u201d First, \u201cI did not see any signs\u201d and more importantly \u201cwhy would you put your hotel guests in a room where construction work was occurring next door?\u201d She assured us that Friday was the last day that construction was going to occur. Saturday & Sunday morning at 9:22am, I started to hear the drills again. When I called down again, they said, oh we didn\u2019t know this was happening but you can talk to our supervisor if you like. My reply was \u201cI don\u2019t want to waste anymore time with this but will speak to your supervisor when I check out.\u201d When I checked out, I had complained again, and they said \u2018oh sorry, we\u2019ll have our supervisor give you a call to talk to you more about it.\u201d I politely left my number with them and have not yet received a call. Also, the internet charge for the room is $9.99 per computer although the front desk only told us $9.99 per day. For the same price, I\u2019d stay at a Kimpton property hotel or The Standard instead this hotel charges $25 per day for parking anyways.

I let him choose the hotel (here's where the learning starts!), and decided I would wear my \"easy going\" cap for this quickie trip. This hotel was a great deal on line and I loved the idea of a Japanese approach to our accommodations. After braving the rush hour traffic in LA to get to the hotel, we were in a hurry to check in and get to your dinner engagement. I had read on line that some of the rooms had been recently renovated, so checked with the person checking us in to make sure we were in one of the updated rooms. She replied that it was \"semi-renovated\" (learning continues...). Upon reaching our room, which was spatially adequate,it felt a little old and dingy. The bedding ensemble was new and styled very nicely ~ I think was the \"semi-renovated\" element our check-in attendant was referring to. There was also some new, very cool wall paper on the wall behind the bed. Everything else was very standard and in need of updating. Upon returning from our night out in Downtown LA around Staples center, we were famished and had walked around for a while trying to find something open to grab a late night bite at. With very little available, we took a cab back to our hotel and thought we'd order room service. Alas, no room service available. While there is a lounge in the hotel lobby, there is no food service. There is also a restaurant, but it closes early in the evening. I thought all of this was very strange, however it was a Thursday night. The front desk provided us with a Dominos Pizza menu and also found a menu for a Thai restaurant that delivers. The single desk attendant suggested we walk just a couple blocks down the street where we would find many restaurants open. We walked quite a long ways and there really was nothing open. This is not the best part of town I might add, and we felt it best to get back to our room. We ended up calling the Thai restaurant and ordering ~ eating at 1:30 am and it was pretty good. But really, in the future, I will not stay at a hotel without room service or adequate dining options close by. The bathroom, while functional and relatively clean had a loose faucet and just really needed to be updated. The bed however, was very comfortable and the bedding was nice ~ again, part of that semi-remodeled effort. If you're going to LA and will be out and about, not spending time in your room, it is definitely an adequate stay. I do think that you'll do better just a few blocks towards the center of downtown with other options such as the historic Millenium Biltmore which is actually great value. I won't choose to stay here again and definitely will do more research before I let my beloved do the choosing again.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yuma, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cWould've gone elsewhere...\u201d", "Author": "DentistDorisUSN", "ReviewID": "UR123181558", "Content": "I should have parked across the street for a flat rate of $5 (weekend price after 4pm), but it was too dark to see the price sign.

We called the hotel with a couple of other questions before our trip, and we were always treated kindly and given thorough answers to our questions. The bell staff were very friendly at check in, Self Parking ($24 per night) was a breeze. The front desk team was very friendly and made us feel very welcomed.

I have stayed at the Ritz/4 Seasons/JW Marriotts/etc, and these beds/linens were equally as wonderful as any of those high end, pricey hotels. Another nice touch in the room is having a small fridge. No mini-bar items to deal with... just an empty fridge in the room, waiting for us and our beverages! The only room for improvment would be better toiletries...

The one other major place that MUST be improved: The business center is basically non-existent. There is only ONE working computer and the printer is hit and miss, at best. Since there is only 1 working PC, there was always someone camped out on it, with other guests, waiting.

We both had been trying to pick a hotel for weeks and read tons of reviews for several hotels. I finally made a decision and settled on the Kyoto Grand and it exceeded both of our expectations. Our original reservation through Expedia said we were getting one king bed, but when we checked in, the staff immediately offered us a room with two separate beds. Check-in was really fast. Our room was very clean and our beds were made up and our towels were changed daily. The beds are AMAZINGLY COMFORTABLE! Even after long days of walking around and sightseeing, we always felt refreshed the next day. Our window in the room was facing the beautiful garden. The bathroom was a little bit dated compared to the rest of the room, but it didn't bother us as it was always clean and everything worked. The shower had good water pressure. All of the staff at the Kyoto was friendly and helpful. They answered all of our questions and recommended places to go to in the area. One lady from the front desk, (I believe her name was Marisela) was extremely helpful. She booked a sightseeing tour for us around 10pm for the next morning. I realized the gift shop had closed and I needed to buy batteries for my camera, so I asked her if she knew where I could buy some - she told me to wait a sec and called someone from the hotel to bring me batteries, free of charge! We were a little reluctant to walk downtown by ourselves because we heard it was not safe at night, but it was perfectly fine, even for just two women. Shops and restaurants in Little Tokyo are open late, so we always felt safe and there was always something to do in the area. Pitfire Pizza is also a block away from the hotel in the opposite direction of Little Tokyo, so we went there for dinner a few times. Union Station is in walking distance to the hotel, as are several bus stops for various routes if you plan on taking the Metro. The Walt Disney Concert Hall and the Fashion District are also close by. The only things I could complain about was the hotel restaurant and the wi-fi. We had breakfast once at the restaurant and the servers offered us coffee before we got to see the menu, so unfortunately we didn't know that it was $4 each for coffee because of refills. Had we known that, we would have just got free coffee in the lobby. Wi-fi is expensive, about $10 a day. If you want it for less, you can go to Starbucks to use their internet. Other than that, I have only good things to say about the Kyoto Grand Hotel. Neither of us drive, but it was really easy for us to get around L.A. from the hotel by walking or taking the Metro. Coming back to the hotel was always a pleasure. The decor is beautiful, the atmosphere is really laid back, and the rooms are big and comfortable.

Second, the hotel is located in the middle of \"Little Tokyo,\" a cluster of Jethnic apanese businesses, including restaurants. Third, the hotel is far enough from what can be an intensely busy neighborhood, the area around the Staple Center, Nokia Center, and Convention Center. Fourth, the hotel is reasonable walking distance to other downtown restaurants and attractions (like the new Disney Concert Hall, Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the restored Union Station, and some museums.

Make sure that you have something in writing about these charges before checking in. As to restaurants -- most of the Janpanese restaurants are pretty stodgy and not great. The best one we found was Chin Ma Ya, which is in a three level food court in the building next door to the hotel. Very tasty dishes, much more interesting than the others. There's a noodle shop (cash only, so no receipt to tell you the name) on the south side of 2nd street just west of the hotel that isn't bad.

As to breakfast -- there's a Starbucks at ground level adjacent to the back door of the hotel. The hotel advertises their Japanese garden, which is a very nice garden on the roof over the lobby of the hotel. It's open to all guests, and a very nice place to hang out. The downside is that the garden is often used for weddings and other events (mostly weekends), and those uses preempt use by other guests.

The upper rooms also have spectacular views over Los Angeles. If you're looking at using the conferencing facilities, then read on about my experience: A colleague and I ran a 3-day event at this hotel for 60 people. We picked the hotel because of its location in downtown L.A. and because it had the space we wanted at a good price. On the upside, the conference rooms were well-appointed and furnished, and four of them - their \"Four Seasons\" rooms had sliding doors which allowed quick and efficient changes to size for maximum flexibility, converting it to one, two, three or four rooms as needed. All the rooms we were using were adjacent, allowing people to quickly move from on to another as needed, and all rooms were close to the sleeping rooms - so no great long hikes down endless corridors to get anywhere. The event management staff gave us a great overall rate on a combination of the conference rooms/food and beverage/minimum number of sleep nights booked by attendees. They also gave us a discounted rate for parking. There was good email communication in the 9 months lead up to the event and the staff we dealt with were helpful. On the night before the event, the gave us both access to the rooms and allowed us to set up a registration desk in the lobby area. On the downside, there were a number of problems which left our events running less smoothly than we were comfortable with. Something seemed to happen between what they promised us and what we got. There was an apparent breakdown in communication between the person we were liaising with and the banqueting staff - i.e. the people looking after our conference rooms - which caused a lot of undue stress. On our first day, with one day's notice, we were told we wouldn't be able to use the nearest restrooms as another event had roped the area off. This forced our attendees, including disabled people in wheelchairs, to have to go to facilities on other floors, causing delays in events while we waited for them all to go and get back. The evening of that day, an expensive, specially-made cake for our event (that the hotel had agreed we could bring in) went AWOL after they'd offered to store it for us, never to be seen again. On our second day, we arrived first thing to find the rooms locked and after taking 20 minutes to get someone to open them, they and hadn't been cleaned from the previous day. On our third day, the area outside our rooms was swamped with people for two hours waiting to get into an event in the nearby ballroom - with those guests wandering into our conference rooms until we posted people on the doors to stop them. Throughout our time there, tea and coffee was consistently left outside one of the rooms we were using, rather inside as we requested, so that other random guests kept helping themselves (and at $75 a gallon for coffee, including taxes and service charges, as a not-for-profit organization, we weren't happy about that). Many of the attendees to our event also complained to us about the counter staff being unhelpful and rude, and overall, there was a general lack of organization. We did get a call from the general manager following our feedback. He apologized and told us it won't happen again if we go back there, but didn't offer to reduce the charge on our overall bill or seek in any way to make amends, which left us feeling there was little sincerity behind it. It's a shame because this hotel could be a great all round venue if they could just get their act together.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albuquerque, New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cI would stay here again - nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "diablo_cat", "ReviewID": "UR115916452", "Content": "I stayed here last week for a couple of nights while on business travel.

I stayed in 2 different hotel rooms during my stay. The 18th floor room was nice, it was a one bedroom with a small dining area. No kitchen, but very roomy with a sofa and chair. I stayed with the bride the first night and in between tea ceremonies and before the actual wedding began we checked into our room. Upon arrival to our 17th floor room I was pretty sure someone had smoked in that room. I noticed there is a $250 charge to clean the room if you do happen to smoke in it and my daughter has asthma so staying in a room with a cigarette smoke scent was not ideal. I called the front desk immediately to avoid any issues. I was asked to be placed on hold. Mind you this is at 1:40pm and I was due for photo's at 2pm. Luckily we got to do an early check in, I will say that much. The woman on the phone was probably busy, I was placed on hold and then explained what the problem was. She said she would try to move me. I asked when that would happen because there was a major time crunch to move all of our luggage into another room. She said \"well, I can do it in 5 minutes if I get off this phone.\" During this conversation security came to the door. I asked him if he could smell the smoke and he said, \"it's hard to distinguish the smell over the perfume.\" I pretty much felt like no one believed me that it had a strange smell and decided this battle wasn't going to be won in the next 5 minutes. Skipped the room switch (she never called me back to let me know if we were in fact moved). Later during check out there was a discrepancy with what our room number was. So, I guess she did move us? We slept in the original room and I arranged for my daughter to stay with my mother for the evening to avoid any asthma flare ups. My cousin booked the royal suite for the morning of her wedding so the makeup and hair crew could get their work done with sufficient space. Makeup and hair was to begin at 8am and at 8:10 the front desk said the room was unavailable. After some checking? The girl at the desk said it should be fine to go up, no one was probably in the room. Um? Other than those strange hiccups, the support staff were wonderful. Room service was fantastic, the bellmen were great. Their pull out cots are TERRIBLY uncomfortable, but what pull out cot is comfortable? Would I come back?

Parking I believe is $30 and buffet is $20/pp which I didn't think was all that great. Just standard breakfast fare except for the miso soup.

For us, this is not an issue because Trade Show Organizers planned for this well and arranged Tour Bus Fleet to provide dense service at 8 minute intervals of 1/3 full busses for comfort + commuting!! For LA, the closest hotels were 5 large blocks away from the convention center, so staying close by is not as beneficial for off site private meetings as other trade show venues where the hotels are across the street. The decision to stay at Kyoto Grand came mainly from positive reviews below on this site. We were not dissappointed. If you enjoy Japanese cuisine and service then this is refreshing as there are dozen or more superior Japanese restaraunts on par with best in any US cities. Ok, that is enough for the area. The hotel review, offers very good value at $175 per nite. In room breakfast choice at $20 with gratuity is excellent, compared to $42 with exactly same food a month prior in San Francisco's W Hotel across street from Moscone Center and local SF breakfast at diner of $27.00 + tip. Was delivered on time. Funny though, we had to phone each day to request the door hanging order form. You would think Housekeeping would put fresh ones in the room daily, but I have noted this from most hotels I stay in so this must be some trendy cost saving tip amongst hoteliers? I stayed on 9th floor. Decor was tired and old, but not peeling or faded and everything worked well. The bedding was new. Linens were Crisp, clean and as comfortable as any Sweet Sleeper upper scale bed. Slept great but that also could have been the Sake and long days. Towels were large and very fluffy. Everything was very clean, very! Gardens in the back of the hotel were actually refreshing to look at in the morning against the city scape and made me wonder, \"who would engineer that these days with real estate costs being so high?\", so this is pleasant bonus and helps put you in a nice, calm state. This is well maintained by the hotel as it should be and is a nice esthetic. I am a gardener so this was a bonus. I would recommend Garden View rooms over city view. The TV was older tube style, but I only watched it briefly, but it makes the decor appear older and not updated. Small change of this would update the room. Hotel's Ibahn wireless service in the room worked perfectly and having cost waved ($9.95) as part of conference booking package was great! Again, barely used it to upload and download few messages so it would have been painful if we had to pay each day. Lobby bar was well provisioned but underwhelming. OK for meeting or quick drink only. I would not choose to invest more time there than this. A dozen Japanese bars compliment Japanese restaraunts nearby. The hotel staff is terrific, from whoever answers the phone, the front desk, door men, bell captains, housekeepers, room service and kitchen staff were terrific! We did not use the hotel restaraunt as I suspect few do, epecially after reading the reviews here. I looked in and it was closed. At best, it did look subdued. If I owned this property, I would re design coffee shop to reflect higher energy and up beat Japanese style, Tokyo contemporary coffee shop with pastries for tea anytime and 18 hour operation for breakfast 6:00 AM to Midnite for Asian, European and East Coast North American travelers. I did notice from ther bus there is a Starbucks in the hotel, but never visited it. I did not visit the health club, but you probably figured that since this review focus is on sleep, drink and food. The showers worked great. Terrific water pressure. In Japan however, I am always amazed at the terrific tubs and showers. These, though very functional in terms of U.S. standards would be considered sub standard in Japan, only and I suppose a bath make over would be too costly. Safes are provided at no charge but this hotel is very secure. There are well dressed, polite and competent security people in the hotel and present. We felt secure and safe. I like a safe so I can leave my laptop in the room. I did not see one and called the front desk and within minutes, they brought one up and I was in business. The service in this hotel is excellent. Finally, we were leaving as the Tsunami hit Japan and saw the saw and felt the deep concern of many guests from Japan and the local shops. Our thoughts and prayers go out to our friends in Japan! Summary: none of the updates I suggest, the decor or bath fixtures or even coffee shop update would make my stay any better and the lack of these 'updates' are subjective and did not make my stay any worse at all.

The hotel is located in Little Tokyo, where you will be able to find a good variety of Japanese restaurants, a Japanese market (that actually sells non-Japanese stuff as well), Japanese-style \"combinis\" (convenience stores), Japanese DVD rental and so on. You will find non-Japanese establishments as well, just to be fair. The area seems reasonably safe given what I have heard of downtown LA.

I've stayed there one or two weeks a year every year since maybe 2005, since it was the New Otani (old name). My take is that the price is very reasonable for downtown (generally @$135/night). This is very important- they have rooms which have been renovated with black wood furniture and new bedding (very comfortable) with large Sharp LCD Tvs but you need to ask for it specifically. The front desk told me they don't charge more, it's just based on availability and upon request. I've had one every time. The only issue I have with these rooms is the bathroom- yes they are pretty small, but more annoying to me is the vanity/sink. I'm tall so any hotels with older lower sinks are annoyance when shaving and such. Newer hotels generally have counter height sinks which are much nicer. But that's my only issue with the room. Room service is terrific, it's a bit overpriced (only because of the service charge) but is tasty and I don't think it's ever taken more than 15-20 mins from order to delivery. Staff is very friendly. They have 24 hour maintenance staff and they were able to quickly accommodate my request to make my room's AC very cold despite it being cold outside and 2am at the time. Another important tidbit is that there is a free shuttle which will take you (and come get you) most places downtown. I've been taking cabs everywhere and never even knew that til this trip. Ramon at the bell desk clued me in on it and was awesome, even took me to an ATM for my bank to save me bank fees at just any ATM. Lastly they are probably being bought by Doubletree soon which is all the better since I am a Hilton Diamond member, and earning points would make this hotel all the better.

The rooms were definitely nice with nice linens and bedding, as well as furniture. The service was absolutely HORRIBLE and I can say that the niceness of the hotel could never make the LACK OF SERVICE better than it was, nor make me EVER EVER want to go back or even refer someone to go there. REASONS: 1.) Check in/Service - the ladies at the front desk ignored everyone, including me, my spouse and his best friend, a groom, who was having his wedding at this location. After 5 minutes of standing there, in front of them, while they failed to acknowledge our presence, they proceeded to check in my spouse and I. This part of the check-in seemed semi-decent; I've seen better. Then it was the groom's turn to check in. This turned into hell. Maria, the lady checking us in, ignored the groom for about 2 minutes while she was on the phone; she failed to acknowledge him properly. Then while she was checking on his room, she said that his future wife already checked into their \"day of\" room and honeymoon suite. She was confident about it, stating it was a fact. We called the bride to verify; she said she was in her parent's room and did not check in, so, obviously she did not check in. Once we informed her that the bride did not check into the rooms, Maria replied with \"Oh... Yeah... well, no one has checked in yet.\" SERVICE FAIL #1 because she has no idea how to do her job. 2.) Service - I had some wedding guests in my room prior to the ceremony. There was a wardrobe malfunction and we needed some safety pins. Knowing this was supposed to be a 4 Star Hotel, I thought it would be an easy task for them to complete, especially because another4 Star Japanese hotel in San Diego was able to successfully complete this task in the past. I called down to the front desk and asked for 2 safety pins; they responded stating that they would call housekeeping to see if they could get some and then call me back. 5 minutes pass by, no response. I call back down and ask again. They said the same thing. 10 minutes pass by and nothing happens. I call down for a THIRD time. They responded angrily and said they would check and that they would place me on hold; they hung up. I waited for another 10 minutes for someone to come up to the room. They didn't. I walked downstairs to the front desk and asked how difficult it was to get 2 safety pins; one lady with curly hair responded angrily and said that she heard the lady who answered say what she said and that the phone disconnected and that me \"waiting\" for 30 minutes was not true. If the phone disconnected, and they know which room the telephone call is coming from, why didn't they call back? They obviously don't know how to do their job and especially don't know what \"Customer Service\" means. SERVICE FAIL #2. 3.) Service - After the wedding ceremony, we went down to the Azalia Restaurant. Nice venue and decent but not average service. Due to their inability to maintain the side entrance from the STREET, 2 wedding crashers walked in and grabbed drinks and appetizers. People from the wedding party had to kick them out. I don't know why the hotel didn't take the precaution of blocking off the STREET entrance when they knew a party was being held there and that anyone walking on the street had access to the entrance. SERVICE FAIL #3. 4.) Service - Breakfast in the Azalia on Sunday morning. Definitely not worth $17.95 per person. No one came by to serve water or greet us. I had to search for a spoon. We had to track people down to get the check. If someone was there to give us service, we wouldn't have to search for spoons or water (which I never got the entire time because by the time I was done with my breakfast I didn't need water anymore), which then would also allow for them to properly figure out how to break up the checks. SERVICE FAIL #4. 5.) Service - Parking. Parking was decent in itself. The worst part of it was when my spouse was getting the car, they made him pay cash only. He had to back up and park, then go find an ATM and get cash. It cost $25.00 to SELF park over night. That's ridiculous in itself. We got home later that day and checked our account. They billed us extra on our room to include parking, something we already paid for because the guy made us pay cash, not even asking for a receipt from the front desk. The lady on the phone was unrelenting, saying that the parking guy is supposed to give us a receipt. She wanted us to show her a receipt showing we paid for the parking. This entire weekend we were never given a receipt (we never got one when we checked out - most places provide receipts... but apparently this one doesn't because the front desk people don't know how to do their job), so how would we be able to show a receipt that didn't exist? After 5 minutes of convincing her that we paid and that we never were given receipts anyways because of their failure to do their job, she decided to refund us the extra amount they OVER charged us for no reason. How do they even know we used a car in the first place? How to they charge for something that they can't prove we had. SERVICE FAIL #5. I mean, seriously, how difficult is it for CUSTOMER SERVICE professions to actually provide customer service? Apparently it's rather difficult here. Their employees were obviously not chosen accordingly to help improve their customer service. Who ever hired the managers to hire these dumb hourly employees should be fired. I also don' t know if training would even help these employees become better or more equip to perform their jobs. If this hotel has amazing employees, they obviously don't work weekends when a majority of their client\u00e8le are there. This place will forever be marked in my book as the worst place to stay ever. I wouldn't even send my worst enemy to stay here and get the horrible service I did.

It also had more of a Japanese feel with the blinds unlike the deluxe, Only difference was it didn't have a 42in TV! It was a corner room so this could explain the extra space so try and request a corner room. The hotel restaurants are expensive and to get to Beverley Hill / Hollywood you either have to drive or get the subway(train) which is about a 5 minute walk and takes about 20 minutes. Our room had a nice view of the garden but the othesrs weren't so lucky.

The view along one side of the hotel is a giant flat grey wall of another building. It was a little disappointing.

I flew all the way from the friendly southeast (GA), and upon arrival felt like I had not left. The staff up front was very friendly and helpful. The room was very clean and inviting. The bed (we upgraded to the pillowtop king room) was EXTREMELY comfortable. The shower had great water pressure. The room was quiet (it was a street side room not over the garden). We never heard people beside us, over, or under us. Their conceirege was always in the lobby walking around and very accessible. Anytime we were in the lobby looking lost, he would walk up and offer friendly help and advice. The only slight negative (and the hotel staff can't do anything to fix it) is the location. Its not the best, not the worst. The only big tourist stuff it's close too is olvera st., union station, chinatown, and little tokyo (of course). If you don't mind walking a few blocks in the beautiful weather to the metro, though, you have access to a ton of tourist attractions. They also have a shuttle van that will take you to the metro and other points within a few miles of the hotel. I did feel very safe in the area, as it is close to police stations.

When I finally got her attention, she didnt even remember or recognize me. I had to explain what she asked me to do. I was really angry at this point so I asked her why I had to wait and she showed no sympathy and just kept repeating, \"you're room wasnt ready.\" I kept asking her, why didnt you assign a different room? Why did take me almost 1hour to get my keys? I even asked her if the fact that I am an employee of the State of California and receiving a discount on the room rate was a reason. Either way, for the first time in my life, I was treated like a 2nd rate/class consumer. She did not greet me, she wasnt comforting with the wait, she didnt even apologize or try to make my experience better after my complaint. This is by far the worst customer service treatment I have received in my entire life. I get better service buying food from a street vendor. I even invited 2 other couples to stay in the hotel that evening so we can carpool to our New Years Eve festivities. I shouldnt have done that. Overall, the hotel is nice and the location is in the heart of downtown Los Angeles in Little Tokyo and is accessible from plenty of tourist attractions.

The elevator takes you straight into the hotel where it has an enormous lobby area decorated with japanese paintings and other exotic decor, which made us go \"WOW!\" Now this is the reason why im rating this a 4 instead of a 5. i booked the \"Deluxe\" room with a king bed directly on the Kyoto Grand website. As pictured on the site, the deluxe room is the remolded room thats decorated in dark brown colors and specifically a 42'' flat screen tv, this is the room i booked. After checking in, we proceeded up to the room only to find that its one of the \"old\" rooms thats labled as the \"standard\" room on the website. The standard rooms are decorated in very light colors with a 25'' or so tv, very different from the deluxe rooms. So i went back down to the front desk and told them the situation, Maria at the front desk double checked my reservation on the system and she said that that room is whati booked! now the standard room rate was about $98 and the deluxe room was about $117, i did not pay the extra money to get one of those old standard rooms! (you can verify the differences between the two on the kyoto grand website when you get to the reservations page w/ the rooms/rates, there are specific and obvious differences between the standard and deluxe rooms even in the description)But Maria was nice enough (given the fact taht it wasnt really busy) gave me the upgrade to the deluxe remodeled room. The deluxe remodeled rooms are amazing and breathtaking! the huge 42'' tv kept us from being bored, the decor was very warm and relaxing, everything about the room was A++++++. So all in, the rooms, service, location were picture perfect except for the EXTREMELY MISLEADING room descriptions on the website. i hope the management reads this review to prevent this from happening again.

Sink faucet was hard to turn off completely. Room was clean. Refrigerator in room was convenient.

The real problem in this hotel is service. People who are supposed to provide service in this hotel are clueless. Local TV stations were not coming in -- but in 5 days, no one in this hotel could get the cable company to fix what was wrong. My radio was broken -- it took two calls, the second, very insistent, to get it fixed. Someone else's charges were charged to my room -- it took more time to straighten this out than it should have. There was no concierge available during the 6 days of my stay -- only the desk clerks, usually only one per shift. When I arrived, there was no bellhop -- I had to bring my suitcases up to my room unassisted. There simply weren't enough people working in the hotel, and the ones who were there could stand re-training. Neighborhood was very safe during day; I never walked around unaccompanied at night. Lots of Japanese and other restaurants nearby, and yogurt places (Yogurt Land at San Pedro and First is even better than Pinkberry.) Also markets and interesting shops. Location is walking distance to Walt Disney Concert Hall (excellent docent-let tours of all 4 theaters are available,) museums and the Cathedral.

We had checked in to our room which was surprisingly very nice, with the exception of our mini refrigerator not working. We called the front desk and they were more than happy and timely in replacing. it. Excited with our children we decided to go and look for the pool to spend time waiting for the game to start.

The concierge informed us, take the courtesy shuttle to Union Station and catch a train to the stadium. Wow!! That sounds fantastic. Get on the shuttle, the gentleman driving is making small talk asking why are we going to Union Station and he explaings, he doesn't think there is a train to Dodgers stadium. At this point we are sure the concierge must be right so we decide to go forth with the Union Station idea. No Surprise, the irritated train worker let me know they no longer provided transportation to Dodgers Stadium. On the way out of Union Station, once again disapointed we noticed a sign turned backwards that said 'We no longer provide transportation to Dodgers Stadium\". Why did we not see the sign prior to the courtesy shuttle leaving. We lugged ourselves and kids back to the hotel, via foot, and the concierge actually said, Oh your back already???

The business center in the lobby was always accessible with internet access, a printer, a fax machine and a copier. I also found a back entrance to the hotel where there was a Starbucks adjacent to the exit. LA Mall is a few blocks away which has a CVS, a Carls Jr, a Sbarro and some other little stores. The best find was Pit Fire Pizza Company 1 block over on 2nd St towards Broadway. My only gripe is the bed. That bed was the hardest bed I ever slept on.

The check in was unbelievably quick before I knew it I was headed towards my room. I got a very clean king deluxe room. The colors of the furniture was neutral colors which was nice. The bed was a little on the hard side but it was sleepable. The view from my room faced lots of high sky rises. And the view below was the beautiful view of the Japanese garden that is located on the property. I loved how peaceful the hotel was, I hardly seen anybody around except for the staff. And I thought maybe this is a well kept secret of a wonderful hotel. A must see on the 3rd floor of this hotel is the Japanese Garden as I strolled thru this beautiful garden I felt my stress just fade away completely. I could tell they really kepted up with the gardening and the water looked so clean. The thing I didn't agree on and shouldn't be charged to the hotel guest. Was the charges for parking which was $24.00 a day, which was charged on my bill automatically when I checked in. But I also realized that everywhere in that area and in downtown L.A, parking was charged. The thing that I didn't care for was that from the parking garage I had to walk thru the lobby and past the front desk clerks to get to the elevators to get to my room. But thats my opinion as for my partner she felt safer knowing the front desk clerks can watch whos coming in and out of the hotel. So thats a neigh and a yeah on that subject. The area is a great location to go to every popular attraction in Hollywood and Los Angeles. For restaurants yes there is a couple in the hotel but pricey. And the hotel connects to a mall with restaurants also. But around this area for fast foods restaurants thats open 24 hours its not close by its a quite a bit of a drive. Or in matter of fact any fast food restaurants, there isn't any close by. As for the staff they were very friendly and always greeted me with a hello as I passed by them.

We took the train up and literally walked to the hotel from Union Station (about 3 city blocks). But whenever we wanted to get back to the station to take the subway to get around, the free shuttle was there. Made it very convenient for a non-car stay. If you do bring your own car, don't park at the hotel ($30 a night) but instead in the lot across the street on Second Street -- $8 a day and $5 on weekends. The hotel was also a one-block walk to Little Tokyo, which gave us a fun night out. Dined at Suehiro -- great food and only about $10 per person. A small shopping mall is attached to the hotel (via the gardens) and has a large Japanese market. We got some snacks there and even made some ramen in our room with the coffeemaker. Staff members were *more* than polite and kind. Truly, I did not run into *one* staff member who was nothing less than warm and accommodating. The room was standard hotel fare -- neutral and calm decor. The fridge was a welcome feature for snacks and drinks. Yes, the beds were very firm, but I slept well. We had a view of the gardens and far into the distance of downtown. Fast elevators made it easy for me to go for a non-smoking room and just pop downstairs for a cig. Restaurants in the hotel are very expensive ($49 for brunch!), but there were many other possibilities within an easy walk or via the shuttle.

We also had half price sushi and cheap drinks during the daily Happy Hour at the Genji Bar, which was good value. We were on the 10th floor and could hear a bit of noise from the street - the insulation is clearly not great - so I would recommend getting as high a floor as you can. I actually wish we had not bothered renting a car. The hotel self park is $24 a day and the valet $30. We parked the car in a nearby lot for $8 for 2 days and never took it out. It is such a hassle to drive and so expensive to park in LA, that we took taxis, the metro and buses. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from Union Station and despite the popular perception that public transport is terrible in LA, you can get anywhere you want to from there. So, forgoing the rental and getting the airport shuttle ($15 each way) would, in hindsight, have been cheaper and easier.

We ate at the Thousand Cranes restaurant - this is a top notch Japanese restaurant. We sat at the sushi bar and had a superb eating experience. The Little Tokyo neighborhood is very nice. The area is clean and we were told it has been recently cleaned up and is an up and coming area. There are tons of neat little restaurant in the area and it is also an easy walk to the new home of the LA Philharmonic! Overall this was a great place to stay in Downtown LA - walking distance from the train station and walking distance to great food and events. It couldn't be easier!", "Date": "October 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNot great neighborhood\u201d", "Author": "knml911", "ReviewID": "UR20371814", "Content": "We spent 2 nights there.

Maybe because of those high expectations, I was quite disappointed. The hotel lobby is not spectacular, but very nice. Our room, however, was at a 2-Star level. There were numerous stains on the carpet, and the bathroom, in particular, was quite rundown. Of course, it's all about price/value.

At registration the desk clerk handed me a cup of iced tea and a warm towel while I was signing in--a nice touch, and a sign of the thoughtful service that was to mark my stay throughout. The lobby's great, and the third-floor garden is a haven. The restaurant A Thousand Cranes is worth checking out. It's pricey, but the Sunday buffet is one of the best meals (and high-end bargains!) I've had in Los Angeles. The location, with a bail bond place practically next door, may be off-putting, but that's because a city detention center is nearby, as is City Hall.

I looked for a hotel near the Metro station and Art Museum I was attending within walking distance. This place was a gem. Three blocks from the Metro station and two blocks from the Japanese American National Museum, right in the heart of LA's Little Tokyo. Formerly the New Otani Hotel, (It still has an Asian/Japanese theme) they have about a 20 story tower complete with everything you need. A lobby bar which also serves food, the weekend bartender Roberto G. makes the best mojito you could ever have and also is so personable he shold have a tv show.. Also a lobby level restaurant (Azealia) for mainly american food. A couple floors up are the main eateries, a fine food venue with a sushi and shashimi area, a place with a lot of beef and asian inspired influences and a mainly nighttime bar with every drink you want, including every type of sake, as well as food items. Hours vary depending on the day but there's always something, including room service if it's that late. Plus you're in the heart of little Tokyo. Yeah it might not feel great at 10 or 11 at night but it's safe! And there's a ton of other places to eat as well as the in-house Starbuck's, but they close early. For the hotel itself, easy and quick check-in and out, very competent staff, I never had a problem go unanswered. The room, I had a basic room, was everything you could expect, windows that open, variable A/C, bathroom toiletries, the tv even includes a few HBO channels. My favorite feature was the authentic Japanese Garden, located on a terrace on the third floor, it is a several acre oasis garden of foliage, streams and a waterfall. In one corner there is a full bar and grill where you can walk-up or order food to your table. Grilled ribs and a cool drink while admiring the LA skyline in the middle of a Japanese Garden, how cool! The hotel's staff was always there, not only for security but to make sure you had no problems.
