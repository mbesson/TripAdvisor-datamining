Read on if you need more... We stayed the first week of April (1-5th). Roman Spa was delightful. The beds were very comfy, sheets and towels super soft and rooms very clean. Making our arrangements was a joy as everyone is so accomodating. The heated spa pools were awesome. Not big enough to do laps but plenty big enough to float about and enjoy the healing effects of the hot spring water. We stayed here because of the hot spring pools and mud bath. The mud bath was a total trip! Really glad I did it but not something I need every week. Everyone in the spa was very nice and professional. The grounds were very beautiful and well kept - this is such a great base to explore the northern part of Napa. We are in our mid 30's w/o kids. I'm not sure this is a great place for kids and families but that said there were a few during our stay and most were well behaved. Some weren't and I very much appreciated the front desk folks reminding them to settle down. The vast majority of the guests were in there 50s - 60s but as many of the reviwers wrote they probably started coming when they were my age. I would not hesitate to reccommend this hotel to anyone.

My wife and I enjoyed soaking in the three different geothermal pools for hours on end. Each pool is a different size and temperature.

The weather was beyond \"good\" and floating in the main pool and watching the palm trees sway in the breeze was the best! My legs have never recovered so well! We will return with our extended family members in that the hotel has numerous garden sitting areas along with the poolside areas where any family member would find their \"favorite spot\".

Inside the large room that houses the 100 degree pool, there were saunas for men and women. My only wish is that the pools were open for longer hours (beyond the 8AM to 10PM time period), but that was only a minor issue, and did not impact our enjoyment of the facilities.

I have found that all of the spas with the natural hot spring waters are all about the same as far as spa and treatments, although they vary in price greatly. In my opinion, the highlights of this location are, hot pool, hot tub, and roman spa/jaccuzzi inside, as well as mens and womens nice sized fit about 6 people dry saunas, all of which comes free with your rooms, and they are open until 10:00pm! The spa has great mud and hydro tubs with 2 feet of bubbles(the others have small regular tubs with these wierd bubblers under your but,no good), they leave you alone to get in and out of tubs so much more privacy, yet still very attentive and check on you frequently. The massage rooms are private and quite with wonderful massage therapists. The prices are reasonable, the location is right in the center of town one block off so easy to walk everywhere, which is nice if you are consuming any local wines! The rooms are nice and clean, not fancy. I prefer a good price and great spa over stylish rooms and hype. If you are looking for something more luxury you will be paying the minimum of $400 a nite at the very few 5 star places in town.

Although we disliked the bed, and wished that the DVD player would read the DVDs we brought, we found it a serviceable and pleasant place. We stayed in room 105 and it was an unusually well-equipped full kitchen -- good array of cooking utensils, oven and cooktop, fridge with freezer, a toaster and microwave, and a full set of dishes for four -- really well set up to take advantage of the fact that the Cal-Mart a block away is a great place to buy hot prepared foods/salad bar, a good budget meal option. There was a kitchen table with three chairs, a desk in the bedroom, and a largish bedroom table with two armchairs. Everything was quite clean and practical. The pools were nice, not as alluring as the ones at Solage of course and usually quite crowded, but nice and a comfortable temperature (the indoor pool was too small for much swimming). We appreciated the clothesline in the bathtub for hanging wet swimsuits, a thoughtful touch. The water pressure in the room was adequate in the shower, the showerhead was low for my tall husband but tolerable. Agreed with other reviews that the location, being able to walk to lots of cute downtown areas, is a major asset. No wired internet, they have property-wide free wireless that seemed to have good bandwidth but we had to log in over and over. The king-size bed was horrifically springy and bouncy, we didn't sleep very well as a result, and the radiator made really ghastly noises and was only minimally adjustable (always either too hot or too cold). Those were our least favorite things. We would stay here again for the value, though we wouldn't be all that excited about it. It's perfectly fine.

There is a large, naturally thermal-heated pool, a smaller indoor thermal pool and a thermally-heated hot tub. Pools are closed by 10 PM and we have never experienced the pool filled with \"Yahoos\". Gardens, well-kept vegetation and palm trees are part of this hotel/resorts's elegance with six two-storey buildings containing spacious, up-to-date and ultra clean suites with either kitchens or beds and room only. We have always rented the double queen beds (I am a restless sleeper at the best of times and so two beds is a must for us) with kiitchen. The beds are to die for...firm and yet soft enough for comfort. We cook most of our meals and enjoy the wines, sun, heat and relaxation of the Napa Valley. There is ample parking that is free for all guests to use. There is also a spa run by the Roman Spa. The staff is efficient, courteous, always friendly and very helpful. What can i say? Our long record of coming here every spring, summer or fall of every year save two over the past nearly 1/4 century is testimony enough.

We have brought over 20 people of our friends over the years to your resort as new clients. We arrived in the hotel at 5:00pm on august 6th, and checked out Sunday august 7th at 11:00am. We had my husband, me and my 10 year old son, as well as my pregnant daughter and her husband in the room we reserved. I had a spa procedure scheduled for Sunday at 3:00pm, and my family and I went to the pool to wait until then. At 1:20pm a woman ran in and started questioning us whether we were checking in or checking out. No hello, no smile, not asking kindly, she acted as if we were teens on a playground after hours. She spat out that we need to \"get our stuff and get out,\" were her words exactly. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even get a chance to respond because she turned on the spot and marched off. At 2:00pm she came back again and with raised tones started telling us off for not following their policy with 1:00pm end of pool services. I explained to her nicely that I had a spa treatment at 3:00pm and ask if she could make and exception and let us swim another hour till then, on the grounds that we were consistent customers, we had not recieved any kind of discount, or special treatment, and ALSO there was only one more small family of 3 at the pool area at that time. To this she gave me an attitude saying \"well do you see how crowded other resorts are?! its because of our rule that we are not so.\" My husband joined the conversation and informed her that the reason for other resorts being more occupied wasn't the rules, it was the price that is many many times lower, even for a day pass, then it is at Roman Spa. She said, \"I have no energy to argue with you! I will make an exception, but at 3:00 all of you and all your stuff better be out of here!\" As all this was going on my son-in-law was trying to tell jokes to my 10 year old son, so that he gets distracted from the situation and doesn't get upset, and as the woman was running off to the office past the pool she saw my son-in-law chuckling. She stopped, grabbed the fence and yelled \"I want you out of here!!!\" My pregnant daughter (his wife) approached her and asked on what ground does she have right to speak like that about her husband. The woman just yelled at her saying \"and get that kid out of here too!\" When she looked at my son she made such a face as if she had seen a dead thing!!!! My daughter asked to see the manager immediately, and she screamed that she would call the police! My daughter and I kept trying to ask why exactly would we be reported to the police and she screamed \"I'm gonna go get a big man to drag you out of the pool!!\" Here my daughter requested that the police be called so that she can tell them how this woman was threatening us with physical force. At this, the women finally let go of the bars of the pool gates that she had been hanging on for the last 5 minutes and nearly ran back to the office. At this point we had gotten our stuff, and I, my daughter and her husband went after her to the office. I requested to see the manager. She said \"I am the manager!\", I asked for her business card, and on the fifth time of me asking for it she finally shoved one at me with such a disgusting attitude that made me want to throw the card back at her face. She spelled her name out for me as if I was an illiterate. Her name was Pauline --. At this moment a man looking like a cowboy with a ring of janitors keys walked in the office and immediately started eyeing us up and down. He started cutting us off rudely and saying that it was time for us to leave, that we needed to leave, and that the best for us was to leave. Then he quickly opened the door for employees and went behind the counter, locking the door after himself. Then my son-in-law asked him what his name was and he refused to give it to us. Then my son-in-law asked him who the manager above Pauline was, he replied that he was. We asked him for his business card, he said he didn't have any. My son-in-law asked how could the higher manger of a resort not have a business card. The man replied \"Do you have a driver license from Nebraska?\" when my son-in-law looked surprised, the man asked \"Do you even know what Nebraska is??\" At that point we just turned around and left. Besides the ruined family trip, and the horrible feeling of unfair, unjust, unnecessary treatment, I want to know what exactly did my family with a 10 year old child, a pregnant young lady and her husband, and me and my husband do that was so criminal that we had to be threatened with police and \"Big men.\" We had no alcohol there, no food, no toys, no music, my son was not splashing, jumping, or diving, and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go anywhere near the adult pools. Now, it is obvious to all that $259 per night is not for the old room and old appliances, but we pay for the mineral pools. So to be limited on that after paying much, much more per night here than in an all-inclusive Marriott resort is just ridiculous!!! I am also wondering why after I had found over 90 poor reviews for Roman Spa on this site alone, most of which were talking exactly about the rudeness of the front desk staff, still situations like ours are happening, and Pauline flaunted at us the fact that she has been manager for 9 years.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minden, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cSlept like a baby\u201d", "Author": "Mary R", "ReviewID": "UR117093177", "Content": "My husband and I slept like a baby at the Roman Spa Hot Springs Resort.

The rooms are clean and the property manicured, with a variety of flowers and humming bird feeders to soothe your senses and lots of lounging furniture to relax in. However if you are into room decor, you will be disappointed in that regard as the decor is 70s and very bland. The mattresses are average, no pillow tops or luxury bedding. The effort is put into the outdoor aspect, but the indoors has much room for improvement. Taking that into consideration, I felt the rates are a bit on the high side. Unless you are willing to pay a hefty amount for dining I would recommend getting a kitchenette which will allow you time to lounge and relax rather than taking time to hunt around for food. The grocery store is just on the other end of the block from the hotel, very convenient a big plus. The property is the most convenient and has the most amenities in Calistoga.

Once I get into Calistoga, the work world seems to disappear. And by the time I check into the Roman Spa, my breathing slows and I genuinely relax. That is why I continue to return. The Roman Spa is not a new property, but it is very well maintained. The gardens are inviting and always impeccable. The hummingbirds buzz around drinking from the feeders under the arbor, and from the flowers around the property. Our room overlooked the arbor and the pool, with a great view of the distant hills in the East. The pool is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmain attraction\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for us. After flying over 2,600 miles from south Florida, the warm pool is a GREAT way to rejuvenate before going out for dinner. If you have never stayed in an area with spring fed pools this is a wonderful introduction for you. You feel almost primeval soaking in the Earth warmed water - you really just relax. On other trips we have been here in January, and even then it is an awesome experience to float in the warm water. Whether it is something in the water (minerals) or just the temperature, you will be delighted. Everything is a very convenient walk from the hotel. If you want picnic supplies, a sandwich or a hot meal to go, try Cal-Mart about a block away. This is a full service grocery which is locally owned and operated. You can also find snacks to take along as you visit the wineries during the day. There are also bakeries for breakfast, a cantina for lunch and PLENTY of options for dinner. Again, all within walking distance. If you have not been to the California Wine Country before, Calistoga is a perfect location for day trips to both the Napa and Sonoma Valleys. You can go in any direction and find top-notch wineries; from a larger commercial level to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMom and Pops\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 who will take you on walking tours and explain the wine process to you. Also look into the olive oil producers, i.e. Dutch Henry, it is a great item to bring home and re-live your Wine Country experience once you return.

It's nice to get in the warm and hot waters of the pools during each season, but in winter, the hot spring water creates a lot of steam and a little smell of spring water in the air. In summer, there is no steam at all and the pools look a lot nicer. In summer you can also take advantage of the various courtyards on the property, each with some tables + umbrella, lounge chairs, and 2-3 barbeques. I saw that the cleaning crew cleaned each barbeque in the morning. The place is pretty well kept. The rooms are well taken care of. Basic, but comfortable. Basic bathroom, but good water pressure. I found the bed to be comfortable and with lots of fluffy pillows. Some units have a kitchenette that is stocked with most things you would need to prepare breakfast or an easy dinner. We did not cook, but I checked into the cabinets. During the August stay, there was a bachelorette party in or near our building and that created a lot of noise. If it wasn't because i was too tired to get up, I would have complained with the front desk. I would recommend this to couples or groups of friends that are looking for a hotel with a pool that is good value in a good location. Do not go if you are looking for a quiet and romantic setting. I would NOT recommend the Spa. REVIEW OF THE SPA: My husband bought me a massage and facial as a gift in February 2009. While the idea was great and I really appreciated it, there was no way he would have known how bad the experience was going to be. First of all, the location is like a permanent trailer on the other side of the hotel's parking lot. Secondly, the staff is friendly but not professional. The facial sucked and the massage was horrible. In fact, the massage was so horrible that I felt disgusted more than relaxed afterwards. The male masseur kept complimenting me on my muscle tone and mentioned a few times how \"beautiful\" I was. Was he expecting this to increase his tip?! I felt like it was cheesy and extremely unprofessional for someone to keep making such personal comments while rubbing their hands on me. Anyway - don't waste your money.", "Date": "September 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cyearly trip\u201d", "Author": "Jujubellie", "ReviewID": "UR76817258", "Content": "My mother takes my sister and me every single year to the Roman Spa.

They have really nice garden-like decor complete with coy ponds and sun dials that frame nice motel-style rooms. Like the Romans of old, they have three baths: a hot tub that's typically about 105 degrees, a cooler pool heated to around 95 degrees and a warm, indoor pool kept around 100 degrees. The real Romans would have had their cold pool around 40 degrees, but I think most of us would run away from that. :D The rooms are nice. They're clean and serviceable. Each comes with two wine glasses in addition to the usual hotel glasses and a refrigerator, which is a plus. Some of them even have kitchenettes. The service is friendly. I've never had a complaint. They also serve coffee in the mornings. The spa is also real nice with good service and typical Calistoga spa treatments, including mud bathes (if you've never hada mud bath, have one before you die -- you won't believe how nice it is until you have one -- very relaxing). The best part, though, about Roman Spa is the value. It's one of the least expensive places in Calistoga that actually has a spa and hot bathes. I also like the three bath system, because it's not just a hot tub and pool: it's three bathes that are meant to be relaxed in, each at a different temperature, which is kind of unique. Now, is it a top level resort like Indian Springs? I've never been to Indian Springs, but I'd guess not, but then, from what I hear, Indian Springs is the Ritz of Calistoga. There are certainly Ritzier places in Calistoga than Roman Spa, but they're also a lot more expensive and I'm happy with what I get at Roman Spa. Saying it's not like Indian Springs is sort of like complaining that a burger place doesn't serve fillet mignon. Roman Spa is really good for the price you pay and for what it is. I'd say it's one of the better hotels for its value that I've stayed at and that's saying a lot. And, the refrigerator or kitchenette is great, because it means I can buy groceries, eat in and save money. Roman Spa is also right down town, so it's literally with in walking distance of the restaurants, shopping, etc. But, I also seriously enjoy being there.

Spring added a bonus of green hills and wildflowers on our hike on the nearby Oat Hill Mine trail. The hotel is not fancy but it is clean and welcoming to guests of all ages. What was evident both times was the friendly nature of all the guests and the number of locals that are regulars to this particular resort. There are three soaking pools of differing temperatures, all very relaxing to stay in. People read, sip on wine or other beverages, sit by the pool, talk with each other making new friends. Next door is the Roman Spa where we got a massage on both days and had the same therapists from our last trip. Excellent massages on both days. It is hard to imagine anything more relaxing to the mind and body; soaking in warm pools of water, getting a total body massage and then returning to the pools with a cool drink , perhaps a nice white wine from nearby Napa. As night falls you see the stars above. It is a short walk to all the fine restaurants in town. The ambiance is gentle and quiet and refined. We ate at Checkers which , at first glance, looks like a diner for a quick burger and pizza. We had roasted garlic, salmon with spinich, and angel hair pasta with shrimp that was outstanding. $5 for for a merlot special. We hiked on Saturday and saw over 20 different kinds of wildflowers on the trail. The views were fantastic. For a weekend of massage and hotel and dinner the event is definitely a splurge but well worth it.

We (Mollie, my wife and I) live in San Francisco, a great reward in itself, and travel to Roman Spa three to four times a year. The drive is short, about one and a half hours, if you can resist stopping in at all the wineries along the way. Once at Roman Spa, quickly check in to your room (a room booking is required to use the spas), get a spa towel and head off for the mid-temperature, indoor spa. The sore lower back and joints of this old man love those massaging jets. After a few minutes, amble the few feet to the small, hotter outdoor pool. Oh, this is living, more massaging jets. Then, for a change, slip into the large, temperate swimming pool. Rest your neck against the smooth coping of that temperate swimming pool and you may see some of the restful sights I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen over the years. In the early morning, colorful hot air balloons drift by as they weave in and out of sight against the tall palm trees on the spa property. In the early evening, the fronds of the palm trees dance lightly in the breeze. You are apt to see hummingbirds flitting about feeders located on the beautiful grape arbor walkway that parallels the length of the large pool. Lounge on deck sunning chairs and read for a while. Barbeques are provided for guests use. A loaf of bread, a jug of wine and thou\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 you know, the essence of contentment. Many umbrella picnic tables abound. The rooms are clean, the surroundings pleasant and so peaceful. Mud baths and massages are located on the eastern side of the premises. Have I left anything out? Parking is no problem. Oh yes, the dining around Calistoga is as easy as walking two blocks to several downtown gastronomic choices. Wineries nearby are too numerous to mention; just pick up a brochure from the Spa office. Two state parks and Mt. St. Helena are nearby too. Roman Spa has bed and breakfast packages and a wedding package. The Sharpsteen Museum is a block away; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worthy of a visit if you can bear abandoning those massaging jets. Go ahead; reward yourself.

Our room had a kitchenette which was convenient, but since the spa is located only steps away from a variety of restaurants (high, medium and low end), we just used it for the refrigerator and early morning coffee. What has always been the draw for us, besides the pools, is the landscaping. There beautiful dark wood vine arbors and there are always seasonal plantings. At this time of year, the mums are plentiful. Pumpkins had been placed abundantly in the gardens, including a monster big one outiside the office door. I was hoping for cooler fall weather, but had to live with glorious, sunny mid 80s weather during my stay.

The motel feels very much like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve entered a time machine back to the 1970s, to a much more simpler way of life. The rooms are definitely nothing fancy but they are clean with hot water, air conditioning, cable television, and even a small refrigerator in the room. The only negative about the room was the sound of water flowing through the pipes whenever someone in an adjacent room turned on the spigot or flushed the toilet. We had a second floor room overlooking the pools and the very well kept landscaping. There are three pools at three different temperatures depending upon what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for. It seemed that there were many eastern Europeans guests during our stay. Perhaps they understand and appreciate more the benefits of the mineral spa. The pool closes at 10:00 pm so there was never a problem with too much noise. We were in the pool each morning and then after a hard day of wine country tourism, again in the evening. Outside our room, there were many tables and chairs and even a grilling area. Many people were cooking their own dinner and enjoying their Napa Valley selections of wine. The motel was full of very laid back and friendly people. It was a bit like being in a campground, meeting many different people. Perhaps because of the three night minimum stay requirement, after the first day, we recognized most of our neighbors and were on friendly terms. We took mud baths at the Oasis Spa which is right next door to the motel. The volcanic ash and peat moss mixed with hot water has a distinctive smell that some may not take a liking too but for us, it was no problem. Our attendant was there whenever we needed her without being intrusive. It was an interesting experience that is worth trying. The facilities are simple much like the motel. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing fancy or pretentious here. The main street of Calistoga, Lincoln Avenue, is just a short block from the hotel. There are several restaurants on the street. Two we visited are Miguel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, a Mexican restaurant. The salsa Miguel makes is extremely good. You can pick up a coupon for $5 off any order of more than $10 at the visitor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s center across from the Cal-Mart grocery store. We ate breakfast and dinner there and was greeted each time by Miguel himself. The other restaurant we recommend is Checkers directly across from Miguel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. It was recommended to us by the lady selling pecan brittle at the Saturday morning Farmer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Market. The pecan brittle ($5 for a bag) was very good too.

However I then noticed a number of less positive reviews and comments, so I had some concerns. I wanted to write this review to reassure anyone else who plans on visiting. Firstly, let me say that we are a family of 5, travelling from Scotland. During our month-long trip we stayed in a variety of accommodation, from Big Sur Lodge (basic but great location) to Seascape in Aptos (good facilities, but a bit soulless) to Stanford Inn in Mendocino (very nice, but a bit stiff). We enjoyed each and every one, but my personal favourite was the Roman Spa. As already stated on this website, the Roman Spa is definitely motel-style accommodation, but it makes no pretences to the contrary. We had a family room for 5 which was great - a double bed and a separate room with 3 singles. It also had a small kitchen area. We all loved the pools, and especially the fact that they were open until 10. We lay in the pools after dinner one evening, gazing at the stars and surrounded by palm trees. We did not use the BBQ facilities as we were only there for 2 nights, but definitely would have if we had stayed longer. We only discovered the complimentary cart of tea and coffee on our last morning. My husband and I both had mud baths and massages. I agree that the spa accommodation is basic and could do with updating, but I cannot fault the service, and felt fantastic afterwards. My ongoing hip pain completely disappeared for a few days. All in all, a really relaxing place to stay. The pool are great, and the many shaded areas surrounding the pools make it a great option for families with children. Finally, it was great to stay somewhere which allowed us to walk to local restaurants, so my husband could have a glass of wine with dinner too!

It is located conveniently near the downtown area and across the street from the pioneer museum. My first visit was when I came on a holiday weekend and stayed for a long July 4th overnight and weekend visit. As a tourist on an all American holiday, I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of privacy the Roman Spa offers on even the busiest weekend of the year. How can they do this? Gardens, in a word. Gardens, lighting, and lots of patio furniture strategically placed, gives the Roman Spa an edge. Reading a book under the grape arbor, I was approached by the staff and offered a pillow for even more comfort. People can spread out and relax on the many beautiful groupings of furniture surrounding the pool, and two courtyards. The gardens enclose the Roman Spa and after years of care and attention, the palm trees, the vines, and the many flowering annuals glow with warmth that soothes the soul. As a get away, Calistoga is easy and convenient to all the wine country tours and the gourmet restaurants in the area. A short drive from San Francisco lands you in Calistoga and a half block from the main drag lands you in the Roman Spa. An asset to my stay at the Roman Spa was the fact that I book a room with a kitchen. The local Cal Mart is a short walk away and my family always goes to the store for snacks, breakfast, and lunch foods. Since we love going out to fine restaurants in the area, the kitchen offers us a chance to eat our lunch and breakfast in, while we launch out on the evening dining from our room. Since the rooms all front the beautiful courtyard and gardens, we can eat breakfast on the patio in style with our outdoor dining. On my first stay, July 4th, many fellow spa customers were grilling in the grill area and I noticed family picnics going on. None of these were obtrusive for the other guests, again due to the lovely arrangement of grouped furniture and garden surroundings. After I get to the Roman Spa, the trick is to unwind from my busy life. How do I do this? In a few words, unplug. Ok, there is a TV in each room, but mine stays off. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bring a computer with me, although my daughter brought hers and went to the local Internet caf\u00c3\u00a9 one block away from the Roman Spa. For me, unplugging is the answer to why the Roman Spa is my haven and home away from home. My cell phone is handy, but somehow is rendered less important in the setting. My favorite TV shows can wait. Yes, the Roman Spa is an oasis of calm in my busy life. I started staying on long weekends and after that first July 4th went for Labor Day and Memorial Day weekends. These busy weekends found me enjoying the pools, which include the hot tub, the swimming pool, and the indoor hot soaking pool. I swim and do laps in the morning and the pool is never overly crowded despite the busy holiday weekends. My new approach to the Roman Spa is to go more than twice a year, where I now go mid week and stay through the weekend. The pool is even more exciting when less people are in it, which is every morning at 8:00 when they open and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m the first one in. Our new technique is to go to the Roman Spa on a Wed. or Thur. and spend a while unwinding. One other thing I love about the Roman Spa is the visual stimulation of the place where you are surrounded in a bowl of beautiful mountains in the wine country. The Spa is beyond beautiful as already stated, but the close proximity to the surrounding region makes the oasis within the Roman Spa more like a jewel in a crown of beauty. Ok, the shallow part of me also loves to shop in the vintage clothing stores, buy fudge in the candy shop, and spend time picking up candles for my table at the candle store. For an ultimate relaxing weekend in a beautiful setting, pick the Roman Spa. It is the place to be for all ages. Families, couples, or even single people looking for a break and a place to think will all enjoy the Roman Spa.", "Date": "April 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cLove the Roman Spa Every time!!\u201d", "Author": "rainbowCalifornia", "ReviewID": "UR7260581", "Content": "The Roman Spa is in the heart of Calistoga, and easy to walk anywhere in town from it's convenient location.

While there are some things that are lacking about the Roman Spa, our overall experience has always been a positive one, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what keeps us coming back again and again even as other hotels and motels open up in the area. We agree with a previous poster that to characterize the rooms as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resort\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd style is an overstatement. The rooms are comfortable but quite basic, and there is nothing to suggest a resort of the type you might find in Hawaii or Mexico. There are no bathrobes and slippers; there is no deluxe bed with high threadcount sheets; the towels are adequate but not plush; and you get a simple bottle of conditioning shampoo plus a plastic tote bag for your wet swimwear rather than the array of exotic shampoo, conditioner, and lotion that you find elsewhere. We also agree with a previous poster that the air conditioning/heating unit is noisy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something we have noted for all of the years of our stays. So why do we return? First, while the rooms are basic, they are always impeccably clean. We usually get a unit with a kitchen, and that provides the convenience of being able to prepare meals and store and reheat leftovers from our meals at a local restaurant. Second, while Calistoga is not a large town, the Roman Spa is at nearly the exact midpoint. It is one short block from the commercial main street, so there is virtually no traffic or traffic noise but you are one minute from exploring the shops or heading out to dinner. Third, while the rooms themselves are very simple, I have to argue that the gardens and the pools are the main attractions. The gardens change seasonally, and they are always a pleasure. There are different areas on the property \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one with a fountain and tables where people sit and have a drink or play cards \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one with a grill where people gather to cook dinner and eat at picnic tables \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a grape arbor, which provides a shady place to relax on a recliner on a sunny day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and recliners around the outdoor pools for those who want sun. Interspersed everywhere are seasonal and permanent plantings. In winter, there are generally lots of cyclamens and poinsettias; in the spring, pots of bulbs are everywhere; in summer, there is a riot of color from a vast assortment of perennials; and in the fall, there are pumpkins and other fall color. There are three pools fed from mineral springs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a larger outdoor one that is warm enough for swimming in the winter but cool enough for lounging in the summer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a medium one indoors that is the perfect hotness for long relaxing soaks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a small round hot Jacuzzi next to the large outdoor pool for those who like it pretty hot. There are also saunas in the two bathrooms next to the medium indoor pool. As you can probably guess, when we stay at the Roman Spa, we are generally not in our room, soaking in a pool or sitting in a quite place reading a book. In conclusion, the Roman Spa is definitely not a luxury resort, but it has remained a place of rest and relaxation for us for more than two decades.", "Date": "December 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cRoman Hot Springs Is Just An Old Motel.\u201d", "Author": "rollinalong", "ReviewID": "UR6477181", "Content": "The website for the Roman Spa Motel promises gardens, spas, and \"European Style Lodging\", but it nothing more than an older motel with ordinary pools and a few plants.

This Motel needs to improve their noisy A/C units. It has poor sound insulation, and I was kept awake by other guests all during the night. The place appears to have been built sometime back in the 1960's or older, which would account for the lack of noise insulation. The pool might be heated with the aid of a natural geothermal aquafer, but the pools aren't filled with pure water from it - they smell of chlorine. We couldn't wait to leave the next morning.

(The word \"motel\" is on their sign, seen if you go directly to their site online.) This is an important distinction that I overlooked - a Motel as opposed to a Hotel - and this evidences itself in terms of austerity in accomodations. All the glowing reviews on this site caused me to abandon a more comprehensive research, so I'd like to give a very thorough review so people can make up their minds with a variety of info. I was hoping for a hot springs soak, and a rejuvenating stay at this \"resort\". I left feeling very tired and discouraged. The pros are that indeed, the staff is friendly, the grounds and rooms are clean, and the springs are used to full advantage, whether you rent a private whirlpool room as I did, or wish to avail yourself to the pool or hot tub outside. The cons of the place? I was a bit unhappy to detect the scent of chlorine in the outside pool, thinking I would be getting the same unadulterated hot spring soak as I could get in my room. It would have been easier to revel in a body of water that is \"pure\" hot springs water, rather than swimming in something with chemicals in it. But the water was nice, the moon was full, and I continued to try to get into the spirit of my retreat. Back in my room, my partner and I excitedly tried to use our new laptop for the first time...he had bid on an auction item online that was due to close. (I admit that not asking the Roman Spa Motel whether or not they had wireless internet service is my own fault, but since I've seen the rankest little motels advertising it, I erroneously assumed they would have it.) We went to the office to see if there was a complimentary PC for guests, but this was not the case either. I was also able to let this detail go, and my partner and I slipped into the whirlpool in our room. This was a nice feature, hot, pure sulpher-smelling water filled the nicely clean tub...but I was disappointed that the tub wasn't just a bit deeper. My partner and I are small people, so if you're a big guy, be advised that in a sitting position, your shoulders will be way above the water line. Scooching down into the tub, we found it difficult to find a comfortable position and hung the back of our necks on the squared edge of the tub. Romance was not to be....We retired to a hard mattress, and closed the curtains that didn't block out the light from outside to our satisfaction. During the night, we finally surrendered and shut off the window-heater-conditioner unit that vibrated and clanked every time it came on...so I woke up cold the next morning. Huddling under the blankets to attempt the last couple hours of precious rest, I was disturbed by the sounds of maids using the laundry next to my room, and the distinct sounds of another guest in an adjoining room, stirring something in a cup and speaking. I was amazed that the walls were so thin! Getting up with sore hips from the hard mattress, I searched the room in vain for a coffee maker...another amenity I guess I've been taking for granted. I guess in short, even if my destination has some charm and the draw of natural features, if I can't get a good night's rest, I won't be inclined to return.

Also, several soothing fountains, nooks and crannies everywhere! The lighting at night was delightful! Our room was amazing, spacious, clean, tastefully decorated. All was quiet and soothing.

The staff spent hours coordinating the rooms with me which seemed to change daily up to the wedding day. While we were at the resort, the staff was kind, easy-going and so accomidating. I was worried that our crazy friends would get us in trouble but it worked out so great. The pools were great, the kids loved it. The resort is centrally located to most spots in town and the wine country. The other guests included a group of fun and sweet Russians who are regulars at the spa. The place has a home-away-from-home feel to it. The rooms were super clean and no one claimed the rooms to be newer than they were. Even when I noticed my wedding dress was missing after unpacking my car, the staff helped me locate it. For other reviewers who complained about the price, I would like to say that chain hotels in the area such as the Best Western off the highway, are not any cheaper and a lot less fun and personable.

I went in to the office after 10:00 a.m. and was told no manager would be available until Monday. Why would you run a \"resort\" with no manager on site during the month of August? I called on Monday, and was told there was no manager in on Mondays! Again, no service seems to be the mantra at the Roman Spa. I do not know where the Roman Spa gets their staff, but as a small business owner, I would never put up with rude staff. I have stayed at many hotels throughout the world, and many in the Nape Valley and I can honestly say that good service can over come many flaws in the hotel busness.
