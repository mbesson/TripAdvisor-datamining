The MRT is a 5 min walk away, but if you like walking as I do you can walk to China town one way and Orchard Road the other. I ventured out at night and felt safe.

We had a confirmed booking for a deluxe Crystal Club twin room. The hotel website advertises Crystal Club rooms as \"exclusively located on the top floors\" and also states that all guest rooms \"overlook Singapore\u2019s Civic District or the lush greenery of Fort Canning Park\". Check in was friendly and efficient and we were told our room was on the 6th floor (the hotel has 10 floors) at the time we did not question this. I was surprised that we were not shown to our room, which although quite spacious and obviously recently updated, was always dark and the view was of a concrete wall. If you stood close to the window and craned your neck, you could see part of the building across the road and its carpark. Housekeeping staff and the concierge were always very helpful and friendly. Extra towels and new toilet rolls were delivered promptly, though as a previous traveller commented, toilet rolls were not replaced even when one was empty and the other almost so. The Crystal Club amenities were very good and worth the extra cost, though the staff were not as friendly/helpful as I would have expected - maybe they reserve their best hospitality for business travellers? My friend and I were there for 6 nights, but never addressed by name. After a few days we queried why we were on the 6th floor. We were told it was because there had not been any vacant twin rooms on the Crystal Club floors when we checked in, though we had not been advised of this at check in, or given the option of a king room. Fortuitously a twin room on the club floor was available so we moved and had a view! It took a while to get used to not needing to turn on the lights all the time. Overall the hotel was fine. Breakfast was very good and the hotel's location was perfect for us as we used the MRT frequently and City Hall station is only around the corner, it is also a very short walk to Clarke Quay.

The hotel staff rushed to unload the taxi before we could reach for our cases, then checked us in despite our being two hours early: luggage would be delivered to our room as soon as available, while we should relax in the spacious (and atmospheric) main hall (in fact we nipped round to Raffles Hotel 100 yards away for a nice expensive Singapore Gin Sling). On returning we found our luggage in our room which was spacious, comfortable (double king size bed!) and well-appointed. Throughout our stay nothing was too much trouble for the friendly concierge who pointed us in the direction of trips, advised on airport transfer etc etc. Breakfast was included and featured everything one could wish for - the traditional western cooked variety, different oriental specials daily, proper juices, tasty bread, croissants etc. We had little need to eat out afterwards. Other reviews comment negatively on the reception staff: we found the exact opposite - friendly smiles, help with whatever was needed and so on. We dined in one night (convinced to do so by the 20% discount voucher offered to guests). We chose the bar option which saved money as the meals seemed to arrive direct from the restaurant. My steak was one of the best i've had in years, washed down by two glasses of excellent red wine (2 for 1 happy hour offer), while a beautiful young lady sang a selection of Carpenters songs (extremely well) accompanied by a proficient pianist. Nothing is perfect of course - the bathroom decor was a little tired - but this wasn't far off; our homeward flight was at 2.00 am but the staff made the hours after checkout pass quickly by looking after our luggage, providing a free hospitality room (with shower, TV etc), summoning a taxi to the airport and again loading our luggage: all in all one of our best hotel experiences ever.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location\u201d", "Author": "Denwick", "ReviewID": "UR125736660", "Content": "This is a good hotel, very central to MRT, shopping, Boat Quay/Clarke Quay, Marina Bay not far.

The main positives for this hotel are its value for money and its location - walking distance to Clarke Quay, Boat Quay, the Esplanade and Raffles Hotel and within easy reach of Chinatown, Orchard Road and Little India (by public transport or taxi). The hotel lobby is very impressive and is quite art deco in style with lots of dark wood and rich fabrics. We were slightly disappointed with check-in as we had grown accustomed to warm welcomes across Asia and that was sadly lacking here - the female receptionist who checked us in wasted no time on pleasantries and was not exacly helpful. Check in took about 30 seconds...we were asked for a credit card and told to enter the pin into a card machine (we later found out through our internet banking that S$150 had been taken as a security deposit but it would have been nice to have been told this at the time), we were then handed a key with no explanation of how to get to our room or where the lifts were etc and the receptionist walked off without so much as an 'enjoy your stay'. I am happy to say that things got much better from this point...our room was very nice, decorated in a similar style to the main hotel areas and surprisingly spacious - the bed was HUGE. The bathroom was lovely with a great selection of toiletries and essentials plus dressing gowns/slippers etc for use during our stay. There was an iron and ironing board and a safe which was free to use. Unfortunately, the lighting in the room was very poor. Our room was a non-smoking one on the 7th floor with a nice view to the front of the hotel, be aware that the main fire and ambulance station is located here though so unfortuntely loud sirens could be heard a lot during our stay. This in itself is not the hotels fault but the soundproofing in the rooms is virtually non-existent, aside from the constant sirens, we could also hear everything from the room next door and the corridor outside plus 'chatter' coming from the street below! Breakfast was not included in our room rate and we didn't eat in the hotel during our stay as there are so many great places in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. Singapore is famous for its street food and we particularly enjoyed a couple of meals at the food court opposite fort canning park just around the corner from the hotel (its name escapes me but it was very cheap and seemed to be a favourite with the locals!) We did have coffee and cake at the hotel deli which was lovely. We didn't use the pool or leisure facilities as we had so much we wanted to see and do in Singapore...our flight was late at night on our last day so we had hoped to lounge round the pool a bit after we had checked out but we were told this was not possible as you need to be a current guest to use the facilities. The hotel did, however, hold onto our luggage all day and allowed us to use a room for 30 mins so we could take a shower and get changed. The concierge were very good and alway happy to help. There is no free wifi in the hotel but there is a cheap internet cafe minutes from the hotel (just down the escalators to the left when you leave the hotel, opposite peninsula plaza).

Grand Park City Hall will remain by best value for money and location hotel in Singapore. Taxi from the airport terminal 1 was $20. When it was time to leave Singapore I took the SMRT to the airport.

While the check-in process may have gone more or less smoothly, it was all that followed that provides the fodder for this review. 1. This old house: Bathrooms eventually smell, but this one smelled as you walked in the room. Could it have been mold? Maybe. Regardless, the bathroom needs some method of ventilation and perhaps even a mold inspector to ensure that there isn't anything else lurking on those walls. 2. In the shadows: The lighting in the room, overall, was lacking. Only during the day, when one could draw the curtains, was it possible to almost see everything in one's room. And barely. The rooms require a flashlight. 3. Drip drip: One of the joys of staying at a hotel is that you don't have to worry about all of those things that might happen at home, like a leaky faucet, or even worse, a leaky air-conditioning unit. This was not just a leak, it was a puddle that accumulated on the marble floor. Which leads to... 4. Slip and slide: Upon entering the room with the \"light\" on, and not expecting what was coming, I slipped on the puddle of water just before the carpet began. Yes, a full on fall, which could have been quite bad, had I had fragile bones or not managed to balance enough to not hit my head. 5. Horrible service: So only on the THIRD phone call did anyone bother to bring ice to the room and then that person was the one to call someone to come and fix the air-conditioning. It took THREE phone calls, after they were told, \"Someone slipped in the room due to a leak from the air-conditioner.\" You would think that a slip in anyone's property would lead to a manager coming in to check, at the very least. Perhaps even an upgrade. Free room service. Profuse apologies and the offer of getting you a doctor. But no, three phone calls later (four, if you count the one from their staff), and only then was the dripping remedied. And, no sight of a manager, at all, to see if everything as ok. So, overall, the Grand Park City Hall requires, well, too much to list.

Their prompt and swift action to arrange the check out make life so easy for me. And the moment, I step out the lift and rushing to the cab, a mr Leonard handed me a bag of morning goodies, mineral water and just steam hot dim sum, bread, cake, tissue, etc. Gosh, I was overwhelmed by their attentive care and thoughts.

I think the tonic is his smile, careful thoughts for each evening menu and etc. Thanks, mr shek for the wonderful food. And after, pop into my ever clean and cosy room for my beauty sleep.

It is a reasonably large hotel so the service is not too personal but it is efficient and the small bar is a nice place to end your evening. The breakfast buffet is good and the pool is a nice place to spend a couple of hours when you don't want to be running everywhere. The main thing is the location. You are a couple of minutes walk from City Hall MRT which can take you all over the city including straight up Orchard Road if that is you thing. Alternatively you can walk to Boat Quay/Clark's Quay in about 5 minutes and the Marina Bay area in about 10-15. This year they have free internet which is good. Just something to note that while it is WiFi in the main ground floor it is through a LAN cable in the rooms which is not great for iPhones/iPads but fine for laptops. The rooms are clean and a decent size. We were upgraded to what I think was a club room so not sure about the rest of them. The gym is also well stocked with machines and the spa is lovely.

Unfortunately they never seemed to have more than one person on reception (which was also for checking out and cashier) which caused delays. However, the reception staff were polite and helpful. I was upgraded to an 'executive room' (from Superior). Although not very large it had everything required, a large flat television and a good choice of cable channels. There was plenty of wardrobe space and I noticed it included both an iron and ironing board and a small safe. Do people really steal hangers from hotels? I am always annoyed by the two piece variety. The marble bathroom was quite big and included both a bath and separate shower. Four bath towels rather than 2 would be an improvement. The telephone was by the bed and its cord was not quite long enough to be used on the desk. If two phones cannot be justified what about one with a wireless handset so that it can be used when using a laptop at the desk? I was on the 5th floor and the window just had a view of the terrace and pool of another hotel opposite. Higher floors may have better views including over the river or bay. There was an outdoor pool (smallish) which also had a lot of engine noise from the hotel's air conditioners. There was no service to the pool area although I suppose one could ring for room service. Adjacent was a very well equipped gym. There is also a big spa facility on the ground floor which I did not try out. It would be nice if breakfast was included.

It had been many years since we had last visited Singapore (actually staying then in the Raffles which I guess was a bit more affordable at that time!) and we were keen to get a hotel in the centre of things. Our previous impression of Singapore had left us with a feeling of a \u201ccity without a centre\u201d. Not so now! Grand Park City Hall indeed seemed to be pretty much in the hub of things. Only a block or so from the Raffles and Orchard Road. Walkable to Boat Quay and Clarke Quay. Near the City Hall MRT therefore easy access to Little India, China Town, Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore Flyer (all worth a visit). The hotel clientele is a mix of tourists and business people. You can tell the before 8am breakfast diners are there to work, at later times it is more relaxed as the tourists eat. I think it is a little more geared for business clients, though we had a good time and good service as tourists too. The room we were in had a decent view and was clean and adequately roomy, though not spacious. Not a great deal of storage space though that did not affect us\u2026we only unpacked minimally as we were only there for 4 days at the end of an extended stay in the Far East. Free safe in the room but you pay through the nose for room internet access (business hotel you see!). You can find internet cafes in Little India for a tiny fraction of the hotel\u2019s room internet costs! Unless you are there on business of course when you\u2019ll need the hotel online facilities. Service in the hotel was very good. Special word for Leonard on Reception\u2026.he couldn\u2019t do enough to make us welcome. Also gave us a late checkout for a midnight flight at no extra cost as we opted for a twin room rather than a double (less in demand). The girls in the bar and in the breakfast room were also really excellent (with one exception!). Breakfasts were really good with plenty of choice. As stated earlier, the hotel location is ideal. A word of caution if using taxis though. You will always readily get a taxi from the hotel to anywhere. We did find it a problem trying to get a taxi back late evening though e.g. from Little India, where there were hundreds of taxis\u2026.all \u201cbusy\u201d. One that was \u201cavailable for hire\u201d wasn\u2019t going our way at that time! The MRT is easy to use, cheap and convenient\u2026.so I\u2019d recommend that for central areas. Singapore is very expensive to stay in, and to eat and drink. Places like the Quays are pretty pricy to eat and drink in, though worth seeing. So make the most of the various happy hours in bars, including the Bar in Grand Park City Hall. Taxis not too expensive, MRT cheap. You\u2019ll get better and cheaper meals in \u201cethnic\u201d areas like Little India and China Town. Great markets in both places too. Strongly recommend Lagnaa restaurant in Upper Dixon St. Little India for superb curries at very reasonable prices. Just don\u2019t be too adventurous on the spice level though! Other suggestions \u2013 take a bumboat river trip through all the quays to the marina, and the Botanic Gardens are lovely. Singapore is a wonderfully slick and efficient Westernised City where English is virtually universally spoken.

I splashed out a little to stay on the Crystal Club Floor, which has its own business lounge that provides cocktails and snacks from 5pm to 7pm (I say snacks, but the array of hot food was actually enough to substitute for dinner), and a varied hot breakfast buffet from 6am to 10am. Add to that the free internet and free two pieces of laundry, and soon the higher price for a club room seems much more reasonable. The hotel's location is very good, sandwiched between Fort Canning Park and the historic Padang. The MRT is just around the corner, and there is a liberal smattering of shops and restaurants within easy walking distance. The hotel lobby area is airy and light, with a cafe/bar at the far end, and plenty of reception space for checking in (although Crystal Club guests check in on the 10th floor).

We were allowed to check in earlier (2 pm) than stipulated time of 3 pm 2. Although we did not have connecting rooms, Bryan at reception kinda fall over backwards and made it happen the next day ... the downside is that we have to move all our stuff to one room the next day and check out one of the rooms (well, only the children, 11 and 16, that's why they were unhappy). 3. The concierges (day, afternoon, and night) were all very helpful and knowledgeable. Too bad I'd forgotten their names, I think one of them was Albert. 4. We were allowed late check-out for one of the rooms. We left at around 3:30 pm to go to the airport. Interesting:- 1. My spouse found the room musty, but I didn't notice anything. 2. Missing glass partition from bathroom shelf. 3. Broken door chain in children's room -- a bit of security concern, but thankfully Singapore is a safe place. 4. Decor (atrium) at breakfast location is interesting, a blend of east and west, old and new -- I believe the old and new wings were blended in. 5. Location was convenient -- a short walk to metro station, though at night, the \"sex\" signs come alive at nearby mall... OK:- 1. The breakfast service was good, selection not bad. Air-con place, no flies around. 2. The breakfast staff was very attentive -- e.g. a waitress dropped teapot (?), and immediately a few waiters rushed to help the client, and ensured he wasn't hurt by any shards, and helped moved him to sit in another location. Bad:- 1. (I didn't use nor see the pool, this was reported by husband and child.) The swimming pool was very small, like the size of a baby pool. 2.

And other interests in the surroundings are peranakan museum, bible house, Armenian Church and others which located in the green neighbourhood. The check in was smooth, with good acceptance from the front desk staff and my reservation was upgraded to be on the club floor. The room was clean but quite modest for a club floor room; seems to be in deluxe category, but I had no problem since the room and bathroom were clean. The furniture looked bit run down but overall still tolerable. The breakfast quite okay, with lots of varieties of bfast dishes. Pity they dont provide the crispy bacon again as they used to.But seem the staff in the coffee shop too busy and no smile or welcome greet addressed to us. Seems so Jaded, well very Singaporean, simple, easy and straight to the point D. This also seems to happen to the staff at the lobby except one lady that greeted us on the last day when we were rushing getting into the Chrysler taxi, she was very nice and cheerful (forgot the name). So overall, this hotel provides good service and accommodation; the improvement shall be done soon to the interior of the room and staff attitude to be more servicing.

Definitely not a 5 star in terms of quality. Even a 4 star is a bit of a stretch. We had to change rooms because of mould, a really putrid smell & flooding in the bathroom. One of my colleagues has had to change rooms twice, due to the smell. We were apparently 'upgraded' but the room is exaclty the same - just a couple of levels higher. Our current room doesn\u2019t smell as bad as the first room, but still not that nice. I think I've owrked out why it smelss so bad. I don't think they use cleaning products & the smell is from bacteria in the toilet. Although it looks clean it obviously isn't. We told the valet, when he asked, that we would like a taxi to take us to Holland Village. The valet spoke to the taxi driver in Chinese & we hopped in. We knew something was wrong as soon as we got out of the taxi. I checked out our location with GoogleMaps on my iPhone & sure enough the taxi had dropped us in Little India. My husband ordered an espresso from the waiter whilst at breakfast. After waiting 30 mins he enquired after it. Apparently they sent it to our room. When he tried to explain that he is obviously not in the room & tried to cancel the order, the staff insisted that it was on its way & they gave him a filtered coffee with milk (which is what they offer as included in the breakfast buffet) & still charged for the Espresso. He was in such a hurry & so flustered by it all he had to sign for it just to get away from there. By the way \u2013 I was in the room; the espresso never arrived. After a quick swim to cool off we discovered there was no pool towels left. So I rang from the pool/gym phone to ask if someone could restock the pool towels. They wanted to send some pool towels to the room. I tried to explain that I was already at the pool & there were more guests requiring towels. 45 mins later, towels still hadn\u2019t arrived. The internet connection is abysmal. It is like old school dial-up. The mattress on the bed is so hard, one would swear they were lying on the floor. My back is killing me.

I entered my room to find black mold on fittings , paint falling off the walls , mildew growing an all the walls.Carpet was filthy. Bathroom quality and cleanliness was also highly questionable. I went to reception to complain and was told this room was scheduled for renovation so i got upgraded to a deluxe room on the same floor. But it was highlighted this room was much bigger and i should be charged more, but this time would be charged.I thought this was OK, but also thought they had a cheek giving me the room in the first place. I got to my new room expecting some improvement. The difference was wallpaper covering the walls and had cheap ikea style furniture, the room was not much bigger than the previous . This room was equally as bad apart from the walls(wallpaper covering the mildew perhaps). Dirty bathroom , pubic hair in the sink. Cheap towels. again the presence of black mold and the carpet looked like it hadn't been hovered in a very long time. As my stay was brief , i decided to grin and bare it.

Since I had stayed in the hotel with friends the previous night I asked for an early check in the following morning. Again, the staff was wonderful and let me check in around 10am. However, when I arrived in the room I was slightly disappointed. Yes, the deluxe had much more space than the superior room, and the bathroom layout was improved, but the view was TERRIBLE. On the hotel site they say some of the deluxe rooms have a view of Fort Canning, so I was expecting somewhat of a view even if it wasn't Fort Canning. Instead I got to look at the corner of the building and a parking garage the entire trip. On top of that, we also had an ant problem in our room. In a matter of 5 minutes I had killed 10 ants and they kept coming back day after day. I was also not a fan of the bed, but I prefer soft plush beds rather than a more firm mattresses. In both the superior and deluxe rooms, there were king beds that were more like a California King. The first night with friends, we slept 3 girls very comfortably in the bed. On a more positive note, this hotel is in a GREAT location. It is very centrally located- about 10 minutes walking to bars in Clark Quay, 20 minutes walking to the marina area, and 5 minutes or less to the MRT.

Maybe star ratings have undergone depreciation. I'd not rate it more than 3. Location's great. City Hall is pretty much central to the tourist circuit with Bugis, Raffles, the Merlion, the Clarke Quay, the Esplanade, all within a decent distance. The City Hall MRT station is a 2 minute walk, so you could get to anywhere in Singapore and not be lost when you come back to the City Hall station. The Funan IT Mall is also a 2 minute walk. That said, the rooms are amateur-designed. The entrance opens into the bathroom door, which incidentally has no ventilation. So live with the Parfum de Loo while you're here. The washbasin was cracked (the cracks were cement-filled, but the cracks were on glorious display). The potty doesn't have a jet-spray or hand-shower that is critical to everyone who doesn't simply wipe and forget. The minibar did not have many of the items listed on the minibar price list. The cupboard had one door unhinged. Despite knowing that we were a married couple, they gave us separate twin beds and could not shift us to a double-bedded room. Breakfast was nice-ish but not 5-star again. I had to remind them on 3 of the 4 days to refill the bowl of honey for the waffles. Housekeeping was responsive enough, though we have no idea of the room service. For some reason, they never placed the newspaper at my door, despite reminders each day. The stay was comfortable overall, given that we spent most time touring around. But for the USD 174 they charge, I just couldn't see the value for my money.

Unlike some reviewers here, I did not experience any musty smell, moulds, stained carpets, or the hotel being stingy with the shower gels. Perhaps the hotel took notice and ratified these problems. That said, I was disappointed by the size of the room. It is a tad cramp. The mini bar area was also cramp. I had to rearrange the cups, kettle, tray, and other utensils so I had enough room to boil water and make my cup of tea! (No complimentary bottled water here) Also cramp is the shower. The shower door opens inwards, so once getting into the shower, you have to squeeze your body out of the way so that you can shut the shower door! Also cramp is the restaurant which serves breakfast. I had to navigate carefully around the serving counter so that I wouldn't bump into tables, chairs, and patrons. In all, I felt a little cramp staying here. The internet rate is cutthroat: SGD28 per day. At that price, only the desperate or ignorant would hand over their hard earned cash to surf the net. Lastly, the room TV also do not carry many channels or many varieties. In conclusion, GPCH is not quite worth the value it charges. Chris TIP: Surprisingly, many Singapore cabbies are not familiar with GPCH. So I advise you to print out the hotel's map (from their website) or carry the hotel key card (which shows the hotel's map) and show the map to the cab drivers.

It is rated as a 5-star hotel, but feels more like a 3-star hotel. The location is great and the hotel lobby looks presentable, but once you get to the hotel rooms, it is very disappointing. I have stayed in 2 rooms in this hotel during this trip and can confirm that both rooms were equally disappointing in its appearance and cleanliness. Firstly, the superior twin rooms are smaller in comparison to other Singapore hotels that I have stayed in previously. The carpet is dirty and does not appear to be vaccumed by the room service staff (we found toe nails on the carpet that remained for several days and had to pick it up and dispose of it ourselves eventually). The bathroom has no ventilation fan, hence there were appearances of mildrew and mould over the grouting and wall tiles. The TV reception for the local TV channels was poor. The mattress seems worn out - one can feel a sinking 'dip' in the middle of the mattress and I have a normal BMI (i.e. not overweight). The room service staff appears to be rather lazy. For examples, they repeatedly did not bother to tidy away and wash up the cups or rinse the kettle and do not make the beds properly on a number of occasions too. They were also very stingy when it comes to replenishing the shower gels, shampoo etc. For example, they provided one small bottle of each item to be shared between 2 occupants in the room, while most hotels would supply two of each. Thus we went out to buy our own bottles of shampoo, shower gel etc. The hotel doormen only appear interested to greet the guests when you engage their services in luggage handling/ hailing for cabs(i.e. potential to earn tips) and for the rest of my stay, they did not bother to smile or greet me or my roomate when we pass them at the hotel entrance. It was as though we were invisible! They charge a very expensive rate to use their internet services and we subsequently discovered that it was possible to get free basic wi-fi services in Singapore, courtesy of the joint effort by the telephone companies in Singapore.

Our room was clean small but enough room bathroom was quite nice, there were around 12 channels we only watched the movie channel and the australian channel as the rest were not in english lol. The pool was ok at night look alot better with the lights, spa was big for a spa and the fitness center was very good my partener approved. We had the breakfast included in our package and there is soooo much food lots of different things like noodles and lots of choices of fruit,cheese and drink. I think it cost aound $30, there bar is quite fancy no thongs or singlets and quite $$$ better to go down the road to chimes they have happy hour on all drinks at 3pm - 9pm. They have a spa there if you want to get pampered but you pay a high price $$$, they also have a koi fish pond nice to watch.

I wanted to enjoy a little comfort on my stopover back from Australia, but since hotel prices had gone up quite a bit from my last trip 3 years previously, I opted for \"only\" a 4-star to treat myself after 5 weeks in Oz. The Grand Park City Hall had a bit of a cold welcome when I arrived late at night from the airport, since no more bell staff was on duty to get my luggage. But everything was uphill from there. The \"Superior room\" was considerably bigger than the standard rooms (see floor chart on the photo), which I also saw later after check-out, with big double bed, desk area, large marble tiled bathroom and semi-walk-in closet including safe, bathrobe and slippers. Room service was both quick and very affordable, bed was great to flop down on after a stressfull day of delays and long flight from Perth. Staff couldn\u00b4t have been nore helpful. The batteries went out in my TV remote and I mentioned that on the way out to get some food, it was fixed when I came back an hour later. I asked to have my luggage stored after check-out since my flight out was late in the evening and was offered the complimentary use of a room for half an hour to refresh myself for later when I came back from my city tour and before returning to the airport. This was a standard-sized room and while I don\u00b4t know the price, I wouldn\u00b4t have felt as comfortable staying there as in the bigger one. Location is great with an MRT station round the corner, the Singapore River just a stroll down two or three blocks, Fort Canning Park round the back and Bugis Street markets about 10-15 easy minutes on foot. Two circle line city tours stop nearby, too. Shopping for electronics is a must when in Singapore and \"Funan Digital Life\" mall is just across the street. Shops there are all well stocked, layed out and have new, reputable material. A lot less busy, crowded, loud and shady then what Sim Lin Square is nowadays. Breakfast was good, less european/continental variety, more asian delicacies, good choice of cooked/fried breakfast (eggs made to order if you wanted to) and also very heavy on the sweet selection (fresh waffles, pancakes with syrup). Stuffed myself silly on the sweet stuff the first day and lived to regret it as I couldn\u00b4t bear the sight of food for the rest of the day, should have paced myself. Internet was ethernet-cable only at the desk at reasonable price (some people reported billing issues in their reviews with changing computers, it looks like the billing is based on PC/MAC-address connected, not any-number-of-computers-per-room).

It was clean, with a wide variety of choice and, again, attentive staff. The location of the hotel is good. Very close to City Hall MRT station, close to Raffles Hotel (good cocktails!) and to the Suntec convention centre. The reason my overal rating of the hotel is high is predominantly because of the staff. Two examples among many. First, I needed a large amount of photocopying done for a meeting. Despite asking for this to be done between 8pm and 9am (at a weekend) the staff took on this challenge with no hint of irritation. Indeed, the task was completed early and I'm sure at least one member of staff worked late into the night. Second, having checked out on my last day I was able, as in many hotels, to store my luggage until later in the evening as I had a late flight home. On this occasion, when returning to pick up my bags, the staff gave me complimentary access to a room so that I could have a shower and change. This made a big difference to my level of comfort as I prepared for a 12 hour flight home, and I really appreciated it. I can recommend this hotel for business travellers.", "Date": "June 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location in Singapore\u201d", "Author": "JenandBrad", "ReviewID": "UR32095130", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 7 nights and we really enjoyed our stay.

Lastly, the rooms were nice. The bathroom had a big bath in it and there was plenty of room. The only negatives that we experienced were that sometimes the tv reception was bad (not that we had much time to watch tv anyway) and that twice the water in the shower was only warm, not hot, although this was only a problem for me, not my partner.

We wanted Internet just for brief access times when buying stuff (for reviews and specs) but it became an expensive ($120) , time consuming and source of frustration exercise (and a lot of explaining to the big boss / wife). The other (minor) thing was after the countdown / new year at the hotel party - all was very well until 1AM when just when the guests were really enjoying themselves with most old and young dancing the floor, the band / organiser got tired or bored (who knows) and decided to suddenly close it off !!! , even if initially when asked, the hotel personnel said that the party will go on until 2AM or later if the guests are enjoying.", "Date": "January 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manila, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cA Grand Time at the Park\u201d", "Author": "jatv", "ReviewID": "UR23121846", "Content": "Stayed at the Hotel for three wonderful nights and enjoyed every minute of it.

The whole experience raised questions as to what the hotel staff should do or could do when faced with unreasonable customers who nevertheless bring their custom. Surely, they can't be tolerated to no end. Upon walking to my room, I found it was a very long walk from the lift.

Also, Clarke Quay is quite closeby. Furthermore, there is a central MRT station 2mins walk away, which means that it's easy to get almost anywhere in Singapore quite quickly. My room partly had a good view of the city but was also opposite a very old office building block which wasn't that pleasant a sight. Check-out was another weak point, I was immediately behind customers who took more than 15 mins to check in so was forced to wait a while, I just can't understand how it could take that long to check somebody into their rooms. The staff member manning the entrance went to the front desk and assisted another customer who arrived in the other queue after I had arrived and upon assisting this customer, left to man the front entrance again leaving me in the lurch.

I was then given a room of which my security card did not work and after trying for about 10mins decided to return to reception yet again. I actually found this quite amusing with reception looking very worried - they where ever so helpful in getting the problem sorted and also gave me free drink vouchers in their cafe/bar.

As we expect to be travel to Singapore more often in the near future, we will most certainly stay with them again (we've stayed with Copthorn Orchid and Waterfront before .... they simply don't compare .... different league all together) and we have no hesitation to recommend Grand Plaza Park Hotel City Hall to family, friends and colleagues.", "Date": "February 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Queensland, Australia", "Title": "\u201cSuccessful stopover hotel\u201d", "Author": "heggos", "ReviewID": "UR13189555", "Content": "We chose the Grand Plaza Park from the hotels on offer with the Singapore Airlines stopover package, after researching on Trip Advisor. Our stopover was on the return leg of our trip to Europe (flying back to Australia from Paris). We wanted a hotel that would provide a double and a twin room on a non-smoking floor(we are a family of 4), in a fairly central area (so we could walk to Chinatown, Little India, Clarke and Boat Quays etc), and with late check-out (as our flight out of Singapore was at 9.10 pm). We also wanted a hotel that would be pleasant enough to spend all weekend in, if we just wanted to hit the beds and stay there! (not knowing how tired we would be feeling after four weeks away and a number of flights). Our flight to Singapore got us in very early on a Saturday morning, so we were at the hotel at about 8.00am. The twin room was ready, and the staff were happy for us to move into it and wait for the double to be ready (suggesting that would be by 12.00 midday). Our teenage daughters went straight to bed, and my husband and I went for a walk to Chinatown. When we got back to the hotel at about 11.00, our room was ready. We found both rooms to be spacious, clean and well-presented, with very nice bathrooms. The beds were comfortable, and both rooms had pleasant views over the pool side of the hotel (we were on the 7th floor; the hotel is not too large with only 10 floors). We found all the staff at reception to be friendly and helpful, quick to offer assistance with luggage and with directions. Enjoyed the pool Saturday afternoon, after a walk to Little India and some hawker market food. After a really nice night out on the Saturday night (with a walk to Clarke Quay and dinner at Lotus Grill) we slept in til late on Sunday, checked out at 12.00, left our luggage in the reception area, went out for brunch at a sushi place nearby, then hung around the hotel for the afternoon. My husband and I had massages at the Spa attached to the hotel, leaving us time for happy hour drinks at the hotel bar before our transfer to the airport. This was a pretty idyllic stopover, and means that I will now never do a long haul flight again without breaking it up with some rest and relaxation!", "Date": "February 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rolle, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cExcellent upper mid class for business or pleasure\u201d", "Author": "Shaun321", "ReviewID": "UR12811461", "Content": "Stayed for 4 nights on business January '08.
