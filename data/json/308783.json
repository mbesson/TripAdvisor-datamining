{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Absolute Gem of a small hotel Discovered this hotel while staying at Febris hotel through word of mouth from the Aussies that were staying there and booked myself in for 3 nights.The hotel is situated in Tuban and is central for Kuta Beach and is a very good base to stay.The hotel is 50 yards away from Febris Hotel and is a sister hotel.I checked into the room and was quite impressed as it had a fridge like febris that you store all your beers in The only drawback with this hotel was the bathrooms which do need upgrading but this is a budget hotel.The swimming pool is not very impressive but you can use the pool at Febris Hotel which is much better.The food in the hotel is very good and i did not have one bad meal there.The are around Tuban is very good with plenty of bars shops.My favourite was the Irish pub called gracie kellys that was attached to the Bali Dynasty Resort and the food was very good pub fayre and very well priced.Next door is a very good Indian Restaurant called the Queens Tandoor which served very good Indian food.The Green Garden was probably one of the best hotels i have stayed in.The staff make the place and were genuinely the most friendly hotel staff i have ever encountered .Thank you for a very good holiday will be back next year", "Date": "Dec 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR178793479", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Mickytraveller"}, {"Content": "Loved it so much I went back twice!

Not only did we get rooms for US$33 per night, they provided complimentary transfers, to and from the airport, and included daily breakfasts.The Hotel is situated in close proximity to Kuta and to all shopping amenities such as stalls, shopping centres etc. I have to admit when I arrived I thought I had severly blundered after walking up the dimly lit, aged staircase. This was to be a temporary feeling after checking into our rooms, complete with balcony overlooking the pool (rooms 31  32). The rooms are tidy and very well kept and maintained. We only had one problem with the airconditioning and the hotel staff couldnt get there quick enough to fix the problem. They are constantly upgrading facilities.The pool is shaded a bit from the hotel but we found this to be an advantage. While we were in Bali the temperature was very humid (isnt it always) and we found that most of the pools were overheated. This turned to our favour as the pool was always refreshing and inviting. It certainly wasnt cold. It doesnt have a swim up bar but does have seats and ledge in the pool for you to sit and drink your own cans.The biggest plus for this hotel was the service. I have stayed at many hotels from 2 to 5 star. Nothing beats the service at this hotel.Restaurant: Apart from breakfast the hotel attracts a lot of passing tourists for its meals. As they say, eat where there are a lot of people. This is a definate dinner hotspot. Recommendations: We had elderly couples to newly weds and wedding parties staying here while we where there. Everyone had only good words about their accommodation. I was shocked to realise that the hotel was in full capacity because it was so peaceful and quiet most of the time. Yes, we had a couple of power outages whilst we were there but their backup generator always kicked in to make for business as usual.This is the best value for money hotel stay that i have ever enjoyed. If your not happy with the room please tell them because there service is without question.  Please Enjoy your stay at this hotel.....We did!!!", "Date": "Nov 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR648700941", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Chizzel"}, {"Content": "hmmm mixed feelings really Not so good but great for the price.

Close enough to walk to Kuta and yet far enough away to get some peace and quiet. Pool is perfect, but you also have use of the larger pool at the sister hotel (which is just across the road). Food is good and good value for money. The girls at reception are very helpful. I arrived in the late evening for check in and was allocated room 38. When I opened the balcony there was no view; well a view of a wall of the adjacent building. I was told I couldn't move rooms there and then but to ask in the morning. The room was so dark in the morning I made up my mind that if I didn't get a new room I would move hotels. Why go to Bali for a holiday and wake up to a dark room, and have a view of a wall! Anyway; the lady at reception was very helpful and I moved rooms by 10 am. The new room was such an improvement. I was glad to give the hotel a second chance.If you arrive early; make sure you don't get these rooms.

Booked via Expedia and, as a first time visitor to Bali, wasn't sure what to expect. GG was fabulous! - from the A/C pick up at the airport to the welcoming and efficient reception staff. Room 39 was perfect for a single traveller. Typically Balinese, huge with a good bathroom - little dated, but very clean and everything worked very well. Lots of nice touches with the frangipani on the daily linen changes, safe, satellite TV, hairdryer, laundry, library, pool towels and fresh bottled water in the room fridge each day. The courtesy massage/pedicure was brilliant, pool was fantastic and the staff and service were exceptionally good. Worth noting that GG restaurant was the busiest on the strip with no-resi diners - so they must be doing something right. Lots of nice extra touches - the staff air the rooms each day and then return at teatime to close up and put \\the A/C on for you - perfect after a tropical day out! I stayed for 10 days and came home ultra relaxed! The ambiance of the GG, and the staff, who really do treat you as a guest, not a room number, was tremendous. I met lots of likeminded people and made some good friends!Visit Samur beach and Jimburan for beach dining at sunset - perfect bliss! Volcano tour, Culture park, bird/reptile park and monkey forest are all trips well worth haggling for a car and driver for a half days trip.. and do have a fresh pineapple cut for you on the beach..it will melt in your mouth.Next time I go, I will turn up in a cossie and sarong, with just my passport and an ATM card. For the uninitiated, Bali is the home of very good quality designer knock offs and everything is SO Cheap! The only advice I will give to first time visitors is to be aware that you will be hassled by the street/beach traders when you visit the markets and Kuta beach - stay polite but firm if you're not interested....", "Date": "Nov 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR302206902", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Soosethree"}, {"Content": "Excellent If you want a cheap hotel in Kuta, look no further. Lovely big rooms, good cheap food, nice pool, no complaints at all. Very clean, staff are fantastic, ended up being great friends after just 10 days. It also has two sister hotels, Febri's which is almost opposite and the Green garden beach resort, just a few hundred metres away. Both equally as good and available for you to use the facilities. Febri's has a wonderful large swimming pool which we tended to use more that ours, but only because the sun shone over it all day and there was some shade at ours. The hotel will provide free transport to/from airport so DO NOT book the taxi option which Expedia offer (if of course you book through Expedia!). Reason for the holiday was to meet my daughter who was 22 while we were there. I mentioned this to the hotel (she WASN'T staying there) and they made her a cake (see pics), decorated the table etc accordingly. Nothing was too much trouble for them.

I was impressed with service and cleanliness of the room but that's about it. They put me in room #29, which was at the very end on the second (top) floor. The noise was horrible during the day with constant construction. The night time was fine but from 10am to maybe around 5, the noise was horrible. I am very easy going so i usually overlook this stuff but this was beyond reasonable. I didnt change the room because I never stayed at the room during daylight until my last two days there. Location - was okay i suppose but I didnt really like it either. Discovery mall was within walking distance but you really need taxi to get anywhere besides that. you definitely need taxi late at night as street is very empty and dark. I would have much preferred staying around Legian for location. TV - they had cable with CNN, ESPN, HBO and Cinemax. Pretty good listing.I also had major problem with bees. Bees were hovering in front of my room after 10pm. There were alots! But then, i think this is a problem only i had in my room. I never used the pool but it looked fine and they were keeping it clean everyday. Breakfast had pretty good choices but the quality wasnt all that great. I stayed at cheaper hotel in Legian before and had better quality breakfast. Restaurant - I never tried the hotel restaurant but i noticed they had live music and very lively atmosphere all around the open air restaurant.

When my boyfriend and I arrived at the Green Garden, we were immediately taken in by the warm staff, relaxing restaurant, and lovely, open lobby.

Make sure if you are travelling from very far away (I flew from the US), say no to the offering of a warm stone message on the legs.

From the moment we arrived we were treated to the best in balinese hospitality.The room was a decent size, clean and with a comfortable bed. The bathroom was a bit dated but was ok. The air conditioning was fantastic, and so quiet (quieter than a lot of 4 and 5 star hotels I have stayed in). The walls were a little thin and noise travelled easily through the walls, the pool area (which was very nice) also acted like a mini ampitheatre so I would make sure to take some earplugs next time to help me get the extra few hours in the morning that you need after a late night!The breakfast was good if you like Indonesian food (Fried rice and fried noodles - fantastic!) but the one time we ate there in the evening it was pretty average.We rented a car with a driver through the hotel to take us on a tour of the island (to Ubud and down to Ulawatu and Dremland beach). The cost for a driver and taxi for 8 hours was just \u62e220!! I would definitely recomend that you do this on at least one day.We also used their spa (located down the road) and took advantage of their in-house 3 hour deal for \u62e215. What they dont tell you is that as a guest of the green garden you can use these facilties for free whenever you like (much bigger pool, jacuzzi, steam room and sauna) so make sure you get down there to check it out!I would definitely stay there again and are planning another trip in July, this time we will stay in green garden for one night and then move to ubud (amazing place - one hour from kuta) and then up to mount Batur to catch the sunrise at the top of the volcano before moving back to the green garden before we go home.
