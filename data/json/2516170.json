Location: right off I-17. IHOP in walking distance. Restaurants and a huge Wal-Mart a mile away. Loved Mellow Mushroom for grinders, pizzas, pitas... Check-in: easy. Rooms: modern, nice furniture, large TV, wireless service. Only 60 rooms have a small fridge, so if you need one, ask for it in advance. Workout room: small. 2 treadmills, 2 ellipticals and free weights Pool: shared with neighboring hotel. Whirlpool. Chaise lounges have cushions (they need to be replaced), however, pool towels are accessible at the pool gate and will cover the cushions. If bringing beer, I would recommend cans and not glass. The front desk asked if the beer in my hand (glass) was from the pool...of course I said No. :) Smaller basketball court~basketball available at front desk. Bar: Opens at 5pm. No food available. Breakfast: not complimentary. Nice service though here! Buffet includes, eggs, bacon, oatmeal with fresh berries, waffle station, bagels, juices. Again, the customer service from every staff member was wonderful! Thank you, Grace, for all your efforts in finding out how much it would cost to clean my dress. The front desk called me to let me know the price FIRST and to see if I still wanted to have the dress pressed via their laundry service. So thoughtful to check with me first! And the front desk staff was always smiling!", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "cstoutMn", "Title": "\u201cVery Good Time At The Marriott!\u201d", "Author": "cstoutMn", "ReviewID": "UR120584327", "Content": "Stay here for my son's baseball tournament.

I wanted a small refrigerator in the room, and the staff told me that if it was available they could get me one, and they did. This hotel and the residence inn which is next door are fantastic!!

I was traveling all over the Phoenix area, so I needed a nice, clean hotel not far off the interstate. This was exactly what I needed. I normally don't stay in suburban areas like this, but like I said I was traveling all over and wasn't at my hotel much beyond sleeping and eating breakfast. The hotel was very clean, the free breakfast was good (for what it is), and the staff was nice. My room overlooked the pool area (which I didn't use), so it got a little noisy at some points. While this wasn't enough to bother me, you might want to request a room not facing the pool if you think it would be an issue for you. There's just about every chain restaurant you can think of in the immediate area (again, this isn't something I normally look for), but if you want to go more intown it's maybe a 20 minute drive -- not bad. I'd definitely stay here again.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cexcellent stay\u201d", "Author": "cc41", "ReviewID": "UR97764310", "Content": "We stayed here the first night of our AZ vacation.

The service staff was helpful and always asked if we needed anything. We requested two cribs for our room and they were already set up when we got there a long with extra sheets and pillows.The room was very clean and everything is still new. We were in town for Spring Training, so it was a little farther drive since it's on the north side of Phoenix. The extra drive was worth it because the surrounding area was very nice and safe. All new chain stores and restaurants nearby. Made our family feel very comfortable and had everything we needed nearby. A nice sized heated pool and spa that is shared with the Marriott Residence Inn next door, perfect for our entire family. Bed was very comfortable and shower was perfect. They had an all you can eat breakfast bar for $9.50 per adult. All kids under 12 were free when with an adult. Not the greatest food, but definitely did the job on days we wanted the convenience. Make your own waffles, cook to order eggs and all the other normal breakfast buffet items. Air conditioning worked well. Free wireless and wired internet worked great. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family.

It's about 1 mile at most from the interstate (I-17), so there was no traffic noise at all. The Courtyard is separated from the Residence Marriott by the swimming pool and basketball court. The pool is bigger than normal because both of the hotels use it. The beds and bedding are phenomenal in the Marriotts, in case you haven't stayed in one for awhile. The room was plenty big for the four of us (2 adults, 2 kids over 10), pool was great for the kids, and they had a basketball court/tennis court as well. We had wireless internet in our room, as well as HD flat screen with plenty of channels. The front desk staff was extremely friendly and helpful; above and beyond really. The drawback would be no continental/free breakfast, but there was a small restaurant on-site. I believe breakfast was $9.95. Clearly the fact that no breakfast or meal was included didn't make us not want to stay there....that was a choice we made. That said, there were plenty of places around the hotel, particularly a brand new Paradise Bakery & Cafe in Norterra just about 2 minutes from the Courtyard. This is an area that seems to be relatively new and is going to be growing. The Norterra at this point has very few shops open, but no doubt within 6 months, it will be completely full. We stayed at this Courtyard for $180.00 per night during spring break time, and I booked using AAA on the Marriott.com website. That's a little steep, as there was a Fairfield Marriott down south about 5 miles that had a nightly rate of $151.00 and included a free breakfast, but we stayed there last year and we wanted to try somewhere new. I think if the price was right next year, we'd opt to either stay here again or right next door at the Residence. I don't think you could go wrong with either of them.", "Date": "March 27, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Courtyard Phoenix North / Happy Valley", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d866698-Reviews-Courtyard_Phoenix_North_Happy_Valley-Phoenix_Arizona.html", "Price": "$102 - $159*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2029 Whispering Wind Drive</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Phoenix</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">AZ</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">85085</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2516170", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ad/c3/adc3591be2d0ca8d27e13a5d2af7deae4large.jpg"}}
