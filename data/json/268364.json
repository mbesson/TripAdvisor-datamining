Plus it was very quick to get & leave your car. Coming in from the main highway, when you pass the hotel take the first right onto St Mathieu and leave the car there while you unload. It is also very easy to get your bearings from Sherbrooke. I was able to find everything from here and it is literally two street turns from the highway. If you are visiting either Concordia University or McGill the location is ideal. And if you are a \"foodie\" from the states - it couldn't be more simple to pass the Atwater Market on your way home from here to stock up on Quebecois specialties. We were upgraded to a deluxe double which was very large and full of light. While the decor was a bit dated - we found it charming & comfortable.

It is a bit further west than the properties i normally choose. I almost always stay at Starwood properties and have stayed often at Le Centre Sheraton and the Westin. Le Meridien is very close to the Guy-Concordia subway stop which is very convenient, especially in the winter. It is only a couple of blocks away from la rue Ste Catherine which is full of shops. There are two economical ways to get to this property and both start with the 747 bus service. This service costs $8. The ticket is valid for 24 hours for all of the buses and metros within the city. I was staying for three days so I bought the three day pass for $16. !) The first way to get to the hotel is to get off of the 747 at the first stop which is the Lionel Grioult subway station. Here you can take the green line two stops to the Guy-Concordia subway stop. If you exit the subway stop on St Matthieu you need only walk up the street a short way to Sherbrooke and turn left to find the hotel. 2) The second way to get to the hotel is to take the same bus to the second stop which is rue Guy. From here you walk uphill past several side streets and three major streets (and past the Guy-Concordia subway stop) to Sherbrooke where, on the left, you will find the hotel. This might be a nice walk in the Spring, Summer and Fall but is not advised in the middle of winter. it's survivable but not fun when schlepping a suitcase. Of the three Starwood properties in which I have stayed in Montreal I would recommend both le Meridien Versailles and the Westin. - Le Centre Sheraton is huge, you will often need to wait in line to speak with their rather brusque staff-members, the Platinum lounge is very large but the staff in the lounge are unwelcoming. The rooms are a nice size but the ceiling is poured concrete - a very ugly industrial look from the 70s which made me feel cold and uncomfortable. - The Westin is also large and seems to host many conventions. The great advantage to this hotel is that it is located immediately next to the subway (Place d'Armes) and also immediately next to Old Montreal with its myriad of restaurants. The rooms are all standard Westin rooms, very comfortable and modern. You will also need to stand in line to speak with anyone at the front desk or concierge. I remember asking the concierge this summer for information about the film festival which was taking place that week and she didn't know what I was talking about. She pulled up the website and started reading to me. I was expecting to receive some type of handy pocket-sized guide. - Le Meridien Versailles is much smaller with almost no lobby and the rooms are rather out-of-date. The bathroom is very 70s chic but everything worked fine. The staff are the saving feature of this hotel. They were all very kind and accessible. Overall, Le Meridien Versailles is fine if you are spending three or four days in the city for business. It is often more affordable than the Westin and the subway is only a short distance away. if I were visiting for touristic reasons and could get a good rate at the Westin I would prefer its location, next to Le Vieux Montreal.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding Service\u201d", "Author": "Harry F", "ReviewID": "UR123076991", "Content": "I stay regularly at this hotel when I teach in Montreal.

As tourists we found the location was not particularly suitable. Although one of the important galleries was quite nearby most of the places we wanted to see were quite a distance from the hotel and as we prefer to explore on foot it made for a lot more walking than we preferred. We also found it difficult to find decent reasonably priced food near the hotelt. Plenty of cheap student food of poor quality and very expensive restaurants, but nothing in the middle. We were particularly disappointed in the lack of French bistro style eating opportunities in the area. Unfortanately the lack of a choice of dining opportunities at the hotel was a problem also as there wasn't a suitable place to go for a coffee or a light snack. This was particularly a problem when we came in at night and didn't want to go directly to the room. The room was ordinary even though it was an upgrade. The bathroom fittings were a little dodgy but worked. It was very dark and the fact that it overlooked a lane didn't help. There was a bit of a privacy problem in that the room looked straight across the lane into private dwellings. . The staff were very good - always polite and helpful. The desk staff quickly amended an incorrect entry on our account when it was pointed out. I would not recommend the hotel to tourists although it is a good value for money if you are travelling on a budget. But, as someone who has travelled extensively on business I would recommend it as an excellent option. Very good value for money and well located for business I would imagine.

The Le Meridien Versailles was not up to the same standards as the Westin or Sheraton, and I think this is because of the age of the hotel. I stayed in a regular king-size room on the third floor. As others have noted the hallways are very narrow, and as such you do hear quite a bit of noise in your room at all hours. The bed was comfortable....not quite Westin standards, but comfortable. My room had a particularly noisy heater. When it came on, it banged, and rattled while it was on, and then when it shut off, it gave a large hisss. I lived with it for the first night, and was so tired the next day I just collapsed into bed and forgot to request a change or room. I really couldn't be bothered to get changed again, re-pack, and change rooms, so I endured the hissing/banging for the rest of the night. When I checked out in the morning, the front-desk staff asked if I had any issues. I usually just say no, but remembered to mention the heater. They were quick to respond to say they would have a technician look at it. At the same time they admitted their heaters are very noisy, and replacing them is quite expensive. They claimed they have started to do so, but started with the top floors first (I think there are 14 floors). I was on the 3rd floor. The area was convenient for my business. The internet worked reasonably well, and as mentioned the bed was comfortable. I also found the sound-scape in the elevators quite interesting. I wasn't aware the hotel room keys would let you into the art museums until I started writing this post, and then read previous reviews. As such, I would say the front desk could have done a better job here. The art galleries are about a 10-15 minute walk away, so this would have a been a big plus...even for business travellers.

I had last visited the Meridien about 5 years ago. Location The Meridien is located in the \"Concordia University\" vicinity so the area is a bit run-down. Lots of cheaper food offerings but St Catherine's does get a bit \"rough\" later at night. The Meridien itself is well located near the Guy-Concordia metro entrance. Rooms As a SPG Plat, I received a suite during my 1st stay and a regular room on my 2nd stay. To be fair to the hotel, they had upgraded me to a suite on my 2nd stay but it wasn't ready. I decided not to wait for it and took the regular room instead. As others have mentioned, the rooms are showing its age. Yes, they probably are in need of renovations. Yes, there were spots where I could see the wallpaper peeling away. However, it's also worth mentioning that this is the most value-priced Starwood hotel in Montreal. Given the inevitable raise in pricing after a renovation, I'd choose to leave it as it is. Also, given the area, I'm not sure a higher priced hotel could be supported. For the suite, it was really just a large room. There wasn't any separation with the \"living room\" as there were just sofas added to the end of the bed. My HVAC wasn't working when I arrived so I had to call down to the front desk to have someone come up and turn it on. I thought this was poor planning as they knew I was coming in. There was also a small \"kitchen sink\" area beside the bathroom - probably because the bathroom sink is really small. The bathtub was actually a jacuzzi with a makeshift shower curtain around it. Water pressure was decent although earlier claims of hard water build-up was evident. For my regular room, there was a separate area between the entrance and the bedroom where the fridge, safe, and hangers were located. Other than that, I thought it wasn't too much different from the suite, except for the size. Restaurant As a SPG Plat, continental breakfast is included. 5 years ago, the buffet had a hot option where I could be upcharged. Now, there are no hot items so it's not even an option. A bit disappointing but otherwise indicative of the economic downtown. Service This is where I think the hotel really shines. The front desk folks were extremely helpful and did their best to answer my offbeat questions. The wait staff in the restaurant were also exceptional. Final thoughts Would I come back? Yes. Would I recommend a colleague? Yes, but I'd warn him beforehand. Tips The area is loaded with ethnic restos but I found it extremely difficult to find healthy food.

If you are looking for luxury - this is not the place. We have stayed at a 3 star hotel with better presentation and for less money. This a 3 star hotel charging 4 star price - My impression was that they spent so much money modelling the main entrance, they forgot about the actual rooms. We also received a noise complaint but not until the following morning. The next night we were aware that the walls were thin, so we kept it to a low whispering. Even then we received a noise complaint, saying we were heard talking loudly. The walls are very thin. Management is not very professional or courteous and lacks manners. More training with customer complaints could be beneficial. The best thing about this hotel is the house keeping department. Rooms were clean and everything neat. (Except for a forgotten already- filled out survey left from the previous people - which had also said the rooms were small). I had forgotten some items at the hotel, and housekeeping were kind enough to set it aside for a couple of weeks. The lady in house keeping was more professional and friendly than front desk staff. They should get a raise just for knowing how to speak with customers.

John at the front desk allowed me to check in 3 hours prior to my reservation and another staff (I think his name is Stephen with a dark beard) provided a late check-out til 2 pm on the date of our departure, as well as, luggage storage as we went out for dinner on our last night in downtown. The hotel itself is on a smaller scale with limited facilities (no pool but a small gym/sauna and business lounge plus a separate restaurant that does not provide room service.) However, when we felt like dining in our room, the front desk staff again came to our rescue by making recommendations on places that deliver. (TIP: Call Angelo's for Italian food, they had a huge selection with very good service.) The room size is adequate although the bathroom is a bit tiny. I would recommend that the hotel invest on upgrading the bathroom fixtures in the near future. Housekeeping worked around the clock so that we were not disturbed when we wanted to sleep in on the weekends. My kids get a kick out of the funky \"glowing\" elevator with nature music.

He remembers our names and warmly greets us when we arrive! The rooms are comfortable, with very comfortable beds, but are alittle worn. There was a hole in one of the sofa arms and the carpet was stained. The hotel has not kept up with its competition, at least its competijtion here in the states. Internet in the room is a stiff extra charge, there is no microwave in the room (you have to pay extra for one), and the fridges are tiny and old. The one in our suite was not working when we arrived and had to be replaced. The worst is the tv. I do believe the equipment is the same as it was 15 years ago, and the choice of channels and movies is pathetic. The hotel has tried to make itself over an an \"art\" hotel. Whoever did the design for the lobby should be fired. It is pathetic and cheap looking. Also, the elevators now are lighted by \"black lights\" (remember the 1960s?) and have water sounds piped in. What exactly is this supposed to do? The old elevators were classic, wood paneled and you had enough light to even see the buttons to push. We didn't even bother with the hotel dining room. They used to include breakfast as part of the room rate and it was a terrific buffet. Again, they could learn something from the states where this is the norm. Now the food is overpriced and not very good. We walk two blocks and have a wonderful breakfast and a hot cafe au lait at a Premier Maisson (a great bakery and food chain) for half the price. Again a makeover to make the restaurant look \"hip\" has flopped. No one goes there and why should they? There is so much better food in Montreal. Overall, the hotel is comfortable with a nice staff, but there is so much more that could be done with this place.

As it was a king bed, I slept well, using a flat portion of the bed, but if my wife had come along, there would have been a definite problem. A medium issue I had was with the sofa set, which was uncomfortable to sit on and worn/dated. A minor issue was that the television was the boxy kind and a bit outdated. The bathroom was OK - and I did use the soaker tub which was a very good size for soaking in. Overall, I would recommend this hotel - very easy to get to and a bit different. I would recommend a bed check upon arrival, as that is a critical item that can make or break a stay. It is well priced for what it is and if I had a comfortable bed, it would have been the perfect stay.

The location was fine for our purposes, but it may be a little far from some of the downtown areas depending on what you're planning on doing. At the end of the day, I would stay at a different hotel next time just to try something different. If the price was right though, I would have no problem staying here again. Overall, I would give it 3.5 stars.

The Meridien is one subway station from where the Sheraton was at Guy-Concordia. Taking the Saint-Mathieu exit and walking 2 short blocks up to the Sherbooke street and the Meridien is right at the corner to welcome you. The lobby is small but tastefully decorated akind to a W but with less hip and flair. Our check-in was quick and my request for a king bed was replied with a quick ackowledgement that we have been upgraded to a Junior Suite. A quick ride on the tight elevator and we arrived in our room. The check-in agent was right, this room is quite nice. The room is in a dark slate color that is the hip color of the day. It makes to room feels cozy and fresh despite the large room dimension. Windows abounds in this corner room and daylights easily fills the room at any time. From the looks of things, the carpet and the furnitures the room just have been refurbished. The room is tastefully decorated to be a up-to-date European styling. The king bed has 2 of the most thick and soft duvet pillows that I have experienced lately. The bed cover and blanket is also in full duvet and makes for wonderful night sleep. There is a comfy sofa chair and coffee table for a good reading place. The workdesk is tucked quietly into one corner of the room. Rounding out the rest of the suite is a TV/drawer combo which the old TV is the weak point of this room. The closet is roomy with a minisafe and the usual board and electric iron. There is a mini-sink right next to the minibar and cupboards are abound here but unfortunately no microwave oven or any utensiles. The bathroom is a good roomy size with its own thermostat which is a great things since the having a cold bathroom in the winter is no fun thing. There are not much to fault the bathroom except of the crack mark in the sink and the not so clean jet water cover. Did I mention that the bathtub is a roomy jacuzzi? The bath amenities are CrabTree & Evelyn, the same line that Hilton uses except that these are aloe vera based products. The Bronte reataurant downstair is one of the good restaurant in Montreal but unfortunately for us it was closed to the public as the chef is on vacation. We did have our breakfast there and although there are good choices for the continental breakfast: cheses, fruits, cereal and some cold cuts (salami, smoke salmons and quiche), they were not too exciting. We were not sure if the quality is due to the fact that the restaurant is closed to the public or not. The staff is wonderful and service is always very friendly and personal. Due to its boutique style, we always get welcome smile and words everytime we were downstair. The restaurant service is also excellent and friendly. The location of the Meridien while not as central as the Sheraton, it is just blocks away from good and decent price restaurants. The subway station itsself habors some homeless but inoffensive citizens. We were at no time feels threaten. The Meridien is a better choice than the Sheraton unless you have to stay a bit closer to downtown core.

We like to travel and try to stay in 5 star accommodations at 3 star prices, just like the rest of you! We booked this hotel through our Starwoods points program so we stayed for free for 5 nights. Accordingly, keep in mind that had we paid full dollar for our accommodations, perhaps we may have been a bit more nitpicky. Overall, we think this hotel is a nice pick for Montreal and serves as a nice home away from home. The hotel is on the west edge of downtown, within easy walking distance to the Museum of Fine Arts and shopping on St. Catherine Street. The Metro Station is one block away as well as a convenience store for snacks. Not walking distance to the Old Port district (at least for average travellers like us....and we actually enjoy walking), but the Metro makes it relatively easy to get around anywhere in Montreal. Definitely not quite a high end full service hotel, but is more like a upper-middle end boutique. Do not expect a high end, luxury hotel. There is limited room service during the operating hours of the attached restaurant (Bronte), no pool, limited gym facilities. The buildling seems quite old and the decor needs updating, but is decorated in a tastefully traditional way. The elevators are very small and a bit slow, but adequate. What the hotel may have lacked in updated luxury, however, it more than made up for with great service. We were greeted very nicely upon every morning departure, provided with friendly sightseeing advice when we asked for some, and were given prompt attention when we needed anything. With our points, we were able to book a top floor Executive Junior Suite overlooking Sherbrooke and St. Matthieu, continental breakfast included (fresh fruits, juices, coffee, tea, breads, croissants, cheeses, cold cuts, cold cereals, yogurt, egg casserole, and even smoked salmon a few mornings). I believe the cost would have been around $279 per night, which we would have considered a bit expensive for this hotel, but not out of line. For comparison purposes, we also spent 3 nights in Old Quebec City at the Auberge St. Antoine for $299 per night (a true boutique gem if you plan to stay in Old Quebec City) and the Le Meridien really pales in comparison. Interestingly, the Le Meridien Versailles actually made the cover of the periodical Resorts & Great Hotels...a distinction the hotel does not want lost on the guests.....since a copy of the magazine is prominently placed on the desk of your room. In sum, this is a nice hotel that is adequate in every respect. We would return and stay there again. Hope you found this review helpful.

You just have to give the front desk 5 - 7 mins advance notice when you want the car. The only other alternative we could see was an outdoor carpark where it is $8 for 24 hours but every time you bring the car in and out you have to pay the $8 again.

The room was smallish but had what you needed, very comfortable bed, desk, tv and adequate bathroom. We were on the 9th floor and our view was just of the street.

Even though our confirmation had it written we were denied. The clerk at the desk said that she would look in to it and we never heard from the front deak again. After getting our keycards I walked in on a man in his underwear shaving in the bathroom and his wife in her nightgown staring at me. I was so shocked!

I had to give an extra 1000 points to stay in this upgraded room. Our friends were on the 11th floor in room 1158 right below us. The only difference between our two rooms was that ours had crown moulding and was decorated in beige and theirs was decorated in grey/charcoal. As an interior designer myself I was shocked to find out that when I called to inquire as to why I had paid more then my friends I was told it was because of the decor! Shocking! I should mention that we had to use our room key in the elevator because we were on a high security level. In the eveinings we could use the stairs to get our friends floor and go up and down that way instead of the elevator. That is the security I paid extra for, yeah, okay.

Take your own kettle and some plastic plates and knives and forks as we did, so we could make breakfast and supper by buying things in the local grocery stores including a 24 hour one which was very useful. The hotel does have an excellent restaurant which has an internationally well known chef, but it was quite expensive and there are lots of cheaper places all around the hotel The room was a wonderful oasis to return to after long days on a coach. We stayed for 3 nights and could have stayed longer. Had a meal in Chinatown which was excellent and very cheap. Montreal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s China town is not large but we really enjoyed eating with the local Chinese families. The open topped tour bus was interesting but Montreal held no charms for me apart from the cheap meals at the Pizzeria Angela round the corner from the Hotel. The meal of the day was very good value. You must tip 15-20% for everything in Canada as it makes up part of workers wages. And sometimes 2 lots of taxes are added to everything which makes working out what things actually cost very difficult at times. One family on our tour in a restaurant tried to leave a small tip and the waitress was incensed and demanded her 20% but as this was probably only about \u00c2\u00a33 for a family of 4 adults I could not see what the English family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problem was. There are some people who throw down a few pennies tip in England which obviously the waitress found insulting. Our guide had told us how to work out the tips so they must not have realised. However we visited Quebec from Montreal which I absolutely adored. It was very French and felt a bit like being the in the Loire Valley in France. But here the Chateaux were hotels. Quebec has lots to see and do and we would return here anytime. The day was far too short to appreciate this wonderful city. On the way back to the airport we made 2 short stops one to take the 1000 islands hour long cruise on the St Lawrence seaway which was really interesting and scenic except for the rain and the other at Kingston Ontario, which was the old capital of Canada. We did not have enough time to explore but had a tasty meal of great fish and chips !! and sat in the sunshine. The distances between cities on a coach tour is very long and tiring and if I was doing it again I would take the train between them, but we did see so much in a week that we might return another time to take our time and savour the different places.

I got a decent rate on a \"jacuzzi suite\". First, the jacuzzi is just a couple of jets in the bathtub but it fills quickly and with very hot water. Bathroom is not big but nice with marble everywhere. Suite just means a larger room with a small sitting area on one end, I've been in larger \"non-suites\". I guess it's the whole European boutique thing where smaller is better, that's seems to be the whole feel throughout the hotel. The lobby is small, the gym is small, the elevators are small, etc. If you are claustrophobic, look elsewhere. I also stayed in a regular room over New Years, same deal but not as nice in the service dept. The staff is friendly and helpful for the most part. Location is good, just far enough away to be quiet but not too far to walk to everything (unless it's 35F and raining, then it seems like it's miles away!).

Let me start by saying that this is a recent purchased hotel that used to be a small independent. If you are expecting the usually Le Meridien level of quality - beware - it is not of that calibre. It is a very standard clean enough 3 star hotel. The staff are very polite and friendly, and will help you in English or in French. The rooms are actually slightly larger than the normal hotel room. They are slightly dated but nevertheless are kept up pretty good. The hotel offers found what they call \"high speed\" wireless internet. The internet speed is SLOW. I also checked with my colleague in another room and he found it so slow that he asked for his money back after 5 minutes of frustration. The bathrooms are poorly lit with only one tiny little soap in the bathroom. Hallways are tiny and rather cramped. If you can get a great rate at this hotel and you are not a business traveller, you may find this okay.

After receiving verbal confirmation that we would be staying in a non-smoking twin room we arrived to find that they had only a queen room left. We told reception of our room choice having been confirmed just a few days prior and then were given the only other room available -a king smoking room. Although nicely appointed, the stench in the room was not to be believed - even the housekeeper who came to spray a foul perfume to disguise the odor found it unbearable. There is only a tiny opening in one window for ventilation. We again voiced our displeasure and were eventually given a twin non-smoking room just above the garbage pick-up in the back alley. The room was old and not clean - the bathroom incredibly small. Bathrobes were provided after asking for them but when the room was made up the following day, they were carelessly wadded up on the beds. Also, for anyone hoping to use the wireless internet service, don't count on it - the staff admitted to this problem and offered us access at their hotel accross the street.

The (non-club level) room was spacious, but not particularly clean. The bathroom floor was sticky and never improved during the stay.

Restaurant Bronte--the hotel's boutique like restaurant--was very good with warm welcoming service and an interesting menu. The location is a little out of the way, but handy to the Art Museum and high-end shopping. As long as you aren't expecting something like NYC's Parker Meridien or Toronto's Meridien King Edward, it's OK.

The room we were given was on the penthouse floor and had a lovely view of the city, and was spacious and well-appointed. The bathroom was more than adequate and the monogrammed Frette bathrobes put there for guest use were a nice touch. The hotel itself had a very European feel--it is much smaller than most of the other hotels in that area--and the service we received was very good, from the doorman hailing our cabs to the concierge arranging a late check-out for us. Restaurant Bronte, which is attached (very unobtrusively) to the hotel, was a nice place to have a drink--trendy, but low-key--and their menu appeared to be on par with some of Montreal's other \"hot\" restaurants, like Area and Cube. The only small drawback to this hotel was its location--to get anywhere outside of the \"Golden Square Mile\" one has to take a taxi or the Metro (there's a station just down the street). Within walking distance are many good shops and restaurants, though, as well as the scenic main campus of McGill University.
