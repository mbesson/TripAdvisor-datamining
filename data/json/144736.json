Sometime around 4 in the morning i heard sounds of sexual intercouse. Also my toilet pipe blew and fecal matter was all over half of my room. The manager was nice enough to send a plumber to my room, and we soon found out the problem was there was a dead rat along with a few used condums That was Cloging the toilet. There was bullet holes in my wall, and in the middle of the night a african man threw a cinder block at my window. Walked into my room and asked for his XXX DVD's. I had know idea what he was talkin about??? He then kicked a hole through the wall and pulled out his XXX and then walked out. Police did show up looking for this man, and said we is wanted. I also belive he may have been smoking weed. I will never come within 50 miles of this place ever again.

Could not find a good hotel decided to stay at Dollar Inn after driving all night long and all day. The good hotels were far from where I was going to visit. I paid the 4 days I would be in town. I really didn't want to stay at this hotel. Just by looking at it from the outside gave me the creeps. The room I was given was in the back. When I entered the room it looked bad. The furniture was old and dirty. The carpet was dirty. The bed looked dirty. The sheets were bad. Stains everywhere. The shower was dirty. The lock on the door didn't even lock and it had a cheap chain to lock it. When I saw the room I actually wanted to leave infact I wanted to back home to Texas. I didn't sleep all night long thinking someone was going to break in. I put a chair under the door knob because the door did not lock. This hotel looked like the hotels in a thriller movie. I will never ever stay there again. Even though I paid the 4 days. I was lucky and got my refund back and paid only one night. There is a Motel 6 across the street. I went there. And the rooms were better and cleaner. Clean sheets and towels. The tub was not too great but it sure did beat the Dollar Inn. And Motel 6 uses cards to open rooms and once you close the door inside it has a bolt lock. Sure made me feel safer. I stayed the next 3 days at Motel 6 and was happier. Even the people at the front desk were nice. Do not stay at the Dollar INN. It is nasty!!!!!!!!!

The price was the lowest I had ever got for overnight stay. The room, I should say, was simply bad in terms of cleanliness. My girlfriend stayed awake the whole night because she thought the blankets were not washed(I fell asleep before she could suggest me to leave!). The bed was comfortable but probably not clean.

Instead the room charge was to be 40.00 a night. The customer prior to me was being treated very rudely when I arrived and she eventually refused to stay. After I received the same treatment I began to think that this was the normal for this particular hotel.

The bed sagged, the toilet was dirty and ran constantly, the shower head was clogged with God knows what, there was no remote, no coffee maker, and no sign that the room had been cleaned in the last week. What a dump! And to top it off, if there had been an ice bucket, it would've cost 1.30 for a bag of ice. Never again. I will sleep in my car in a rest area first...at least there's coffee there.
