Given it was New Years and i manage to book this hotel at $90 USD a night, it was a steal. However, had i paid $150+ I would've been highly disappointed. The hotel just didn't give you that clean feeling. Arrived rather late at night, check-in was quick and easy. Hotel staff was the highlight of the property. Treated guests like you were at a 5-star hotel. The apartment/hotel itself was spacious and had all the necessities for a long stay. I just never got the 'clean' feeling of this hotel. Arrived to no towels (they didn't have any until the morning) and a few stains on the couches, rugs, etc...But given my rate and the going rate of hotels during this time of year, it was fine. Another huge downfall was no wifi. They had wired internet, but come on, spend a few hundred dollars for wifi. hotel staff was great, hotel itself was so-so and the location left a little to be desired. If i could do it again i would've picked somewhere closer to the beach areas or downtown dubai.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cSpent 9 days at Metro\u201d", "Author": "MarkfromCA", "ReviewID": "UR121685290", "Content": "I have been to Dubai many times but this was the first time I spent anytime in the Al Barsha area.

I found both of them with Metro but was worried \"you get what you pay for\". I was surprised. The hotel is new, clean and very nice. It is not a 5 star hotel, but then again neither is the price. I would give this hotel 4 stars and I would stay again. The location is near the mall (but a bit hard for some taxis to get to) and there are empty lots around it. I was able to walk 7 minutes to the Metro or take a taxi (always was able to get one out front). The only thing this hotel lacks is the grand restaurants and over the top service. I found the restaurant very nice, the bar friendly and the front office staff very nice and helpful. Frankly I think it is one heck of a deal and my only fear is that the more people that find this place, eventually the prices will rise.

However: 1. After a four-and-a-half hour drive from Muscat, it took more than 30 minutes to check in, even though we had a credit-card confirmed and guaranteed booking. 2. It took an additional 15 mintes after check-in for the extra bed to be brought in, even though we had specifically requested it in the booking. Staff did not care that we were already extremely tired after a long drive, and didn't offer any refreshments while we waited. While being charged an extra AED150/day for the exxtra bed, it was so unconfortable that none of us could sleep on it, and instead rearranged the cushions from the sofa on the ground. 3. Internet is ridiculously expensive and SLOW (transfer rates of dial-up) for AED20/hour, AED100/day). 4. The hotel charges AED50 for an replacement keycard, and can only issue ONE KEY PER ROOM (RIDICULOUS!) 5. Front desk staff is completely incompetent -- when called and asked for manager, was told to hold and no one responded for more than 10 minutes. Then realized we had been hung up on! When we called back, the staff said the manager was not in that day! 6. While trying to get ready to go out one night, we requested 3 extra bath towels at 6PM. Front desk/housekeeping responded that there were NONE AVAILABLE, as all their towels were still in the laundry! HOW RIDICULOUS IS THAT!?! Didn't end up getting the towels till 1AM! When raised this issue with management during checkout (when we were finallly able to get ahold of Mr Iqbal) he was belligerent and uncompromising, offering insincere apologies and no explanations.

The apartments are only a few minutes from the metro, which takes you all over Dubai. Taxis are also cheap. The rooms are so reasonable at the hotel , that I would use this as a base, if you are on a budget, but it is not cheap and chearful. So if you want to do the tourist things hop on a metro. If you want to relax on the beach, get a cab and ask the driver for Umm Sequim beach, it is right next to Al Burg. This beach has no sun beds or sunshades. We watched some people take their own tents and sun shades. (we will do this next year , because we plan to go back to these apartments) It costs \u00a34 there in a taxi and \u00a34 back. Although there is a kitchen, there is a chinese and thai restaurant within a few yards. So we got takeways. (be warned through the chinese takeaways are massive, so order half , what you would do in the UK.)

We had a great deal for 2 double rooms and I was more attracted by its close proximity to Emirates Mall where I knew we can eat, entertain the kids and spend our time enjoying our limited time in Dubai. We arrived at 10:00 am and was told our rooms were not ready and that standard check-in time was 14:00. I mentioned that I requested early check-in because I was travelling with 3 young children. The reception were polite and said they will try to confirm when a room will be available which was dependent on other guests checking-out. The Front Office Manager Mr. Namdar then appeared and took charge of the situation, seeing 3 little kids he immediately upgrade us to 3 bedroom apartment checking with me first if it suited our needs. We were provided with a cot and we were in the room within 35 minutes of arriving. The rooms are huge, spotless and comfortable. We had restful sleep with no noise issues. The hotel provided complimentary water bottles and we were grateful for these on our first day. The hotel is 10 minutes walk to Emirates Mall and this has to be the major attraction as we did not have to hunt for taxis when we wanted to come and go (usually a problem coming back late at night in Dubai from some Malls). Emirates Mall has an indoor Ski Arena, Magic World as well as shops/restaurants which provided great entertainment for our kids. You could also buy all types of fresh food(excellent fruits) from Carrefour Super Market and take back to the hotel which has a full size kitchen including washer/dryer. The only item to note is that this hotel will not have views if thats what you are looking for.

The building is a fairly hard to find and some taxi drivers needed assistance to find their way, either from their colleages or us once we got to know the area better but it was never a great problem.
