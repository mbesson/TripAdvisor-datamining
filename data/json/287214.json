{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great improvement! I have been a guest at this hotel over the past 15+ years and finally the total refurbishment of the hotel itself has been finished. There have been some great improvements made with room appearance and mainly room comfort being improved. All rooms now have plasma TV's and the whole building is now smoke free (disadvantage to me!). The staff are friendly enough but could be a little more polite also another drawback is the removal of mini bars from all rooms instead they now run a system much like room service where you put in an order through reception. I like to stay in the spa suites because they are a corner suite with a separate bedroom that includes a true KING size bed (not just two singles pushed together - there is nothing worse!) My favourite rooms are the ones on the backside of the building that overlook the mountains. They are currently updating the leagues club next door, usually can can walk from the hotel to the club without leaving the building but unfortunatel with the renovations you must go outside.There are ample food selection with in 1 mins woalk of the hotel and well placed at the foot of the blue mountains.", "Date": "May 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR561272279", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Zammit"}, {"Content": "Best place to stay if in Penrith We saw a show at the theatre at the Panthers complex and so stayed the night onsite.The room was comfortable, conveniently located and well-priced.

It was quite a lot more modern looking than previous rooms I had stayed in. As soon as I had settled in, I felt like a cold beer - upon opening the mini bar I found that everything in it was hot! Not room temperature, but heated up. Time to contact reception... Used the new telephone in the room and tried pressing the special button labelled to contact reception, but no response from the button at all. I then found the manual number for reception, and they arranged to send someone around. A few minutes later a staffmember arrived with another fridge on a trolley, and replaced the fridge, noting that they had experienced some difficulties with the particular type of fridge in the room. It appears that some of the items associated with the renovation are still not 100% flawless.Had dinner in the Flavours restaurant in the club which is part of the Panthers complex, and then a few drinks at some of the bars in the complex. The whole complex is now getting rather dated, and even with the renovations in the hotel, it is showing.Slept well in a comfortable bed, no noise during the night, and checkout was efficient the following morning. The following day we had a conference in the Panthers complex itself, and this was professionally run with excellent catering and service throughout the day.Would recommend the Chifley at Panthers if you are attending an event/function at the Panthers complex, but recommend booking early as it fills up quickly when events are taking place. The compendium in the room also notes that otherwise free telephone calls (1800 numbers etc) are charged for at this hotel, which is an added sting for those who would normally use a telecard instead of a mobile phone. This is a surprise in this class of hotel, as I have normally only seen these type of charges at 5 star establishments.", "Date": "Mar 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR779544238", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "OzML"}, {"Content": "Finally Somewhere That Exceeds Expectation My family of 4 stayed here on NYE and have to say we can not fault this hotel.After a recent TERRIBLE experience at a 5 star establishment it was great to find a hotel with helpful staff.The rooms have been recently upgraded with LCD TV's and modern deco, our room was the basic room but was roomier and newer than what I had expected.As I have 2 children 4 and 9 weeks old we needed to take a large amount of items. The hotel staff were extremely helpful with our luggage, an area that alot of hotels let themselves down in.Buffet breakfast in Panthers club is a bit pricey at $19pp but paying for quality is always fine by me", "Date": "Jan 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR784635487", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "PJ26Sydney"}, {"Content": "A typical casino hotel This is not a good hotel experience.

Lots of activities for all the family. There are also a few fast food places just in front of the hotel if you are feeling peckish.Our room was very big, clean and had been refurbished fairly recently. Everything was fine, except the carpet was a bit of a scary colour. There are restaurants and also a club open at night, so you don't really need to leave the hotel complex.All up a fine place to stay, but nothing out of the ordinary.
