Everything is walking distance. We are with our 11 and 13 year old kids. We're from NYC and so we're used to walking. Still, we've barely used any transportation, except when it was pouring rain. We've walked from the hotel to the Colosseum, Forum, Pantheon, Vatican, Trevy Fountain, and other major sites. The hotel is quiet, as it's located in a pedestrian only area. Still, I'd read tripadvisor and asked for a room on the courtyard side just in case. We have a quad. It's quite cute, cream walls, about 14 foot ceiling with ancient wooden beams. My kids are in a bunk bed. The bath is big enough and has a sculpture in it! No bath, just shower but the water pressure and temp are ok. Wifi is great. Towels are large if not fluffy. My ny warning is that my husband came a day early and I'd reserved a single on the courtyard. He said that the little room looked out n something more like an air shaft than a courtyard. Our present quad has a small balcony (which we can't go out on) and plants, a view of the sky and the sound of birds. It's very restful. I'd definitely come back here and would recommend it to friends. They recommended a great little pizzeria nearby, non touristy in a touristy area. It's called Pizzaria Al Leoncino and it was a perfect genuine Italian place for locals.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cbasic, but a good bargain\u201d", "Author": "kaf8e", "ReviewID": "UR127134264", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights in March 2012.

We were only there for a day and a half so it was fine as a base for sleeping and spent our time out enjoying Rome. We went during high season so I was little worried about whether the air-conditioning would cope but it was fine (though a little noisy). The only negative thing was that in the bathroom there was a slight smell of sewage which I think probably is the drains and beyond the control of the hotel as it was 30C when we were there but it meant we had to remember to keep the door shut.

We arrived very late so had little option - if you do take a taxi, opt for one oif the white ones in the queue outside - we were approached by 3 taxi touts all quoting in the region of 65 to 70 euros! A tip for food - a nearby restaurant a few doors away with purple table cloths (sorry can't recall name) was very good and reasonably priced. A few doors to the left, there is a restaurant called Toto - eat there at your peril (read my reiview under Toto restaurant, Rome) The area is generally very pricey to eat and the food generally 'tourist' standard - if you can move away a bit to eat- to even the Pantheon- you'll get a better deal for your euros. ...", "Date": "April 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "california", "Title": "\u201c4 great nights in Rome\u201d", "Author": "mammaisontheinternet", "ReviewID": "UR103405922", "Content": "Superlative location for the price in pricey Rome.

The hotel is located a 2 minute walk from the Piazza Spagna and 3 minutes from the Spagna subway station, and as a result we were able to take the Metro everywhere in Rome, which made the massive city much more navigable for us (we found all of Rome fairly walkable, but some of the neighbourhoods are not as close to the Metro lines). It is right in the ritzy Via Condotti shopping district, with many restaurants and shops just below, a lovely place to take a stroll at night. We stayed in a double room with private bathroom - this had a king-sized bed, no TV, it was basic and clean. The room itself was not overly small, but the bathroom was quite tiny (the shower is certainly built for smaller-sized individuals, it was a bit of a gymnastics routine even getting into the shower door, larger individuals beware). We had asked for a room with air-conditioning (an extra 6 Euros per night) - and although they mixed this up, it was no problem getting the remote for the air-conditioner that was in the room already. A small problem was that our air-conditioner was supposed to be connected to a sensor and turn off when the window was opened - ours was somehow programmed backwards and turned off when the window was closed. In 35 degree temperatures, we could not have BOTH the window closed and the air conditioner off, so we had to keep the window a crack open to have the air conditioner on, which means much of the noise from Via della Croce below filtered into our bedroom (when we did close the window though, they were quite soundproof). However, I actually quiet enjoyed taking a siesta and listening to the chatter of bella Roma below (earplugs worked for the evenings, and my husband sleeps through anything). There is no breakfast, but D'Angelo's just on the corner serves the best pastries we had in Italy, there is also a supermarket up one block and a small alimentieri across from D'Angelo's.

My best friend stayed at a youth hostel in Berlin, which was much better for a fraction of the price and compared Hotel Panda to a youth hostel in Rio, which cost even less than the Berlin hostel. We have also stayed at an infinitely better place for less in Tokyo, the most expensive city in the world, and we live in NY, the second most expensive city in the world. We have also stayed at 4 star hotels in San Fran for the same price. In 2+ weeks, the bedsheets were only changed twice during our stay (you can tell, cause the sheets get wrinkled, and clean sheets are crisp), the towels were also not changed on a daily basis (they even just took a towel that was on the floor and placed it on top of the other towels on the towel bar), the sink was only cleaned once after 2 weeks, and the floor and everything else not at all. On a daily basis, someone only made the bed and took out the trash. The shower tiles were filthy, and there were puddles on the bathroom floor. They also ran out of toilet paper and had no replacement roll at one point. The only thing provided in the room were 2 small packages of harsh soap. The room is miniscule (and I'm coming from the viewpoint of a New Yorker used to the tiniest closet apartments in the states). The \"double\" bed was actually the size of a twin, and the room wasn't much bigger than the \"bed,\" which was actually a futon placed against the wall, which had a wooden board glued/nailed on it to make it look like a headboard. The futon dipped in the middle. The pillows were also so uncomfortable that I slept without one the entire time. I was expecting the size of the room, but the uncleanliness was ridiculous. I found a dead bug on the bed the first day and another kind of insect crawling on the floor a couple weeks later. The front desk said that the free wireless can only be used by your own laptop in the lobby. It took half an hour to load one site, and one of the sites never loaded. Most of the stay the internet was slower than molasses. We're talking way slower than dial up. Only on one day was it working properly. Around 1 am one night, we smelled fumes so harsh that we, along with others in the building in rooms facing the courtyard, were coughing uncontrollably. We had to leave the hotel for half an hour til the fumes cleared. We called and went to the front desk, who later told us that the restaurant next door had some guys (who were wearing gas masks) spray mosquito spray in the courtyard. On another night, the same restaurant blasted music til 12:30 am, which is the time the front desk told us that they were allowed to blast music til. At checkout, the front desk attempted to charge an additional night and charge for using the phone in the room when I had been told that using the phone was free as long as I called the local access number on my phone card. Needless to say, they failed. The hotel is located near the Spagna subway station. It's located in a safe and clean but touristy neighborhood. My best friend recommends the nearest cafe for the best cappuccinos and double espressos in the neighborhood- the guy in the red vest serves sandwiches, drinks, and pastries at the counter. Beware of the closest bar/pizzeria that's open late- the cashier claimed my bill (which I bought from the bank here in the states) was counterfeit and tried to take it. Like that's gonna work on a New Yorker. Also, the bartender, who took awhile searching for a certain beer for the Italian customer before us, tried to just give my best friend the first beer he found instead of what he asked for. I'll definitely never stay at this filthy hotel again. I have no idea why it's recommended by anyone.

I have very mixed feelings about Pensione Panda. The hotel is in a great location. We easily walked to must of the major sites and it was nice to have the train station as well as buses nearby. The first room we had was #20, a double room with a bathroom, which was right next to the check in desk and steps to go outside. It's window opened up right over the main street. Of course we slept with the window open it being pretty warm in Rome. That night was so bad for me. The noise on the street all night long was way too loud. That morning I asked if there were any quieter rooms and with no problem at all they let us move to #36. which was all the way at the end of the hall. It had a little spiral staircase to go up and had an additional bed for a third person. The room was larger, the bathroom was larger too. It had nice exposed wood beams. The window opened out to just other buildings and courtyards and it was amazing how much quieter it was. We had a very uneventful stay there From 9/11 - 9/15. The room was always cleaned, new towels, firm yet comfortable bed, etc. We paid 108 euros/night and I made the reservations directly via email about 8 months in advance. Here's where the trouble came.... I also had made reservations (at the same time) for our last night in Italy 9/24 with them. When leaving on 9/15 I confirmed that with them. I also called from Capri on 9/23 to let them know I would be arriving around 10 pm on 9/24. Wouldn't you know that when we arrived on 9/24 at 9:45 and checked in they gave us the keys for #26. We walked into the room to find a tiny single bed. I had in writing that I had reserved a double room. The man said that was the room that was assigned to me by the woman who runs the hotel, and that there were no other rooms available. I of course demanded as nicely as possible that something must be done about this. He made a few calls and found us another hotel to stay at in our price range, called a cab and gave us 20 euro to pay for it. We arrived at the other Hotel - Hotel Azzura near the Barberini Metro stop around 10:45 pm, the ride cost 13 euro. The man who runs the hotel, Renato, was very nice. However the hotel was very old, rundown, on a dirty street with not so nice looking people hanging around outside. We told him we needed to leave at 6 am which lead him to instructing us how to open the doors since they would be locked for the night at midnight. I asked about a wake up call and he pretended not to understand. We were starving and had been traveling all day, so we headed out to get something to eat. He said we needed to be back by midnight. I was so looking forward to this last night of our trip and our last night in Rome and now I couldn't even stay out late and see the city. When we got back at midnight I asked Renato in Italian about a wake up call, and he said he didn't do those, and he'd be sleeping at 6 am. He proceeded to take 30 mins to find me a tiny little clock, that wound up not alarming at all. We paid 100 euro for this room. I am so upset that after being a good customer at Panda and already having paid them for 4 nights, making reservations in advance, confirming countless times, them not having my room and then having them force me to stay at a place they had to know was not the greatest, was just inexcusable. Other hotels know things about other hotels, right?? The guy did try at Panda I suppose, he gave us the 20 euro, and apologized and really it wasn't his fault as he just worked the desk but still.

We had a very generously sized room, right next to the reception desk. The room was usually a quad room, but there was only two of us. We had our own bathroom. The rate was VERY reasonable for Rome. The disadvantage was that there was poor noise insulation, which resulted in us being woken by reception activity early in the morning. There is no breakfast served at the pensione, but if you walk down the street (toward Via Del Corso) for 1 minute, you will find a great cafe that sells delicious pastries and serves good coffee. If you get your coffee \"per portare via\" (or to go), then it is very reasonably priced and you could enjoy sitting on the Spanish Steps as you eat your breakfast. The cleanliness was of a high standard. Staff were friendly and helpful. Getting to the hotel is very easy. From the airport, catch the train to Termini, and then the metro to the Spanish Steps (Spagna). Exit the station in the direction of Spanish Steps.

The receptionist also was not very friendly or helpful - we asked her for some directions on the first morning and she quite impolitely gave us some very vague directions. As the room was small & hot, we had to sleep with the window open but they had a tumbler dryer operating in their utility room for practically the whole night.

It was a very nice and clean room, but the shower was almost too small to fit in. I literally had to slide in sideways and flatten some of my \"parts\" to make it work. My fiance had to go in sideways because of his shoulders. That said, I am a \"gifted\" girl, but my fiance only wears a medium or large shirt. I know that there are more important things in Rome than shower stalls and that hotel rooms are made in small spaces. But, this was a little too small. Also, Hotel Panda was on the 2nd Piano, which is actually our third floor. You have to walk up one flight of stairs to get to the elevator, take it up and then walk down a flight to the hotel. A little confusing, but we got used to it. And finally, the hotel called for a car to take us to the airport, since we had an early flight home. The car cost 47 Euro. During the ride to the Fiumicino Airport, the driver got up to speeds of over 160 km (99mph) many times. He was whipping in and out of traffic like crazy. There was no reason, we weren't late and hadn't said anything. Grateful to be alive, we just paid him and didn't say anything.

I can honestly say the location of the hotel is fantastic! It was a 5minute walk max to the Spanish Steps. Literally walk out the front door of the building and turn right, walk up the road to the corner and turn right again, you can see the S/Steps in sight with the flowing fountain and its merely a few steps away. The metro is also located up the road which is a bonus for those wanting to use public transport (come out of the alley way it is located in and if you look to your left, there are the S/Steps) though we walked everywhere to appreciate the sights. Now, if you don't like steps, then beware, because the hotel is located up many flights of stairs (see pictures) so if you are travelling light, then you are lucky. Yes there is a lift (teeeeeny tiny lift) but its only on the second flight of stairs, so there is NO escaping the stair climb or descend. Unfortunately for us, we had heavy suitcases (as we had more of Europe to travel) and could barely lift them up those stairs, it was like the stairs Never ended LOL Worse yet, once we finally reached reception and got our room key, we were about to pass out when we saw our room had a spiral staircase hahah what luck! The price of the hotel was reasonable considering that accommodation in Rome is very expensive and the closer you are to monuments, the more things cost, so we were happy at paying 108Euro per night. We also felt very secure in the building, so nothing to worry about, good security, someone always in reception and good room locks. (and you can always turn the lock dial when you go to bed if you dont want to be disturbed in the morning - it gives a red dot on the lock so the cleaners dont knock) The hotel was great - the room was not that big BUT very neat and clean with a double bed and a single bed (Note: the double bed is two singles pushed together) Though very comfortable matress to sleep on. The bathroom in the room was clean and the facilities appeared new which was a bonus (compared to other hotels we have stayed at where the toilets and sink are worn out) The bathroom overall is very small (but people have mentioned that in Italy, they are all the same and sometimes smaller) Nonetheless, we had a shower which provided hot water, and at the end of the day isnt that what you really need? The bath towels...well, they aren't like Aussie towels but you know what, for something that looks like a bed sheet, they are quite absorbent. The room is serviced every day, fresh towels are given, little Lux soaps are stocked up and plenty toilet paper AND if you feel you may runout, simply ask reception or the cleaners and they will stock the bathroom with more. The weather in Rome was a humid 34degrees and counting (and this was already at 10am, imagine the whole day) we really appreciated the air conditioning, though just to let you all know that the temperature setting only goes as low as 24degrees on the remote - not sure why it is permanently set to that because we really would have loved to have it colder, say perhaps 18degrees because it gets really hot in the room and with the humidity, you need it as cold as you can get, especially at night as the heat remains. Oh and the air con wont turn on until the window is shut as they have a sensor trigger. The staff are friendly and helpful, including the manager. Our bathroom lights had blown and he was prompt in buying the bulb the next day and installing it asap, he was a very sweet man. Also the guy on reception when we arrived was so lovely and we didn't get his name, but would like to thank him for being so kind, helpful and polite :) Oh and one last thing, this is merely a room with beds, air con and a bathroom ... NO TV. (don't expect it to be the Ritz or Hilton) Just a simple hotel room. So if you can't sleep at night, ensure you have something to enlighten you ie: book, DS game etc Overall, definitely value for money and would stay there again if I ever returned to Rome (though would not look forward to those stairs hahahhaha)", "Date": "September 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cA Super Deal\u201d", "Author": "Dadsco", "ReviewID": "UR20103639", "Content": "We recently spent 10 wonderful days in Rome, and were very fortunate in being able to stay at the Pensione Panda.

I kid you not it is a three minute walk to the bottom of the Spanish Steps and the Spagna Metro. It is also half a minute from the Corso - most famous shopping street, and Dior,Hermes, D&G, Roberto Cavali are all within seconds and open until 8pm which is fabulous following a busy days touring and before the numerous glasses of wine to accompany dinner. This hotel is basic, i got the impression that the staff are there merely to watch the door and so don't expect the concierge at Claridges but it was very clean and our room was fairly large with a king size bed and a single bed in it - perfect for the 6 hours we were there each night. Our bathroom was minute and if you had a large guy with you this could be a problem but for us it was no problem at all. We even had a little balcony that overlooked the court yard below, not very exciting but some outside space at least, and much better than the noise of the road facing rooms i guess. Be warned you need to be persistant to book this hotel - I had to call and email them 4 or 5 times and i think it just depends who you speak to, like i say many of the staff seem to be there just to watch the door. Without a doubt this Pension is fantastic due to the location. It is 3 metro stops from the main station which is nothing and a 3 day metro pass costs 11 euros. It is within a 10 minute walk of the Pantheon and Piazza Navona and not even 10 minutes from the Trevi Fountain. I reckon a straight and direct walk to the vatican would take 25 minutes top. but there is just so much to see and soak in - one of the things that was great about this hotel was that there are lots of restaurants and bars nearby so that you don;t have to worry about coming a long way home late at night. A few top tips i have are: go to St Peters about 3pm on a friday, there was no queue at all and we were the last people who were allowed to up the Basillica at 4.15 and they were very very strict about it. The final walk up the 350 steps to the very top is a killer but is totally worth it adn you eventually come back down in into St Peters, which also amazingly I timed right with 5pm mass and I was able to take communion in St Peter's which is a must for any Catholic. On Saturday I was lucky to have prebooked a tour of the Vatican museams and the Scistine Chapel before we went (cost about \u00a330 each compared to 11 euros) but this was worth its weight in gold as when we arrived at 10am and spent 13 minutes walking past the two mile queue of people who were never going to get in and I was able to walk up to the guard and have my name ticked off a list! FANTASTIC!! we flew with Ryanair and i wasn't too sure about how to get from the airport to town but i had prebooked the terravision coach which i was a little sceptical about but for 14 euros return it worked like a dream. Don't forget to go to the Trevi at night as it is magical - and remember to throw your three cins in over your shoulder to ensure you return to this fantastic city! Finally, i really regret not taking my video camera (i had read on loads of sites that you couldn't video or take pics) i could have videoed everywhere apart from inside the sistine chapel!", "Date": "November 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auburn, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "pupdud", "ReviewID": "UR6150002", "Content": "This was one of the best values in Europe.

First time in Rome and used Trip Advisor to help find a place within our budget. We stayed in a room with a queen bed which didn't leave much space for anything else but if your in Rome to spend time in a hotel room this is definitely not the place for you. It was walking distance from everything and the street outside had flower vendors in the morning and several restaurants at night. We usually got something on the go from the small grocery store just a few steps from the entrance as it was a much cheaper breakfast. Being from the South we were surpirsed at the attitude of the employees. They were not what I woudl call personable but we got what we needed so can't really complain. I've been told this is what people in Rome are like. We had some friends staying in Rome at the same time and they choose a place near the Pantheon. We had dinner and heard about how loud it was for them. We on the other hand enjoyed very peacfull nights. While it's true that you couldn't hear anythign from the outside you could hear people coming down the hall at night. However, that didn't run too late and if it did then I slept though it. If you're like us we didn't go to Rome to see a hotel room. We were usually out the door no later than 8:30 am and back around 11pm at night so we could sleep and repeat the same the next day. I never asked and it might be worth mentioning that one night I took a shower and ran out of hot water within 5 minutes. The day before I took one and my husband right after with no problems - so they may turn it off or run out in the evenings I don't know which. Don't let the maps of Rome fool you, everything looks spread out, but it's not.

Overall I would highly recommend this hotel. The location is fantastic, we did not need to use any public transport as all the main sights were within a 30 min walk (many, like the Spanish steps obviously, much nearer!) The area also has the advantage of feeling very safe, due to upmarket shops and the number of people around in the evenings. Via Del Croce (road on which the hotel is) and other neighouring streets are very lively, with lots of people sitting outside cafes etc. In terms of prices, clearly this is not best area for bargains, but our 2 chocolate croissants and 2 coffees in the street next to ours cost us under 7 dollars. The hotel itself is quite basic, ie no TVs in the rooms or communal areas. However our room had all it needed, everything was spotlessly clean. Also we had an ensuite double room and our was actually quite big, so much so that there was an extra single bed in there. Looking at photos posted by others it looks like room sizes are hugely variable, so may be worth requesting that room- can't remember number but it's the one right next to reception. I do agree that the shower cubicle is very small, so if you are significantly overweight or tall you will struggle. However the water pressure and hot water were great. We did not need to use the aircon as the room stayed cool despite it being hot during the day. As a final note I would advise bringing ear plugs - Via Del Croce is mostly pedestrian but due to all the people outside it gets noisy especially on Fri and Sat nights. However with ear plugs in this was fine and I would imagine it would be as least as bad in most other central streets of Rome as they would have more cars and scooters going down them. I did a LOT of research before booking this hotel so I know that it is more than fairly priced and I would definitely recommend it and stay there again.", "Date": "September 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cTeeny, tiny shower stall\u201d", "Author": "Pepepetrov", "ReviewID": "UR5782200", "Content": "This was our first experience in Rome and we relied heavily on reviews on this and other websites.

Honestly, the opening was no more that 18-20 inches and the entire stall is not more than 30 inches square. I'm short and average size and I had to step in sideways. We didn't need air conditioning because the weather was so nice but some smokers showed up in the room next to us and sat on the balcony puffing so we had to close the windows or have our whole room polluted.

Hotel Panda is a great Hotel for those on budget. My family of five (children 16,14,12)booked two rooms (approx \u00a3420 for 3 nights ). Rooms very small but clean. Towels changed every day. NB Towels not your usual thick fluffy ones more like large white cotton sheets but served the purpose and did dry you! Ensuite facilities(shower , toilet, bidet and sink) small but adequate - everything very clean. NB not all rooms have en suite. Plenty of sockets for hair dryers etc. Air conditioning available but have to pay extra. We booked taxi to and from the airport via the Hotel - cost 65 eros each way for 5 of us. There is a airport bus near station costs slightly less per person. Hotel provides free maps and advice. Hotel excellent location - on quiet street. This Hotel doesn't provide breakfast but there are numerous cafes / restaurants nearby. Very central to main tourist sights- spainish steps 10 min walk, Trevei fountain 10 min. Colesseum, Forum , Pantheon etc all walking distance. Go and see 'unknown soldier ' buliding. Great eating out - not as expensive as I thoght it would be. Mant restaurants have set torist menus. Ice cream shops are fabulous - lots of choice. There are plenty of Macdonalds but we avoided these ! Be careful - Unfortunately we had our camera and video camera stolen on our third day from a modern restaurant near the Vatican. These people are very clever and know exactly what they are after!
