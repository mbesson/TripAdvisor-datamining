The Gardens and grounds are amazingly looked after and although Artini 2 is about 20 years old the grounds are well kept.Want a delux room for $60 per night but they were full had a double ground floor with garden view and I have to say the room was very clean although a bit dated. the sheets however were stained and the pillows were like rocks but the aircon was fantastic. all the staff are really nice and the pool is lovely its in a good location just a short walk to all the shops and best resturants in Ubud. I would recommend a stay here but try and get the upstairs rooms with the view over the padi fields best room looked like T3.

The booking was made and confirmed on March 2008.When I arrived at 9pm on July 18th Artini 2 told me there were no rooms. They said they had reported this to Bali Friendly two days prior to my arrival. Their excuse was that the rooms had faulty toilets and could not be repaired in time for our arrival. However why were two other rooms not kept and made available for us especially as the booking had been confirmed in March?So travellers who was repsonsible for the cock-up, who knows? In fairness to Bali Friendly an assistant apologised for the mess-up, I have still to receive an apology from the manager who told me he would phone me back and never did! Just don't trust Bali Friendly or Artini 2 when it comes to booking. Good luck. I eventually stayed at the Puri Dalem which was pleasant and efficiently run and excellent value for money.", "Date": "Jul 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR661280701", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "SingaporeRimmer"}, {"Content": "Overpriced, over-rated, and cheap around the edges.

Breakfast was very very poor - terrible food - very cheap and very low quality compared to other hotels we have stayed at in Bali, that have had cheaper rates.

This is our 3rd visit to Bali and the first time we have had a bad experience at one of the hotels/cottages. We arrived at Artini 2 and were told that our 2 reserved rooms (paid in full) were not available; they were being used as a movie set and we would be accommodated in 2 different rooms for 1 night and then have to move to the original reserved rooms the next day. The morning breakfast service was extremely slow and disorganized. During our 5 day stay they were never able to accommodate our request for beverages by the pool (they were out of white wine for 5 days???). My first attempt at bathing was with cold water, the propane tank had run out of gas. The staff quickly changed it. The gardens on the property are very well maintained and beautiful. The head of the morning service staff appears to only be interested in the guests that are willing to book outings/programs through him. We were scheduled to return to Artini 2 after visiting the northern coast of Bali, but chose to book our return to Ubud at a different location.", "Date": "Apr 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR250912612", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "KwajaleinTraveler"}, {"Content": "Excellent experience My husband and I recently returned from a week in Ubud. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Artini 2 Cottages. The grounds are beautiful and meticulously kept up. The staff was so helpful and friendly.

We have just returned and can't speak highly enough of this place. Having stayed at much more expensive places before this was a real surprise. The rooms are simple with no televisions, bar fridges or towelling robes, etc. But they are so clean with all the essentials and very Balinese. We had wonderful views of the rice paddies and found the staff so friendly and helpful.

What will leave you in awe is the buildings and landscaping of this small place. It was fantastic and made our stay there very pleasant and peaceful. We got a superior room for US $50/night net and it was well worth it. The hotel is built into a steep depression with jungle in the back and a paddy field on one side. Very quiet and green as the rooms where well back from the road. In typical Balinese style our large room had air con, and a tv, although there is nothing on the TV for our 3 year old to watch. Very clean and in good order, our only complaint was that the bathtub needed a bit more scrubbing. My wife noticed it, but I didn't (guess I'm a typical guy). Breakfast was very mediocre Western, but the look and feel of the place made up for that. One last complaint, watch out for a tout called Plentong who will hound you into using his 'brothers' taxi. He is extremely overpriced and worst of all he does not have Air Con, although he will lie to you that he does. We ended our Bali trip in his lousy taxi, sweating to death in the midday heat on the way to the airport. This is not recommended. Try out the Hotel, avoid the taxi driver.", "Date": "May 2, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR333592764", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "livinginpenang"}, {"Content": "Dreckig und Fleckig   showReview(14355974, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR240582651", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "bluehorizon"}, {"Content": "Artini 2 Ubud: gesund?   showReview(13879743, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR388219938", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "nini13"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297701-d308745-r22965040-Artini_2_Cottages-Ubud_Bali.html", "HotelID": "308745", "Price": "$40"}}
