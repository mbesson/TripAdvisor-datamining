The staff in the dining area were also very efficient and helpful because sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for a table, but they handle the crowds well. The gym is extremely nice and it was a nice perk that Arod was there for a workout and my kids got autographs! The location is awesome so close to Aquarium and shops and the Water Taxi.

In my opinion, the studios are better laid out for business travelers. The amenities include free microwave popcorn in room, free dinner/reception Sun-Th with wine/beer, free full breakfast. P.S, I am a Hilton Diamond member so I stay at Homewood Suites a lot and I am very picky. This Homewood Suites is very new, and somewhat atypical. It is a 12 story building - not spread out like most (however, it is inner city unlike most). It shares the building with a Hilton Garden Inn (same lobby, parking garage). The front desk is split -left side Homewood Suites (go up left elevator to rooms), and Hilton Garden Inn on right side. The second floor has the \"lounge\" for breakfast/dinner. The room is laid out a bit different than most Homewood Suites, with a non-movable combo desk/dresser splitting the room in half with the flat screen TV attached to the top next to the desk - you sit at the desk 2 ft from TV screen. PROS: * Very modern and clean. * Quiet, thermostat controlled temperature (central heat/cold - not window unit). * Extremely accommodating and pleasant staff - they know customer service here. * Close to everything - Roy's across street, Talera next door, Movie Theater, Starbucks and HaaganDas Ice Cream next door on other side, Whole Foods behind. Littly Italy and Fells Point within walking distance. Very safe neighborhood (Inner Harbor East). * Very quiet (however higher floors are better) and ample light from large windows * Large bathroom * Easy on and off from I-83. * Good price/excellent value CONS (Mostly minor): * Expensive parking ($32/night). * Not close to convention center which is on the west side of the harbor. * Spotty housekeeping service - Not all towels replaced daily (they took but did not leave any behind 2 of 4 days I was here), popcorn/coffee never replaced - but was correctly instantly by front desk who provided extra box of cookies for trouble. Comforter cover never replaced - saw the same stains every day. This is the main reason I did not give it 5 stars. * Drawers for clothes are a bit small. * Very slow internet at times. One point to be aware of: They say they have self-parking (entrance off Exeter St), but it is run by a private garage and you will have to pay every time you go in and out - cannot bill on hotel. However, you can enter hotel directly from garage. Valet parking is very good (valet remembered my name every day) and quick (can text for car in AM). They were able to switch from self to valet at check-in. Also if driving in Baltimore area, be aware of many photo-enforced speed traps.

Hotel is connected to the Embassy Suites and there is one, understaffed front desk for both Hilton branded hotels. We are Hilton Honors Diamond card holders...however, there was no separate line for check in for either hotel. We mistakenly booked a smoking room and did not realize it. When we arrived and found out, we asked to be switched to a non smoking room since two of us have asthma and can't stay in a smoking room. After 15 minutes of staring into a computer with the check in line growing and growing behind us, they decided they did not have any comparable non smoking rooms that evening (a Friday night) but we were assured we would be able to switch for the second night of our stay. Since it was our mistake, we were disappointed, but agreed to wait until the second night to switch and we squeezed into a smaller room that was non smoking. They said they would call us as soon as the new room was available and would move our luggage for us. Went up to the complimentary evening reception and I got the last glass of wine from the pitcher, which they were not refilling even though there was a half hour left until the end of the stated time, and the food was mostly gone and not being refilled as well. Our room was nice and clean, but a bit cozy for my family. Next day we left our luggage packed and ready to be moved, and when we returned from sightseeing around 4pm it was all as we had left it. Made another visit to the overworked front desk, and spend another full 20 minutes waiting for them to find a room to move us to as promised...no one had done anything about it. And once again the check in line behind us grew as I heard grumbles and felt the angry eyes staring at the back of my head while I waited for the front desk staff to do their job. Finally they found us a room - again and they sent the porter up with me to help with the bags (very nice guy...the only person in the whole hotel who actually did his job with a smile). Valet parking was fine...we left our car there and walked to downtown and the aquarium. The other odd thing about the hotel was that it did not really have it's own pool, but rather was attached to a gym that we were allowed to use. While the gym and pool facilities were nice, the gym closed early on the weekends and my children were very disappointed they could not go in the pool in the evening. The location was so convenient and the hotel was fine.

However, when management makes such bad decisions then I have to tell others. CHECK-IN/FRONT DESK: The Homewood Suites and Garden Inn share a front desk. No biggie, I've seen this before, especially in urban core areas. HOWEVER, there were usually only two people working the front desk. TWO PEOPLE FOR TWO FULL SIZE HOTELS. Those ladies still managed to keep a smile on their face even when they had a long line of worn out and angry guests. RESERVATIONS: We had booked a room at the Homewood with two doubles and a fold out so our family of five could fit comfortably. However, management had overbooked the hotel so our room was not available when we checked in around 6pm. So they moved us to two side by side rooms (not adjoining) in the Garden Inn. Ok, not a big deal. It WOULD HAVE been a big deal if we had brought food to cook for dinner in the Homewood like we had originally planned. (but we didn't, so I won't complain) BUT then, they made us move the next night (we were only there two nights) to a Homewood Suites. Once again, this SHOULDN'T have been a big deal. I did book a room in the Homewood and not 2 in the Garden Inn. HOWEVER, because there were never more than two people at the front desk, this meant I had to wait 30 minutes to check out and get our luggage stored in the morning and then another 30 minutes to check in and get our luggage into our room new room that evening. ROOMS: Yes, there were issues with the rooms. Several guests, including ourselves, didn't have hot (it wasn't cold-but to call it warm was a stretch) water in the Garden Inn. Then, when we moved to the Homewood the ceiling fan was literally falling down. When I called to the front desk they did send someone up (30 minutes later) and the maintence guy started looking at it to see if he could put it back in and it fell on him! (Luckily he wasn't hurt-he was so disturbed by the whole event that he left all his gear in our room-including an uncovered knife and needle nose pliers-luckily he called us 30 minutes later to tell us before one of our kids found them! (Ok, these are minor things that I don't usually care about-but given everything else they just added to the frustration) PHONES: Our cells had poor service in the building so we decided to order out for pizza. I checked the phone info sheet-no mention of charges-and dialed several local numbers. The third call finally went through. Later that night I had to make another call to the same delivery place. The next morning I had charges for four phone calls! Even if the call didn't go through (when I say didn't go through I mean fast busy or the call cannot be completed as dialed) they still charged us. (the nice overworked front desk staff-who knew me by name now-quickly removed the charges) POOL: Once again, normally not a big deal-but with everything else it was just icing on the cake. First, the pool is part of MAC, an fitness center, no biggie, usually. But, the first night it was closed for a staff party and no one told the hotel. Then both mornings it was closed for swim lessons. So, we planned to take the kids to the pool-which had been raved about by a porter and the concierge as having a great kids area and even a slide(I thought this was odd since it was part of an urban fitness club but, hey, maybe they also cater to the families in nearby Little Italy?) So we make the trek down from our upper level room across both hotels to the MAC, I go to sign in and the nice lady at the desk says, \"Oh, you can't come in here-you don't have shoes on.\" Yes, you need shoes for the pool. So, the three kids and I trek back up to the hotel and come back down-this time with shoes-and make our way to the wonderful kids pool. Only to discover that it's nothing but a standard size urban inside hotel pool. Still, it's November and we have a good time. That is, until my two oldest (7th and 4th grade) decide they want to swim some laps while I play with the youngest in the pool. There were several open lanes and I explain lap etiquette and they have themselves a good ol time seeing who could swim faster or longer-the whole time being very respectful and quiet. Until they get kicked out because kids aren't allowed to swim in the lap pool. VALET: I don't use valet so, once again, not something I would usually comment on but since it arose, here it goes. There were maybe three guys working valet (4 on the night I checked in) and they always were running. I figured they were hustleing to be good employees. No, they were hustleing because there weren't enough people working-this happened every day. In my long time at the front desk (I easily spent an hour and a half over two nights at the front desk) I heard countless people getting their valet charges credited because they were waiting 45mins+ for their car. The valet parking garage is attached to the hotel. Need I say more? In summary, these hotels are staffed with friendly (if slightly uninformed people) that are doing the best the can with poor management overseeing them. Would I go back?

OK - so maybe the computer knew we were a bunch of aging boomers and a senior. We arrived early (our friends also stayed the night before) around 11:30 am and our room wasn't ready (did not expect it to be but asked anyway). I asked when it would be ready and was told at around 3:00 pm. No problem - we went to lunch and the aquarium. We returned at 4:30 and the room wasn't ready. Megan, the staff at the front desk, gave us a room that was ready. I then asked if our romantic package would be moved to the new room. Megan looked quite bewildered that we even had the romantic package (it does show up on my confimation.) Megan went to the original room to check. No romantic package. She told me that the extra package price would be deducted from my bill. She also sent up around 7:30 pm a cheese and fruit platter which we didn't consume when we returned from dinner but did enjoy the fruit at breakfast the next morning. Also, when we arrived back at 4:30 pm, our friends room still hadn't been cleaned. In the morning when my billed showed up, the package had not been deducted. I called down to the front desk and explained about the charge and was placed on hold. After 5 minutes on hold, we decided to go to breakfast. When we got back from breakfast, I called the front desk again and finally got them to remove the package charge. The breakfast was mediocre with no cut-up fresh fruit so we appreciated the fruit platter we received the night before. Scrambled eggs were so-so, potatoes under cooked. The room was clean but I felt it was overpriced but that might be due to the area. It is a good location and walking distance to the aquarium and restaurants.

The kids (9 & 14) thought the sofabed was comfortable - an adult might disagree. When pulled out, it took up the entire room, so there was no where to put suitcases. We were in a room that came off the corner of the hallway, so the entrance hall was very long and the room dimensions may not have been typical. Had a partial view of some of the water, but mostly a view of the parking lot across the street. Full sized frig. My son doesn't like the noises of the big city (honking horns, sirens), so he noticed the noise at night but we didn't. Breakfast exceeded our expectations. The Sunday morning one was pretty extensive and they had lots of people refilling. Nearly overcrowded for seating but no one was left without a table. The breakfast on Monday morning was a little simpler, but still satisfied us. Regarding the pool and health club. The pool that you have access to is small - similiar to some Hampton Inn pools.

They sent me the head of maintenance and he came and apologized, told me the workman must have gone for a part. Well we were in the room for the next 30 to 45 minutes and he never came back.

Checking in was awkward with the way the hotel is set up on the street, but it was easy. We originally booked a 2 Queen one bedroom suite. Upon check in, we were told they were out. We had booked a month in advanc, so this was news to us. So we ended up with a King one bedroom suite. That's fine. The child can sleep on the pull out couch bed. We checked into our room to find it ULTRA tiny. The picture online make it seem quite spacious. It is not. It is rather cramped with a lot of wasted hallway space. The bathroom and dressing area are very cramped and once the pull out sofa is pulled out, it is the entire living room. This room was not designed to accomodate more than two people comfortably, and certainly not a couple with a small child. The rooms were very clean, and I was glad to have the kitchen. I was not aware that the pillows and comforters were down. If I had, I would have requested a down free room. The air conditioning was very odd and it was difficult to get it cooler in the room. The complimentary hot breakfast downstairs was a very nice perk with very friendly staff. Front desk staff used profanity upon my checking out when I laughingly described the fit that my child was throwing because we were having to leave. That was awesome. Thank you for using the 'P' word right there in the front of a very nice hotel. Yes, my child was 'pissed' but you didn't need to keep saying that over and over again. Glad he was not in the room at the time. Internet was good once you got the right connection. I kept getting the Hilton Garden Inn site rather than the Homewood Suites site.

To start, we arrived to find another family in front of us with the mom in tears because they couldn't honor their reservation - apparently they overbook the rooms at this place. So this family - with 6 kids - was sent over to the Marriott. My husband and I had 3 kids with us, so we were worried at this point. And rightly so. The desk clerk told us that she didn't have our room available either. But we could have a smaller room if we wanted it. Not wanting to trudge to the Marriott with 3 kids at 7pm, we took it. The front desk person told us that they don't guarantee rooms that are booked online. Nice. In 2011 this place can't guarantee your room if you book ONLINE??? Whatever. Upon first glance, the room was ok. Till we noticed the musty, smoky smell and stained furniture. On top of not having the room we paid for available, they gave us a smoking room when we specifically reserved nonsmoking due to my very bad allergies and for the kids' health. My husband complained, but they said again that no other rooms were available. They sent a custodian up, who promptly started spraying air freshener all over the place - great for allergies, of course. At least he was extremely nice and apologetic - he left an \"air purifier\" that didn't do much. The one thing I can say for this place is that the free breakfast is great - lots of selection and everything was hot and decent. You would think that once we checked out, the crappy time was over. But no. I started getting weird random charges on the card I used to check in. Especially weird because they are from the Hilton Garden Hotel, which is connected to the suites - but where we did NOT stay. Neither the accountant nor the managers at the hotel(s) have any idea why these charges are on my account.

We just had a nice stay and I'm glad we chose Homewood Suites again - this time in Baltimore. Just a few words of \"note\" to pickier guests: the breakfast area is gotten to by going to \"Homewood Lodge\" in the elevator - the rear doors open. It is staffed by only a few, so when it's busy, please expect that some things might need to be refilled, but they do it as quickly as possible and will get it for you right away if you ask. The pool is kind of an issue, but not really. I'd read people complain about it because you can only use the splash pool and hot tub and not the lap pools. This is true (because the fitness center and pools are actually a fitness club's property), but is that really a big deal? I will say the \"taste\" of the splash pool was gross (salty, like sweat), but the pool is clean and we had a great time (just sucked it up and dealt with it). The lifeguard was really, REALLY super nice and we had fun - but also note that you should go ALL THE WAY through the gym to get to the pool if you have children as they are not allowed to go through the changing rooms. Another thing I didn't know that has nothing to do with Homewood Suites is that parking is VERY VERY EXPENSIVE in Baltimore. Do your homework and try to get discounts. I did use the hotel's parking garage with in/out privileges and it was $26/day (they charge you by how many nights you stayed), though that rate could change. You can easily walk to most of the pier properties. I walked to the aquarium and I have very, very bad legs. It was a nice day though and we went slowly and enjoyed the walk. Cabs are available, but if you're going to do that, you might as well drive and park close to where you want to be. It costs the same ($6-7 over, $6-7 back vs. $7-15 for parking). Another note that will change based on what's going on... LOTS of sirens one night, not the other and jack-hammering in the a.m. (after 9 a.m. Sunday) due to construction on the street below.

We couldn't find an empty table when we went down to have breakfast and it seems the tables were not cleaned up fast enough. One thing to watch out is the parking. The parking garage is connected to the hotel, but the entrance is on another street on the back of the hotel.

Families, business people, etc. Very nice. But, as with many hotels, the cleaning staff is normally from another country and English tends not to be their primary language, however, they can usually understand what you are saying. From the day we arrived, we had to call the front desk everyday to get more wash cloths. There were my husband and I, our teenager and our infant. So we atleast needed three cloths, as I brought the baby's from home. But everyday we would arrive back at our room to find 1 or 2. The one day I caught up with the maid she had no idea what I was saying when I said wash cloth. She tried to give me soap, shampoo and a hand towel. Also, we tip everybody...the housekeeping, maintenance (when they had to come twice to replace light bulbs), and even the people who brought us our wash cloths. And one time I said enough is enough...why are we tipping the person who brings us our wash cloths when we didn't get them the first time around? So the guy who brought them asked us 2 more times if there was anything else we needed or he could get us until my husband finally gave him a dollar. And he smiled and left.

I traveled back to visit Baltimore, where I lived most of life, to visit my hometown w/a husband who pretty much shunned city life. But I wasn't going to give up staying in the city for a bit. He loved it. We were on the back end of the hotel, 2 stories above a grassy private area w/a fountain (5 stories up technically) so noise was NOT an issue at all. I loved the fact we could walk out the front door to the aquarium, shopping, little italy etc. I also loved the fact that \"Harbor East\" area has been so renovated and built up w/fancy hotels/restaurants/shopping that your safety is not really in question. The hotel is across the street from a police sub station and there is numerous hired security in the general area. It is also right next to a Whole Foods for shopping to stock your mini kitchen in your suite. The $25 a day parking can be a little hard to take, but we needed a car. If you are just staying in the city, you don't need a car as public transportation/walking/cabbing/airport shuttle is always available. The parking is not owned by the hotel, but I felt perfectly safe in the garage as we had an elevator directly to our hotel. Actually, I can honestly say it was probably the cleanest parking garage I have ever been in. The suite w/two rooms was honestly smaller than we thought, especially w/a pack and play, but that's ok. Front Desk staff was VERY busy but helpful if you needed them. They brought milk and some other things right up to our room when we arrived the first night after the dinner closed. The one down side? The free breakfast/dinners during the week were really nothing to speak of. They had stuffed flounder on their menu for the weeknight we were there and it ended up being plain pasta w/red sauce. It was fine to feed our toddler, lucky we were planning to have crabs that night anyway. The breakfast eggs were cakey and bacon see through - but then again, you can't complain when its free. Take it or leave it. And there were other options such as cereal/fruits etc. Also, I know from living in the city that the pool privledges aren't those in the large pool shown - its simply a little plunge pool for hotel guests at the MAC.

Pool The pool doesn't belong to the hotel. It belongs to the health club in the same building. As a hotel guest, you do not get to use the pool as pictured. The hotel guests are all crammed into one small pool area. We got to use the pool for 15 minutes on Saturday. There are two other pools we could not use. One was empty and the other had one man doing laps the 15 minutes we were there. We visited Bmore for a long weekend and the pool closed by 5 or 6 each day. It was not open on Easter. On Saturday the life guard decided to close early and forced everyone out about 20 minutes early. 2. Bar noise Our room faced the James Joyce Bar and on Friday night we got to listen to what sounded like live, very loud music from the outdoor patio until very late at night. Fortunately we brought a small hepa air cleaner and that drowned out enough music to allow our children to sleep. 3. I think they want you to bring your own towels. They are STINGY with towels. We are a family of four. We had three towels the day we checked in and made do the first night and next morning. When the cleaning staff came in they left us with only 1 towel and hand towel. We got back to our hotel fairly late and had to call room service to get towels. When they showed up they tried to give us only two. What? 4. Linens Our children slept on a pull out sleeper couch and linens had been left on from the previous visit. They were dirty and full of food crumbs. We had no other linens in the room other than heavy blankets. 5. Parking is expensive You have to park in a PMI parking lot that is very expensive. It cost us $40 to park in the lot Fri - Sun. 6. Breakfast The breakfast is free and is a lot like what other restaurants offer but they could not keep anything stocked. Both mornings that we ate there they were out of forks, bowls, cereals and much of the food for long periods of time. Depending upon which elevator you go down on, you end up at one of two eating places. The nicer side costs $10 or so and has pretty much the same food as the free side. It has omelets made to order and had some fruit. It was less crowded and apparently didn't run out of stuff as much. I never saw a sign indicating the one side wasn't free.

Upon hearing that, she disappeared into the back and returned with an envelope good for a free in-room movie and two boxes of movie candy for us! We had a movie night anyway! We had to extend another night as well as get a late checkout on our last day (all with a \"no problem!\" from the desk staff), and among the things we did during our stay was walk around the corner to the drug store to get a medication extension for my wife (who had forgotten to pack that in our haste to leave home), visit the Starbucks next door, shop for furniture on the same block, walk to the Inner Harbor ESPN Zone to play games and eat dinner one night, and within the hotel itself, there was a small library where my wife found a book to read, and we enjoyed a free pool table.

While housekeeping did come up right away to clean the shower again, when I went to turn the beds down for the night (around 8pm) I noticed the sheet problem. When I called down to the desk I was told housekeeping was on break and wouldn't be able to come up for 45 min. This was unacceptable as I had 3 very tired kids that needed sleep fast. So my husband went down and got sheets and we made the bed ourselves. He also took the gloves down with him when he went to get sheets as my one year old had found the gloves and was playing with them. When he complained to the manager he was told they couldn't comp our stay b/c of the rate we booked but would send him a certificate for a free night. We are HH's members. So they did try to do something at least. The furniture in the living room was a bit worn, stains and such all over the couch. Some minor stains on the floor. The fan was nice in the room as it was a bit warmer in there. There was an on/off switch for our fan and it did work. The beds were comfortable. The shower and tub were clean and free of mold which was a very big plus for me. Another big plus was the workout center and the pool. While we didn't use the workout center, we walked through it for the pool and it was one of the nicest I have ever seen. They had 3 pools: one workout pool, one lap pool and a smaller pool for the kids. Also a hot tub. We used the smaller pool and there were noodles and kick boards for the kids. Also, the lifeguard was so nice and got my one year old a life jacket and a toy rubber duck to play with. The water was heated too so it was very comfortable to swim in. They are all indoor pools by the way. It was a big hit with the kids. We walked to a baseball game at Camden Yards the first day and while it was doable I wouldn't recommend it for little kids. We had the one year old in a stroller so that was ok, but our others (7 yo and 4 yo) were tired and not really wanting to keep walking. It's a good 20 min to Camden Yards from the hotel.

I have been staying in Baltimore while out of school for summer break. I arrived at Hilton Garden on Thursday May 7, 2009. I thought that this location was beautiful and that I would truly enjoy my stay. However since here, I have been treated very rudely! I will only mention the incidents that have really truly upset me. I must advise that I checked out for the first time since May 7 on May14 because of the rudeness from Donna the manager at the front desk, but the location I moved to was not what I was looking for. I wanted to be close to the water and I flew in, so I needed to be somewhere where everything was in walking distance, which the Homewood Inner Harbor location suited me perfectly. Sometimes I want a good home cooked meal while away from home, and here I can cook, and everything is very convenient. Well, I checked back in on Friday the 15th paying 195.00 covering me until Saturday morning. Saturday morning I enquired about the rate, and it was 139.00 plus tax, so I paid 300.00 to cover me until Monday the 18th. Sunday night I received a call from Donna the manager saying I needed to come down and pay. I explained to her that I already paid. She said, \"no you need to come down and pay, or else I will have to have security come down and escort you out of your room. I then (with a little extra bass in my voice) said that I have already paid, and you are dead wrong, and I will need an apology tomorrow, and I will be contacting the manager! She then said \" I guess we'll just have to send you some more free stuff!!! I was completely floored! I then decided that these calls needed to be recorded just in case they did put me out 6 hours away from home in a room that I had paid for, than that was completely grounds for a law suit! I then called back and Skylar answered the phone. I tried to explain to her that they were wrong in a very calm manner She would not agree even after I completely explained how, when, and who I paid! They also disconnected my phone not allowing me to call out. This a.m. when I woke, I went downstairs and requested the manager contact me because I was still very upset, even now writing this, I am fuming! I called and called for the manager, My call finally reaching him at 2 p.m. He told me he would speak to Scott TOMORROW! Are you kidding me???? And also, for me to lay down and get some rest or go out and get some fresh air! Really, what is that supposed to do?!. I called back down when 2nd shift got here actually trying to give one of these ladies a chance to apologize. Skylar answered,. and I said \" So, you guys were wrong!\" She did not apologize, but did admit that I was caught up on my room last night while being harassed at 10:15 p.m. I do have taped phone calls on my cell phone. My mother taught me very well! I document and record everything. I then asked for corporate number, she said 1-800-HILTON. After calling that number and seeing that was not enough numbers, I then called back up front and Donna answered. I then told het that I would never need anything for free, I have paid more e money in my room than what she makes in a month and I will never need anything for free, after all my house isn\u2019t sitting in a puddle! I said this because no manager has taken care of this issue, and they have been able to say what they want to me, no manager has stepped in, so obviously I need to step up and say something! I was almost in tears last night- tears of anger, humiliation, and I am still extremely upset! I have spoke to Katrina from corporate and she was in disbelief, she gave me several apologies, which I can't say for the hotel. She has promised that both ladies will formally apologize to me this week, and I can't wait! Karma is something! I will write my reviews and pass this on to whoever until this issue gets solved! Corporate has promised satisfaction in 3 days, no more than that!", "Date": "May 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Stay at Homewood Suites Baltimore!\u201d", "Author": "DeeCSW", "ReviewID": "UR29797344", "Content": "Stayed here on a HH reward for one night to see a Yankees-Orioles game. We normally stay at the Hampton Inn Camden Yards when going to games but wanted to try something new. The location of the hotel is very convenient to the Inner Harbor and about a 15-20 minute walk to the stadium. The neighborhood around the hotel is great, with a Starbucks next door, Haagen Dazs, movie theatre, and a Whole Foods around the block. I liked the convenience of the hotel parking garage ($22 overnight, $25 with in/out priveleges), as there was an elevator that took us staright from the lot to the lobby. The only negative during our stay was at check-in. The woman at the desk reacted less than enthusiastically when I presented her with my paperwork for my Hilton Honors stay. I don't know if was because it was \"free\" (as she announced rather loudly, with a hint of sarcasm for all the world to hear, or at least the people standing behind us). This kind of amused me as a Hilton Honors member staying in a Hilton-owned hotel, I would expect at the very least, a smile. Oh well. Maybe next time? I was given keys but not told any other information, such as when and where breakfast would be served, where the gym was located, where the pool was located and its hours, etc. We were given Room 559, a Studio Suite, despite my preference for a higher floor away from elevators and ice machines (my standard preference that automatically kicks up on my rewards reservations). Fortunately, we did not experience any noise from either despite their close proximity to the room. The suite itself was lovely; there is a cute little kitchenette and we were treated to a free bag of microwave popcorn and 2 bottles of water in the fridge. We did not cook during our stay so I cannot comment on the kitchen being well stocked. The room was large and more than adequate for the three of us (2 adults, and and one child). Our son slept on the pull-out sofabed (had to call the front desk for sheets) and we took the king-sized bed. Loved the swivel tv. Our little guy went to sleep, and we liked being able to turn the tv around without the glare/sound bothering him at all. The bathroom vanity/sink was outside, and as others have noted, and this can be bothersome to whomever is in the bed, especially late at night if you have to turn the light on (it's bright!!). Shower was a nice size. Breakfast is served on the 2nd floor and there was a nice selection of hot food. We kind of overdid it with the eggs, bacon and sausage. There were also pancakes and cold cereals. Plenty of juice and coffee, etc. Overall, we had a very pleasant stay.

This review is for the Homewood suties). The reviewers were not wrong. Best bang for your buck in the inner harbor. The hotel is located in a new area of the inner harbor called Harbor East. The Marriot is between you and the water but there were still water views from our 10th floor room. The hotel was at least 1/2 the cost of the marriot in front of us with a lot more amenities. We had a one room suite with a big sitting area and pullout couch for my daughter, a full kitchen, and a king sized bed for 3 nights for $415 (the weekday stay was 1 1/2 times the cost of the weekend nights probably because the area is designed for weekday business people. By the way parking is extra at about 25 a day). There was a 42 inch tv that pivoted so you could watch it from the bed or the living room. There was a free hot breakfast everyday, on weekdays they have a free evening appetizer meal (for example stuffed shells, salad, vegetable and cookies) each afternoon from 5-7 with beer and wine. They are attached to a full sized gym that is brand new and completely state of the art with free membership for all hotel guests that has a large lap pool for adults, a larger pool for water aerobics and a medium pool for families with kids filled with noodles and kick boards and water wings and a lifeguard as well as full gym facilities, big changing rooms with showers and lockers, squash rooms, spin classes etc. The hotel staff went above and beyond to help us out and the area is so brand new so there are plenty of restaurants, starbucks, whole foods, haagan daaz, and a great movie theatre right next door. it was a 15 minute walk to the fells point bars and restaurants, 15 minutes to the inner harbor and it was 5 minutes to little italy. There was a water taxi stop in front of the marriot so that was 2 min. away. All in all this was a great vacation. Our only issue was a recommendation by one of the managers for a restaurant called \"the greasy spoon\". We were told that it was in walking distance and we never found it. We checked the next day and she repeated the directions and said she saw it there that morning. We drove past the area and beyond, twice. we never found it. I also did an internet search and it never came up. I don't know what the deal was but we never found anything like what she told us about.

The big screened tv rotated, so you could lay in bed and watch, or turn it around to face the living room area. The bed was very comfortable, although I didn't care for the light fluffy pillows (I personally prefer a more weighted, heavier pillow). The only thing about the layout of the room I didn't like was the bathroom/vanity area. The bathroom had the shower and toilet in it, but the sink/mirror is outside the bathroom in the vanity area. While I was getting ready in the morning, at the vanity area, I had to turn the lights on, which are very bright and woke my 20 month old and husband. There is no door separating the vanity area from the bedroom area. I personally like to have privacy when getting ready and would prefer for there to be a door there ( at least just for keeping the bright lights from others sleeping still). That was really the only thing I didn't like. I loved the complementary hot breakfast in the morning. We ate so much, we actually skipped lunch that day. They had everything you could want - eggs, bacon, sausage, some kind of grits, potatoes, oatmeal, cereal, milk, coffee, fruit, yogurt, tea, juice, bagels, toast, muffins... We got down there early and it wasn't busy at all. They even brought out a high chair for our little one. After breakfast, we headed to the aquarium ( about 5-10 min. walk). We requested a late checkout and they said we could check out at 1:00. (12:00 is the usual checkout time). You are allowed to keep your car in the lot until 4:00 pm without getting charged additional $ too, which is nice if you want extra time to do whatever you want, without having to worry about moving your car.

He was also pleasant and professional and stated that he did not see them on the reservation, but he would call housekeeping to make sure that our request would be filled. A little annoyed but assured, we went up to the room so that our twins could take their afternoon nap. They slept on the floor, but my wife made sure and slept right beside them for safety. They had just begun to walk, so we did not want them wandering in the dark if they woke up early. After nap, we decided to leave for dinner.

Last year I stayed at the Marriott across the street, which has nicer views, but I think I will return to the Homewood in the future. It was a pleasure to unwind in the evening on a sofa and not a bed. I used the microwave to warm up my take-out restaurant food, and later for a snack. Microwave popcorn envelopes were a nice touch with the free coffee/tea service. I noticed the kitchen was fully stocked with equipment, including potholders, cooking utensils, and full range of pots/pans. The room was spic-and-span, the suite set-up was charming and I never bumped into the walls or furniture. I had a partial view of the Harbour from the 9th floor. King bed was attractive and firm. Other travelers have noted the beautiful swiveled Phillips plasma TV - some HD viewing possible; child content control, some on-demand features for a price (about the cost of a retail theater experience), hotel services/account. Hilton offers express check-out: either use the TV or call the front desk. I did the former. A comprehensive breakfast was complimentary in my room rate--overall a good experience, but some minor catering issues (butter not replaced when it ran out, egg casserole not fully cooked). I loved the Neutrogena toiletries, but there was no shower cap and no shelf or waste basket in the toilet area for feminine hygiene needs. (I pointed this out to staff). Also, despite being a Hilton member w/ a profile, my request for hypo-allergenic bedding was not prepared for arrival and I had to chase down a staff member to take care of this, discovering there is no \"housekeeping\" number on the phone (also, the room # was wrong on the phone). These problems were reported. Staff was very friendly during these experiences, and at the breakfast room. I liked the variety of restaurants, attractions, and support stores noted by other travelers (Whole Foods, drug store CVS under construction in particular) immediately adjacent to the hotel. But I walked about 2 blocks into Little Italy about 6 PM on a lovely spring evening (well-lit) and immediately regretted it as a solo female. Additionally, there are way too many aggressive panhandlers in the Inner Harbor. While I am used to these in my home city, travelers should prepare for the onslaught and/or the resultant guilt trips. While there were plenty of Harbour Police on patrol (some on Segways or bikes), they were not present off of the Harbour area e.g. in Little Italy. Warning: There has been major construction at the Harbour immediately in front of the Marriott and Homewood for at least one year, which curtails freedom of movement and provides early-morning sound effects.", "Date": "May 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, PA", "Title": "\u201cVery clean, nice, and great location!\u201d", "Author": "JKCPittsburgh_PA", "ReviewID": "UR15814557", "Content": "I took my sister to Baltimore so that she could check out Univ.

The room was a Studio Suite, so everything was in the same large room essentially--it was very spacious, open, and comfortable. Everything was VERY clean and seemed either relatively new or very well-kept. The bed was very comfortable as well. Overall, I was impressed with how clean and nice the room was, as I am very picky about the cleanliness of hotel rooms. My sister said the water pressure was good in the shower, and the hotel had provided nice Neutrogena soaps to use. The complimentary breakfast was good--there was a nice selection. Also, the hotel was very convenient to the downtown/inner harbor areas. We took a taxi to the inner harbor, but, had the weather been nicer, you could probably walk there in ~15 minutes. The hotel was also very convenient to Univ. of Baltimore as well as the exits to major highways. Overall, I was impressed with the hotel and its location.

Loved the TVs\u201d", "Author": "Ctraveler", "ReviewID": "UR15546027", "Content": "We stayed at the Homewood Suites from Wednesday to Saturday in April with our two children ages 13 and 5. We chose it because it is a brand-new hotel and the picture of the indoor pool looked amazing. We were disappointed to find out that the pool pictured on the Homewood Suites website wasn't really part of the hotel. It was one of three pools belonging to a very large health club located in the same building. Children are not allowed in the large lane pool, but only in the small pool which was off to the side (and not pictured in the photos). Hotel guests are allowed access and use of the whole health club. When we asked to see the pool the front desk of the hotel gave us a pass which said it was for one free use of the fitness club or pool. It said that subsequent uses cost $20.00. Also, the fitness club is quite a hike from the elevator banks of the Homewood Suites. (It is closer to the Hilton Garden Inn which shares a building with the Homewood Suites). I saw families doing it, but I wasn't really in the mood to go through the entire building with kids and their pool gear. There, of course, are changing rooms at the health club with lockers which I assume hotel guests may use. Once you get to the fitness center, you also need to show a photo Id and have all family members sign in. All of this ended up being too many obstacles for one tired mom and in the end we never did use the pool. The room was very nice. We had a one-bedroom King suite which had a pull-out bed for the kids to share. It had two flat-screen TVs which the kids loved with pay per view movies available. The room was not overly spacious, but adequate. It would be very tight for larger families. The brand-new full kitchen was very nice. Vacationers beware! The complimentary breakfast is from 6am to 9am on weekday mornings! It was OK. They had 4 or 5 hot items every morning, but expect grits and biscuits and gravy, rather than pancakes and waffles. The biggest problem with the breakfast was that it seemed to be poorly run. They kept running out of the hot food. No matter what day or time I went up to the buffet with my kids, we were always scraping the bottom of the pan to get the last eggs, the last potatoes, etc. For two days in a row they had the same four onion bagels sitting there. They finally put new bagels out on Saturday. They ran out of \"to go\" coffee cups one day. The next day they ran out of silverware and everyone who got their after 8:20am had to use plastic forks. There was hotel staff overseeing the breakfast, but when they ran out of food or utensils they would just shrug. On the other hand, my 5-yr- old loved the Fruit Loops! We couldn't find any other restaurant options for breakfast within short distance to the hotel. The Inner Harbour is close, but not quite close enough to drag 13 year olds out of bed and make them march to it before breakfast. Families might consider buying breakfast items from Whole Foods around the corner and eating in their room if they can't make it to breakfast before 9am. Starbucks and Haagen Dazs are right next door to the hotel. The hotel is on the edge of Little Italy. We ate very well for dinner! We did walk back and forth to the Inner Harbour. The shortest route is to walk across the street to the Marriott Waterfront and then use the pier/bridges to get across. We would stay here again, because it wasn't a bad price for the accomodations and location to the Inner Harbour. Just don't expect much from breakfast and be prepared to use the health-club pool with the kids.", "Date": "May 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bronx NY", "Title": "\u201cVery Pleased!\u201d", "Author": "TravelinQueen73", "ReviewID": "UR15406592", "Content": "Me and my family just returned from a weekend stay at the Homewood Suites in Baltimore and we were very satisfied! We were there for \"A Day Out With Thomas\" and we were able to check in early at about 1pm, which was great! We stayed in a spotless one bedroom suite on the 11th floor with a city view. It was new and spacious and had everything we neeeded. We are a family of five and we had plenty of room, with 2 beds in a separate bedroom, a sofa bed, full kitchen, and 2 flat screen TVs. (The linens for the sofabed are kept in the closet in the bedroom.) The hotel is within walking distance to the Aquarium and many restaurants and attractions. The Aquarium is expensive at approximately $25.00 per adult and $20.00 per child, but the kids loved it! (The 4D show at the aquarium was fun but my little ones were scared.) You will do a bit of walking so make sure you wear comfortable walking shoes, while everything is within walking distance, somethings are a bit of a hike especially if you have young children! There is a whole foods (organic supermarket) and a wine shop across the street, a movie theatre next door to the hotel, and also a Starbucks and a Hagen Dazz store. The parking garage is attached to the hotel, and while it is $25.00 per night parking, it is very convenient and you can come and go as you please with the card given to you at the front desk. The complimentary breakfast was the best I have ever had at a hotel! There was a selection of hot and cold foods such as, bacon, sausage, eggs, potatoes, cheese grits, cereal, danish, muffins, bagels, toast. There was also juices, coffee, tea, chocolate milk and yogurts. We were worried that we wouldn't find much left because we didn't make it out of our room unitl after 9am (breakfast is over at 10am) but there was plenty and the servers (hosts) were very nice.

Whole Foods grocery store is around the corner so you can grab something healthy and stock it in your hotel room's fridge. We actually took advantage of Whole Foods great selection of salad and gourmet deli to bring back to the room for dinner one night. The pool at the MAC fitness center was nice, but kids were only allowed in the small side pool, which was dissapointing because they really wanted to swim laps in the big pool but were not allowed to. They also had a ridiculous rule that you had to take a shower before entering the pool so we would have to walk from the locker room to the pool dripping wet and freezing!

There were three towels for our family of five, we called the front desk and the phone just rang and rang and rang. After trying for 1/2 hour my husband went downstairs to request the towels. The same thing happened later that evening when we realized there was no bedding for the sleeper sofa. Again, on day two when the maid failed to leave us enough towels and NO toilet paper, the phone was never answered. We never had enough personal items the entire stay. Luckily, I had brought our own shampoo's etc... The toilet clogged on day three, again, no answer. The front desk just never answered the darn phone! Very, very poor customer service. I would think on day one, when you know that 5 people are in the room, you would make sure we had 5 towels for the each day the remainder of our stay.

We went with the hotel because we have always had good luck with Homewood Suites. We first stayed at the hotel in mid Jan. because of a medical appointment, which at the time of booking we asked if they give medical discount, which we were told they did & they knocked off $20.00 and we were very thankful for that. Then we booked for the surgery for end of February, this booking did not go as smooth. We were told no discount for medical, when we questioned why we got it the first time she had no response to that, she also was very rude. After much discussion, she did give us a discounted rate. We checked our reservations the next morning & they had booked a non-smoking room instead of smoking as we requested. We called the hotel & they changed the reservation, but to our surprise when we went on line to check our reservations again, they added $30.00 more onto the one nights charge. We called & ask why, they said because we made a change to our reservation. Our ? was why wasn't the second night hiked, she had nothing to say & again she was very rude & short. So as long as you don't ask for anything different you will be ok. Also when they cleaned our room and stocked the coffee, they left decaf and no regular. I am sure its because we were located on the 12th floor, which is the top, and by the time they got up there they were out of regular. I feel these hotels should be considerate to families that are coming to their city for surgeries. This was a very upsetting time in our family and to have to deal with people like this just made the situation worse.
