It was the best of four hotels so far. Located next to a tram stop on a useful radial route that serves the inner suburbs; trams make lots of connections with other rail services. The hotel is 5 min walk from Warschauer Str. interchange stations with frequent S-Bahn services to Alexanderplatz and all the way through the former west Berlin, in minutes. The U-Bahn equivalent station is a further 5 min walk away along the same road overbridge and is actually the terminus of the historic original U-Bahn line. A significant surviving remnant of the Wall is a further 5/7 minutes on towards the river. Hotel has been redecorated and redesigned in a classic way as suits its name. All was top notch. Breakfast ample with ample choices served in the long thin dining area that links to the room lifts. All mirrors and reflective lighting. Small front reception doubles as a bar. The staff clearly expects certain good standards of behaviour and appearance and certain guests were reprimanded for their unacceptable appearance. Good. Do not be put off by the immediate surroundings nor by the somewhat scruffy rail station which is located on a split site with an open air ticket hall. Lots of regular taxis in the area. It is about Euro28 to Schonefeld airport by taxi if you can't face the rail links. Even the humble Lebanese self-service cafe next door can offer great food. The main street/boulevard with the tram service offers a mix of health food supermarkets, good chemists, nail bars and second hand book shops. Generally, the area behind the hotel (away from the rail station) offer the most terrific choice of cafes, restaurants, specialist shops and small fashion shops. You can eat something, somewhere, 'around the clock' in the hotel vicinity even if it is only from a take-way cafe. There is a big Sunday fleamarket 15 minutes north of the hotel in a small park square. We would stay there again.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel Aviv, Israel", "Title": "\u201cVery recommended!!!\u201d", "Author": "Dimac1982", "ReviewID": "UR113812660", "Content": "Well, we wanted not expensive, nice hotel with good connection to the center of Berlin by metro. For 90 EURO per night (BB) for 3 persons, we received very large and beautiful room. Really, it is very beautiful. looks like 5 star hotel I swear! The building isn't new, but the hotel inside and rooms are very groom. Staff was very comminicable and friendly. Breakfast was nice. If I'm visit Berlin agayn - there is no dilemma where I'll sleep. The only little problem may be during the most hot times of summer. It may be too hot in rooms. But I didn't check. In any case, between September and April\\May - the hotel is the best.", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, Close to S/U Banh. area not great friday/saturday nights!!\u201d", "Author": "Corkonian_85", "ReviewID": "UR66957396", "Content": "i stayed in the hotel from Friday to monday. we arrive very late friday night to find the hotel in an area surrounded by outdoor clubs, fast food outlets and young drunk kids, mostly of the Punk variety. we did not feel safe on the train platform or walking the 200 meters to the hotel. once at the hotel it was beauitful, you cannot hear the techno music from the clubs or the sounds from the roads outside. the room was a good size, the staff were excelent, the breakfast will keep you full well into the day. during the day the surrounding area looked fine. mainly young students living and working in the area. there was some broken glass on the gound from the nights before. i would not recomend this hotel if you have young children as the drinking culture in this area is a big turnoff good hotel if your looking for cheap, comfortable hotel close to the train lines.", "Date": "June 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pitesti", "Title": "\u201cNice and cozy\u201d", "Author": "simi69", "ReviewID": "UR63652741", "Content": "I was with my family 4 nights here and the hotel was nice.

This time I wanted a bit of a treat. The hostels are always clean but I wanted somewhere a little more cosy to spend time relaxing between beer and dancing. The hotel did not disappoint, in fact we were very pleased with it. It was clean, warm, quiet (surprisingly so considering it's location next to a busy road and train station). Staff were polite and friendly, bed comfy, breakfast buffet good (fruit, salad, bread, eggs, cheese, juices) and bar welcoming. The hotel is small which makes it cosy and convenient but maintains a professional ambiance. Very pleased with the rate (230 euro for 3 nights - Sun to Wed). The hotel also held our bags from Saturday until we checked in on Sunday. Good location as is close to main station, U-bahn station as well as trams. 10 minute walk to Panorama Bar / Berghain!! Would recommend and will stay there again.", "Date": "March 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm", "Title": "\u201cGood breakfast and nice rooms\u201d", "Author": "TeacherStockholm", "ReviewID": "UR35693691", "Content": "Very nice rooms, sofa and armchairs.

If they had told me it was a 5 star hotel I would have believed it to. The hotel is on the east side of Berlin. Which isn't one of the best areas. Very untidy streets. However we never felt unsafe. We didn't really looked around in the area, but I don't think there is a lot to do. A lot of young people. But we left the hotel in the morning and returned back late. So only for sleeping....it was great! The rooms are nicely decorated, spacious and clean. The breakfast is fantastic...even fresh fruit (btw breakfast was included in the price!) The employees were very helpful and . Very convenient to train station, only 200 meters (U-bahn as well as S-Bahn). Within 10 minutes you're in downtown Berlin (3 stops away from Alexanderplatz). Would definitely stay there again for that price.", "Date": "April 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Isle of Wight", "Title": "\u201cWhat a gem ! Most unexpected\u201d", "Author": "PaulLins", "ReviewID": "UR26694634", "Content": "Stayed here to be close to the O2 World Arena, Berlin to watch P!nk perform. Our priority was closeness to the venue and a clean hotel. What a gem !! Honestly, we've stayed at hotels all over the world including 6* hotels in the Maldives. We had no expectations here, just a hope it would be clean. The room was spacious, clean, nice bathroom, heating, quiet and modern. The staff ( all of them ) couldn't do enough to help. We actually had an evening meal there twice out of the 3 nights we had available to us. Ok, so the second time the wrong meal came out much to our horror but we laughed it off and ate it anyway( and yes we still payed for it !) Breakfast was included and it was very nice. Internet was quick, wireless and very good value. \u20ac3 got you 2 hours but you could log in and out as you wished. Location fantastic for us for the O2 but literally 200 meters from the train station - so direct from the airport and direct to pretty much anywhere in Berlin. We would definitely go back here and have no hesitation in recommending the hotel and the staff.", "Date": "March 23, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Klassik Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d1028471-Reviews-Klassik_Hotel-Berlin.html", "Price": "$71 - $160*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Revaler Strasse 6</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10245</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1028471", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/87/9e/879e16fbc0bd6ac977191f72f55a1c1e7large.jpg"}}
