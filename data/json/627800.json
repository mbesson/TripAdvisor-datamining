I found it not as bad as the reviews on here read. The room was not very small and it was clean, the beds were comfy and the toilet and the shower were clean. The staff were helpful though they do not know much English. The location is good, just a few minutes walk to the Hung Hom MRT and there are a lot of restaurants nearby. So we enjoyed our stay and I would recommend the hotel for budget travellers.", "Date": "June 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cSmallest room in the world!\u201d", "Author": "kwtum", "ReviewID": "UR128374839", "Content": "Don't stay here ever!

For about $80.00HK extra per night, I was give a room more than twice the size with a couch etc. I would highly recommend this hotel. The staff for the most part were pleasant and helpful.
