I had no objection and upon arriving was okay with the modular-type 2 bedroom unit. My main concern was that it was clean, and it was. Chieko, the owner was also very accommodating when we asked if there was another unit available for another member of our family who originally planned to stay with us, but everyone was more comfortable with them having their own 2 bedroom unit. The daily rates were very reasonable and the location would be hard to beat. The boat dock was a fun place to swim with noodles.

We were coming down from Kansas City to get a puppy. The family that we got the dog from recommended Green Valley Resort. When I checked it out online, I was really surprised at the rates so we booked a 3 night stay in cabin #20. I had no idea what to expect and we were so surprised and happy to see our accomodations when we got there. It was so beautiful. Our cabin had a beautiful view of the lake from our screened-in porch. The lake was only about 30 yds from our door. Our kids had a great time looking on the shore for shells and floating on rafts. It was like our own private beach. The cottage was completely furnished with a super comfy king sized bed along with 2 queen size sofa beds. One of these was on the screened porch so it was a plus. Everything was very clean and fresh linens were available all day. I had a chance to talk with the owner, Chieko, and found her to be one of the hardest working people I have ever met. She is truly dedicated to making her guests feel welcome and comfortable. We rented one of her pontoon boats and had a great time. It was the way to see and appreciate the beauty of the lake. I would highly recommend a boat rental if you stay there. The rates were very reasonable. The pool area was a huge hit with our kids. They have a good sized waterslide and some very comfortable pool side loungers. They also have a great play area for the young ones that includes an old boat that has been made to be a part of the kids play area. Who needs slides when they can play in an actual boat and pretend to drive? All of the staff was very professional, yet holding onto that lakeside demeanour. I would have loved to utilize the hottub that overlooks the dock but the weather was too dang hot. If you are looking for a Hilton type hotel room, then this isn't for you. These cabins are the epitome of lakeside living complete with bugs, some outdated decor, and a great place to roast some marshmellows and make s'mores. It's why you come to the lake to relax. I would recommend this place to anyone, and my family will be coming back for sure.

That happened with two of the twenty-one cabins our family reserved for our FAMILY REUNION this summer. We negotiated for over a year at GVR (via numerous emails and phone calls) to reserve a week when the \"whole resort\" or \"entire resort\" was available. .\u2026because of a \u201cdeposit discrepancy\u201d two families were ousted upon arrival. They found accommodations down the road (lucky there was availability during 4th of July!!). We were never informed of any \u201cmissing deposits\u201d. Our intention to book the \u201centire resort\u201d was clear to Chieko (owner) when we put a deposit down on an unreserved cabin, guaranteeing payment if a family was unable to attend. We also had problems with Rate discrepancies and were offered a boat rental discount for the day but only if it was rented for a week. All in all, the resort was laid out perfectly for a Family Reunion with a central area (pool, playground, horseshoes etc) surrounded by the cabins. Conducive to those with very young or older family members. A pavilion would be a great addition to accommodate for meal gatherings or rain. EXCLUSIVE?: Pool was great, although locals or friends of owners can use the pool/spa even if a FAMILY REUNION books the \"whole resort\" paying over $15,000 for the week.... hey, maybe they paid too? ACCOMMODATIONS: A few cabins are very updated, others were much older and in decent shape, but one had ceiling tiles falling in over the bed and the two-story 4 unit house was very slanted (no, it's not your sea legs). SERVICE: Ample supplies of towels and linens were available. Gerry, the handy man, was great to fix things that broke and worked at preventative maintenance also. Chieko, the owner, seems nice and has been in this business for many years so she knows exactly what the deal is. Shrewd transactions are recommended to avoid misinterpretation of terminology or language. The other clients, who were given our cabins at GVR during our reunion, told us that they come there every year during 4th of July week.

The lady that ran the place was absolutely sweet! She went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable. Once we got to the cabin we had noticed the grass was a little high, but assumed it would be taken care of during our stay--that didnt' happen. The cabin was a decent size, the bathroom didnt have a tub, so I had to bathe my toddle in the kitchen sink. The hot water heater was out and had to be worked--BUT \"Jerry\" was there within minutes to fix it. It was a propane heater, right above the sink, when the hot water was turned on, a very quick burst of blue flames would shoot out of the thing... weird. The only air conditioning was a window unit in the kitchen, which was fine except for at night- the bedrooms were pretty warm, we bought fans to keep us cool. The electricity wasn't working in the rooms, but again- \"Jerry\" was there to change a fuse. There weren't enough outlets to plug things into, we had to unplug to microwave to plug in the toaster, and when my kids wanted to watch a dvd (we brought our own player), we'd have to unplug the microwave (only 1 plug in the living area). The carpets left your feet black... We had to wear our sandals after we got out of the shower. The pool was nice and clean (when they say \"solar\" heated, they just mean warmed by the sun) which didn't see much sun, the pool is surrounded by trees, it was pretty chilly, but my kids enjoyed it. The playground need a lot of work. About 90% of the toys in the sand box, and around the playground were broken and had lots of sharp edges, several bull ants were seen as well... The laundry facility consisted of one washer and one dryer at $1.25 each. No real access to the lake unless you have or rent a boat. If it were'nt for the nice lady that made sure we were doing good- I would have given this place a really bad review. I did enjoy my self, the beds were very comfortable- being able to help myself to clean towels and bed linens are wonderful! Not too close to town, so it was quiet.
