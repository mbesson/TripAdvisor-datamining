Very close to the metro, easy to get to from airport. We had two doubles with private bathroom and balconies facing the street. The rooms are spacious, clean and very comfortable. Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00edn and his wife were very friendly and helpful when we had questions regarding internet access and directions. At the time we were there, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00edn hadn't gotten WiFi (they were getting it a week from dates we were there) so we had a dated computer, but were able to connect to internet most of the time. The only negatives are the thin walls - we could hear our kids next door, and there are no elevators - you'll have to carry luggage up four flights of stairs. Would recommend Benamar for the value, safe and clean rooms and location.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sweden", "Title": "\u201cGreat place and helpful owners\u201d", "Author": "TexasTimon", "ReviewID": "UR118246591", "Content": "Never met such friendly owner, helps out with nearly anything and you run into him all the time.

The location is close to the metro (Tribunal)--great for us as we took the metro from the airport (beware of pickpockets in the metro as you are a target with suitcases/backpacks. Have nothing of value in the backpack. The room was an interior on, facing the enclosed courtyard and on the fourth floor. It was immaculate clean, spacious and met our needs. A no-frills place to stay in a good, safe neighborhood , close to good cafes, places to eat and the downton center e.g., two metro stops to Sol. The owners, Jose and Mari, are very simpaticos and helpful. We didn't need their help as we got by with all the info we needed. We saw Mari more than we saw Jose. There is no elevator so you climb stairs (figure that in). When we ofered to pay the room charge the second day, Mari sort of shrugged it off \"today, tomorrow, whenever, you decide (in Spanish)\". We made the reservation by internet and had a confimration that same way. We believe the rooms are recenlty renovated and the price, the location made it a good choice an excellent value. Check to see if the rooms have AC if you visit in the hot season. We believe some do. Knowing Spanish helps as you are in their country. RE: the reservation, we asked for a room facing the street (didn't get it--didn't inquire why) and also about the availability of a hair dryer in the room. We were told one was \"disponible\" (available). We didn't have a hair dryer provided. No big deal as we bought an inexpensive one to use on another trip. There was however, in the room a flat-screen TV and a computer with good internet service (no printer). Helpful as we could search in Spanish for info we needed--from bus stations to restaurants locations!!

The owners are a couple. Both of them are super friendly and helpful. The location is excellent. It's between two metro stops \"Tribunal\" and \"Alonso Martinez\", and equally close to either one. \"Tribunal\" if the only stop in the entire metro system which gets you to all 3 major train stations (Atocha, Principe Pio, and Chamartin) with direct train. You also need to transfer only once to get to the airport. The hostel is located on the 2nd and 3rd fl. (which equals to the 3rd and 4th fl. in the U.S.). At our arrival we were so tired and of course frustrated to find that there's no elevator in the building. Jose found me upstairs alone with no luggage and understood our difficulty immediately without me speaking out anything. He ran downstairs right away and carried all the bags for us. The room is clean is spacious -much bigger than any hotel rooms we stayed in other cities in Spain. The bathroom is in the same good condition. The only shortage, if I have to come up with one, would be the thin walls. During our first-night stay, there were loud guests in other rooms. However the second and the third night were perfect. Overall this is an unbeatable value compared with what we paid for hotel rooms. We spent almost double for our hotel room in Barcelona for the same length of stay.", "Date": "December 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Valencia, Spain", "Title": "\u201cGreat value in a welcoming environment\u201d", "Author": "CFValencia", "ReviewID": "UR56850101", "Content": "Spent three weeks here and would definitely recommend it for the price.

Very close to Tribunal and Alonso Martinez metro stops, which makes any destination easy to get to (including the airport). While you get a very clean, newly renovated individual room, don't expect any toiletries or other amentities you might expect from a hotel. There is a TV and a very old computer running Windows 98 that has free internet access. Once you check in and get your key, it is hard to get in touch with Jose, the very friendly owner. If any problems occur, you are on your own. Also, make sure not to be noisy, as we almost got kicked out of the hostal one night for making too much noise.
