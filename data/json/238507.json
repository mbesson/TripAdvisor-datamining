Water taxis are much more expensive and not extremely faster. You can get a water bus that directly brings you to the airport (rate from lido: 15\u00e2\u201a\u00ac) or you can take the bus (rate 5\u00e2\u201a\u00ac) leaving and going to p.roma.

It sure beats dragging your luggage through the small streets and over the bridges in Venice! The hotel is located right on the main strip where all the restaurants and bars are located. Lido island is beautiful and peaceful. It is a nice alternative to overcrowded Venice. A quick 10 minute boat ride puts you in the heart of Venice. The room was clean and the bathroom was large compared to other places that we stayed. The best part of our stay was the hospitality. All the staff members were friendly and helpful. We had a luggage bag full of gifts (including wine and olive oil) that we could not take on the cruise with us. When we found out that the luggage storage at the train station would not hold the bag for a week while we were away, the hotel staff graciously told us that we could leave it in the front office and pick it up when we returned from our cruise.

The location of the hotel on the Lido di Venezia island offers the best of both worlds - a \"home\" away from the crowds of Venice, where you can enjoy the quiet and have a rest, but close enough to the main sights of Venice (by waterbus, which leave every 10-15 minutes and take about 20 mins. to reach St Mark's Square). Buy a 72 hour travelcard for 33 Euros for unlimited travel on the waterbuses around Venice and buses on Lido. This does not include the direct waterbus service to/from Marco Polo Airport, which costs 15 Euros one way (buy a ticket in the airport arrivals hall). The hotel itself is located on Lido's main shopping street, which is only one minute away from the waterbus terminal. The road, and in fact the whole area, is charming, and not busy with traffic at any time. It is not a large area however so do not expect a lot of nightlife. There are probably only about 15 restaurants in the area, mainly offering Italian cuisine, but there is also a Chinese and Indian restaurant (not tried). I had some very nice pizzas though. There is a supermarket almost opposite the hotel, which is handy for buying water and snacks. The beach is a 10-15 minutes walk away, at the end of the same street. The hotel has a traditional, old-fashioned feel to it, which made a pleasant change from identical chain hotels. Staying in a single room it was not of course very large, but more than adequate. It was nicely decorated, had ample storage, good lighting, a comfortable bed, and a modern bathroom with shower cubicle, everything working perfectly and kept impeccably clean. In fact, the maids deserve a special mention because I have rarely seen a room left so clean every day - never a crease in the bedding or a spot on the carpet, and supplies (shampoo, soap etc.) were replenished when needed and towels changed regularly. All staff in the hotel were very friendly and helpful - from the front desk, to the dining room staff and maids - and all spoke good English. The inclusive continental breakfast served daily offered a nice start to the day, with a range of cereals, rolls, croissants, meats, cheese, fresh fruit etc. Only one odd thing to be aware of: you pay extra to have boiled or scrambled eggs or even a yogurt. If you stay in any hotel in Venice remember to keep some spare cash for when you check out as there is a new city tax to pay. It varies according to location (Lido is cheaper than Venice)and star category of hotel. For this hotel it was 2.10 euros per day.

But I have decided to take that risk. We too had the misunderstanding about breakfast at check in. When we booked the hotel there were no reviews on trip advisor that mentioned this. We assumed that when it said \"All rates include Breakfast and VAT\" on our confirmation email, we would get breakfast. This was not true and naturally we argued our case, as it was clearly stated, only to be treated like we were cheap people trying to get freebies from them. I can say without a doubt I have never been spoken to in such a rude, patronising manor, the whole thing has upset me quite a bit. There was another couple, from America, checking in at the same time, who had exactly the same problem who also argued with the lady. When we asked if we were the first people to ever make this mistake in thinking breakfast was included in this rate she said we were. However, other reviews on trip advisor show me this is not true. We would have booked the room with or without breakfast as it was a very good price for the location but the way the misunderstanding was dealt with was unacceptable. I asked to speak to the manager and was told he was on holiday. I have now found out from email correspondance with them he was there all along and \"watched your theatrical scene from the reception, and did not intervene since he understood that you and your friends were creating the bad performance in front of other clients only to obtain the favours.\" So he is a manager who refuses to speak to guests with a complaint who are paying in stay in his hotel? After this episode we felt shunned by all the staff in the hotel, as if they wanted us out as soon as possible, and we felt very helpless about our rights.

The pre-paid breakfast doesn't even cover all of the food, you have to pay 2 euros to get a yougurt and 4 euros for scrambled egg.", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cProbably Wouldn't Return\u201d", "Author": "Europe_Bound_2010", "ReviewID": "UR116433537", "Content": "I'll start this review off by stating that I fully expect hotel management to disagree with any critiques that I have of this hotel and our stay that seem negative, given how other reviewers have been responded to. I would hope, however, that those reading this review consider my comments to be constructive criticism of the areas that could use improvement, and realize that I do list positive aspects of our stay as well and wish to provide a fair and balanced review of our experience with this hotel. First, what drew me to this hotel was the great price that I was able to secure by booking far in advance. At the time, the hotel seemed to have very positive reviews on TripAdvisor. Like other reviewers who started to comment on this hotel more recently, although my reservation was for room only I was under the impression that it came with a continental breakfast given the wording on the website at the time of booking. I thought by 'room only', it meant that I was getting the continental breakfast, and I chose not to purchase any additions such as the buffet breakfast, fruit baskets or flowers in the room upon arrival. Having read reviews after I booked and leading up to my arrival I fully expected to encounter problems at check-in, and was not surprised when I was given the script of how I booked room only and it was to cost extra for breakfast. I was then told a price for a continental meal, and although I can't remember what it was anymore, I remember it being exceptionally expensive for what is to be included in continental. We didn't have a positive first impression after check-in, made to feel like we were expecting too much for so little, yet we had the evidence printed out with us on our booking that breakfast was included in ALL bookings made through their website. We instead went to nearby cafes for a fraction of the cost, or headed to the grocery store across the street to pick up fresh fruit before heading into Venice for a day of sightseeing. It should be noted that food in the rooms is strictly prohibited, a first-time encounter for us in our travels around Italy. We arrived at our room, which was small. I fully expected this from the previous reviews, and since it was an economy I wasn't too surprised. This wasn't an issue for us since we spent very little time in our room anyways. If you have lots of luggage though, you may consider upgrading as it was difficult to even comfortably place two small suitcases and still maintain adequate walking room. We noticed immediately that the bathroom light was not working. We tried it a few times, left the switch on for a few minutes thinking if it was energy efficient perhaps it was just taking a little bit to get going. No such luck. We went to the front desk and given a look like we were just making this up, and told that we would have to wait two hours for it to be investigated. There is no window in the washroom, nor was it positioned in a way that we could get adequate light to enter from the window in the room. Two hours to change a lightbulb seemed unreasonable, considering guests typically like to freshen up when arriving after a long day of travel. When we went back to the room from reception we tried the switch off and on a few more times while getting settled in, and suddenly it decided to work. We informed the front desk who made us feel like we were a huge inconvenience. Light switches would be difficult to improperly use and are the same in Italy as in Canada, so clearly there was a problem with the bulb and not us (it was most likely loose upon our arrival and something shifted causing it to suddenly work). At this hotel you have to leave your key when you come and go, which we have encountered before. Typically not an issue but a few times we had to wait. One time, without yet stating our room number we were handed someone elses key. This had me concerned that someone could take advantage of this and would have access to our room while we were out. We never left valuables in our rooms because of this. The hotel has a sign that if you dont need fresh towels and in the interests of being environmentally friendly leave them on the towel rack. We did this, having only used them once, and they were replaced anyways - except for the day they were taken and not replaced! We regretfully had to go down to reception and request towels. At this point we were feeling very unwelcome (by the tone and expression used when addressing us) and were not given an apology, just a comment that they would inform housekeeping. Air conditioning had not yet been turned on, so we left the fan on and windows open so that we could return to a cool space. It was mid-May and already very hot out. On this day we had already returned once after housekeeping had been through, so there should have been no reason for someone to have entered our room at this point. The window was shut, including the shutter, and the fan was off when we entered. The room was hot and stuffy with no air cirulation, and took awhile to cool down. It's not my first time to Italy, and I have never encountered hotel staff coming in during the middle of the day to shut windows (on a sunny day with no forecast of rain, might I add) and to turn off fans when it is hot outside and no airconditioning is turned on. This hotel does have many advantages working in its favour. It's within close proximity to the Vaporetto stop, from which it is a short waterbus ride to Venice (about 15 minutes to St. Marks square). We purchased the three day pass in advance online and received a discount, so transport was very cheap. Having stayed in Venice near St. Marks on a previous visit, I wanted a quiet place away from all the tourist commotion to return to at night. Lido was perfect for this and I would definately return to Lido again. The rooms seemed clean, and as I commented on before the size of the room didn't matter to us and was expected. They have larger rooms on offer, so I appreciated the variety and the fact that they took budget travellers into consideration. Overall, however, I would likely look elsewhere if I were to return to Venice or Lido. If I encountered another amazing deal for this hotel and other's weren't available, perhaps I would return, but only if no other options were available in my pricerange. It's not the worst place I have stayed: it's clean and close to transport options. But that is the extent of it. The way we were treated by staff throughout our stay made us feel uncomfortable and unwelcome, and for this we would likely not return.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Wales, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat!\u201d", "Author": "WelshmamOF2", "ReviewID": "UR116312810", "Content": "Great location for staying on the Lido - couldn't fault it.

We had a room overlooking the back of the hotel and it was very quiet, we werent disturbed at all during our 3 night stay.

You also had to pay extra if you wanted scrambled eggs, which would be fair enough if you are having them cooked to order.

Oh yes it does, I say, presenting my print out of my booking where it states breakfast included. Oh no it doesnt I am told, surely you must realise at this price it doesnt include breakfast..

On the Saturday morning Spale organised for us to have our breakfast in the garden so we could all sit together, the weather was good so it was perfect. The breakfast was lovely you could have as much as you wanted - but there's only so much a person can eat! My friend Pauline who organised the trip couldn't have picked a better location for the water buses. It took 10 mins to St. Marcs Square - there are some really nice islands to visit. The hotel recommended places to eat nearby,which were all good. Don't hesitate to use this hotel.", "Date": "May 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cIdeally situated hotel - Ensure you get what you pay for.\u201d", "Author": "bevblako", "ReviewID": "UR109023858", "Content": "This is a nice hotel which enjoys a fantastic position only a minutes from the water bus stop in Lido Venezia. The hotel was very clean and the check-in process wasquick and easy. We paid for a superior room which the website states has a shower and bathtub and larger beds. The 1st room we were given had a bathroom (the size of a large cupboard) with only a shower. I went to reception to query the room we were provided and we were quickly moved to a larger room with a large bed and a bath and shower.The hotel website advertises a private beach. However, when I enquiried how to get there I was advised that it wasnt open yet !! There is no mention of it being closed on the website. Luckily there is a public beach which we were able to use. We arrived on a Monday and on the Tuesday we asked reception if we could leave our laptop in the safe. A notice in the hotel advised not to leave valuables in the room and to give to reception for safekeeping. The lady on reception gladly took the item and advised she would keep it safe. However, on the the next day when we asked them to look after it again we were advised by a different receptionist to leave it in our room as 'this was safer than behind the reception'. On Wednesday (the day before we were leaving) we requested our key from reception and was advised that they had removed our travel iron from our room WITHOUT PERMISSION as it was against Italian law to keep them in hotel bedrooms !!! They refused to return the iron until our check-out. There was no signs telling us irons are not allowed and the iron was in the same place on Tuesday when the room was cleaned and was not removed. It is of concern that staff are removing guests items from their rooms without permission.

The first time we arrived to check in the hotel, something weird with the system. The guy at the counter were asking us the passport. This was fine but the weird thing was, he asked to hold the passport and told us to return the passports in like 30 minutes later. Passport is something valuable and important and other party should not hold the passport . An hour later, we returned to the counter and demanded the passport and he returned it to us without any scenes. On the first night of our stayed in the hotel, we bought a pizza to be eating in the room but an old lady with biker's jacket sound us with a rude voice and action. she told us that we could not bring foods to the room. Seriously, we did not see any notices or hotel's rules for forbidden bringing the foods to the hotel until the next day a new notice was displayed at the counter saying about the forbidden of bringing foods to the room. With a toddler it was impossible for not bringing foods to the room.we were not cooking in the room just bringing pizza! The hotel said only small amount of water is allowed to the rooms! On 23rd april, we told the staff that we will check out very early in the tomorrow morning so we settle the bill by cash on the evening of 23rd april at the counter and the funny thing was, we only received the receipt in the next morning (24th april 2011) simply because only one person was allowed to write the bill! A day of our departure, 24th april 2011, we checked out at 6.55am and returned the key at the counter. Nobody was available to checked the room before we left since they lack of staffs to do so and it was the hotel fault for not having enough staffs. In the afternoon on the day of our departure, the hotel sent an email to my hubby saying that we damaged the sink in the room ( see, the simply made a false allegation and took advantaged from our early departure by saying nobody was checking the room when we left!) . They tried to find a reason by saying we were breaking the sink . It was totally false allegation. We left the room as the day we entered it. Sink is not something easily to break and the hotel asked euro 195 to be transferred to their account as a cost for replacing a new sink. We refused to pay them since we did not make any damaged to the hotel room. We only stayed in the hotels for having showers and sleeping. The rest of the day we went out for sightseeing. Plus, what is the heck of us to break their sink. The hotel kept emailing us about forcing us to pay the damage by suggesting and assuming that we have an insurance to cover the payment that we made, if we paid the price that they asked for repairing the sink. It is absolutely clear that the hotel is trying to force us of making a false claim to our credit card insurance. Today, on 2nd May 2011 we received an email from the hotel saying that they have already charged our credit card for the amount of Euro 195 and demanding our home address to send the bill so that we can claim from insurance with the bill. Nothing is good about this hotel except the location. The owner is rude, the rooms is small, the furniture is old and lousy. The system is outdated etc. And the worst is they are making money from charging the customer by charging our credit card for something damage that we have never done. If anybody knows where or any bureau to report about this hotel and the insurance fraud, please let us know.

Staying at this hotel has certainly made the trip much more pleasant. First of all, it is less than 5 minute walk to the hotel after coming out from the Lido waterbus stop. That's a big plus, after seeing how some of the people needed to drag their lugguage up and down numerous bridges when staying at the main island. Also, it is easy access to the beach which makes the children very happy. The hotel room is big and it is comfortable for four of us staying in the room. The bathroom is very modern. After seeing some of the toilets in Rome and Venice, going back to the bathroom in the hotel is even a nice and relaxing experience. The only thing I found a bit strange is the arrangement for the breakfast. I booked the family deal available on the hotel web site. When I went to breakfast on the first day, I was told that my booking did not allow us to have eggs and yogurt or I need to add extra 2 EURO. This is not what I expected and I couldn't remember seeing this on my booking. Given all the choices available, eggs and yogurt are literally the only two extra items excluded. We do feel that this makes it unnecessarily complicated. We would recommend the hotel to include the costs for all inclusive breakfast. Given the 1 or 2 EURO differences in the hotel bill, that's minimum. Yet, when we were told about paying for this 1 or 2 EURO at the breakfast, it just seems a bit awkward. Lastly, it is not just this hotel but other Italian hotels. They all expected the guests to leave the keys when we went out. We don't mind doing that. Yet, with young children, we at times need to go back to the hotel room many times before going sightseeing.
