Staff are friendly, hotel is clean and a pleasant environment, how ever the following has been questionable: - although rooms have TV channels stating what programs both Spanish and International are available \u2013 only Spanish programs are available. - some rooms showing signs of wear and tear with certain bits missing i.e. switches, baths/showers discoloured, curtains \u2013 some work some do not. - room service is limited in choice - breakfast looks impressive but no labels explaining what all the food is, hot plate not very appetising, milk warm, coffee questionable, if busy tables show signs of previous use and can be slow to clear tables - restaurant \u2013 very limited and expensive, not always attended - internet coverage is hit and miss In summary \u2013 this hotel although grand in initial appearance, seems to of had its day and is on a decline with regards to quality, lacks attention to detail and service.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels", "Title": "\u201cAverage but ok\u201d", "Author": "Alvarorrr", "ReviewID": "UR20891453", "Content": "There are three reasons why I regularly stay in this hotel when I'm in Madrid: (i) It is next to my parents place (but for visitors that want to visit the center is not very convinient): (ii) rooms are very large; (iii) it has a nice gymn/spa; (iv) during weekends it has reasonable prices (70-80 EUR).

This is by far the best one I have stayed in. It is a little far from the tourist centers (15 min taxi), but it is well worth it. The rooms are huge and luxurious. DON'T stay here if you like modern or minimalist, but otherwise, you will love the replica antique furniture in this brand new building. The staff is curteous and professional and the prices are excellent. Great food and a full health club used by locals as well. I'm not easily fooled by \"luxury\" hotels - read my reviews on the Wellington (not up to 5* standards) and the Palace (nice, but waaay overpriced).", "Date": "March 1, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Foxa M-30 Suites & Resort", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d228616-Reviews-Foxa_M_30_Suites_Resort-Madrid.html", "Price": "$63 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">C/ Serrano Galvache 14</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28033</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "228616", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/54/3a/543a9e37e627caf866d442ad0e50e5a88large.jpg"}}
