{"Reviews": [{"Content": "4 OUT OF 10 this is a very spectacular resort but the service and the good are not good at all!!! for example, they did not replenish the shampoo bottles that were tiny everyday and when you called for a cart to pick you up at 7 10 it arrived at 7 35 after 3 calls to ask where the cart actually is. most of the staff do not speak english at all which made it hard to communicate and receive the service or the thing that you needed. i wouldn't go back there again.", "Date": "Dec 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR252793143", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "h0telguide"}, {"Content": "awesome place!!! stayed here the week before Christmas with my wife. The property is spectacular. we stayed in one of the bungalows with our own little pool. The main pool and bar were great too. Terrific service from the hotel staff and the resturants are all very good. We thought the french resturant was the best. Make sure you play golf at punta esplada. Its the most beautiful course I have ever played..There is a senior PGA event sked for the spring of 2009. Also have lunch in the sushi resturant on the trump property which is on the bluff overlooking the Suanctuary. We had dinner one night Marrans in the marina well worth the short (2 mile) trip. The best part is the 3 mile beach next to the hotel, probably one of the nicest beachs in the world, with NO CROWDS!!!! Only drawback was the spa was not open yet. The mgr told me it would open in Apr 2009.", "Date": "Dec 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR699263774", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "BostonLmp"}, {"Content": "It\u9225\u6a9a amazing but BEWARE. I would\u9225\u6a9de given this place a 5 out of 5 and here is why I did not. I felt like a test guest, testing out this amazingly gorgeous hotel and all it\u9225\u6a9a amenities for the other guests that will soon arrive. They never did. The hotel was empty, which was amazing considering it was my honeymoon, but due to the lack of people, there was lack of food and activities. I felt like a kid that paid full price to get into an amusement park and half the roller coasters were not running. It is WAY overpriced and to go off the resort for the day will cost you about one nights stay. I would call and ask about what is open before you book. If everything were open it would\u9225\u6a9de been the best hotel I have ever been to.

I've been to many upscale hotels and resorts such as St. Regis, Las Ventanas, Paraiso de la Bonita and Las Ventanas but this was my favorite. First, the service was genuine and perfect. Everyone was so eager to please! The grounds, pools, beaches were also perfect. Everything was just postcard material. They only had 4 of their restaurants open and we tried 3 of them. Each was great and I am looking forward to returning to try all the others when they open too. Highly recommend this resort to all who appreciate attention to detail and dont mind spending a little extra.", "Date": "May 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR412018352", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "dtown22"}, {"Content": "The Santuary is a santuary We just spent a week at The Santuary Cap Cana. It was clearly the best vacation experience I've ever had. The grounds are stunning, our oceanfront suite was lovely and comfortable, and the service was amazing. The hotel outlines a beautiful pristine soft powder beach but you had to go into the water several feet before the sand was really comfortable to walk on. However, The Santuary provides a free shuttle to the Cap Cana Beach Club which is another fabulous experience in itself. It is a private oasis where the beach conditions are perfect in every sense of the word. We hopped the shuttle and went there every single day. And it really is no trouble considering the shuttle is at your doorstep in a matter of minutes. You also get to see what Cap Cana is all about which is basically a breathtaking landscape for the rich and famous. IT IS NOT AN ALL-INCLUSIVE which some people have failed to comprehend prior to their stay and it is expensive. We had a driver to take us to a local store where we purchased soda, water, snacks, and a bar set-up and I was really glad we did. Cocktails are $15 and I drank about 100 of them that week! I can honestly say the $2400 we spent on meals and tips were absolutely, positively worth every penny. We experienced privacy and tranquility and beauty and service like never before. Write me if you have any other questions. I could go on forever.", "Date": "May 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR957739398", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "suddenlysingle"}, {"Content": "Dont bother to go here unless you love being ripped off!! Lets start at the beginning. They are not completed with construction so plan on hearing noise. They dont have a website so you cannot book online. I have travelled all over the world to many 5 star resorts and this will never get one star. The place has gone bankrupt three times. The spa is built but they have no money to furnish it or install the elvators. The beach on the property at the hotel is a rock beach with beautiful sand beaches all over the island but not here. They do have a beach but you cannot walk from you rroom to it. The room air conditioning does not work. There are 183 rooms built but they can only occupy 40 or so since they cannot finish the others. The restaurants (they claim they wil have 8 when finished but only 3 are built). And these are a joke. You are in the Dominican Republic and they build a French restaurant? We were the only customers in both restaurants and they had a wait staff of 15 at each restaurant looking for something to do. And if you want lunch or breakfast plan on spending over $150 dollars per person.. My 6 friends ordered three paella dinners and they charged fthem for 6!!! Said it was their policy. If you want to go water skiing (free anywhere else) they want to charge you $50 dollars. The place is built to look like a spanish castle and they ran out of money so the landscaping is all dead. There are no black out curtains on the windows (did these guys ever even go to a hotel before they built this place) so at 7 am the light blasts you out of bed. They built retail stores but cannot lease them. So they sit vacant . You cannot even buy suntan lotion here!! My recommendation is to pass on the Sanctuary until the next owner takes it in foreclosure and makes the changes required to run a decent hotel.", "Date": "May 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR945453049", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "golftravelmaniac"}, {"Content": "The Top of the Line The property is magnificent. It is not yet completed but will be in another month or two. Only 70 of the 170 rooms are done and 4 of the 8 restaurants are open. The spa and casino are scheduled to open in the next couple of months. The staff is tripping over itself to be helpful. They need to learn some restraint. But everyone is really wanting the guests to be satisfied.There are still some new hotel creases to be ironed but it will be the best in the Dominican Republic when it is done. The property is fashioned after a Venetian village. It is just too pretty to describe. The rooms are large and well furnished with all the amenities of a 5 star hotel, including free internet through an ethernet system which is very fast. The restaurants are varied enough even with 4 of the 8 open. Each offers something different but all are serving top quality products prepared perfectly. Staying at The Sanctuary you are able to use the other facilities of Cap Cana. Did breakfast at the Punta Espada Golf Club, there is a spa at the Playa Caleton Beach Club, Lunch is available at the Trump Restaurant at the Farrallon property and the Marina has 4 restaurants which are excellent. Did dinner at Mitre, also wonderful. There is a new beach club just opening next door to the hotel which has a much better beach than in front of the main part . Would recommend that instead of doing the regular beach. Pools are very good and essentially with no one around it felt like your own resort. This will become the premier property in the DR as soon as it is completed. But it is pricey so expect the best to cost.", "Date": "Mar 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR859618488", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "drbcabarete"}, {"Content": "Absolutely stunning new property in Punta Cana area       Picture of me on #13 at Punta Espada", "Date": "Mar 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR849940773", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ArizonaBenny"}, {"Content": "Magnifique et luxueux   showReview(22703014, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR693809798", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "benverlaine"}, {"Content": "the best of the world       The swiminpool", "Date": "Aug 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR276162143", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lolita070"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g147293-d1022212-r23143959-Sanctuary_Cap_Cana_Golf_Spa-Punta_Cana_Dominican_Republic.html", "HotelID": "1022212", "Price": "$666"}}
