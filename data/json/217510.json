Many of the features I enjoyed like the lower price (just about $100/night), the free wireless, the professional service, and the beloved water bottles, are at this location. However, I wasn't thrilled with the room. My biggest issue was how stiflingly stuffy it was. I almost thought we had a smoking room by accident (*disclaimer*: we didn't follow up on this, as we didn't see any ashtrays and frankly we were too tired once we arrived to deal with it) but it actually seemed like general mustiness, possibly from the heater. The worse part was that the window wouldn't open even an inch so there was no way to get some fresh air in. Bummer. I couldn't wait to get out each day. Good inspiration to see the city, I suppose. The room itself seemed large and clean though I think it was getting a little worn out. The bed was pretty hard and we could tell it was two twins pushed together. There wasn't a view, just an ally, but the location in the heart of the city more than made up for that. That's why I would still probably recommend this hotel, as we could walk to the L, Millennium Park, the Art Institute, and tons of restaurants within minutes. The river and Magnificent Mile weren't too much of a walk either. At the price we paid, it nearly made up for everything. Maybe if they threw in a free breakfast we'd be even? (Do note that there are two Club Quarters in the city. This is the Central Loop location. We didn't realize this until our friends ended up at the other one wondering why we weren't meeting them in the lobby.)", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Holland, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cExcellent staff\u201d", "Author": "Heather H", "ReviewID": "UR126398082", "Content": "Because of an unexpected family emergency, we were unable to actually stay the night.

I was a little worried before arriving because I booked the smallest room they have, one of those tiny economy rooms. But it and the hotel had nearly everything I needed. A couple minor deficiencies are at the end of this review. Everything in this hotel seemed really new and very up to date. The business center had free computer use. The rooms had free, fast wireless. The fitness center was actually pretty spacious and had four treadmills, some ellipticals and two stationary bikes, plus a few benches, some free weights, weight machines and nice mats for stretching. Everyone at the front desk was extremely nice, helpful and professional. I really felt like I got top-notch treatment. The room itself, while small, had plenty of room to walk around. It had a nice big TV, a small closet, a couple of drawers, a comfy chair and a full-sized desk. It also had a really small closet -- but it was plenty for one person for two nights. In the bathroom, there was no tub, just a shower stall, but it was relatively spacious and had a hand-held shower nozzle. Everything was clean, clean, clean. My only complaints, and they're very small ones, were that the bath towel I had was very rough. Not even a little bit soft. There is coffee in the room but NO BREAKFAST. Not even a danish. I room service for dinner -- a salad -- from the in-house restaurant. It was delicious, but beware that they add a 15 percent gratuity to the bill automatically, no matter how little you order. And it stops serving at 10 p.m., which is a little early for me.

We actually used the travelocity secret hotel deals and got a great rate on this hotel... making it very worthwhile. We booked a room with two beds (NOTE: two twin beds) and it was myself and my boyfriend, along with another couple. Needless to say things were tight, but we were not in town to enjoy the hotel room. The room was on the smaller side, but if we could pull off having 4 of us and all of our luggage, I would hardly say that size was a major issue. This is especially true if you are travelling with 2 people to a room. Essentially the room was just a base camp, as we went shopping soon after we arrived and went out Saturday night, took the L back to sleep and woke up early to shower and prepare for the game, then checked out and headed to brunch/tailgate. If you are planning on spending a significant amount of time in your room, or are travelling with a group... this hotel may not be the best option. Check in was a breeze and everyone was very nice, from the valet to the desk attendants. We got a room right away and found it to be clean - having a mini fridge in the room was a nice touch and the bathroom was very clean as well. The hotel itself was quiet and the bottled water on each floor was a nice addition as well, especially Sunday morning after a late night out in Wrigleyville. The location of this hotel was convenient to many areas (Millennium Park, shopping, dining) of the city as well as for catching the red line, location is definitely a strong point. There was a spot to hold luggage after check-out, and it was very secure (someone at the door of the room at all times). Overall, it was a good experience and I would come back again if heading to Chicago under similar circumstances. Staff was friendly (even engaged in some good-hearted heckling when we came down in Packer gear) and although the rooms were small-ish, the price and location couldn't be beat!

The rooms are VERY SMALL, if we had more than 1 bag we would've had to climb on the bed to get across the room.

The mattress was very hard and not at all the comfortable when I sat on the bed (because there is no other place to sit) I could feel the \"rim\" of the mattress poking my legs and it was sooo hard.

When the trucks are lifting and banging dumpsters you will be woken unless you have amazing ear plugs, or are deaf. The best night there, I was only woken up twice by the trash trucks. I can understand needing to not come into the middle of the city for dumpsters at rush hour, but do they really need to empty, pick up, drop off, re-position, and bang dumpsters at 3:00am?

I was pleasantly greeted when I entered the lobby. Check-in was fast and easy. Each time I dealt with the desk staff, they were friendly, helpful and very pleasant. There is a space referred to as the living room off the lobby, which has plenty of space to sit and talk, work or watch TV. It really was like having a living room in the lobby. I was told there were two business areas, although I used neither. Free Wi-fi (yes, free at an upscale hotel) is available throughout the building. I used it in my room and it was a strongsignal with good data speed. My room had a single queen bed, a desk, two bedside tables and a side chair. The bathroom had a shower and not a tub, which was fine with me. The room itself is smaller because it has just one bed, but there is plenty of room to move around or even have a couple of guests. The style is contemporary and has a warm feel, and it felt good to return to the room after a long day. Free, chilled and filtered water is available on each floor with plastic bottles to fill and take on the go. I really appreciated that effort.

This became a particular problem for our elderly friend with rheumatoid arthritis, who needed a bathtub to soak in each morning.

The location was ideal, within walking distance from the majority of the downtown attractions, including the Willis Tower SkyDeck, Millennium Park, the Art Institute and Buckingham Fountain. (Which is good, because we found the the subway line wasn't very helpful for tourist destinations.) The room itself, while quite small, was tastefully decorated, immaculately clean and very comfortable. I only noticed noise from other rooms on one night, the rest of the time you could hear a pin drop. We were on the 10th floor, so city noise was minimal and the elevators were insanely fast and you never had to wait long to get one. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. I liked the fact that there was a lot of serve-yourself conveniences, though I could see others viewing that as a detraction. For instance, you check in/out using an electronic kiosk, if you want an extra blanket or ironing board, you find a guest closet in the hallway and help yourself. They offered a gym, a \"living room\" to hang out in, and free bottled water on every floor at the elevators. The pub connected next door had very tasty and reasonably priced food. And if you need to park a car, we did the self park for $20/day (roughly $15 cheaper than just choosing a garage), which was a short 5 minute walk away, though they do offer valet if you so desire. The only negative I can come up with is the thermostat...it was impossible to figure out how to get the heat on, and the room was too chilly the whole time.

A quick summary: this is a clean, comfortable hotel that offers pretty good value if you need to be in the Loop area and Financial district, and is an easy walk to the train and Amtrak station. Still, I'd check for other good rates for area hotels. Room 802 is meant for a single. The smallish room is spacious enough for one, with a comfortable double bed. It looks out the back -- not a great view, but quiet and away from any street noise. There is good-size desk/work surface, easy-to-use flat screen TV, good sized closet, coffee/tea maker. Very good housekeeping and spotless, well-functioning bathroom with real glasses, nice toiletries provided and good bathtowels. This room has only a shower, no bathtub, but I chalked it off to the \"good value\" principle. The shower was a little under-pressured, but the wireless worked fine.. The irons and boards are across the hall in a communal closet. There is free bottled water for the taking. There is an Elephant & Castle pub-restaurant on site for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The bar has a lively (not raucous) scene in the evening. There is a good business center for free printing, including from your room. The area has a number of restaurants and shops, and is very close to some pricier hotels, e.g. a JW Marriott and a W Hotel. You are in the midst of the finanacial district, and the shops of State Street, the Art Institute of Chicago, the DePaul downtown campus, theaters, etc. are a short walk away. Still, there were some issues. There was no room safe. The heat in the room was a little warm, and I could not figure out how to work the room control well. The rooms are arranged off the hall such that two doors are very close together -- I could easily hear when the person next door was going and coming, although the rooms themselves are quiet enough that I never heard him/her when actually in the room. However, it was useful that these seemed to be a hall full of single rooms, i.e. no screaming children or couples carrying on loudly. The staff ar friendly, but there is room for improvement. I arrived early, and always understand if a room is not ready. I stashed my bag to get on with my day. However, neither at this time nor when I returned later in the day did anyone explain any of the amentities or services to me -- not the wine/snacks in the evening, not the coffee/tea available 24/7 in the lounges, not the business center amenities, not the Elephant & Castle availablility, etc. They checked me in and out, and no more. The info card in the room was useful. I looked into the lounge to see if the coffee there was any better than the typical room coffee. No, it was not, but the room was nice enough. 'Wish I could have had time to try the wine service at cocktail hour. There is the nickle-and-dime issue of a $35 early check-in fee. I just stashed my bag. I understand why \"good value\" hotels charge this fee that would be unforgiveable in more expensive hotels if rooms were available, but it's annoying. They also have a sliding late check-out fee. I tried the Club Quarters because colleagues at last year's conference stayed here and reported good value. It's pretty good for the area, but this year those colleagues got a great rate ($88 before taxes) at the Hyatt not too far away using Hotwire. When I did some research on Tavelocity and other hotel sites, the Club Quarters gave the best rate (others like the Hyatt, the Palmer House, and Kimpton hotels were $200 and over.) Next time, Hotwire may get my business, especially if I have no time to take advantage of the afternoon amenities. So: all-in-all, good value compared to the usual, but it encourages me to try Hotwire for next year's conference.

The room was smallish, but we were there to explore Chicago and attend several wedding functions.The decor and service was Excellent!! There wasnt a pool but we ate bangers and mash at the hotel restaurant--food excellent. Service was a little slow. Potbelly was also a stop we made before heading to Sky Deck.

Since I didn't have a laptop with me for the first day or two, I made use of their business centre which had great workstations. The room I had was quite small for American standards, but I found it perfectly adequate for my needs (I declined the upgrade to a suite for $25/day). The bathroom is also on the smaller side, partly because there's a shower - no tub - which is also something I prefer (although my colleagues were grumbling about this). Free wifi and a nice small LCD TV was good (although I would have preferred HDTV). A welcome voicemail from the manager is a nice touch. I wasn't too impressed by the fact that you had to use your keycard to use the elevator - was an annoyance I could have done without. The one other thing that didn't bother me while I was staying there was the fact that the rooms could do with a bit more humidity (was pretty dry in there). The location is unbeatable (just a couple blocks away from the Sears tower), and the price is definitely on the lower side. It was convenient for me to have breakfast and the occasional room service from the Elephant & Castle right next door (which is also connected internally from the hotel) so I didn't quite miss the fact that there was no in-house restaurant.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very good value in a fantastic location, but there are also a few things you should know about. First, the Pro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Great value, considering the rates in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Loop\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd area of Chicago. I paid $99/night. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The location is perfect for exploring downtown. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right between the Art Institute and the Willis (formerly Sears) Tower. There are multiple restaurants and services within easy walking distance. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Free bottled water. The hotel really seems to take the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153green\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd theme seriously. There are empty water bottles on each floor with purified water dispensers for you to use as much as you want. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The furnishings are relatively new and nice. Not overly luxurious though. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re somewhere between a Best Western and a Westin. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 There are free computer workstations to use for printing out boarding passes (see note in Cons though) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The hotel itself is very secure. Key cards are needed to operate the elevators as well as enter your room. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The attached Elephant & Castle Pub. Very good food. Not a huge menu, but what there is is very good. Plus you get your room service from there. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Free large chess sets in the lobby and lounge. Cons: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 No safe in the room. This was a biggie for me as I had camera equipment I would have put in there. I asked the front desk about whether they had safe deposit boxes for use. They said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yeah, we can, umm, rent them or let you use them\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Not overly confident. When I pushed further, they said they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean rent, they meant just use. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use them though as their answer didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t inspire confidence. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Free wireless\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is exceptionally slow. I was there for 5 days (4 nights). Some days it was just okay and others it was virtually unusable. Note: The front desk was once again no help in troubleshooting any issues either: The in room instruction card tells you what network to join, but what it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell you is that you need to open your browser (Safari, etc) and accept their terms and conditions every 24 hours to have access. It will look like you have a strong signal, but you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to access it until you do that step. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The free computers to print boarding passes can also be excruciatingly slow. We tried for over an hour to print 3 boarding passes. We got 2 printed then finally gave up. Each web page was taking 2 minutes or more to load, then often failed and we had to restart at the beginning. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if this was temporary or what, because the wireless that night was also super slow. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 There is only one ice machine in the hotel. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to go to the 3rd floor to use it. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The lowest category rooms (standard rooms) are VERY small. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m talking cruise ship small. The bathroom was so small that when I sat on the toilet my knees were under the sink. No, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not kidding or exaggerating. My friends had both the next room category up, plus one had a suite. They were larger and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d definitely recommend going for the higher categories (although the suite really isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a suite as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all one room) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 No refrigerator in the lowest category rooms. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 No fan in the bathrooms \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 No movie channels of ANY kind (HBO, Showtime, PPV (of any kind)) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Valet parking only, and the valet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know any restaurants in the area, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask them. So the bottom line is whether I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d stay there again. The answer is yes, but only in one of the higher category rooms and only if there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a hotel in that general neighborhood that had safes in rooms with a similar price.

There is no room service, but they do provide a service where you can order from restaurants nearby and they deliver up to your room for the typical room service fee.

First, we asked for an iron (because there is no steamer if you want wrinkle-free clothes), and it took over a half hour to get one delivered. Second, there is no fridge, so if you purchase food from a restaurant downtown there is no place to store your food, nor a microwave in case you get hungry later on that evening. Not only that, there isn't even a vending area which commonly house the commercial microwaves like you'd see in an office lunch room. There's nothing! This is very inconvenient, especially if you plan on staying more than one night. Third, parking sucks!!! They validate your parking but there are no in and out privileges, so you're basically paying twenty bucks whenever you leave the garage. We plan on going back to Chicago next month, but will most likely opt for a different hotel further away from downtown. We figure we might spend more on the room, but we won't have to pay for parking and we might even have access to some basic amenities.

We are not picky people but we could not ignore the fact it felt like we were sleeping on paper :) Another point, make sure to ask for extra towels... our room was stocked for 1 person. 1 towel and 1 washcloth. Also there was no iron which wasn't a huge deal, my husband steamed his shirt with the shower on. The other complaint would be the attached reastaurant (Elaphant and Castle). Every waitress was rude (both times we went there) and were really impatient. We went the first time for dinner and it was so loud we couldn't hear each other so we got up and left. The second time was for breakfast. I tried to alter my meal bc of food allergies and the waitress was so annoyed with me I thought she was going to hit me in the face.

It was my first stay but I anticipate staying here again in the future. My company has a corporate agreement with Club Quarters so I don't have much of a choice on where I stay while in Chicago on business. The only \"dings\" I can really give this place are regarding the front desk and the beds/pillows. On several occasions during my stay the front desk staff was more interested in discussing their personal lives than helping customers. I expected the standard issue hard bed and that's what I got. What I was not expecting was the condition of the pillows. When I went to lay down, the interior contents of the pillow moved to either side of my head and my head was literally laying on the bed. So what's the point of even having pillows? By piling both of them on top of each other and kind of rolling that into a ball, I was finally able to get a marginally acceptable pillow. As others have mentioned, this hotel is not going to put you in the middle of the action of downtown. If you don't mind some walking in order to get to Michigan Avenue, Millennium Park, etc. then you'll be just fine. Because it's more in the business area of town, it can be a bit deserted on the weekends and after about 8-9PM on weeknights. But I walked around by myself on numerous occasions during these times and felt perfectly safe. As for the room size, I had a room with one queen bed. It is small by US standards but if you're in downtown Chicago, you shouldn't be in your room other than to sleep and shower anyway! This hotel caters to business travelers so if you're looking for a spacious and/or luxurious room then should look elsewhere.

Excitement led to disappointment after stepping foot into my room. The room is best described as a broom closet with a small (1' by 3') frosted window. No real light got in which made the room seem even smaller and more closet-like. The bed was queen sized, as expected, but once we got in the bed we realized it was lumpy and slanted. The duvet was also so disgusting it actually stuck to my hand when I moved it. The floors were of the same sticky consistency, I had to wear flip flops when I walked around. Ick! The bathroom was acceptable. The TV was, at most, a 20\" screen that was difficult to view from the bed because it was so small. Things that I think should be in the room upon check in like extra pillows (there were only 2 in the room) and an iron/ironing board (this IS a \"business\" hotel) were stored in a \"guest request closet\" on each floor. Luckily there was an extra blanket and pillow as well as an iron, but no board, when I checked the closet. If someone went after me they probably didn't get what they were looking for. This hotel has a pretty good location. Right in the middle of the loop, you are close to most things you would want/need to do for business or leisure. The availability of restaurants/bars (except the hotels, of course) around the area after 9pm isn't too great because it is a very business oriented area. There are some great restaurants over on Michigan Ave, about 5 or 6 blocks away. For more ethic restaurants you will probably need to take public transport, of which there is plenty near the hotel. The blue/red/brown/orange lines are within 2 blocks and there are buses all around. The parking is $20/night self park validated by the hotel or $38/night valet. We self parked, the garage is well patrolled and we didn't have any problems. The price is decent for the area too. The common areas are nice and the fact that they have free in room printing was helpful, even though their printer (used for the entire hotel) was out of toner after 1 page printed. They also have free bottled water, you bottle it yourself in a common area. This place could be much better. The rooms are too small and too bare.

Stayed 5 nights with a rate that I got on Orbitz (cheaper than calling the hotel, where you will reach a person in New York during regular hours); this hotel has corporate accounts, but I wasn't part of any company--just a tourist. Check-in took maybe 90 seconds--unbelievably easy, and automatic. I asked for a room as far away as possible from the smoking floor, and that request was accommodated. Yes, their rooms are small, but still larger than most rooms in European hotels! Nice desk with cables for your computer. The room was very clean and bed linens were crisp. The lighting could have been brighter, but, as usual, hotel lighting never seems to be bright enough in any hotel room, for my tastes. The lighting in the bathroom was great, though. No bathtub, just shower (fine with me), hairdryer. There is cold filtered water at the elevator end of the halls, where you can fill your water jug (they have the containers there). If you don't want to bring your computer--they have several in their spacious business center (open all the time), and you can even print out things following their instructions on how to do that. The fitness room was nice, with 2 TV screens in it so you can watch TV while on the treadmill or whatever equipment. I used it daily, and there might have been 1-2 other people in it at the same time. They had a stationary bike, elliptical trainer, 3 treadmills, a couple of weight benches, free weights, and one of those multi-purpose weight machines. I only ate once in the restaurant next door (Elephant something). They open at 6:30 AM; I thought breakfast prices were a little steep, but service was very good. When I walked by there in the evenings, there were always people in there. You can get breakfast for less in a couple of places within a block. Within a 2-block radius, there were 4 Starbucks that I counted and 2 McDonald's. There is a 7-11 across the street where you can get fruit. The front desk staff was SUPERB. Very personable, professionally dressed, and people who know what customer service is. I was going to be out when I needed to print a boarding pass, and I left my info with them, and it was done exactly as requested. They will also sign you up for various tours, which is a good idea (prices are same as if you had done it yourself), as various times for the popular tours sell out, and you are basically guaranteed a space. (Plus, you just charge it to your room, and you have a neat accounting of your trip.) The hotel appears quite secure--the elevator does not move until you insert your room card into a slot in the elevator and then you can press your floor number. Upon arrival, I took the CTA Orange Line train from Midway Arpt down to Quincy Stn (about 1 block from the hotel). That would not have been a problem except for one thing: There are no elevators for the most part at the old stations in the loop (the rectangular run of trains downtown). So I had to haul the large suitcase down more than 40 stairs on 3 flights of stairs (not an easy feat for someone with a purse and tote bag, too). If you want to take the train in ($2.25 vs. $22 airport shuttle), then get off at the Library station on the Orange Line, where there IS an elevator. (This will be a little longer walk, maybe 3 blocks.) Get your maps and other \"tourist\" brochures at the airport right in the same area where you get your baggage. You must purchase a fare card to get on the train. The fare card machines do not give change. The Sears Tower is 2 blocks away, Millenium Park is 6 blocks and Grant Park a little less. To save money, print out the \"free attractions\" in Chicago from one of the websites (can't remember which one). You can get the trolley at the Sears Tower location--go on the \"Signature Tour\" and hop on/off wherever you want. There are actually 3 tours on your ticket, so allow an entire day for it. You can walk to the Institute of Art (a must-see) from the hotel easily, and it is free from 5-9 PM on Thursdays. (You can take photos of the permanent collection but not of any exhibitions.) By taking this trolley tour, you can see where you would like to spend more time. Take the Architecture Cruise Tour (90 min., $36 adult, $31 senior). As for dining, there are lots of places (including the usual McDonald's, Subway, Dunkin Donuts, and many more) within a block of the hotel. For evening dinner, consider the Italian Village (1 1/2 blks northeast of the hotel, on Monroe), the oldest Italian restaurant in Chicago. The decor is very nice, and there are 3 levels of dining. Prices run $13+ for an entree on the main level, and the bread is delicious, too, and superb service. My friend and I split a salad and an entree, and the restaurant was happy to do that for us. Another place with wonderful food is Riva Cafe on the Navy Pier. Eat upstairs if noise bothers you (which I did); the view is much better, and you can listen to jazz music (not live, at least on Thurs night). Service there was superb. The mussels in the garlic sauce were perfect. There is a beautiful stained glass gallery collection in the long building where the Riva Cafe is, that is free. I also had afternoon tea at the Russian Tearoom, which is about 4 blocks east of the hotel on Adams, at the corner of Michigan and Adams. Very nice decor, and superb service, too. Nice selection of teas. The 3-course tea (savories, scones, and sweets) is average in taste. Their house blend of tea was delicious, though (berry flavored), and the little guy would refill your cup the moment you took a sip. This hotel is wonderfully located, and I walked everywhere, including to the Navy Pier, which is 2 miles away. Check to see what is playing at the Bank of America theater, which is 1 1/2 blocks from the hotel. I saw \"Jersey Boys,\" and that was excellent. I was able to get a half-price ticket the day of the performance (paid $30), and said in the next balcony up from the main level. (Restooms are on the basement level, though!) Shopping is 4 blocks away up and down State Street and then onto the Marvelous Mile along Michigan Avenue. Stores on State, I noticed, were staying open until 8 PM. Finally, don't leave Chicago without taking the Green Line train (\"L\") to Oak Park, and touring the Frank Lloyd Wright home and studio and taking the self-guided walking tour (which is available in several languages) around the home. Beautiful victorian and Prairie style houses. The ride from the Loop is about 45 min. The food at Winberie's is very good, as is the service. It is across the street from Scoville Park, where there was a free music concert with a great band. (You would have to check schedules for the entertainment.) One last thing--there is absolutely no need to rent a car in Chicago. Besides, parking rates ran $16 for 20 min., and more than $30 a day at the garages. The parking for CQ is 2 1/2 blocks away! (I did not have a rental car.) The Chicago public transportation system is great. You can go online to www.transitchicago.com to get directions on taking the train/bus to anywhere. But as I said, I walked everywhere (and I am a senior citizen), between 4-6 miles a day. All in all, a wonderful hotel stay made more so by a friendly and customer-service oriented front desk staff, and a location quite ideal for tourists who want to be able to save money by walking to various Chicago sites.", "Date": "July 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and good price\u201d", "Author": "JoW2009", "ReviewID": "UR33717570", "Content": "Room was dark but comfy.

We were hoping to get in and out fast so that we could get to the Field Museum...No such luck..

You can book through either one, check in at the same desk, sleep in the same rooms ect.

Different phone numbers, different rates, but the same address. It took me a long time to piece this together. I booked a regular room online and asked for an upgrade when we got there. Nothing was available that night, but somehow she put us in a room with a king bed, fridge and microwave. (only queen beds were listed) So that was a pleasant surprise. Yes, the room was very small. But that didn't bother us. The TV was smaller and older and yes, across the room on the desk. But that also didn't matter.

The rooms aren't that big, but they arent too small either. You need to keep in mind that this hotel is intended to have its rooms used by single business travelers. There were only 2 pillows on the bed, and when I called for 2 more - THEY NEVER CAME! it was crazy! No call to tell me that we wouldnt be getting them, we sat there, and waited to go to bed, and eventually just had to deal with it. READ THIS: Then, the next day, as I was checking out, the valet brought my car up (after 20 minutes). I will admit that it is my fault for not thinking ahead, but I had no cash, and I completely forgot that I needed to tip him. He gets out of my car, and when I grab my keys from him, he says \"oh, nothing for me?\" I was seriously embarrassed and felt bad that I had no tip. I apologized profusely and told him that I had no cash on me. He says \"really? nothing for me?\" I'm still upset and apologizing. Not so much when he then says \"oh, so my kids have to go hungry tonite?\" Seriously? Is that really appropriate? I just paid $40 to have my car parked overnight - I don't think they need to hound me for a couple of bucks. I will never stay there again.

Despite my 60 years, walking to the Sears Tower, the Ogilvie Transportation Center, State Street, the El, the subways, Grant Park, and the Art Institute wasn't unreasonable. It's also pretty handy to the freeways. Parking is in a self-park garage two blocks away, though the cost is about half of what overnight parking is at other Loop hotels.

Renovations on our new floor had not been completed as planned: the ceilings in the hallways had no tiles--wires were hanging down, and pipes were exposed. Plastic sheeting hung in front of areas where construction was ongoing. The hallways had no paint or wallpaper--electrical sockets had no faceplates.

The hotel manager was upset by my complaints (I doubt if I was the only one to complain) and after some wrangling offered to move us to a Club Quarters about a mile away. We accepted the offer. I do not know whether the same offer was made to everyone affected. The hotel should never have expected guests to pay for such sub-standard accomodation.

This hotel was the worst hotel I've ever stayed at. 1- The hotel staff is EXTREMELY rude. I am a very laid-back low key person and I could not believe the rudeness with their personal conversation, gum chewing, and overall lack of personal care to me as I checked in, checked out or ask the staff questions on directions. I was hoping they would at least fake a smile or make eye contact. I would get better service from a comatose monkey. 2- Valet parking is a joke -- the valet was not at the front as I circled 4 times and called from the car to the front desk asking \"do you have valet\"? Finally he came out and than he stated to me \"its $36 per night - you should save your money\" WTF!!!!!!!! 3- Rooms were extremely small with a bed that was a little bigger than a twin bed. I'm thinking that's fine because I'm only paying $169 per night. The WORST -- they had put a feather bed on top of the bed to make it \"nice\" and all the feathers were pokeing through pricking my skin all night. I thought I was being bitten by bugs at first--- turns out it was the feather from the feather bed. No extra sheets nothing to put on top of that. I would never ever stay at this place.

I went with 2 other people who shared a room and I had my own room. The room for two people had two TWIN beds. I couldn't believe my eyes! I have never seen twin beds in a hotel in my life. These were two grown men and they said they felt like they were in summer camp or having a slumber party. My first room also had two beds, but the front desk was very accomodating and let me switch right away to a room with one FULL size bed (also extremely strange to me). However, when i went down to get my room key, the front desk clerk jokingly suggested that I might be a problem guest and told me not to come back down to get a room with a view. And yes, I had absoloutely no view except of an alley and another building in my 1/4 size window. However I was happy enough to not have to sleep in a twin bed. The rooms were nicely and contemporarily decorated, but the overall hotel layout was still odd (like having to enter rooms on an angle, really small hallways, weird windows, tiny terrible tv). The stangest part of my entire experience is that they have a sign in the bathroom that says something about how to conserve energy and water, they will only replace towels every other day (also the same for bedsheets). However, if you would like them to replace towels before the second day, that you may place them on the bathroom floor and they will be happy to replace them with fresh towels. Well I decided i needed new towels and after the first night, i placed my towels on the floor to be replaced. After a long day, I got back to my hotel and went to take a shower. The hotel staff took my dirty towels but didn't replace them with any towels. I literally had not one towel in my entire bathroom. I called housekeeping, which apparently is closed after 5 or 6pm and got transferrred to the front desk. The front desk sent someone up with an incomplete set of towels in about 25 minutes. I found this to be an annoyance an inconvenience and for the remainder of my trip never put towels on the floor again for fear they would not be replaced. The last part I want to discuss is my checkout process. The purpose of my trip was business and one of the people I was travelling with had put the room on his company credit card. The day we checked out, we got caught in a business meeting and had to advise the hotel we were checking out late. Even though we told them we would be done and out by 3pm, they never told us there would be an incremental charge of $30 from 1pm-3pm and another $36 from 3pm-6pm and finally after 6pm another $216!!! We checked out at 5pm and when I asked them to place the charge on the original card, they demanded to see it (fortunately my coworker was still there). Plus I asked to pay for my room service on a separate personal credit card, which they told me would not be a problem and took my card. However the next day I checked my credit card statement and they had charged both the room service and the late room fee on my credit card and have yet to refund my money. The best things about the hotel were the centralized location, bottled water machines, the bar/restaurant connected to the hotel (which had last call at 12:15am on a Friday night - totally odd to a New Yorker), and the lobby had a lovely little room with internet and coffee and a tv 5 times the size of the ones provided in the room. But these nice amenities in no way made up for where this hotel was lacking. Would I stay here again? No. Definately not.

The organisation that puts on the conference was supposed to obtain a hotel reservation for me at any one of a number of places, at its reduced, negotiated rate. This never happened. So at the last minute I was forced to look on my own. If you've been pricing downtown Chicago hotels then you know the horror I discovered. After calling a handful of the hotels on my conference list and being told that a room would cost, at the least, twice what the conference rate would have been I went to the on-line services. There really wasn't anything downtown offered except the Club Quarters. I read through some of the poorer reviews and most seemed to settle on the fact that the rooms are very small. There were some pictures posted and these seemed to bear out the descriptions. But I was to be there on a conference and had a good schedule of activities planned out in the evenings, so who needs a big room? The room was exactly as the posted photos indicated. The bathroom was very clean and I had the exact bed spread in the photo. If you've stayed in mid priced European hotels then the room will not seem too small. Service workers in Chicago - in general - are not friendly. The counter staff here are a bit better than average. But the cleaning staff and the restaurant staff are very nice and helpful. The size of the room helps in keeping it cool, which was nice to come back to after trapsing around downtown Chicago in July. The door staff seemed to be attentive of people coming and going and there is an added safety feature of needing a room key to use the elevator. I did not order food, but there are four different restaurants with menus posted in the room that will deliver to the hotel. There is no garage. I don't mention this as a criticism, only as a comment. The hotel is so nicely located that if you are at all ambulatory, you could stay here and never need a car. The Red Line CTA station is only a few blocks away and from there you can come in from the airport and get to almost anywhere.

The menu was pathetic for vegetarians with only one entree- a veggie burger- no meat free salads or pasta. Hey, you're in Chicago, better choices are a short walk away at any time! Another nice touch was a water and bottle dispenser by each elevator.

The only problem we had with the cards going up to the elevator and getting in the room; they didn't explain that to me, and maybe that's the norm in Chicago and other big cities.. but I had no idea and the doors shut and luckly there was someone in the elevator who told me what to do. Then the cards stopped working and I (along with other guests) had to get our cards (re-magnitized). They checked IDs when they did that, so I felt confortable that they did that...

Hotel only a couple of block from the subway (blue line brings you straight from O'Hare for only a couple of dollars each). In the business district so a little quiet at the weekend and you will have to walk up town to find a more varied selection of bars/restaurants. Elephant & Castle pub/restaurant attached to the hotel good for a drink if you like fake British pubs. Food not great and we found it rather smoky but it was an easy option. Our room was small by American standards but perfectly adequate for 2 of us (1xQueen bed). We were on the 6th floor facing Adams Street (I had asked for a high room having read previous comments about noise). I think the 8th floor is the highest. The hotel was really quiet and we had no-one next door to us. Whilst simple modern decor I thought the room (bathroom in particular) looked a little tired & could do with a repaint. The bathroom was very small and we had a shower (no tub) - not a problem but to be aware of if you have children or are larger than average. Only 2 pillows on the bed and we wanted more. Room instructions said they were available in the \"Guest Amenities\" closets located on each floor. We had a look in the closet and found 2 pillows but neither had covers on and both were stained (nice!). Room would have benefited from a safe for guest use. Ours did not have one. Machines on each floor with empty plastic bottles and dispensing drinking water to fill them with was a nice touch. Staff all very friendly. We were there on a particularly cold April weekend and the concierges always opened and closed the doors behind us. Front desk staff always acknowledged us coming in and out. Felt reassured by requirement in elevator to use room key to operate it - a good security measure. Whilst not understanding the previous reviewers full situation I can't really comment but I was interested to note the observation that it took over an hour for the concierge to find the person a chair.

I was told it was a smoking room, but could NOT smell any smoke. I even sniffed the curtains and no smoke smell. The room is VERY spacious. I estimate it to be 17 ft by 8 ft.

The shower gave it a kindof school gym feel. Others complained about the aircondition being turned off and not receiving new towels. There are numerous little notes around the room specifiying that if you want new towels to place your old ones on the floor and to notify the front desk if you want your air to stay on as they turn it off during the day. My main complaint about this hotel was how absolutely humid it was in our room. After a day of walking my husband and I would come back to the hotel and freshen up. I'd wash my face but still feel completely sticky. We bought carmel popcorn which became soggy after keeping it in the hotel room. No matter how low we set the a/c we couldnt get rid of the humidity in the room. My other complaint is that we moved our car into valet the last day so we could have in and out service. When we went to pull it out we were told they couldnt due to a road being closed for the 4th. This was several hours before the fireworks and we even specified when dropping off the car that we were pulling it out of self service so we could use it for dinner. Moving the car to valet was pointless and only ended up costing more.

First off, the location is fantastic. The hotel is located on the corner of Clark and Adams. It is about five blocks from Union Station and four blocks from the Art Institute on Michigan Avenue. If you a fan of coffee, there is a Starbucks on that same corner. But, I seemed to notice that Starbucks were about every two blocks, slightly more prevalent than McDonald's. There were two issues we had. First, we were unable to get an extra pillow. We called the front desk on two consecutive nights. The first night, the receptionist said one would be right up, but it never came. The second night, we were told that there were no extra pillows in the hotel. The second issue was noise. The way the room doors are right next to each other - within inches. Whenever the neighbor would close the door, it sounded like ours was being closed, it was so loud. Walls seemed pretty thin - we could hear conversations pretty easily. With earplugs, it was not much of a problem at night, but it wasn't the quietest place, though street noise was relatively low. Staying at hotels sometimes feels like a coin flip as far as getting people in neighboring rooms that are respectful of others - we just had bad luck. The room itself was small, especially the bathroom, but the bed was comfortable, the room was nicely decorated, the air conditioning worked great, and we had plenty of hot water.

It also does not have the price tag of high-end hotels like The W or Palmer House (both within 2 blocks of C.Q.). If you want to be pampered in a loop hotel, you need to shell out several hundred dollars more a night more then you will at Club Quarters. The folks that are trashing this hotel in their reviews were obviously expecting a 5 star hotel at an unrealistic price. If you choose to stay at Club Quarters what you can/should expect is an extremely clean, amazingly located, remarkably comfortable, safe corporate apartment style hotel. Yes the hallways are small, the amenities basic and the desk staff minimal, but for the money it is a great deal. The rooms are not huge but more then adequate in size. Older NY or London hotel rooms are half the size as these, as are the basic rooms in the Vegas MGM. We estimated that the room was roughly 11\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by 30\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 not including the closet or bathroom. The room was nicely decorated with several modern accents, nice furniture, a comfortable bed and good lighting. The bathroom was clean, brightly lit and larger then we expected based on the reviews we read here. We did hear occasional outside city street noise, but nothing major or disturbing. Extra towels, shampoo, coffee and such are available in a self serve manor from a nearby closets on every floor. Do not expect a fancy view from your window, instead use the amazing location to your advantage and walk the few blocks to the Art Institute or any of the other nearby attractions. The hotel is near three different Loop train stops. Taxis are easy to catch right out the front door. Since Club Quarters is in a quieter part of downtown, if you are looking for nightlife you might need a cab, but there are many nearby bars and restaurants (several that deliver to the hotel). There is also a small fridge and microwave in the room along with the usual stuff you would expect.

In terms of the room we have -- our upgrade buys us a small dark room with a leaky air conditioning system (which we complained about to no avail) a blocked lavatory and minimal in-room services; for example, we continue to receive a single tea bag each day for our tea and coffee facilities. In my experience this hotel is over-priced and under-performing. The staff need much better basic training, for sure. I wouldn't come again and certainly would not recommend it to others. Try the Crown Plaza, which is just up the street and by all accounts a much better option all around.", "Date": "August 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn", "Title": "\u201cSmall?

In fact, we planned to stay one night in the smallest, cheapest room and then move for the rest of our stay (the 3 weekend nights) in a more expensive larger room. But we found the original room perfectly adequate, and cancelled the move to a bigger room. I paced off the space between the bed and the door - about 7 feet by 11 feet, which was all we needed for using the desk, the drawers, the TV. We didn't bring a cat with us so we can't say whether there would have been room to swing one. On the subjective side, the simple wood decor was a relief after staying a few nights in chintz-draped B&Bs. On the practical side we liked the feature of being able to get an extra blanket or some decaf for the coffeemaker from the closet on our floor, rather than calling the front desk for them. The three PCs with internet access and free printing were a real help, as was the coin laundry room. The pub on the first floor had good, reasonably-priced food, and we found it convenient to put the restaurant tab on our hotel account.

Upon arrival and check-in, we were THRILLED with the location, upscale decor, amenities and spotless room! The front desk staff was great as he was more than happy to check our bags until our room was ready so we could go out into the city for the afternoon. The room itself was cozy and small but more than adequate in size for two people. The two twin beds were luxuriously comfortable with superior mattresses; quality, high-thread count sheet and beautiful, heavy comforters, topped of with thick pillows. The cherry wood desk and work area were top quality while the room even featured a standard microwave and mini-fridge. The bathroom was spotless, featuring wonderful soaps, complimentary mouthwash, glass cocktail glasses and a coffee/tea maker. Other amenities that went above-and-beyond our expectations were a shopping service to stock the mini-fridge at REGULAR consumer prices (vs. inflated room service prices), delivery of treadmills or exercise bikes TO YOUR ROOM for working out in private, free WiFi service throughout the property and free PC's and printers to use in the club room on the main level. We'd stay at Club Quarters for future trips to Chicago without question! The downtown location is suberb- 1 block from the Blue Line Jackson stop and 2 blocks from the State Street Red Line stops.

We were looking for 3 rooms to accomodate 8 women and having a difficult time, so we offered $100. per night offer and Priceline assigned us to Club Quarters. We were shocked and amazed, but happy! We were celebrating 2 \"monumental birthdays\" in our group and were told that the 2 rooms w/birthdays would receive a suite and the other room would receive a bottle of wine. (I was in the \"other room\" and celebrating a birthday, but would only have 1 other person staying w/me; so passed my upgrade to the others in our party.) We took all of our luggage up to our room because it was ready and the other rooms would not be ready until later in the afternoon. (No bell person was available to take care of our luggagge which was kind of surprising!) I was shocked when I opened our door to see the size of the room! We were not planning on spending a lot of time in the room, but being able to move about was close to impossible in this room. It was the teeniest room I have ever seen. I realize this hotel caters to the \"business world\", Monday through Friday; but I travel for business and have never seen anything quite so small. Before leaving the hotel, I stopped by the front desk and spoke to Angelo Garcia, who had been so great at helping us earlier, and asked him if there was someway to upgrade my room & I would pay whatever the price was for room change. He advised me to check back when the others got their rooms and he would see what he could do and says he will not charge for the upgrade if he can get an upgrade. I asked for his business card because I believe in letting employers know when someone goes out of their way to make something pleasant for someone else. Cut to the chase, arrive back to the hotel to clean up before we leave for our show and find out that all 3 rooms are the teeny rooms and that Angelo has left for the day and has the next day off. We were told the teeny rooms could not accomodate a roll away, so we are screwed. 3 women in a full size bed is not the way any of us wanted to spend our weekend getaway. They ended up relenting and gave the rooms w/3 people a roll away, but it definitely put a dent in the \"fun time\" we had planned for our Chicago get away w/no spouses or children. Turns out the hotel was oversold for the night. We met in the lobby (no possiblity of meeting in one of our rooms because of the size) before catching cabs and overheard someone who had booked 2 rooms on Priceline get a refund for 1 room they weren't going to be using that evening. Overselling rooms is common, I realize. Promising people something you have no intention of being able to deliver is just wrong. We went on and had a great weekend despite the rooms. Hotel 71 (which is where we had stayed on our last visit) was hosting NSync's Children's Charity event and we gawked at all of the Stars coming and going! Also, the Corner Bakery, was perfect for all of our breakfast needs, very yummy way to start out the day. Bottom line is sometimes you do get what you pay for!

We were close to many of our favorite haunts- Trattoria no. 10 on Dearborn & Washington, Atwood Cafe on State & Washington, Corner Bakery on Michigan & Jackson for a lighter meal, Garrett's Popcorn for the classic Chicago snack on State & Jackson. My only complaints would be that the front desk staff was not knowledgeable about what I consider a tourist \"must\"- the Chicago Transit Authority multi-day pass. We forgot to order ours online prior to travel & they didn't know where to direct us to buy one. I used to live in downtown Chicago but couldn't readily recall a currency exchange close to the hotel. The front desk proceeded to direct me to an American Express currency exchange but I didn't take that advice. You can buy the multi-day passes at 27 E.
