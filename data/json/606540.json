{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Dingy two star joint The photos you see on various websites of this hotel show a clean, new hotel with bright modern rooms. The reality of my experience was a pair of dingy twin rooms with poor quality, old furniture, faded wall paint and frayed carpets.We were a party of 4 adults staying in 2 standard twin rooms booked online. My overall impression, having stayed there, is that of a one to two star hotel. Breakfast included means a 5 RMB voucher for the noodle  rice joint across the road. I didn't see a charge mentioned for the coffee maker pack in the room but was hit for 40 RMB for 2 packs (2 large mugs worth) on leaving.Noise carried in through the flimsy door and woke me early and during the night. Noise from outside was not apparent so the windows are better insulated. Price is ok for the location but don't expect bright clean rooms and a decent breakfast.", "Date": "Jul 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR203461670", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "AlanHu"}, {"Content": "Great location, good price, some noise We are budget travellers looking for safe, reliable accomodation at a reasonable price and found it at Dongdan Yindi. This hotel was in an excellent location - close to Dongsi metro stop and in amongst some shops. It was very easy to get ourselves to sights in BJ from this hotel. The price was resonable coming from the US.The street was busy and the bed was hard, but so was every other hotel in our 2 week stay. The only thing we took issue with was there was a kareoke bar in the hotel which kept us up a bit. I think that this was because our room was on the exterior and the sound bounced off the opposing building and into our room. I think that if we had an interior room this would not have been a problem.The hotel staff spoke enough English to get us along and were pleasant and very polite.", "Date": "Apr 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR241004045", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "kats737"}, {"Content": "Good Comfortable Accommodation We have just returned from a weeks stay at the Dongdan Yindi. Before we left Australia we used Trip Advisor. We only booked one night with the intention to relocate if we didn't like the room. We didn't have to worry about moving and ended up staying the week. We stayed in a Deluxe Standard Twin Room. For a three star hotel it was comfortable with a modern ensuite. The only thing was the rock hard beds. But that seems to be a china thing.If your looking for a hotel that is located reasonably close to key sights and comfortable we suggest you try. The only downfall was the breakfast. It wasn't that great.Ian, Australia", "Date": "Sep 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR518081143", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "IanMelbourne"}, {"Content": "Worn out place Contrary to their announcement rooms (and hotel) provide no internet access.
