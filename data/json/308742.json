{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great time with the Family We visited Ananda Cottages with our five children, and we had a terrific time. It was quiet and relaxed and beautifully situated. We stayed in the two room villa, right by the pool, and kids loved it. We had a little Balinese man outside our window each morning working in the resort rice paddies, and across the gorge, there were paddies as far as the eye could see to go trekking. Being outside of town, it was very quiet, but not so far as to feel remote.The food was average, the service a little better. The bath was big enough for the whole family to bathe together.One downfall was the fact that the villa seemed to be infrequently stayed in, so it wasn't as clean as it could have been, but they were good to respond to our complaints.Based on the lovely setting alone, we would stay there again.", "Date": "Jun 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR326227779", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "eriktera"}, {"Content": "typical cottage in middle of the rice fieldvery typical roomslittle swimming poolgood foodstaff is friendlyspa is very well15 mins by foot from downtowncheap price", "Date": "May 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR569232849", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "fab78"}, {"Content": "A resort in nature       The Bungalows", "Date": "Apr 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR697914769", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "gabeso"}, {"Content": "fabulous!!!!!...rare find!

Our first destination was Ubud and Ananda Cottages was our accommodation for 5 nights. We had a wonderful time here with great staff who were extremely friendly and helpful always. Our accommodation was just what was advertised, traditional cottages set amidst the rice fields-beautiful. We had two huge bedrooms and two bathrooms, bamboo blinds, (no glass in the windows) and gorgeous views across gardens and rice fields. They have lovely swimming pools which our daughters loved, good food, complimentary breakfast and advice on everything. The staff were terrific and even though the liked to sell extras, we did not find this offensive in the least as some of your reviews have said. Overall, the highlight of our trip for friendly staff, gorgeous surroundings, good food and wonderful accommodation.

The property itself was just amazing. Ananda is surrounded by so many beautiful rice fields...and has many of it's own on the property. I went looking for the third pool, and wound up walking around the rice fields for 45 min. I bumped into one of the caretakers and he was very kind and showed me around a bit. But, like some other folks said....these sorts of things always ended up with someone trying to show you around town, the rice field, their village for some money. I do understand how terribly hard things are there for them, and they are willing to work for money - but I really, really hated being approached daily, by everyone for some sort of extra deal. I just wanted to relax and read my book. The guy who cleaned my room daily asked to take me on a tour, the lady who brought me afternoon coffee always wanted to sell me a skirt, the guy who swept the front steps wanted to drive me to his village. It was non-stop to the point you feel tense when anyone comes around and starts chatting because 100% of the time it ends up in them asking if they can sell you something or a service. And I don't believe the hotel knows this, or would allow it. But do I tell? These folks do need money and someone must be saying yes, or else they\u9225\u6a87 stop asking. Anyway....I too had to change rooms. I felt a little unsecure in my first room as there was an old, rickety door that joined my room with a strangers, and was only locked by a little latch. And we could hear everything in each other's room. We also shared a veranda, and he was so chatty it ruined my morning coffee and book. So, I moved to what was available. A smaller room with very loud A/C, and TONS of bugs. The bathroom window would not shut tight, so lizards galore. Plus, I was on the bottom floor and someone arrived that same night. The lady upstairs wore some sort of very loud shoes, all night, walking around and around. I could not sleep at all between her clunking around and the A/C. I am not really that much of a complainer\u9225\ue6c8ut I do need to sleep. I did end up with a lovely private veranda with no chatty neighbors. There are also LOTS of animals running around to check out \u9225?roosters, dogs, cats \u9225?you name it! Again\u9225\ue6d4ot so sure how clean this makes everything, because the doors don\u9225\u6a9b shut tight, they just pull closed and are locked with a big padlock. And then fall open a bit. So, saw the cats and kittens running around and playing in vacant rooms. And the food was barely ok...meaning, not so sure how hygienic the kitchen is. The taste was fine, and the choices were ok, but I literally found bugs in most all of my dishes. I am still here, living and breathing - so I was fine, and it didn\u9225\u6a9b kill me - and I'm sure I ate a few...but that I could have done without that. I am going back to Ubud in the summer and sort of debating on whether to return to Ananda or not. The price is right....they help was very friendly - always big smiles and a kind word...but overall, I am not sure I'd return. But they are long 20 min. walk from town, and just not sure I can deal with the bugs in the food and the pressure to buy from the workers again.", "Date": "Apr 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR994122670", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "ImasuYo"}, {"Content": "Relaxing  I loved Ananda Cottages.They are in among the rice paddies.We had a huge room (upstairs with air con) with a king size bed, which was very confortable.The bathroom was huge with lovely fluffy clean towelsOur room boy was very helpful and cleaned the room beautifully.There are 3 pools - we used the newest one which was close to our room (31) it was just wheat we needed after a long day shopping and sightseeing.The cottages were very quiet - only one other couple staying there.The staff were friendly and very helpful.I would stay there again.", "Date": "Apr 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR826866374", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "aussietraveller31"}, {"Content": "Love the place We have stayed at Ananda Cottages almost every year since 1986!

If the staff had managed this with courtesy and efficiency perhaps it may have been overlooked but we were left feeling that we were being very difficult as we had to repeatedly call and ask and then demand that the AC either be repaired or other arrangements be made.The other factor that distracted from the incredible scenary all around was the sell sell sell of the staff. Everyone knew someone who could arrange a tour (special discount just for you!), any general enquiry about your plans for the day would result in a price offered for transport, and when the head waitress emptied a bag of jewellery that she was trying to sell on the breakfast table, it made the meal a little less enjoyable.In general a beautiful and reasonable place to stay but the hotel management made it a somewhat dissapointing experience. However if you are in the area the Spa up the road 'Linggih Ning' (Jalan Raya Campuhan) was magnificent for facials and massages and general pampering.
