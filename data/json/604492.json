Hotel breakfast is buffet style bit pricey at 14 euros per head, so we went to Starbucks or Macs both within 10 mins on Friedrichstrasse. This was our first trip to Berlin, loads to do and easy to navigate either on foot or using the excellent railway system.

Room consisted of twin beds, wardrobe (only 10 hangers) also safe deposit box (free) and dressing table. Good, clean bathroom with shower. Pleasant lounge/bar area, which closed at 1am, although I think if there were a lot of residents using it they might have stayed open a bit longer. Dining room only offered breakfast, at a cost of 12euros pp however, there are plenty of cafes nearby. The hotel is in a street which cross sects the 2 main east/west roads. On one you will find Checkpoint Charlie and on the other, a large section of the Berlin Wall and an open air exhibition. A 3rd street nearby takes you straight to Potzdamer Platz. Around another corner is the Jewish museum and It is only a 15/20 minute walk to the Brandenburg Gate. For the shopper it is a paradise with most of the designer labels represented, however the gift shops range from tacky to repetitive. We traveled from Tegel airport by taxi, which can be found outside the main arrivals hall, it cost 25 euros. The return taxi cost 19 euros and we were given a guided tour by the driver all the way back to the airport. While public transport is a lot cheaper, approx 2 euros I understand, I believe you cannot do the journey without making a change. My husband and I didn't want the fuss so opted to use the cream taxis (I think you also get a feel for the attitude of the locals this way too).

There were a few choices of places to eat near the vicinity. One or two convenience stores nearby and a small supermarket towards Check Point Charlie. I very much like the modern and clean design of the hotel and the rooms. I stayed at a standard single room. The size of the room and bathroom was good for for a solo traveler. The bathroom had very nice fittings, clean and shiny. The \u20ac12 breakfast buffet was worth the money. The spread included choices of bread, cereals, cold cuts, cheese, tea, juices, salads, egg and sausages among others. Internet and WiFi access were not included in the price. There was however 2 computers at the lobby free for use and a printer as bonus. I had some difficulty using the hotel's electronic door lock. My card key was checked at the lobby and works perfectly except for the door lock to the room. Was a challenge opening the door to the room but was able to find a solution to it. One of the reasons I was in Germany was to visit the Christmas Markets. 2 U-Bahn stations away at Franz\u00f6sische Stra\u00dfe is the Gendarmenmarkt. One of the nicest markets around.

Berlin is very hot, even in spring. The Hotel is modern - bordering on minimalist. The rooms, however, are comfortable, although there could be more \u201cdrawer space\u201d. There is a safe in each room. The bathroom is very clean. However, the towels were on the small and thin side. For a \u201c4-star\u201d hotel we were surprised that the soap & shower gel were dispensers on the wall. The water was extremely hot, virtually instantaneously. The shower was very powerful \u2013 almost too powerful; if used at full power the head was forced back to such an extent that the water could go over the top of the partition. We found that full power is best used when held by hand. There was no Air-Con, which, for a modern hotel was a surprise. Our first room was at the front of the hotel and because of the heat (& lack of Air-Con) meant that the windows had to be left open. This meant that we were disturbed by traffic noise. The following morning we asked to be moved \u2013 this was no problem and we were moved with no fuss at all. So, avoid the front in Spring/Summer if you are a light sleeper - the back is very quiet \u2013 ask for the furthest courtyard , not one where kitchens are. Our package included breakfast \u2013 this was better that the usual Continental fare \u2013 there were a selection of hot food, fresh fruit, mueslis, cereals plus the usual ham and cheeses plus croissants. All were replenished regularly. All the staff (including cleaners) were all very helpful and cheerful. The hotel is convenient for (all within 10 minutes walk): Jewish Museum Checkpoint Charlie (+ Museum) Wall of Terror/Propaganda U-Bahn (Kochstrasse) Netto Supermarket (left out of the Hotel and second on left) Thai Restaurant (left out of the Hotel and on the first corner) \u2013 very nice fresh food Would we stay again: Yes for convenience & cleanliness, the downside is lack of Air-Con - there are probably other hotels that have Air-Con. Hints/Tips on Berlin: Reichstag \u2013 if you intend to go then you must apply at least three days before. (Yoy have to apply in writing or on-line.) TV Tower \u2013 well worth a visit \u2013 lunch is expensive, but worth it to see Berlin revolve below. Note that they confiscate all drinks before entry. Holocaust Memorial \u2013 they have scanners \u2013 so no Swiss Army Knives! U-Bahn - Get a Berlin Welcome Card \u2013 we had a 5-day one, but you can get 2 or 3 day Cards. It gives discounts on many museums and sites and covers public transport ( S & U-Bahn). The U-Bahn is clean. Get a U-Bahn map from a station \u2013 the maps in guide books and general maps were too small to read easily. You are never too far away from a station. Hop-on/off buses worth a day\u2019s ticket just to get your bearings. Tempelhoff \u2013 a bit disappointing \u2013 the park (where the runways used to be) is nice \u2013 but we were expecting to visit the building \u2013 there are no official tours that we could find. Jewish Museum \u2013 interesting both in content and architecture.

Parking on the street is free if you can find a spot. I'm not sure what advantage the 'car park' gains, there is no security and is further from the hotel Breakfast is 12 euros, good selection of food but depends on how much you normally like to eat. I think there is nothing particularly wrong with the hotel, but it was not very welcoming to come back to at night. There was no 'soul'.

Initially there was a problem with my first room in that it was much smaller that my dad's and also smelt of something very unpleasant. Although there was nothing the hotel could do for the first night as they were fully booked, they moved me the next day into a much bigger room on the first floor, facing the street. Rooms with yellow d\u00e9cor are on the first floor, green d\u00e9cor are on the second floor, blue d\u00e9cor are on the third floor and red is fourth floor. I think the red rooms are the 'superior' rooms, as they appear to have balconies from the front of the hotel. The staff couldn't have been nicer or more apologetic about it and they dealt with it in a professional manner. The rooms at the back of the hotel face into a large court-yard with a plain brick wall for a view. I suggest you request a front facing room! The road that the hotel is on (Hedemannstra\u00dfe) is a quiet residential road and doesn't get much traffic. The street intersects with Friedrichstra\u00dfe (one of the main streets in Berlin) and therefore major attractions and things to see & do are easily accessible. The hotel itself is modern, very clean and despite previous reviews, the staff are friendly and helpful. Both rooms I had were clean, well appointed and well equipped. The beds are very comfortable, however the pillows are wafer thin and the duvets provided were in singles. Otherwise I slept very well. Breakfast (not included in the price: \u20ac12) was very nice and typically continental. Wide variety of cold meats, salads, veggies, cereals, bread rolls, scrambled eggs & bacon for the Brits. Along with something called Bircher muesli which I now need to work out how to make as it was seriously good!! The breakfast room is nicely bright & well furnished, however was also very stuffy and warm - even with windows open. Would suggest that you don't wear anything too warm in there! One thing amongst many that I liked about the hotel was the security. Each room has a safe with a digital lock and the rooms can only be accessed from the lobby/reception area by guests with a key card to open the main door. This would hopefully stop unwanted visitors. The hotel is approx a 5 min walk to the nearest U-Bahn station (Kochstra\u00dfe) and Checkpoint Charlie. For the central area of Unter Den Linten, Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag, I would allow 20-25 mins to walk it. Overall I would recommend this hotel. For the location, price and proximity to the major attractions I don't think you can do much better!", "Date": "March 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery satisfied with stay\u201d", "Author": "Twix5", "ReviewID": "UR99174586", "Content": "Me and a friend have just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel and I am hard put to fault the hotel, The location is excellent - just a few minutes walk from Checkpoint Charlie and Friedrichstrasse.

We stayed for 4 nights in June 2009, which cost just over 100 euros per night (for a standard double room). The room was clean and a good size, and breakfast was very good. However, each evening when we came back to the hotel, our room was very cold - i.e. cold enough to make us feel uncomfortable (and we're from London, so we're used to relatively cold temperatures). The problem was that the windows were opened (and left open) by the maids when they cleaned our room each afternoon, and the weather in Berlin was colder than normal for June (temperatures went as low as 5-10 degrees during our stay). This meant that when we returned each evening our room was very cold. Although there were radiators in the room, these didn't work, and when we asked at reception we were told that the heating was switched off at this time of the year. We understand that you wouldn't normally expect a hotel to have its heating switched on in June. However, when temperatures are lower than normal (they went as low as 5-10 degrees) you would expect a hotel to review its policy of having the heating switched off, or to review its policy of opening the windows in the rooms. Whatever the explanation, we didn't feel that it was acceptable for us to be uncomfortably cold in a hotel room, with no heating available, particularly when you are paying over 100 euros per night. We were also disappointed at several other aspects. A couple of things in the room didn't work (e.g. the desklight), and when we asked reception for blankets they forgot, so we had to go down and ask again. Although these were very minor issues, they're just not the sort of things you expect from a hotel when you're paying over 100 euros per night. In conclusion, because the room was cold with no heating available, we didn't feel that that the hotel provided a standard of accommodation that was acceptable, particularly considering that this is certainly not a budget hotel.", "Date": "October 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peterhead, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Born4travel", "ReviewID": "UR81446851", "Content": "The hotel is situated not far from Checkpoint Charlie on Friedrichstrasse, which runs through the centre of Berlin Mitte.

We had booked a standard room but on checking the internet I upgraded to a Superior room for 20 euros per day, well worth it. More room.

The location of the hotel is great -- a five minute walk to a U station (Kochstrasse, in front of Checkpoint Charlie) but it's still on a relatively quiet street.. You can zip up to major train stations with ease -- in fact, you'll love Berlin's transporation system -- and if you want to walk in the area, Friedrichstrasse is a nice, lively area to check out, with lots of store and restauarants. Very safe, and everyone we came across was very friendly. The hotel staff were helpful in giving us directions and advice, and over all, I'd say they're pretty cool. Our room itself was spotless, as was our bathroom, which had a great shower (good water pressure and no clogged shower drain -- so common in so many hotels). The decor was spare, but modern and functional, and I even had a potted orchid on my bedside, which was lovely. The other reviewers are correct in saying that there's not much in English on their TV's -- BBC and Sky was it, I think, but then, we didn't go to Berlin to watch television, so just a spot of news in the morning and before bed was fine for us :) The Cons: While the bed is quite comfortable, there's no top sheet. So you get to use a thick comforter or...nothing. You each get one very thin pillow. You may ask for another, but it'll take a good while before it shows up. Also, we only had decaf coffee in our room. We asked for regular, but the woman at the reception desk just said she'd send someone to our room with it. Okay. We gave it an hour before gave up on waiting and just went out for coffee. They need to do a better job of nailing that down. And oh, no free internet wifi in the rooms. Tsk. Plus it cost 2 Euro for 30 mninutes in the lobby, which isn't bad, except that their computers were sooooooo slow and buggy (I saw others have this issue too).

There is virtually no traffic and if you arrived by car then I don't think you'd have a problem parking in the street. Nice room, nice bathroom, superb shower, no bath, room temp fine, double bed with single quilts a superb idea, brilliant for couples who like different temperatures!! Free safe is very easy to use. Flat TV on wall with usual free Euro and base channels inc Sky News, plus movies and porn as in pretty much any Euro hotel. Gave us 2 completely blank door cards which you just wave over the sensor on the room door and alse the door that separates the rooms from the public areas, a nice touch we thought. Delicious round the corner (towards CPC) does indeed do a good alternative Euro brecky for E8 rather than E12 in hotel. If you prefer cooked and are up late then after 10am you can get a superb omelette in the Italian 2 blocks left out of the hotel towards Anhalter - forget name but has a SommerGarten. Looks a little run down but food excellent. For the evening we recommend Caf\u00e9 Orange on Oranienburger Strasse 32. Go to Anhalter and then take S Bahn up to next stop after Friedrichstrasse - the public transport really is the best way around in Berlin, you never have to wait and it all goes fast. The duck in blasamic sauce or the lamb in olive sauce are just superb and packed with taste - incredible value for just 11 Euros! Back to the hotel, the bar is completely devoid of any atmosphere, best bet is probably the bar round the corner to the left. We tried the bar of the Angleterre to the right and it was nice enough but ridiculously expensive. Better doing your drinking in town really - the public transport is still perfectly OK even late at night. Berlin seems to have a big problem with grafitti, some of which is actually very good, which does make it look more run down than it really is in some areas - but we were told crime is very low and didn't see anything to make us feel otherwise. Motorcycles are left on the street and still there the next day anyway! If we ever go back to Berlin and the Winters is still as cheap as it is now then we'll certainly be staying there! Tip, sign out front is just blue 'HOTEL'. The rest is there but very small, and the word 'Winter's' is almost invisible!

The lobby and front desk area had a contemporary feel. The front office staff were pleasant, helpful, and spoke English quite well. I found security measures at the hotel to be excellent. Your electronic room key is required to access the elevator and stairs to the upper floors where the rooms are located. The room was of average size for a European Hotel but had high ceilings giving the room a much larger feel. Furnishings were modern and contemporary. The TV was a 20\" flat screen mounted to the wall over the desk. Internet access was offered at a reasonable cost. The bathroom was bright and modern and everything in the room was extremely clean. Unfortunately my room overlooked the inner courtyard so not much of a view. The hotel offers a breakfast buffet in the restaurant at a cost of 12 Euros; a bit expensive with the poor US$ exchange rate so I didn't use the restaurant. Overall, this is an excellent choice of hotels if you're staying in Berlin. I was able to secure a rate of US$120 per night (all inclusive) via Expedia. DIRECTIONS: From the Berlin Hauptbahnhof (Main Railway Station) take any of the following S-Bahn trains to the Friedrichstrasse Station: S5 towards Strausberg Nord S7 towards Ahrensfelde S9 towards Flughafen Berlin Schoenefeld / Spandau At the Friedrichstrasse Station, go down two levels to the U-Bahn station and board the U6 subway towards Alt-Mariendorf. Get off at the Kochstrasse Station (3rd or 4th stop). When you exit the train, go right and walk up the stairs to the street. This is Friedrichstrasse. Continue walking in the same direction, past the police station on your right and past Puttkamerstrasse. Hedemannstrasse is the next street on your RIGHT (about 200 yards further). Turn right. The hotel is mid-block on your left. Between the S-Bahn and U-Bahn stations close to the hotel you can get anywhere in Berlin quite easily.

The shower pressure was good & strong and most importantly a very decent size. FYI Ladies: hairdryer inside bathroom! The entire hotel & room were spotless. Furniture looks practically new .... very contemporary (modern) decorations. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this hotel. Would stay there again and recommend it to all. (check out my pictures) Husband & I (in our early 30's with no kids) stayed here from 28Dec to 1Jan. Loved Berlin and enjoyed a 4hr walking tour (in English) ..... despite the fact that it was FREEEEZING this time of year. We seriously recommend/encourage everyone gets the 48hr or 72hr Welcome Card Packet which includes a ticket for unlimited public transportation (all buses & trains in Berlin) which is a must when navigating the city. The Packet also comes with a discount book for museums & other attractions, train system map & more. We are already planning to go back as there were many museums we didn't get to visit. The hotel lobby had a rack nicely filled with brochures (by the lobby vending machine). -We picked up a yellow brochure I think called \"Insider's\" and found discount coupons for the Cinestar Movie theater located in the Sony Center (Movies shown in original language which means a good selection in English). As an American I was shocked to find the movie theater has a full bar inside and they even sell alcohol at the popcorn concession. We didn't see any 3D movies as they were all in German. Sony Center is nice & I recommend it .... we walked to it 2x (yes even in the cold) it was a nice but not painful walk from the hotel. -The same brochure is also how we found out about the \"New Pub Crawl\" which we totally recommend. We later learned that the same group that runs the New Pub Crawl also offers a FREE walking tour daily .... bummer as we had already paid 9 Euros each for our tour earlier that day. The 9 Euros were still worth it so not much regret there. Tips: Hotel is located 2 blocks away form Checkpoint Charlie and train station. In the opposite direction the Jewish Museum was also about that much distance. There were many other attractions within very close walking distance. There are 2 supermarkets near the hotel: PLUS is located on corner of Kochstrasse & Wilhemstrasse (From hotel entrance walk to your left & on Wilhemstrasse make a right until you reach Kochstrasse). KAISER is located in a gray looking residential area behind hotel but this is the only one we went to shop for wine & champagne to ring in the New Year (from hotel entrance walk to the right and at Friedrichstrasse turn right again until you reach pedestrian area/residential area & supermarket sign can be seen at a distance). Now the following is just my personal opinion (welcome to disagree or agree with me): - 12 Euro breakfast not worth it. However, if you can afford it and/or are afraid to walk 2 blocks to Starbucks & other cafes near by .... so be it. We tried it only on our last morning there (1-Jan New Year's Day) because we were not sure if anything was open in the city but later noticed that all food establishments were very open & running at the main train station. - Internet prices in hotel were more expensive than the internet cafes near by so again .... if you can afford it, so be it. But don't be afraid to venture off the hotel for a better bargain. - New Year's at Brandenburg Gate was overrated. I was not the least impressed with the performances on stage or the fireworks show. Fireworks show was over too quickly. We got there at 8pm to make sure we got a good spot & froze for 4hrs till midnight & it was disappointing. I'm glad I still fell in love with Berlin due to everything else the city has to offer (lots of history & grand city atmosphere). - The Jewish Museum was highly recommended by people we met while doing walking tour & Pub Crawl but we never got to see exhibitions. It is one of the few Museums open on Mondays & it even closes really late on Mondays (9pm) so that is the day of the week we went. Berlin was super busy in terms of tourists due to New Year's celebration but that is no excuse to the rudeness we encountered from the STAFF there. We'd spent a good amount of time on a line just to get in and then discovered they had \"airport-security-like\" check-in process before you can even buy your ticket. With Welcome Card coupons we paid 11 Euros for the combo-exhibit ticket. However the ticket sales rep was extremely rude & further rudeness was to follow when we were told (not nicely) that they had sold out of Audio Guides & that checking our coats was a MUST! They had Polizei outside I guess guarding the museum & 2 regular men that turned us away from entering exhibits when they saw we had our coats on. Remember, our coats were already scanned by an x-ray machine upon entering museum. Meanwhile we saw others go inside wearing their coats & coat check-in queue was really long.

Walking distance to a lot of attractions like Checkpoint Charlie, Jewish Museum etc. I booked a room without breakfast (12 Euro) but there are several coffeeshops and bakeries around the corner in Friedrichstrasse, so it is easy and cheaper to eat breakfast here. Very clean hotel and friendly staff. The only minus that I can mention is that they were sometimes very late finished with cleaning the room...sometimes 16.00, so I came back in a room that wasn't done yet. But I can absolutely recommend this room. A tip: take the 2 or 3 days tickets for the public transport, much cheaper than the hop on-hop off offers. The city of Potsdam is absolutely worth a visit as well.", "Date": "October 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Upstate New York", "Title": "\u201cNot bad\u201d", "Author": "eastlandingdweller", "ReviewID": "UR10115799", "Content": "Stayed here for three nights on our first stop of a 10 day Germany tour. Berlin was more of a tourist attraction for native Germans, sort of like what Washington, DC would be for Americans. Could see most of what you would want to see in about 2 days. Nice, clean and recently renovated hotel. Rooms were very spacious and modern. We got a separate room for our two boys age 19 and 11 but they could have easily stayed in our room with an extra cot. Location was fair. A little bit of a hike to the center of attractions near the government buildings and museums. Public transportation system, however, is outstanding and very easy to use. Couple of nice coffee shops in area so don't waste your euros on hotel breakfast, way to expensive. Staff helpful except for one person who I think had difficulty with the English language.", "Date": "October 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "dublin", "Title": "\u201cGreat for a city break\u201d", "Author": "Dublin16", "ReviewID": "UR8699035", "Content": "We arrived in this hotel and firstly found the receptionist very helpful. The hotel is bright and modern and the rooms were spacious enough with good bathrooms. Although there was no AC, it was not necessary as the weather was only about 18c celius. The location is very central, the hotel bar would have zero atmosphere though (but who drinks in their hotel when they're in berlin!?!?) and overall we were very happy with our stay. We paid about \u20ac280 for 3 nights (wed, thurs & fri) and overall I would recommend this hotel. However, that price did not include breakfast which we were advised was \u20ac12 per head. there's a nice cafe on the corner though so there was no way we were paying \u20ac24 for brekkie in the hotel!

The rooms did not have AC and it was a warm week while I was there so this was a negative (no fan in the room). At night with the windows open the room would cool down but the room would get mosquitoes and we would awake to several new bites each morning. The hotel has two internet connected computers available for use, for a fee. The charge for internet access was a disappointment for the price of the rooms but this seems to be the trend in hotels trying to cater to higher spending travelers. The Breakfast was nice but not worth the 12 euros per person they charge. There are much better breakfast choices just up the street near Check Point Charlie.
