Each room has a refrigerator and a microwave. The bathrooms have been remodeled and the showers have a functional shower head that varies pressure and spray. The rooms are kept very clean by a cheerful cleaning staff. Coffee is available in the lobby at anytime and it was good. However, the room also had a coffee maker that made one cup at a time and the quality of this coffee was outstanding. Usually the coffee in most motel rooms is almost undrinkable. We had a king size bed that was very comfortable with nice clean bedding. The room was not huge but very adequate with a table and two chairs, a computer desk with ergonomic chair, and a comfortable, overstuffed armed chair.

Its was only a 12 dollar taxi ride from the airport which was a nice surprise, being used to cities where fares are upwards of 35 dollars.

I was given the room key and walked my suitcase across the small parking lot to my room. Opening the door I found a very very clean room, abit on the small side, but being a single traveller that didnt matter. The bathrooms have obviously been redone as everything gleamed and looked fairly new. The shower ran well and has a showerhead that adjusts streams, hot water and pressure were great! Towels are the super absorbent kind. After a long flight the bed was very very comfortable. The mattress, which I checked, was new and clean, it had firm support and I slept well. Even though this location is on a roadway I didnt hear traffic through the night. In the daytime it got a little bit noisier but for the price I was very pleased.

That exchange let me know that they have people LIVING in the hotel. It made me leery the more I thought about it because there are certain people who HAVE to live in hotel rooms. Had I had my computer, I would have checked the sex offender registry. My 10 year old daughter went to use the bathroom and found some many legged dead bug in the toilet. When she flushed, the tank started spewing water on the floor! I went to the front desk clerk, (I tried to call but she didn't answer the phone),and she said that they didn't have anyone to fix it. Another person staying at the motel suggested that I use a big trash bag and tie it around the tank to catch the water. Fortunately it worked, although I should not have had to do that myself. I had to use some towels to soak up the water and when I asked for more to shower with, they didn't have enough! The water wet the filthy carpet so the room stank the entire weekend. (They had no other rooms or I would have moved.) Later that night, my 10 year old found a cup filled with a condom box that had been left in the room from a previous occupancy and the cleaning staff had not discarded it. I kicked it under the bed because I didn't want to touch it (it's probably still there!) Needless to say, I was very disappointed in this hotel.

When we walked into our room we instantly noticed a horrible smell... extremely musty. It smelled like someone left a bunch of wet towels on the floor. Then after looking around we noticed a few disgusting things about the room. One corner of the ceiling was covered with many spots of mold. The wall paper was pealing off of the wall in some spots... and the walls were dirty. My girlfriend checked out the bathroom area and noticed a huge bug smashed on the mirror. I didn't even want to lay on the bed... needless to say, we decided that it was best for our health to not stay at this hotel. I went back to the front desk and told the nice lady that we had decided not to stay at the hotel and wanted the $80 credited back to my card. She asked why, and I told her everything. She then suggested we look at another room to prove that not all of their rooms are that bad. We checked out that room... it was a little more clean and had no mold, but still smelled really musty. I went back to the front desk again and told her that I still do not want to stay. She then explained that she can't credit the amount back to my card... she has to fill something out and send it to the owners. We just left and ended up spending the extra $$ to stay at a nearby, more well renowned hotel overlooking the ocean, which was an extremely pleasant experience and definitely worth it. Anyway... I'm never going to even think about staying there again and I really hope I get my money back. Otherwise, they should use that $80 to supply the rooms with a bottle of febreze and some candles.", "Date": "October 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bay Area, california", "Title": "\u201cno way!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4364662", "Content": "WE got there at night - so we couldnt see all those spider web next to the bed... street noise was auful!!!!!!!!!! bathroom-hair on the floor from the previous guests, i think, shower - not clean, carpet - not clean, no good!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I called a week before our trip and asked to be switched to a non-smoking room for no extra charge and the lady said that it would be taken care of. However, when we got there, we were still in the smoking room and there were not any non-smoking rooms available so we did have to suffer with that AWFUL smell, and there was a nasty cigarette burn on the side of the bathtub - but we aired out the room, sprayed lysol and lit a candle - by the time we left you wouldn't have known it was a smoking room. That was my only complaint. I would definitely stay there again!

Uh Rah-Marines! Before deciding on staying at this hotel we almost stayed at the Good Nite Inn nearby until we read the reports . This place was maybe a smidge above that. I felt uncomfortable the whole night......not comfortable enough to go in the shower without shower shoes. There was a smell in the room that seemed someone tried to heavily mask with room spray. We got a room with two queen beds upstairs and it seemed that the t.v. was in a weird positon to even watch .......not inbetween the beds as it should be but nearer to the one closest to the bathroom. In order to comfortably watch t.v. one had to pile in on one bed. The ceiling had spots on it that looked like it came from bad plumbing from above and anytime anyway left or entered a room you could hear it. When I finally climbed in bed I noticed dirt on the sheet and some unidentifiable stain. Needless to say I used a shirt that I brought as a pillow case and covered the stain with kleenex. I said my prayers went to sleep with my socks on.
