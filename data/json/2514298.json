I searched and found the Georgian Hotel which has a great location just 10 minutes walk from Oxford Street so we shop at leisure and go out for the evening without worrying about catching trains and lugging bags around. When we arrived we could see it was an old building but whereas this could be made into a real selling point, (original features and all that), this place just looked run down. As soon as you walk in you can smell the kitchen and it permeates the building. The owner / manager was pleasant enough and, despite some nauseating comments about my mum being my sister, check in was speedy. We had had to pay in advance and now I know why! I'd booked a family room with a double and a single bed as no twin was available. The room was basic which wasn't a problem as we weren't intending to be in much. Toilet and bathroom was clean although lacked any necessities like soap. The carpets were grubby and the room stuffy. We went out but when we came back to sleep the nightmare began. This hotel has no double glazing and we were on the street side. Even on the fourth floor we were kept awake all night by the sounds of three lanes of one way traffic flying past. This would have been annoying but liveable if it wasn't for the APPALLING beds. Dirty stained sheets, lumpy (actually physically lumpy!!) beds that were unbelievably uncomfortable and worst of all, having been in my single bed about half an hour I suddenly begain to smell urine! Obviously as it was a family room, a child must have wet the bed at some point and it was just foul! I put towels down in the bed so I wasn't sleeping close to the mattress but even after a short time my pyjamas smelt of urine. I ended up sharing with my mum in the double which was as uncomfortable but at least minus the pee. Having barely slept a wink we went down for breakfast the next morning which was a pitiful affair. No cooked breakfasts of any kind, no fresh fruit, no yoghurt, no herbal / fruit teas, no pastries. All the offered was tea, coffee, two kinds of cereal and toast. For my \u00a3110 a night I expect a little more. And just to add to the fun, the dining room is a tiny, dingy basement area with too few tables, peeling wallpaper and grimy decor. This was just the worst stay I've ever had. Even thinking about it makes me shudder and it made us just want to escape to the point we left for home and didn't spend the Sunday in London. This is not a cheap hotel and for \u00a3110 you expect a decent level of HYGIENE and facilities. If this was the last hotel in London, I would rather sleep on a bench.

The staff was incredibly slow, had to wait for 10 minutes before they answered the doorbell when we arrived in the afternoon. Breakfast was advertised as very good by the hotel manager: a few slices of toast, marmelade, cheese and ham. Orange juice was served in 3cl glasses known as small schnapps glasses at home. Tea or some sort of brew, brownish, tasted less then the tea.(coffee?) Milk and cornflakes. Eggs either very hard boiled like rubber or hardly boiled at all. The only good thing was the location.

The first thing I saw was some red dots beside one of beds, I dont know what that was, but it cold be old blood drops....... However \"The Georgian Hotel\" should not be named as a Hotel, and how did the hotel get 3 stars? One star is too much for this....

The Georgian Hotel at Gloucester Place was said to have a three star rating, so we did not expect more than something equal to a two star hotel anywhere else in the world. The location is great. A short walk from Baker Street station, and also within walking distance of Hyde Park and Oxford Street. But that is just about the only positive things worth to mention. First of all: Our bathroom was located across the hallway. Terribly intimidating, because we had to get dressed just to take a pee. There was no soap, and the shower only had cold water. And as I was going to London with a mate, I ordered a twin bed room. But when I arrived late at night due to a delayed flight, it turned out to be one single bed. And as the staff only were present until 10 PM, there were nothing to do about this before the next morning. So I could do nothing but sleep on the floor! When I confronted the unfriendly (Indian) hotel manager the next morning with this, he only said that they by no means needed to pay attention my room preference. So to get a bed to sleep in, we had to pay 60 pounds more to upgrade to a triple room! This is a definite no-go!

I know how expensive hotels in London can be, but for sure this is one of those that do not make you feel like you got what you paid for at all. Staff was quite unfriendly, at least to us. The room was small and rundown, the locks to lock yourself from inside did not work, so there was a funny situation every morning when the cleaner was about to come in and we were still in bed! The remote control for the TV didn't work, and the floor was annoyingly squeaky. Be aware that what they call a \"private bathroom\" is a bathroom only you can use, but it's across the corridor, and you have to use the key to open both doors, which makes the whole experience of going to the bathroom at night a nightmare, including the noisy doors and floorboards.

It had a double bed, wardrobe, TV and tea/coffee facilities. The thing we found odd was the en suite bathroom that was actually across the landing. It was a private bathroom but not the most convenient when you need the loo at 3 in the morning. The breakfast was basic but again passable. Consisted of unlimited supply of tea/coffee and juice, toast, cereak and eggs, cheese, ham etc. Was OK but some good cooked food would be welcome. All in all, a basic hotel but as we were in London for the sights and shopping etc, the hotel served more as a base to return each night.
