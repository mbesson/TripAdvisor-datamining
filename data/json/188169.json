We booked a king size room online for 70$ and found the room very nice for the price. It was very spacious and clean. There was a nice real brick wall behind the bed. The washroom was quite small, but clean and it would be fine for a couple nights. The useable space in the closet was very small also, but if you don't need to hang much up it's fine. There is free coffee or hot water in the lobby at all times because there is no coffee maker in the room. There was no fridge in our room either. There is a continental breakfast downstairs in the morning. It was on until 9:30 am during the week. We got there at 8:45 and it was slim pickings, so you would need to make a move early for best selection. I did manage to snag the last yogourt and last banana, so it wasn't bad. There were still plenty of bagels and coffee. The parking was very convenient in the backyard of the hotel. It was 15$, plus taxes made 17$, so fairly standard for downtown. That's daily. There weren't a ton of spots, so perhaps in high season you have to park in a nearby lot instead. There is a whole foods market right next door, so you can get nice snacks and drinks there. We found a very nice all you can eat sushi restaurant about a 12 minute walk away on Yonge street near Davenport. Aji Sushi I think it was called. Very reasonable, fresh and tasty. The Japanese reception man at the hotel recommended it and he was right. The location was very good, and is very close to the ROM museum. We would stay there again for sure, if the price was similar.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience.

When I got to the room however I was shocked at the dated and well worn decor, dirty scratch marks on the wall greeted me upon entrance as did the faint smell of cigarette smoke. To be fair the room was pretty clean and comfortable although for some reason the cable for my television was ripped from it and sat on my table top...didn't make for the best reception so now I sit writing a review on trip advisor instead.

Bloor St and Avenue Road remind me of Madison and 5th in NYC. So many great high end stores. We had a shopping weekend and with all of the money we saved on our hotel we spent on clothing at the high end shops! The hotel is definitely old but very clean with such kind staff. I was told that the hotel is under new management and that the rooms have all been deep cleaned and brought up to date. I enjoyed the breakfast that was included and of course the coffee. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.
