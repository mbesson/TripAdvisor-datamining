{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Very Practical The hotel, or should I say, anything diferent, because you have a little kitchen in the room, to make breakfest or anything you would like.Right beside the river, has a incredibel view of the Arno river and the town bridges, and it\u9e93s a walking distance from any point, has a lot of restaurants near by. And the staff is just great.Silvia and Paul are very nice, you can ask about any information, places to eat, where to go, how to go.The room is simple but clean, the only problem is the size of the shower, very small, indeed.

This hotel or better said this small suite is in the heart of the city. It is walking distance to everything. You don\u9225\u6a9b need to take a single bus. It has a lovely kitchenette in which you can make your own food. They leave you a basic breakfast necessities. You can cook in that kitchenette and enjoy dinners with your family. It saved us a lot of money because we didn\u9225\u6a9b dine in restaurants instead we saw a lot.Since it is a flat they clean the bathroom and leave you the breakfast and make your bed. But they don\u9225\u6a9b clean the entire room, which was OK for us. There is a gentle man by the name of Paul who lives in the same apartment and would help you with anything you need. He speaks little English but don't be fool by his angry look he is a very good-hearted man.If I go back to Florence that is THE PLACE I would stay in. This was the best accommodation of our entire trip.", "Date": "Sep 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR156692202", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Massi_Ravasi"}, {"Content": "Great location great position about 10 minutes walk from the Duomo - less to the Uffizi - and handy for walks on the other side of the river. Appartment was plenty big enough for family - two rooms plus bathroom. Kitchen could have been better equipped, but as there are some great restaurants on the streets nearby that wasn't a problem. Good value too.", "Date": "Aug 31, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR677883150", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "OnTees"}, {"Content": "Excellent Location For A Trip To Florence First - I need to make something very clear about this hotel. It is an apartment that is Serviced and therefore you should not go here if you are looking for a 24 hour desk service, room service, breakfast room in the morning etc.My wife and I wanted a nice quiet place to stay, where we would not be bothered by cleaning staff etc and where we could organise our time and not be pestered by breakfast timings etc. This fitted the bill brilliantly.The room was more than adequate - featured a very large double bed (two single beds put together), a nice seating area (table and chairs) and a kitchenette. The kitchenette has all the relevant utensils (you will have to boil your water in a pan,unless you bring a travel kettle) , a fridge/freezer and a two hob electric burner. This was more than sufficient and allowed us to get supplies from the local co-op and store them happily in the fridge. We made a few lunches ourselves and I even cooked pasta one evening.You are not bothered at all by any staff - they come in at some point during the day to replace your towels/toilet paper and re-fill your breakfast basket and that is it.The breakfast? Someone on another site complained that it was just pastries? Well - I am not sure what they were expecting - after all - they can hardly lay on sausage and eggs for you on the breakfast table and leave it there for the whole day! The dried toast, cakes and biscuits they give you are fine and they also supply you with 4 cold juice drinks every day.Really good - location, just enough out of the way to not be right in the middle of the tourists but still near enough to the main attractions (between 1 and 2 miles to everything) to make it possible to walk to places. Downsides?The desk is only open 9 to 6.00pm so make sure you get there in time on the first day to check-in, we just made it on our first day there!Our apartment faced into the courtyard part of the complex. There is room for parking but it is incredibly tight and we occasionally had (after 10.00pm at night) the noise of some poor unfortunate visitor trying to squeeze their car into a sardine like space and having to repeat the action time and time again! Over all - brilliant location, great room - just what we wanted and I would highly recommend Florence.", "Date": "Jul 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR497112765", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "IanBerridge"}, {"Content": "Loved Residence San Niccolo Great apartment within walking distance to the heart of Florence. The two-bedroom apartment and studio kitchen was great! We enjoyed buying from the local grocery store (a few blocks way) and enjoyed evening snacks and wine! Beds were very comfortable. Our apartment was viewing the Arno so there was some noise from mopeds etc (but after a busy day, we had no real problems sleeping!) Shower was small and similar to what you might find on a US Recreational Vehicle or motor home. The rest of bath room was roomy. Careful using the washer/dryer. Only one on-site and It's a new environmentally friendly type. Uses less water but takes about 2 full hours to wash one load, and then another 2 hrs to dry.
