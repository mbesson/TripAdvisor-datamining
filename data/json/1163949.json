The Masa is a cheap clean place to stay, right at the heart of Kuta. It is within walking distance to most things. Surrounded by a large variety of cheap eats and drinks. I have stayed in 5 star places and there is really very little difference, with the exeption of the price that you pay.", "Date": "Nov 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR630620348", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "happytravelling40"}, {"Content": "masa was great We are a family of 5 ,children were 5,9 and 13years. We stayed for seven days in interconnecting rooms at the front of the building opposite reception on the second level we had very little noise from the gang, a/c was fabulous, no parties, polite shy staff,security was very casual,breakfast is small but ok for us. The rooms were large, cleaned every day, towels were great but you need a beach towel or for trips out of hotel etc had our own safe in the room. We didnt eat in the restaurant other than breakfast. Other guests were from all walks of life and generally friendly. We loved the location and the cheap eating places in poppies lane, balinese people in the lane were very memorable and my kids handled the tight squeeses with cars,motorbike's and walking in the lane very well.Next door was a mini shop accross the road was hairdressers up the gang numerous shops who did our washing very cheaply easy walk to the beach, matahari's or anywhere you need to go, we booked with the hotel over the internett and had no problems.This is a old somewhat ugly place but cheap and clean and I would stay their again. Lots of cats hanging around but thats Bali! Other guests said some of the back rooms smelt a bit funky but we were very happy with ours. $100 aud in the peak of school hols to sleep six is pretty good.", "Date": "Oct 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR398748792", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "nene66"}, {"Content": "Can't take a shower Great location, very small rooms. Stayed with daughter, sister and niece. Had rooms next to each other right by the pool. Hotel was breakfast included, although after first morning won't eat at from the hotel again. Breakfast was cold (left over??) No food or drinks available at hotel after 11am! Kids ordered home delivery of McDonalds most nights!. Shower head in room were so corroded water came dripping out instead of spraying. Had to wash hair in basin. Beds were very hard. Great place for stop over. Mostly surfers staying there leave luggage in room and island hop. I guess it really is you get what you pay for. Very cheap accomodation, and you can really tell.

This hotel is located in the middle of Poppies Lane 1 in Kuta Beach, Bali, which is convenient to both the beach and nightlife. You can walk to either in about 7-10 mins. There are lots of restaurants around and anything else you want including shops, travel agencies, tailors, etc. The property itself is pretty nice with two large pools. Breakfast is included in the price, which is not bad. There is a laundry service on site that charges per item. You can also get your laundry done at one of the many places on Poppies Lane 1 for about 7K-8K rp per kilo. The rooms themselves are relatively clean. Would be nice if they changed towels daily - I think it was every other day. Also, we had to kill a few mosquitos - seems the cleaning staff left the door open while cleaning which let them in. The shower is fine, though the shower heads are due for a replacement. The pressure is not great. The beds are a bit hard, but that's to be expected in SE Asia and at a budget hotel. In general, this is a good location if you want to do beach activities and be in close proximity to nightlife and are looking for a budget option with an AC.", "Date": "Sep 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR759619653", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "smartcooki"}, {"Content": "\u9289\u693c\u5157\u9289\ue0a0\u4eb4\u9357\u62cc\u8584\u9428?#x201d;   showReview(21398962, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR806469519", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "parai"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d1163949-r21834767-Masa_Inn-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "1163949", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
