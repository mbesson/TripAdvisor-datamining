What prompted me to write this review, however, was an exceptional experience I just had with a staff member on the front desk. I called on two separate occasions, recently, to arrange for a room for my daughter. I spoke with the same staff member both times and the level of customer service I received was absolutely amazingl! She was personable, professional and caring as we worked through the details on the phone, and she treated my daughter the same way during her stays. She made me feel so pleased that I had chosen this location, and confident that I will do so again in the future.

The check-in process was made difficult with 3 trips to my car for the information they wanted to confirm. They wanted my drivers license so I went to get it. The second time around my credit card which they already had on file wasn't swiping through their system so they made me go get another card from my car - second trip to my car. And then the third time I had to go print my discount card I used for a discount on the room rate. Their were three of us staying in a double bed + pullout sofa bed room. The room was cozy itself. Their were black curtains - so if you intend on sleeping during the day - good luck. The room temperature was fine and controllable. The view was alright at the 17th floor looking down to Montreal downtown. The location was great since we were in the core. Parking rate was $25 which was reasonable. The parking was not connected to the Marriot hotel from the inside so we had to walk from outside each time we wanted to go to our car in the freezing weather. The mezzenine room had computers and a printer (with no paper at the time of us requiring to print something around 4pm on a Saturday). We did not call to have it replaced though. It was re-stacked by Sunday morning. The lobby and elevators are a bit small compared to what I am use to. Overall the hotel was cozy, but service was not the most efficient. The prices for the rooms were reasonable making it worth the amount we paid for being in the core downtown. They charge $20 extra for an extra person in the room. Breakfast was included in the morning from 7am-10am which had many options from fruit, pancakes to yogurt. Beds and washroom were cozy.

So there was a total of 4 of us, with two rooms. When we arrived. Parking sucks. We had to do valet because the parking lot was so small we didn't even know how to park our van. And on top of that, we believe that while our van was parking downstairs for the 3 days we were there, someone scratched our front bumper. I don't blame the hotel for this..it could've been anyone..but that did happen... Any who.. Once we parked and made our way to the front desk, they staff was great! They gave us connecting rooms side by side. They have cookies waiting for you too during the afternoon hours:) Yum! The elevators were tiny.. But I expected that... They have breakfast included in your room fee so that s great because everyday was something a little different, so we were glad they changed it up! My fianc\u00c3\u00a9 loved the waffle maker! I loved the raisin toast! The location is amazing!! You're literally 2 blocks away from St. Catherine's road, where all the shopping happnes. And you're a stone throw away from the entrance to the underground malls. Another thing we liked about staying in downtown was that we were able to WALKZ EVERYWHERE!!! It s pretty great! Since the drivers in Montreal are really aggressive! Granted..sometimes we walked REALLY FAR away... But it was good exercise because we ate way too much!! The rooms were very clean, the beds were somewhat comfy... I like a firm bed... They had great tv channels, we had a little kitchen table chairs, and sitting area. I really liked the room. Although we got two double beds instead of just one queen. We didn't complain though it was good.

Very well maintained. The location was close to metro and bus routes which made it easier to get to Old Montreal or other destinations around the city. CONS: The main issues seemed to be that hotel does not really have the infrastructure to comfortable handle the number of guests that it can hold. For instance, there were 3 very small elevators (one of which was typically dedicated to housekeeping staff) serving 23 floors. This meant that there was usually a line waiting for the elevators and this could sometime take more than five minutes. Also the breakfast room was always crowded and it was very difficult to get a seat. There was no assistance with bags at the front door loading/unloading area.

Took it because this is a family weekend for my wife and I just wanted a low-cost clean place to sleep that has great Air Conditioning. Before I start. PEOPLE, Air Conditioning is such an important aspect of the enjoyment of any hotel to many people especially during the summer months. I LOVE air conditioning and it really bugs me that of the 100's of reviews of hotels I have read, there are hardly any comments on air conditioning. Please, state how you find the quality of the air conditioning so other people who might want to stay at a particular hotel will know what to expect in terms of the quality of air conditioning. 1) Air Conditioning: It works PERFECTLY. And as I stated, I love a cool room. 2) Cleanliness: Clean as can be. Everywhere. 3) Bed: It's a king size, but the mattress is a low quality brand. 'Springy' might be a good way to explain it. 4) TV: Big plasma screen. Since it's Montreal Quebec, there is not a whole lot of English channels. Not the hotels fault. It the quebecois separatists. 5) Work Area and Internet Access: Work area is good, decent sized table and good chair. Internet is included in the price and it's fast. 6) Kitchenette: It has fridge, small stove, freezer, dish washer, and microwave. But I'm Jewish and eat out :) This is what I would call a budget hotel. And for a budget hotel, its good. I am a very fussy person. I would not stay in any hotel less than the quality offered here. So when you read my posts (my handle is Adnauseum) you'll know you are reading from someone that knows what is good and what is not. If you are looking for a clean, efficient comfortable room in Montreal for a decent price, I recommend the Marriott Residence Inn. It's right smack downtown with lots of restaurants and action all around.

The hotel is perfectly located for taking in the festivities of the race. It is located on Peel Street, which is blocked off just down the road 100m. They have a big outdoor party there. They bring in many exotic cars that you can look at. It is only two blocks away from Crescent Street, which is the main party area for the F1. Great restaurants. During non peak times, it is about a $40 cab ride from the airport. There is a Metro/Tube/Subway station a one minute walk away which opens up the rest of the city. Very well located for this. You cannot buy any tickets at the hotel, but they are readily available at the station. The attendant at the station spoke perfect English and was very helpful for us (and friendly as well). The hotel: I would rate this hotel a solid 3 star, maybe even 3.5. The rooms are quite large and the one we had included a kitchen. There were a couple of bar stools in the kitchen which allows you to eat at the counter. The rooms are in need of some updating, as it has been quite some time since they were renovated. The room was very clean and had a large LCD TV (one of the biggest I have seen in a hotel). The bathroom was somewhat cramped, but contained a full bath tub with a good shower head. They had a window type air conditioner which was not bad. Usually they are too loud for me but this one was relatively quiet. The staff was very friendly and helped us out tremendously during our stay and always did it with a smile. They have a relatively small lobby (actually very small). There is a small sitting area. There is a breakfast room on the second floor (first floor if you are European). The breakfast was not that great. It is a little bit more than a continental and included a spot to make fresh waffles, had yogurt and toast. In addition they offered poached eggs, sausage paddies (not so great) and hash brown paddies. There were also several juices, coffee and tea. Of course during the F1 race, every hotel charges almost double, so I cannot really comment on the value on this trip. I think if I were staying during a non-peak time, the value would be good. I would stay there for sure if I were to visit Montreal again.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNice for a short stay\u201d", "Author": "paddling_kiki", "ReviewID": "UR113112856", "Content": "4 of us shared a room with a kitchen for a sporting event during October.

Wireless internet is configured properly and does not create problems with any email accounts as is common with many hotels these days. Work space is adequate. Guests all seem very nice and this is a plus with the RI brand - more down to earth guests. Cons: Loud, even on the 18th floor the street noise is enough to keep me awake. Smaller room than most Residence Inn properties I stay in. Bed is terribly uncomfortable for me - hard as a rock. I am used to Tempurpedic at home and this bed is killing me. Food is lame compared to most Residence Inns. Last night they had some lettuce, tomatoes, pinto beans and store bought tortilla chips and salsa. Today was a little better - burgers with the same skimpy salad items. Breakfast was a little better but not what I'm used to seeing at an RI property. Elevators are tiny and slow - I got tired of waiting and actually walked down 18 flights of stairs this evening. There isn't anything terribly wrong with the hotel. I don't think the staff is wonderful as some have claimed. They had opportunities to go the extra mile for me and never did. Neither did they make life harder for me than it needed to be.

The Manager on duty helped us to see that it would be very difficult to make our flight. Then when we had arranged to get an earlier train back to Montreal, the manager told us we could leave our bags at the hotel while we explored Montreal, even though we would have been at a hotel in Quebec City for the previous two nights.

Breakfast was fine (if not a little repetitive) and I've never seen eggs done like that before but was great to fill up with before heading out for the day. Themed nights with chilli and BBQ were also satisfactory. We did see the strange woman that wanders about but she appears quite harmless. The seating area on the roof was closed indefinitely which was a bit of a disappointment as if we needed to sit outside and read then we had to go round the corner to McGill Uni. Make sure you walk right up Peel street to the top of Mount Royal. Very steep, loads of steps but a great view from the top.", "Date": "September 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "halifax", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel in the Heart of Montreal\u201d", "Author": "nighttraveller23", "ReviewID": "UR39081101", "Content": "Went to Montreal to see the hockey game between Ottawa and Montreal and was not surprized by how nice the hotel was was well maintained a great price and the staff was of great help.

I had asked for extra pillows, a room on a high floor and an early check in time as well. On arrival (noon), we had everything but the roll-away which showed up 2 minutes after we got to our room. Our Room: Very spacious and clean. Even when we had the couch pull-out and the roll-away set up, there was still ample room to move about the room. The kitchen was fully equipped, which was nice. Bathroom was clean, albeit a bit on the small side. Carpet looked clean as well. The beds were quite comfy, and the room had windows that actually opened! The Staff: All the staff were friendly and approachable throughout of 3 night stay. Breakfast: The continental breakfast was excellent. Even when the hotel was sold out, the breakfast room never seemed crowded, and it was easy to get what you required. Hotel Location: The location in Montreal was FANTASTIC. A 5 minute walk down Peel street put us at the Centre Bell. 5 minutes west on Sherbrooke or Maisonneuv put us at restaurants, bars and shopping. Parking: Parking was acceptable. It was an extra $20 a night, billed directly. It was valet parking, so you simply dropped the car off and went inside. *TIP*: There is a hotel only parking spot infront of the hotel - zip in there, check in and THEN take your car to the end of the block (500 feet) to get parked. Internet access: Simply put..... Horrible. We had wireless internet in our room for about 2 hours total of our 3 day stay. The 3 computers in the business lobby weren't fairing any better. It was frustrating when we were trying to print out maps for sight seeing, food etc etc. Overall: I would ABSOLUTELY stay at this hotel again the next time I'm in Montreal.

After reading numerous stories of rudeness and various other complaints about hotels in Montreal we decided on the Residence Inn based on good reviews and our positive experiences at other Residence Inns. Needless to say we were not disappointed. We arrived about 6PM on Friday night and were promptly checked in and helped with our bags. You can park in front of the hotel for 15 minutes or so to load and unload, then pull around the block to the Marriott garage ($19 per day). The hotel was busy this particular weekend for a couple reasons. First, folks took a break as it was Labor Day in Canada as well as the US. Second, I suspect many parents were helping their college students check in to nearby McGill University. I agree with other reviewers about the niceness of the rooms, the facilities and the breakfasts -- all good. A couple recommendations for Montreal first time tourists (as we were). The Grey Line tours are a good way to get oriented to the city. You can book through the front desk and they'll pick you up and return you to the hotel, although as we discovered it's only a five minute walk to where the tours depart. If you can get one of Lester's tours you won't be disappointed - we took the 6-hour city tour. The Rue Peel Metro stop is a block away and is a good way to get around ($9 for an all day pass). Language: we don't speak French but had no problems as everyone speaks English - although sometimes reluctlantly. I found that a Bon jour and Mercie go a long way. Parc du Montreal is a wonderful park very close to the hotel up Rue Peel. Work your way to the top of Mont Royal for a good workout. Although the hotel will grocery shop for you, that service is only available Monday through Friday, and it would be nice to have a grocery store nearby. If you want to venture out Marche Atwater is the place to go. There's a farmers market for fresh fruits, veggies, seafood, etc. Next store to the market is a Super C market which will have everything you need. It's about a 15 minute drive from the hotel.

My room smelt like urine when I kept the A/C on too long. The carpet was probably clean but I didn't like the color because it made it look dirty. The bathroom wasn't that pretty but it was usable. My room was small but thats probably what I signed up for because it was cheap for me.

The assortment of food included scrambled eggs, crepes, waffles, potatoes, cereals, yogurts, fruits, bagels, toast, croissants, coffee, juices, and more. There are also some complimentary PCs in the breakfast room with internet access as well as a large flat panel TV. The only negative feedback about our stay and the hotel in general are the elevators. There are only 3 elevators for the 24 floors, and one was out of order most of our stay. Many times we had to take the stairs in lieu of having to wait several minutes for the elevator to arrive, and most of the time when it did arrive, there was not enough room to fit.

I drove to Montreal and used some old and limited canadian change I had for the pay meter. I was told I could then park in front of the 15 minute zone where I could bring my bags up to my room. I was also told I needed to take all the necessary valuables out of the car before bringing it to the valet at the garage around the corner. Well I circled around the block for about 15 minutes until I found a spot in the 15 minute zone. I needed to quickly bring my bags upstairs. I was told once I brought my car to the valet, they keep the keys for security purposes. Therefore each time I wished to access the car I would have to ask for the keys. Well I found this to be a hassle and an inconvenience, but fortunately didn't need to access my car until my departure. I found the room to be nicely air conditioned, fairly spacious and clean and in good condition. The kitchenette was a nice amenity to have. I kept juice and water and food in the refrigerator. The hotel made an arrangement to give me a room away from the elevators, and the room I had faced away from the main street and bar. So the room met my basic needs in that it was quiet and comfortable, and the staff delivered my request which I appreciated. The hotel is located almost midway between the visitor center and Mont Royal park, and a half block from the Peel metro station which is very convenient. My opinion is that the more exciting (\"happening\") parts of town seem to be a bit further east near McGill, Place Des Arts and the Latin Quarter with many restaurants shops and stores and entertainment there. The breakfast buffet was good. There was a wide selection of cereals, bagels, pancakes, make it yourself waffles, juices and fruits. One morning I arrived (almost too late) at 9am and had to wait for 5 minutes or so to get a table, since the room was packed. The wait staff seemed to be working and cleaning tables as fast as they could. My advice is to arrive early for breakfast if you can. The staff is generally friendly, they can speak and converse in fluent english. They do say hello and smile when walking through the front entrance. I had a couple of issues during my stay. One day the maid showed up to clean at 545pm (while I was taking a nap), which was much later than I had expected. I had arrived back to my room after a long day of hiking up Mont Royal to find the sheets unchanged and room uncleaned and it was running out of towels. I spoke with the front desk and requested the maid arrive during the morning instead of the afternoon. Well the next day the maid arrived no earlier than 1pm. The front desk apologized for this but this did nothing to change the results. Maybe I just had some bad luck but be aware of some poor maid service. In addition one day I got locked inside the bathroom. The bathroom doorknob was loose. I panicked and started banging on the door for help but suddenly realized I had my cell phone with me. I found my way out of the bathroom on my own after 10 minutes. The bathroom had no telephone. I bought a rice krispies snack downstairs from the lobby and paid the front staff, then noticed 20 minutes later that complimentary cookies were available in the lobby. It would've been at least a courtesy to remind me about this. Ok I'll let this go. Please remind yourself to read the information they give you at the begining of your stay with times and services available. Otherwise you probably won't get a reminder unless you ask specifically. You may find yourself climbing the stairs during heavy traffic times because the elevators are small and slow moving up and down 23 floors.

And to top it all off, if you get back to the hotel between 4:30 and 6pm you'll be welcomed by a plate of scrumtious cookies! Now THAT's service! The lounge has a television, books and an internet station, or you can choose to relax in your room where free wireless internet is available as well. The cleaning staff, did an amazing job! Some even went as far to fold up clothes that I had left out. The bathroom and kitchen were always clean! They even did my dishes... Everyone was so pleasant, and you could tell that the staff and the \"residents\" were all happy to be there.

We had to carry all our luggage out of the hotel and walk around to the back of the hotel to get to where the vehicle was. Very poor setup. I only found this out by coincidence. Also my husband was attending a course at Mcgill and I was hoping for a late checkout and all 3 times we've staying there they would not give me past 12:00.

This hotel was a huge breath of fresh air. We were on the 18th floor. The room was fabulous. Large, bright and airy. Modern but cosy decor, a very well equiped kitchen area and lots of storage space. Nothing remotely tired about it. The bed was huge and wonderfully comfortable. If I had to find a fault it would be that the bathroom is small in comparison to the rest of the room, but was still an adequate size. We found the hotel staff very courteous and helpful, both on reception and in the breakfast room. Breakfast itself was excellent, even more so as it was unexpectedly included in the rate. There was a very good choice of food, although it does get very busy and some people are very aggressive in a buffet situation! The pool and gym on the top floor seemed very well kept, though the pool is more of a plunge pool than a swimming pool. Not particularly big. There was a great view from this floor too, as well as some sort of outdoor rooftop bar, but we did not utilise any of these facilities over our 4 day stay as we were far too busy. The hotel is in a great location. We ate in excellent restaurants every night and none were more than a 5-10 minute walk away.

The room was spacious and very clean. Bed was fine - not quite as luxurious as a Sweet Sleeper but I was paying about 60 USD less a night than previous Sheraton. Bathroom fine. Decent shower. Free WIFI internet here which is very much a plus for a business traveller. Have to admit that it's probably my personal bugbear with many high-end hotels - rip-off charges for broadband internet connections (a service on which they must make a huge profit margin generally!). Kitchenette in room is really handy - with microwave, hob, large fridge and dishwasher. If travelling on a budget or for an extended stay - it really does make it more like being at home, rather than a hotel. Sometimes you just don't want to eat out! Breakfast was fine - can't complain when it's included in the rate. I've been charged USD 20 for similar buffet spreads in other hotels. Small gym and pool on the top floor - OK to keep up with exercise regime - but there's also a big sports school opposite - at which I guess you could get a day membership if you were really keen.
