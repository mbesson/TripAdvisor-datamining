I read the reviews but the price was decent and I told myself I wouldn't spend much time in the unit. Let's start with the outside. It's a two-story building and apparently these people don't understand the concept of a broom. I was on the second floor and it was REALLY dirty (I wouldn't walk barefoot outside). Cig butts, bottles, beer bottle tops - all in the same place the entire time. They leave the linen room open 24/7 and it is REALLY filthy. The linen room! (Ceiling is also coming undone). Ok now for the unit - I had to be moved because my air didn't work. It was cooler outside than in my room, and there was 1/2 inch of space on each side of the unit to the wall (you could see outside if you were looking at the AC). Ratty towels, EVERYTHING was unplugged - TV, Cable, lamps. WTF? Second unit - funky smell. No lamps near bed. Some sort of white stuff in the corner of the room. Entry lamp and shower lamp did not work. Oh, and in both units, the bathroom window COULD NOT BE LOCKED.Mattress was really, really old. There is a \"buddy wall\" between units and the people stating next to me kept trying to get into my unit. Real safe feeling. Someone also tried my room from the outside door one morning. \"Do Not Disturb\" signs? THEY DON'T HAVE ANY. Let's go back outside. The second floor walkway to the right side of the building is sagging badly and when I walking on it (just once) I felt like I was going to put my foot through it. The floor is basically made of wall paneling from the 60's and is in bad shape. You can visibly see the rot. Heck they aren't going to clean it why bother thinking of replacing it? Yet the \"proprietorship\" (who I think own a few of these old-school places) drives the most expensive cars and scooters. They have no plans apparently to actually put profits back into their business. There are mattresses standing up outside, old AC units piled high, there is broken glass frames in the back of the building. I will be calling both the Chamber of Commerce and the Health department tomorrow. I don't need someone's private-hair in my bed sheets, thank you.And in the second room they sent me - thanks for cleaning out the trash from the last people. My advice? Search tyour couch for change, cash in that 20 dollar lottery ticket you won six months ago - and spend the extra 15-20 bucks a night for SAFE and CLEAN room in an establishment that does it right. I know of a few but this isn't a commercial - it's a warning.", "Date": "September 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHorrible\u201d", "Author": "Sonson786", "ReviewID": "UR139033300", "Content": "Spare yourself the trouble this place is horrible your not even getting your money's worth I just couldn't do it I had to go sleep in my truck.

We found out about The Cabana Motel online prior to going down and booked the room a few days in advance. We really didn't think it was all that bad, considering the price was affordable for us and we are not all that picky. It was very close to the beach and boardwalk and was just fine for us. I didn't notice any mold, smells, dirty carpets or plumbing issues. The only things that I can say that weren't good about the place were the rickety, old, wooden steps that we had to walk up to get to the 2nd floor to our room, the fact that the key we were given wouldn't open our door so we had to go back to the office and get the attendant, and the ants that invaded the room during the night (I woke up and found them all over the nightstand and next to my head on the bed). Other than that, the room pretty much provided everything we were looking for...a place to crash, watch cable, keep a few drinks in the mini fridge, a microwave, and a nice, little view outside the bathroom window which faced the beach. The bed was really comfortable, too. I'd go back again, and I've heard they made some renovations since we stayed.

We got cheap. When we arrived there was a steaming mad lady in the lobby who wanted her money back. NO REFUNDS. I went to look at the room prior to signing at her urgency. It was ok and would do for my next to nothing budget. Room had paint peeling and by the eve of our departure the ants found us. I read other entries and for a couple days I walked in and out confidently saying the ant reports were bogus-NOT. When we arrived, the fridge wasn't plugged in and the AC was not on, so it was steaming hot and we had luke warm juice because there was no ice machine. We were told to go to the shopping center and buy a bag of ice for 2 bucks and it would not have fit in our freezer. The freezer didn't freeze either. Carpets were worn as were draperies. No table to sit at but the room was small so there was no place to put a table anyway. Pool area was dilapidated and there were broken light fixtures. The pool could use a good cleaning too. The pool is only open from 930am to 7pm and you have to ask to have it unlocked. It's a shame because with an over haul that place would be awesome. It was one block from the beach, less than that even. The maid service is full of non-English speaking staff. When you ask for 2 flat sheets, you get one. They do not use fitted sheets so bone up on your bed making skills that require hospital corners. We had slid sheets off the bed by the morning after we arrived and once I made the beds utilizing my nursing skills, they didn't budge. The nitwit maids only gave 2 towels and 2 washcloths to use between 4 people. They didn't provide trash bags in the cans and the GUEST has to REMOVE TRASH ON THE DAY OF DEPARTURE from the rooms. No one was rude and I did get a weird feeling from the place, so I locked up valuables in the car when necessary. It also attracts kids with kegs. Monday through Friday it is quiet and it's safe.

Check out a lot of sites and this Motel kept coming up - being touted as \"clean, family owned and operated, yadda, yadda\". We didn't want something right on the beach of boardwalk because of the noise and this one was a block in - pretty pictures - family run - sounded good enough - we just needed a place to sleep! It was the most disgusting place I have ever stayed in. Unfortunately, they've got your deposit up front and as you're checking in (and second guessing you're plan because of what you're seeing in person - and it has nothing to do with the photos on any web site checked) you see the small sign that says \"no refunds\". So you might as well grin and bear it and stay the night. Right? WRONG. DON'T DO IT! RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN. Entering the room - (I'll forget about the outside - it is a motel near the beach - the elements have beaten it to death) we put down our bags and sit on the corner of the bed, which immediately falls to the ground. The carpets, wall paper/paint, curtains, etc., have not been changed (or probably even really cleaned) since the 1960's. I am NOT exaggerating. The bathroom - OMG. Worse than the public restrooms on the beach/boardwalk. Again, NOT exaggerating. Oh did I mention that when you close the door you can see daylight coming through all 4 sides? The worst - the ants. I saw one ant before we left to go to the boardwalk. We came back with an italian ice - almost finished. Walked into the room - put it on the night table - changed my clothes - turned around and the cup was COVERED with ants. You could not tell what was under the ants. There were so many, there were layers and layers of ants on top of the cup, in the cup, climbing up the table to get to the cup. Went down to the lobby (which was closed) - to get someone to come look - figured then there was no way they could refuse me a refund. But alas, nobody home!
