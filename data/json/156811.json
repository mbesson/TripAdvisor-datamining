I emailed the hotel directly and the prices were dropped by a over a third! And this was February, not exactly low season... So overall a really fun place, unusual brightly-colored art throughout (a lamp made from Ken & Barbie dolls!!) and a lovely tile staircase to our top floor apt. (the room we stayed in was actually called the 5th street apartment) Room was almost as fun and colorful as the lobby, very large for a hotel room, not brand-spanking new but clean. Bed was a bit hard but we actually slept really well. Was a kitchen area as well that we did not use but looked decent enough. Large bathroom with tiled walk in shower. Safes in the room were nice to have, everyone there was friendly but you never know... They also let us keep our bags in their lobby after checking out as we were taking a late night bus. (valuables were kept in locking pockets of course) It is quite noisy though, (I did end up using my earplugs) so that was a downside. Definitely makes you feel like you are part of the boisterous atmosphere of Playa del Carmen which is what's it all about there anyway! Still would definitely recommend to appreciators of unusual art or anyone looking for something a bit different then the resort-y, Americanized hotel experience.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNoisy rooms where I felt unsafe as a woman travelling alone\u201d", "Author": "Cjlaura", "ReviewID": "UR124311867", "Content": "This hotel was located in a good place however I found it overpriced, the bathroom was rusted where there was metal and my room was so loud at night I couldn't get to sleep until 3am.

The hotel ambiance gives sophistication, class, and style! There website CAN be a bit deceiving--- you may think you are getting a budget cost for what they portray in their website photos. However, the budget rooms are more basic than the rooms pictured on the website. With much research, I knew I was staying in a basic room for the budget price and expected budget accommodations. The hotel does offer nicer rooms at a higher price that face 5th avenue although I cannot review those rooms for I didn\u2019t see them. The hotel offers a handful of budget rooms that face 8th street (balcony has a view of the water). At $42 USD a night in May, I got a deal! I\u2019m a backpack, budget traveler and was generally pleased with the room-- which was roomy and had more than the basics. The lobby is colorfully decorated with modern folk art. The inside atrium is filled with tropical plants and gives a jungle feel throughout the hotel. Open the door from inside your hotel room out to the indoor garden filled atrium and feel as though you are in a jungle. Open the door to your balcony and see 5th street, 8th street and a view of the sea! We were located on the 2nd floor, which had no elevator (most small hotels do not), yet the stairs seems a bit slippery from the super gloss paint on the wide stair railings. I was sure to watch my hands in case I lost my step! After reading previous ratings on trip advisor, I was sure to be prepared for the noise, yet the mariachi band I heard only played until around 8:30-9pm and I stayed over a weekend. I did buy earplugs, just in case, but didn\u2019t need them. Noise was not an issue and considering the location, I expected it, but slept great! The room was very clean, had a double bed, attached end tables, a big side table by the door, a cushioned chair and lots and I mean LOTS of storage for luggage- big closet! The room also came equipped with a TV, ceiling fan and A/C, which is rare for budget accommodations as well. The bathroom was roomy and also provided a lot of room for storage. The private balcony is small (most are in Playa)- enough room for a couple people to sit and people watch. The hotel does have a nice restaurant. We did have nightcap glasses of wine one night and found them to be a bit pricey, but excellent service. The hotel does have a small pool, but was under renovation upon our visit. Upon checking out I did experience some confusion \u2013 Upon email reservation, I asked them to bill me the total amount of my stay \u2013the full amount via credit card. Come to find out they only \u201cheld\u201d the room with the credit card- this was a bit confusing and I was unprepared to pay since I thought it was already paid- so be specific in your reservation and bring copies of emails, confirmations, etc. I had a brief email confirmation from them stating that the reservation was all set- I interpreted that as them taking my request and charging the full amount- this was not the case- lesson learned on my part. Overall, I highly recommend the budget rooms to anyone who appreciates a great bang for the buck. Budget hotels are harder to come by in Playa and this one certainly ranks very high in accommodation expectation at a steal of a price!", "Date": "May 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vermont", "Title": "\u201cNice in pictures, not so much the reality\u201d", "Author": "VermontTigerlil", "ReviewID": "UR14897665", "Content": "I stayed here with my sister, and we booked it in advance based on the pictures on the website, which make it look really nice.

We took a day trip over to the mainland from Cozumel to see the mayan ruins of Tulum and Coba. When we returned to Playa later that night we were exhausted and stopped for food before taking what we thought would be the last ferry back at midnight. We were wrong. The last ferry left at 11pm. So we found ourselves stranded on the mainland for the night. We knew of a few good hotels in the area which we had looked at before booking our trip, but they either had no vancancy or cost way too much just to sleep there for a few hours before we caught the first ferry back in the morning. Hotel Jungla Caribe was close to the ferry and seemed cool at first with its funky design. We had great difficulty communicating with the front desk receptionist as we spoke little spanish and he spoke no english. We needed a wake up call at 5:30am and weren't sure he had understood. Surprisingly, we did get a knock on the door on time, but it wasnt expected. As we were being lead to our room, we were put off by some partially eaten room service food that had just been left on the ground out side the door to an adjacent room which nobody had bothered to take away. Our room was rather bare and we had some initial difficulty with the lock. The walls were white and plain. We liked the black and white checkered floor, but the furniture was dilapdated and tacky. The airconditioner didnt work properly and was noisey. The beds were big but a little hard. The bathroom was spacious but dirty. The water never got above lukewarm and we were shivering through our shower just like the other reviewer mentioned. Ample towels were provided however. All in all, I felt safe but slightly uncomfortable. If it weren't for Jungla Caribe we would have probably spent the night on the beach...which might have been more fun in retrospect though not as safe i suppose...However, I wouldn't stay here again unless I was traveling on a tight budget (and its really not even that cheap for what you get) or planned on trashing the room or something. It does seem as thought it could be a lot nicer than it is and its sad that the staff are not maintaining what could be a funky affordable place to stay.
