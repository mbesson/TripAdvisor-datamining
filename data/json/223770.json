The hotel was def packed, however, the staff was able to handle it pretty well. The indoor pool was cool you can tell they've been maintaining it. Staff was incredibly helpful. We were with some children and the floor got a little noisy at night. Wife called the front desk and staff was able to regulate within a few minutes. The best part was how close it was to the highway.

However, after this experience I will NOT stay at a Sleep Inn again. Of the 7 hotels we stayed in on a recent 10 day vacation, this was by far the worst. We booked reservations from the road 3 hours before arrival. Our rooms were hot and musty smelling. The air conditioners were turned off and apparently had been for many days. We left the property for dinner so our rooms could cool off. There was trash in the hallway and the floors looked as if they hadn't seen a vacuum cleaner in weeks. While eating their lame excuse for breakfast the next morning we watched another couple wait for almost 15 minutes for someone to come to the front desk so they could checkout. This was 8 am in the morning and there was NO ONE at the front desk. When we attempted to checkout 30 minutes later we had to wait 10 minutes. No apologies were given. The management of this property simply doesn't care. They don't care about their customers. They don't care about service. They don't have any concept of professionalism.

My family and I stayed there for two nights. Unfortunately, someone in my extended family chose this location. Just after checking in, we decided to check out the pool. It was small, musty and the smell of dead chlorine was over-whelming. No way was I going to put my infant in there! Then we head up stairs, which was on a non-smoking floor. That rule was, obviously, never enforced. In my parents room, the shower door was broken and barely hanging on the hinges. Their alarm clock was flashing and we couldn't get it to stop. Our room was off the chart awful! Our sheets had cigarette burns. Our daughter's sheets had lipstick stains. Our alarm clock was broken, too. Our shower had a hole in the side of it AND I walk in to find my husband not alone in the shower...there was a baby ROACH in there with him!!! Other fun experiences...the police were called to break up a physical fight in the parking lot. Our car alarm was set off the first night. Our hall mates loved their music loud and their bass high. They also liked to party in the hallway, which is probably why the hallway smelled so smokey. There were multiple power outages, at least 6 and there was not a storm in the area. And to top it all of, my husband is a graduate student and needed the internet, but of course it was down. After numerous phone calls to the front desk and their IT provider, the problem was never resolved. We took pictures for all the other TripAdvisor lovers out there! Go to Memphis, but please, do NOT stay here!", "Date": "September 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGood place to stay\u201d", "Author": "teechur", "ReviewID": "UR16542270", "Content": "Most Sleep Inns are the same design.

At the light intersection past it, you could go a few blocks and find some restaurants and stores. This seems to be a quiet place. The only negative was that the maid had forgotten to put any bath toiletries out, but since I bring my own, that didn't matter much. (I could have gotten them from the front desk if I wanted).

Cons: The non-smoking floor smelled musty, moldy and rank. The walls are VERY thin. The light in shower was broken. The management didn't do anything about the rowdy, drunk college kids who were loud and obnoxious at 4 in the morning. Empty beer bottles were overflowing in the trash can at the front door - what a great first impression! The management didn't ask how our stay was. The sign in the bathroom that said, 'save our planet...' didn't mean a damn thing, as our towels that were hung on the rack (as requested) and new-barely used soaps were replaced everyday.
