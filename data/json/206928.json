But it turned out okay for us. Just keep in mind that this is not a hotel in the common way tourists might think of one. It is partly an apartment, partly a hotel. Many of the services you might be used to in a regular hotel are not available here or they may cost extra, like everyday maid service. The rooms are smallish and yes, a bit tired. But if you don't care for bells and whistles and can fend for yourself, this is not a bad hotel to stay at. The room we got was quiet. There is a kitchenette with cooking utensils, plates, etc. There were a couple of times when we were just so tired from touring Barcelona (Barcelona is exhausting) that we were happy to be able to put together a quick, relaxed meal in the room. The Carrefour supermarket is literally across the street and the not to be missed La Boqueria open market is not much farther. You are right in the middle of La Rambla and in between 2 metro stops. If you just want to use the Aerobus to and from the airport, the bus stop is about a 10-minute walk. I felt safe in the hotel.

Great location makes it worth staying here.\u201d", "Author": "chriskre", "ReviewID": "UR123892035", "Content": "Booked this directly thru the timeshares/hotel website with a nonrefundable rate in Euros. If you find it cheaper on expedia or orbitz etc, you will probably get the same ugly rooms as booking direct so look for the cheapest room you can find. The hotel/timeshare is in the thick of all the reasons why you want to go to Barcelona as a tourist. Located directly on the Rambla street, you can walk to Plaza Catalunya, the gothic quarter and many other touristic areas of the city. There are lots of restaurants and shops nearby. A grocery store is right across the street. Easy to get a taxi right outside the door. The hotel itself has friendly staff albeit with that Catalan aire about them. The rooms do NOT look like the website pictures. We had 3 rooms and none of them looked even remotely like the nice remodeled rooms. I suggested to the front desk clerk that they should be honest with the pictures of the rooms because it's deceiving. The rooms are very small. We booked studio doubles. The beds are very low to the ground. The carpeting is green as are the bathrooms. There is a small kitchenette in the rooms with a micro, minifridge, burner, dishwasher, toaster, percolator etc. No washer and dryers in the rooms but there is a very expensive laundry in the basement. 5 Euros to wash and 4 Euros to dry one load of laundry. Soap is included as it's a front loader. There is a security guard there day and night chasing off the local kids coming into the lobby to steal candy and probably more. The resort has wi-fi only in the lobby area. Internet is wired and free in the rooms. The television is small but has cable with just 3 English language channels and it's only news channels. There is a small awkward safe in the closet. You can't fit a netbook in it just a wallet and your passport. The elevators are tiny. If you have luggage you can only fit one person, two max in these elevators. There is a breakfast area but we did not try it. There is too many nice restaurants around the resort to eat in the hotel. There is no concierge here but they are helpful in steering you to the area where you can book tours. You will not get many toiletries in this hotel. Our soap dispenser was broken and they only gave us a tiny little round hand soap and a little bottle of shampoo and bath gel for two people. Luckily there is a market across the street to stock up. We paid for daily maid service. You have to pay extra to get it since this is really an aparthotel or timeshare. The cost is 6 Euros. They wash the dishes for you in the tiny dishwasher. All in all it was a convenient stay. I wouldn't want to stay any longer than we did which was 5 days. If you are staying longer find a place with a little more luxury or bigger rooms. The rooms can be claustrophobic after a week. The hotel is rated 3 stars.

We were a little short on time and got a travel agent to do the legwork this time. They recommended an apt in the Citadines and off we went. I had heard so many horror stories about pickpockets on las ramblas that I had myself worked right into a state despite the fact that I am quite well travelled. The cab driver from the airport even voluntarily warned us about pickpockets on this street. As we approached the hotel for the first time in the cab with so many people on the street, I admit I was intimidated and wondered if perhaps we had made a mistake in booking this hotel. My fears were misplaced. The Citadines Las Ramblas has a large welcoming entrance ideally located close to placa Catalunya. The desk clerks were friendly, patient and helpful. The rooms were nothing fancy but large by european standards and had everything we needed. Small dishwasher, kettle, stovetop, toaster, TV, bidet and great water pressure. There is wifi on the 1st floor with a small comfy seating area to sit and enjoy it. The hotel was so perfectly located that it was very easy to walk to the waterfront, to tons of shopping, to way too many great restaurants, and a very short distance to the main square where you can catch the bus touristic or anything else your travelling heart desires. The Mercat de la Boqueria is just across the street and a few steps down. There is also a grocery store right across the street and Gelato right outside the door. Check out was so easy we kept questioning them if that was all. Las Ramblas is like one big carnival. The street is filled with human statues at night. One of our favorite things to do was to leave everything in our rooms but bring a pocket full of change with us which we would drop into the buckets of the different human statues and watch them animate. We had no problems with pickpockets whatsoever. Just don't be rubbernecking with a giant back pack and camera slung across you. Get where you're going and you'll be just fine.

We proceeded to line up to check in with our luggage. We had been very vigilant with our possessions while travelling through Europe prior to arriving in Barcelona. We no sooner had put our luggage down beside our feet, when we realized that our backpack was taken. It happened very quickly. No one else in the lobby witnessed it. The hotel security guard had just left his post at the front door and gone to the luggage storage room on the mezzanine level when the theft occurred. The hotel staff were very uncooperative after the incident happened. Infact, I had to ask them to call the police on 4 occassions. Finally, on the 4th request the front desk clerk called the police but we were told the line was busy. She pulled out a map of Barcelona and told us how to find the local police station by foot and to make a report. We were never offered a telephone to call to cancel our credit card which was in the backpack. Neither did the hotel staff ask what was taken and what was the value. We lost all our cash, iPad, camera with over 500 photos of our holiday, prescription glasses, tour tickets, chargers and cables, converter, holiday DVD's, and souviners and mementos. The hotel needs to have signage posted in the lobby to warn guests that theives are active in this area. The security guard needs to remain at his post in lobby and not be acting as a bell boy. There is a surveillance camera in the lobby, but we were told that only the police could view video tape. After filing our police report at the local station and waiting in a line up with many other theft victims, the police told us that they couldn't come to view the surveillance tape for 2 days. When we returned to the hotel we informed them that the police wouldn't be coming for 2 days. They said that the manager could possible view the surveillance video, but the manager wasn't working that day and no one else had the password to access the video tape. Later that day, when we were walking through the lobby, the front desk staff told us that they had viewed the video tape. What happened to the police and manager being the only ones being able to look at it?? They did say that there was a young man on the tape, looking very much like a typical tourist, who lifted our backpack. We never were allowed to view the tape at any time. I would recommend to anyone staying at this hotel to BEWARE of theives working in the lobby and perhaps other areas inside the hotel.

The children slept in two beds that popped out of the living room sofa (it took a while to figure out how that worked, but then it was simple to do each day). We liked having a small kitchen area, and there is a large supermarket right across the street to buy coffee, breads, cheeses, fresh fruit, and other things. La Boqueria (the local market) is also just a couple of blocks down the street. We were on one of the upper floors that faced the front of the hotel, and we had a great view out over the city. We thought the location was ideal. We enjoyed walking down Las Ramblas each day, seeing the many talents of the street performers. One can escape the crowds by walking down any of the narrow streets that branch off into the Gothic Quarter. We loved the Gothic Quarter, especially the residential neighborhoods that are further away from Las Ramblas. Also, Plaza Catalunya was only a few minutes walk, where you can catch buses or trains that will take you almost anywhere you want to go. Train tickets can be purchased at the underground tourist office in the center area of Plaza Catalunya.

When we got to our room, we found that instead of a queen bed, we had a sleeper sofa/ roll-out bed contraption. Also, if you register online, selecting non-smoking serves no purpose. We were informed that all rooms allow smoking, and the suites that have real queen beds cost twice what our room did. We were able to get moved the next morning to a room that didn't reek of tobacco, and we just lived with the sleeping arrangements. We quickly discovered that we wanted to stay off the Ramblas after about lunch time. The saving grace of this hotel's location is that right outside the door is an alleyway that leads out the back of the building into the medieval quarter. We exited in theat direction 80% of the time when we went out. There's a lovely little courtyard in back, with Roman ruins right there behind the hotel. Fantasic! The other great saving grace was the concierge, was the night desk clerk, who gave us one fantastic restaurant recommendation after another.

The room was well equiped with everything we needed including an iron & ironing board, safe, dishwasher (although sadly the instructions were not in English so we just bunged the tab in and put it on!) even a bottle opener which was great and is often forgotten abroad - loads of room for storage and the bathroom was a good size, although the shower needed de-scaling. As everyone else has said the location is the best thing, right in the heart of all the action so everything is easily reach-able from here.

I booked one large apartement with a bedroom, and we actually got two adjoined double bed bedrooms, each with a double bed, no sofa or living room here, but two bathrooms and ttwo small kitchenette. Comfortable beds here, not as hard as the ones at the Citadines we stayed at in Paris.

We were immediately pleased with the cleanliness of the lobby and friendly service from the front desk. Our room was a single, located on the 2nd floor. At first we were disappointed to not have a view of the street - our room was along the side of the hotel and looked out onto an adjacent building's rooftop and a few apartments. However, this turned out to be a bonus because it was the quietest side of the building. Our windows were similar to patio doors and you could step out onto the rooftop if you wanted. There was a maintenance man who came up to the roof occasionally to water the plants. Usually we had our window open when we were in our room with no concerns. The room was spotless and felt like a small apartment. The Citadines does not have daily room service; if you are there at least 7 days, which we were, they come by mid-week to clean and provide fresh sheets, towels and amenities. Otherwise you can either do laundry in the facilities provided or request fresh towels at an extra cost. It was nice that the hotel provided everything you need for at least one day (soap, shampoo, toilet paper, dishwasher detergent) until you can get to the \"supermercado\" - which is conveniently directly across the street. The Citadines chain provides a sofa bed, so you have a sitting room during the day and pull-out bed at night. The bed was so-so in terms of comfort, but I've certainly slept on worst. The room also had a mini stereo system and small TV, large mirrored-door closet, shelving unit, pull-out dining table and 2 chairs. The kitchenette was equipped with a small sink, microwave, mini-dishwasher, mini-fridge plus all dishes, pots and utensils you could possibly want. The bathroom was much larger than expected (for Europe) - a full-size bathtub with handheld shower and sink with large granite counter and storage cupboard. We were also impressed with the service - we could not get the climate control to work, and a maintenance person appeared within 5 minutes of us contacting the front desk. You can't beat the location - we walked everywhere from this hotel and the metro is about 2 minutes up the street at Placa Catalunya, where there is also a tourist information office. Although the Rambla is known to have its \"seedy\" elements, we never felt unsafe and security people \"guardia urbana\" are usually within sight. We walked the Rambla many times day and night with no incidents. All in all I would say that this hotel met North American standards and certainly was one of the best \"3-star\" places we have stayed at.", "Date": "May 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cGreat area, but you can do better\u201d", "Author": "LoLoChicago", "ReviewID": "UR14869079", "Content": "We stayed at the Citadines apartment hotel in Barcelona in February 2008. I booked this hotel at the last minute as the apartment I rented with VBRO had a fire and was not available. Booking was easy and we rented an apartment for 1-4 persons, at 225.00 euros per day for a 5 night stay. This is more than an regular apartment would cost, but I was booking at the last minute and wanted the ease of a hotel with apartment convenience. The apartment is laid out nicely, with step-out large balcony with large sliding glass door. The bedroom is good size and has a sliding door to the living room/kitchen/dinning area. So when the bedroom area is open it gives you a spacious feeling. The bathroom is spacious but shows stains around the faucets. In fact the room is very worn, cigarette burns on the rug, tired out looking furniture, we could not connect our IPOD to the older TV, so we could not view US movies that we brought. The hotel has free internet in the business center. This hotel is located right on the Ramblas 122, and in the middle of everything. Since it was February I figured that it wouldn\u2019t be too frantic and noisy on the Ramblas at that time of the year. The Ramblas was busy, but you are in the middle of everything, across from a grocery store and down a few steps from the famous market Sant Joseph market. The Bari Gotic is diretly behind the hotel so we could walk to all the sites, and we were able to walk to the Placa Reial and the restaurant La Fonda late and we did not have to wait in the long line to get a table. Taxis stopped right in front of the hotel, and the Placa de Catalunya is a 10 minute walk, where you can find the Bus Turistic, buses to the airport and the metro. The major problem was the noise from the small square park-like area behind the hotel; this is also a street that is one of the entrances to the Gothic area. There were 2 caf\u00e9\u2019s that stayed open late and the noise drifted up as well as the cigarette smoke to our room. But the absolute worse was the hippie type homeless people and their barking dogs that hung out in the park all night long. There were a few mentally ill homeless people who would scream randomly at night. Because the buildings were tall the noise traveled up to our 6th floor apartment. The air-conditioning was not on yet, but the room was stuffy so we were opening and closing the window all night long. We almost checked out early, but the convenience of the location and the fact that I had already booked this as my 2nd choice we just stayed. We live in a urban city area so our tolerance for city noise is very high. Plus side: We could walk out see some sites, come back rest, have a bathroom break and go back out again, that is a plus when you are doing all the tourist things. Having the kitchen was very nice for us, as we shopped at the market and could eat snacks and a meal in our apartment. But for the price I can not recommend this apartment-hotel. If you are looking for a hotel you can definitely do better. If you are looking for an apartment you can find better on line and cheaper on line.", "Date": "April 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin,", "Title": "\u201cSuperb - This is not hyberbole\u201d", "Author": "Barry Lynch", "ReviewID": "UR14865183", "Content": "Just about the perfect location..

Mistakes happen but the manager asked us to send a photo and other details.
