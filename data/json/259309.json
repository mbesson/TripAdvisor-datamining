The hotel is near 2 bus stations (5 minutes walk max), one of them linking the metro station Bologna (3 stations to the hotel or 15 to 20 minutes walk) and the other linking the city centre. It somewhat tricky to find the exact location of the hotel as there are no signs to guide you, but if you print the map from the hotel site, or search a little at Gogglemaps or the town transport company site or just ask a local dweller there will no problem to find your way. After 1-2 days that you have learned to walk around easily there is no problem with the transport. The hotel is under some kind of refurbishing and the main entrance is closed so you have to enter from the side. The reception staff is VERY helpful and ready to answer every question about the surroundings, directions how to get everywhere even some tips where to eat at night in two lovely local trattorias. The room was quite spacious (larger than Ibis and smaller than Novotel), quiet, with new furnitures, there was stuff to make coffee and tea, 2 small bottles of water and 1 large, enough wall sockets, a soft bed with 3 soft pillows and a small safe inside the large closet. The bathroom was spacious, well equiped, clean, there was a hair dryer and 3 towels for each person. The only drawback I can find is that the large bathtube have a glass that is not covering all the side and if you are not careful you can easily pour water all over the place! In general I think that the room was refurbished recently and was looking brand new adding that little extra to make a guest happy with his selection. The breakfast was good enough mainly a \"continental-style\" breakfast, but I suppose there was a room to add some more bread types and 2-3 italian delicacies to give a local aroma. I stayed for 5 troublefree nights, not far away from the city center, in a quiet and lovely neighbouhood, I enjoyed my stay and I definitely recommend this hotel to everyone. P.S: Special thanks to the reception staff for helping us getting around, giving info about where to eat nearby at 21.00h and make a reservation for a tour at Tivoli (I can recommend this tour).

Location : here are the drawbacks.. the hotel is reachable only by bus or car. The subway station (Bolognia) is quite far away. There are several bus stops in the near vicinity ( Corso/Istria for Express Bus 80 to Piazza Venezia (direct); or Nomentana / XX April for Express Bus 90 to Termini).

The Neighbourhood where the hotel is located is very nice, only classy old buildings, superb villas etc. So.. maybe during summer, when there is also more daylight, the travel to/from the hotel to/from Bologna subway station, might be a pleasant walk.

As for tickets, our luck was with an italian girl that knew English and guided us to a farther shop that sold us the bus tickets. Between city centre and the hotel there are at least 10 bus station, so it's a very long way. The second day, we caught the same receptionist selling tickets to some other tourists. We asked her to sell us as well and she said she has not but her colleague finally gave us some.Helpful and friendly, isn't it?

Hotel staff was nice and welcoming even at the late hour. They all spoke English with us and were very friendly. We were agreeably surprised by the size of the room. It was a corner room on the last floor (6) with a beautiful large terrace where there was a table and four chairs. There was a third bed in the room in a removed corner, where the baby cot fit just perfectly. After the first night we noticed it was right below an air vent so we moved her cot closer to our bed. The room, linen and bathroom were all very clean. We left a tip for the cleaning person and they did a rather good job. Reception staff was extremely helpful during our whole stay. We appreciated being able to ask anything and they would try their best to help us out. There are lots of buses near by, depending on where you want to go. For the train station you can catch some direct buses a bit further from the hotel, reducing your time to travel to the centre by half. Italian breakfast (6Eur) is really limited and not worth if if you want to actually EAT something. Buffet breakfast (15Eur) has OK choice though slightly over-priced as there is nothing made to order. One night we came back late and asked the person at the bar on the 7th floor for a cheese plate. Although we were after hours the person prepared one and brought it down to us. We did a lot of visiting and we noted that public transportation is always packed whatever time of day so take a lightweight stroller easy to fold up! The Roma pass is really worth it especially because you get to skip lines on the first two monuments you visit. For the Vatican museum there are tons of scams out there so would recommend reserving your ticket on-line on the official website up to 60 days before going there.

Pros: Free internet, tea kettle in the room, a tub in the bathroom, and a reasonably decent and quiet neighborhood. Cons: Dirty walls, poor decor, small and cramped room, no in-room safe, and (worst of all) the air conditioning was not available for 14 hours each day from 20:00 to 10:00 the following morning. Basically, it was only available during the day hours when guests were out of the hotel. It was available each day, for a ten hours period, from 10:00 to 20:00. Once you got back to the hotel, at night, you found the air-conditioning had been turned off by the management. This went on the full week we were there. By the way, this was a particularly warm week, in late May. Basically, it is the management that decides about the guest's thermal comfort or discomfort. If I am not mistaken, in other hotels, it is usually a thermostat that says whether the temperature is comfortable or not. But, this is not the case in the Mercure Corso Trieste. When we complained about the lack of air-conditioning, the management simply ignored our complaints, and kept on repeating as if it were a mantra, that the air conditioning was only available from 10:00 to 20:00. Period! And that was it! That was the hotel policy and no one cared if the guests were thermally uncomfortable. Nothing could be done about that. Upon much insistance, the management informed us that, if we felt uncomfortable, we should open the windows!!! In this case we were subjected to the noise outside!!!

To an extent this turned out great because the hotel's neighborhood is relatively quiet and not swamped with tourists. I enjoyed the regular supermarket around the corner, the produce market on Saturday and the Mediterranean feel of this neighborhood. However...what you miss is exploring Rome at night. Rome is a crowded, noisy city packed with tourists and traffic. It would've been great to return to my room at the end of the day, freshen-up and return to the, now empty, streets of downtown Rome to (re)visit some sights. The room was spacious and clean, beds good, nice bathroom with bidet and shower/bath. What was NOT GOOD was the internet connection. The hotel offers WiFi internet provided by Vodafone. I found this system unreliable and way too expensive. Often hotels offer internet access in the lobby for free and in the room for a fee. But not here. Using one's laptop in the lobby was equally expensive as in the room. I was very annoyed by the lack of free/unlimited intenet use. Breakfast downstairs is very basic. And it's too bad there is no water boiler in the room especially since the downstairs lobby is not very cozy. And for anyone who wants to make use of the (free) bicycle...make sure you have some experience. Rome traffic is brutal and the hotel-bikes are not city-bikes but rather mountain-bikes. Make sure to get a good public transportation map at Termini as not just bus 84 but also other (express) buses stop close to the hotel. Information provided by the front desk is limited. Not a bad hotel and not a great hotel. Make a decision according to your priorities...

Bruno, who welcomed us at the front desk said, \"What language you speak? We can handle Chinese, Japanese, German and English.\" Although we were eager to begin speaking in our newly-studied Italian language, it was comforting to know that English was not only understood, but spoken very well. Bruno was of great assistance on arrival and throughout our short stay. The room was very nice, well appointed, spotless and well furnished with heavy curtains. On our arrrival at Roma Aeroporto, we were offered a ride to the hotel for Euros 102. Upon our horrified look, we were then offered the ride for Euros 80. However, we opted for a shared van for Euros 50, but had to wait until the driver had a full van. It suited us just fine as we weren't in a hurry, we met some lovely tourists and had an excellent tour of the city as we were the last passengers to be dropped off at the hotel. We did not have breakfast at the hotel, but we found a little bar that served panini and coffee which we were able to enjoy sitting at the sidewalk tables observing the comings and goings of the locals - partaking in (perhaps) their first shot of coffee for the day or their last puff of a cigarette before starting work. Unfortunately for us, our second day in Roma was spoilt by the visit by American President, George W. Bush. The city literally came to a halt with all levels of police, some with anti-riot gear, on hand. For dinner, we patronised the Pepi Verdi Restaurant for good food and good value, and it was a short walk from the hotel. From previous reviews, we did understand that this hotel was a little out of the way and, once used to the transport system, it wasn't too difficult.

The room was more than adequate with a modern bathroom and every night was quiet and undisturbed by noise outside or inside the hotel. Breakfast was good with the continental option much better than the cooked. There was no waiting for tables, everything was very efficient. The area around the hotel has some good places to eat. We tried four different ones - Pepe Verde on Viale Gorizia was a good budget choice, Belle Epoque on Via Ajaccio was excellent. Glicine e la Margherita on Corso Trieste is a little pricier with a varied menu but the real splurge was Da Ezio le Scalette on Via Chiana a seafood restaurant with most of the menu swimming in tanks, a great atmosphere and service. There is a bar in the hotel which provides snacks. There are plenty of shops around including a supermarket.

Once inside my room, i was reminded immediately of why I appreciate the Mercure hotels in Rome so much. They all have attractive contemporary decor, a good multi-channel interactive TV system and the most effective and quiet air con I've seen in Rome. Breakfasts were fine, good selection of fruit, bread, croissants, cold meats and cheese. The Mercure's attempt at a cooked breakfast (luminous yellow scrambled eggs and lukewarm greasy bacon) is less impressive. I'm sure they only serve this because they think the many US tour groups staying there would like it. The Mercure has a useful underground parking area, much less congested and easier to get in and out of than at the Mercure Piazza Bologna. I wasn't charged the 20 Euro per day for this, maybe because I paid the rack rate for my room. The surrounding neighbourhood is an affluent residential area, very safe at night. There are not many restaurants in the immediate vicinity, although there are a few pizza places a couple of blocks NE of the hotel.
