{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Look no further.... Whatever you do book this hotel. Search around for the best price, I found mine on Expedia.ca, but stay here!! For the same price as a 1-2* hotel plus parking my sister and I stayed at this 3-4* hotel that has FREE breakfast and parking and is only a few minute walk to the historical centre of Florence. Wonderful modern luxury hotel with everything from bathrobes and slippers to a flat screen TV and WiFi internet access.

The location is horrible. It's very far from the main sites and not easily accessible. Taxis also are not familiar with the location since it is a new hotel and hidden away. There is a lot of construction right outside of the hotel, which is primarily because it looks like they are building some sort of public transportation right outside of it. The walls are very thin, you can hear your neighbors and the people above you, which wasn't that great. The decor is nice and the rooms are clean and small. Overall, the hotel was okay. I wouldn't stay there again though if I go back to Florence but the AC hotel chain seems to be pretty decent. I might look into this hotel chain for other cities just not Florence.", "Date": "Jan 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR354271031", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "pochacco906"}, {"Content": "Skip it for now... Stayed here a few nights in June for Pitti Uomo. First, when we arrived there's construction all around so there was intermittent power. So AC surely does not stand for Air Condition. No power means no elevator and can't get into the room with electronic keys. The crew at the front were just raw. With no power not only were they not willing to watch our bags so we can cruise the town a bit, but no one offered to take our bags up. If I brought my kids, I'd be pissed. And they want 250 Euro's for this place?? Also, it's a bit far from everything, about 20 minute walk to the Duomo. Also, the wait staff in the restaurant are not friendly However, on the plus side, everything is new. Room is nice and modern. Gym is small, but roof top is nice just to hang out. Still, if I came back to Florence, I would select another place to stay. Not worth it.", "Date": "Jul 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR627595663", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Samwise001"}, {"Content": "Hotel very good, but some beginning bumps My husband and I stayed at the AC Hotel in Florence April 18-21, 2007. We originally had a reservation at the Hilton, but they had a political convention and had to move us to the AC Hotel. Overall, we were very pleased with this hotel. It is a very modern, chic hotel with lots of glass and clean lines. When we arrived we asked for a bellman. They told us they could call someone if we waited 5 minutes. We waited and a young man showed up. He didn't bring a luggage cart, but went to get it when we suggested he may need it. He was nice, but this request seemed a big deal for them, which should be normal for a 4 star hotel. The rooms are an average size for Europe (please note this is smaller than in US, so don't be disappointed.) The bed was comfortable and the bathtub was a nice surprise. The hotel has a complimentary breakfast which was fabulous. They had pastries, yogurt, meats  cheeses, fresh juices and choice of coffee. The hotel staff was very helpful. There were a few things that could have been better that should improve. It was a couple months old when we stayed and none of the taxi drivers had heard of it. The road is new, so the address doesn't help. Tell them to take you to the Porta al Prato and they will take you to the beginning of the road. It is only 5 minute walk to the hotel. You can walk to all the sites within 20 minutes or so, but after walking all day, it's nice to take a taxi home! We did have trouble getting a taxi from the hotel. There are no taxis in the area, so best to walk into the tourist area and taxi home. As stated in other reviews, the area is under construction and a bit of an eye sore. This will obviously change over time.", "Date": "May 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR301241734", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "MrsBerry"}, {"Content": "Very comfortable GOOD: nice modern, fresh and clean hotel. funky design with large communal areas and good sized rooms. the rooms also have very large and comfortable beds. rooms have a free mini bar with a selection of soft and alcoholic drinks. rooms are double glazed and have a/c. service at hotel was excellent with friendly and attentive staff. breakfast was served until late (10.30), and there was no great fuss made about getting into your room to clean while your trying to sleep (good for lazy tourists and busy business people). a little out of the main hustle and bustle so a great place to retreat to after a busy evening or day in the city centre, but still within a very short and pleasant stroll away from it all for when you want to go back for more.NOT SO GREAT: only real gripe is that the area surrounding the hotel is currently being re-vamped into a new and stlish business district so it looks a bit noisy and rogh round the edges. this will of course only be a temporary thing and there is not noise as all rooms are double glazed but thought i shouold mention it for those travelling within 2-3 months of the date of this review. it is only 10 minutes walk from the SMN train station, which is ok, but be aware that ten minutes walk through the streets of any italian city with all your bags can be an adventure in itself, (get a taxi for 10 euros and save the headache).", "Date": "Apr 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR226696762", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "RoseyEssex"}, {"Content": "muy muy lindo   showReview(22248260, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR338160795", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "tatianita10"}, {"Content": "Nuevo, c\u8d38modo y limpio       Ba\u5e3do", "Date": "Nov 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR316112528", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "ViliCanarias"}, {"Content": "Vaya disgusto, que recepcionista m\u8c29s malos   showReview(21542261, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR839332493", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "carabasa"}, {"Content": "\u6769\u621c\u552c\u9428\u52e9\u4efe\u9289\u6d96\u5110\u9289?#x201d;   showReview(20608472, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR890905730", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "\u9287\u4ff1\u501e\u9287\u4ff1\u501e\u9287\u00b0\u5011\u9288?> \u9287\u4ff1\u501e\u9287\u4ff1\u501e\u9287\u00b0\u5011\u9288?</a> </div>"}, {"Content": "Hotel de mucha calidad, pero muy lejos!
