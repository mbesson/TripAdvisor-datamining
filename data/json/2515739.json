It was adequate for our stay with good storage, recently remodeled, flat screen TV and plenty of bath linens and toiletries. At check-in we were given a complimentary drink in the restaurant/bar on the 4th floor. It has recently be refurbished and has a great vibe and interesting happy hour menu. It overlooks the San Diego harbor so it is hard to beat the view at sunset. The room also included a very simple breakfast in this space. The caveat to this hotel is requesting and receiving a quiet room. There is major construction on one side so your best bet is an interior room.

She booked the hotel through Living Social. It wasn't until we were on the road that I decided to check on reviews of the hotel we would be visiting. My jaw dropped at some of the first reviews that popped up. Expecting the worse, I was pleased that it was not as bad as some described. First off, this is a motel, not a hotel. The first room we were given was pretty clean. The lamp shade and some of the vents needed dusting, but the linens, bed and restroom were fine. The carpet and curtains, along with the art on the walls need some serious updating. It also needed some upkeep. One of the dresser knobs fell off when I tried to open it. The TV needed some adjusting. The picture was snowy on every channel but it was clear in my mothers room. The walls are so thin that you hear every plane that flies over and several police car sirens throughout the night. When we woke up in the morning, the power started fading, the lights and TV until it would blackout. After a few minutes, we realized that the bathroom light stayed on when the power went out (about 5 times). We called the front desk and in less than 5 minutes a hotel worker was there. We were trying to explain what was happening when the room blacked out in front of him. He called the front desk for us and we were given another room. This was a much bigger room than our previous room, but I would not say it was better. The door splashed guard on the bottom of the door was missing from both sides of the door, leaving a 2 inch gap of light and sound coming into the room. The room also had a glass wall/ sliding door separating the room from the bathroom. The bathroom window had no curtain or shading and the glass wall did nothing to stop the bright morning sunshine from showering us at 6am in the morning. I don't know if it was being on the 5th floor or the 2 inch gap on the door but the planes and sirens were 5 times louder. I did not get any sleep this night. The lobby was nice and the restaurant has a great view. The staff was also friendly.

We decided we were going to arrive a day early, so she booked a total of 3 nights there. Our first night was in another room type, than the room that was purchased on Living Social. We ask for the quite part of the hotel, and the girl at the front desk said that there was construction across the street, and she would put us on the other side of the hotel. She gave us room 305, which was directly across from the construction. We didn't complain because it was only 1 night. The room was very basic, with a sink but no microwave. The pillows in this room were soft, and more comfortable than the following day. We arrived back at the hotel early the following morning, and talk to the different person at the front desk about moving to the other room. He said he would call the room when it was ready. Around 2:30pm, the house keeping knocked and we told them we were waiting for our other room to open up. They let me know it was ready. We moved all our stuff to room 414. This room was a little smaller, but not a big deal. This room had harder pillows, and a microwave. After trying to sleep on the stiffer pillows, we called down to ask for softer pillows and the female at the front desk said that all their pillows were the same. Our room was facing the freeway, but we heard the freeway very little. The bathroom was nice size, but the sink was a pedestal sink, which made it hard to get ready. There is a sink in the room, which we felt was a big waste of space. Overall it wasn't the biggest room for the money, but it seemed clean, and we got a decent nights sleep. We ate at the Glass Door restaurant. The menu is very limited, but the food was very good. We expected the basic bar menu, but the food was much better than we expected. We got a salad with Lobster on it. There was a small amount of lobster, but it was a good salad. I got a Ribeye, and my wife got a chicken menu. We both enjoyed our meals. It is $22 to valet your car with the hotel, which is necessary because parking around the hotel is a pain in the butt. The biggest negative about the hotel is that the room doors open to outside. The hotel is open down to the basement garage, and you can sometimes hear cars going in and out in the middle of the night. The hotel is close to most things in San Diego. I am sure there are better hotels in the area because most of the area looks rebuilt in the last 10 years.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "la verne", "Title": "\u201cWorst \"Hotel\" Experience of my LIFE!\u201d", "Author": "sheri j", "ReviewID": "UR127685959", "Content": "Took our family to stay at this \"hotel\" over Spring Break. Our experience went from bad to worse at this hotel. Only 15 tabs of toilet paper were left on the one remaining roll when we first entered the room upon checkin. The pull-out bed wasn't made up (a request i made at time of reservation and at check-in). When we called down to front desk, they said that the housekeeping staff went home for the night (5pm) and couldn't accommodate our request. We then asked to please send up linens and toilet paper and we would make up bed. We had to make 3 calls to the front desk over a 2 hour period to have this done. The air conditioning unit in our room was extremely load (my husband said it sounded like a garbage disposal trying to clear a large amount of food) the lights in the bathroom didn't work. The next morning, we left the room at 9am and returned after 3pm. When we returned, our room had not been cleaned. We called to the front desk asking for housekeeping service to clean our room while we left for dinner. We returned at 6pm and room wasn't cleaned. We called down to the front desk asking for our room to be cleaned and guess what? The housekeeping staff had gone home for the day! But, they offered to bring up a vaccum so that we could clean our own room. Appalling! We asked to speak to the manager and learned that we were speaking to the manager! We decided to leave immediatly and demanded for our night stay to be removed. (we had planned to stay 3 days but couldn't spend one more minute, let alone spend another dime on this place!) The manager that we spoke to had no authority to meet our requests. When we checked out, the manager at the front desk was going back and forth from his roll at front desk to valet.

The Porto Vista Hotel is one of those places where you can have a great time if you know what you're signing up for. Know up front that you: Will pay $22 for on-site valet parking Are staying in an older, remodeled motel-type property Won't have a pool or hot tub May have a small room, without much of a view These seem to be the things that disappoint the most, especially when you're unprepared, and frankly, I set my expectations low. However, I had booked a very nice rate on kayak.com. So I was actually pleasantly surprised to find the Porto Vista was not the bad property some reviews had prepared me for. My sister and I were assigned a double room on the 4th floor, facing quiet State Street. The room was plenty big, clean and in good shape. While the furniture seemed to have been held over from before the remodel, it looked fine. The beds were quite comfortable, with soft linens and plenty of pillows. We had a flat screen TV, wet bar sink, microwave and refrigerator. The bathroom was clean and remodeled, with European style fixtures and stone tile flooring. People have mixed opinions on the large B/W photos adorning one of your walls, but I really liked it. There is free WiFi. It was somewhat flaky during our stay but great when working. Porto Vista seems to have a lot of different room styles, so we may have lucked out with one of the better ones. The roof has a great view, but otherwise there's not much going on. Most of the space looks like it can be booked for private parties, and it's closed off to other guests. The Glass Door is the on site restaurant, and it was nice. On a Saturday night, it was loud and crowded, so we didn't even catch a drink there. But it was perfect for an enjoyable Sunday breakfast, with creative dishes and a perfect view of the bay. The service was very friendly - from our server in the restaurant, to the front desk staff to the valet. Location is one of the best features - walk out the front door and you're a block from the restaurants and shops of Little Italy. We had dinner at Prep Kitchen, and it was wonderful. The best part was being able to stroll 3 blocks from dinner and be back at the hotel. It's a nice neighborhood for a Sunday morning stroll. Since it's also somewhat residential, you can take in a lot of neighborhood activity. We paid in the low 100s, and I thought this was very reasonable for what we got.

The King deluxe with the balcony had new toilet and bathtub and felt very fresh, bed was super comfortable with thick mattress, had refrigerator and microwave, there was some ocean view on the side of the balcony. The double queen room was large, had old toilet and on-floor-shower, but definately no mold and was clean. Mattresses were super thick. TVs were flatscreens and bright in both rooms. All locks and doors worked fine. The only thing we didn't like was The glass door restaurant which is kind of a separate business obviously popular with public, so we let them have it the way it is. Its not just overpriced, its uneatable. There's plenty alternative places to eat in the area. The other thing I liked was how quiet it was being a block away from India street.

The airplanes come close, but as soon as we closed our balcony door it was quiet. We let them pick us up at the airport and waited to rent a car while we did city stuff--so parking not a problem. 2. Beds are super comfortable. After walking around the city and Balboa Park we slept like logs. 3. Great to have a fun place for an end of the day cocktail--great view a bonus (Glass Door). 4. Spring for a larger room. It's still small but you'll be able to walk around. 5. Daytime management seems with-it, night-time staff not as much. But they did give us some towels and coffee when we found housekeeping had forgotten to clean our room(!) 6. It's not fancy. If you want fancy or you are really high maintenance, you'll have to spend more money! But it's comfortable and good for folks like us who don't care for cookie-cutter Holiday Inn places. In the end, my husband said, \"It's weird, because I wouldn't rave about this place but I'd definitely stay again!\"", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cNice Boutique Hotel.

Located right in the Little Italy district, we were able to park here and walk throughout the shops, parks, and restaurants with ease! The decor of the lobby and lounge/restaurant are really cool, and the rooms are well done. It is an older hotel building, so our room was a bit small, but for the 2 of us (plus our dog - it is Dog-Friendly, which was a HUGE plus for us!) it was all we needed to crash in while out and about. Regarding the room, the furnishings were nice! Artistic wall, flat screen & new furniture. It was small, and our room must have been close to some pipes, because we definitely could hear running water when someone else was using the shower. This was the bit that was annoying - the building is older, so the walls are not as sound insulated as some other places. In fact, one day we got back to the room for a break in the early afternoon and we could here construction (renovation?) that was happening on the ground floor (we were on the 3rd). Part of that is the courtyard openings of the hotel, so it was open to the parking, etc. on the ground floor. Service was good - and they made it easy for a dog to stay with you. The hotel is suited to allow dogs without it being a disturbance to others and easy to navigate the hallways/lobby. Little Italy itself is very dog-friendly, so this was a nice way to vacation. (A flat fee for the dog regardless of how many nights you stay!) There is a park (not dog-park) just to the East of the hotel, so easy to take the dog to do its duty. Little Italy had dog pick up bags all over the place, making it a great stay! I'll review the restaurant - The Glass Door - separately but lets say its worth a trip to the hotel just for the view, and the food was good! Overall, it was a quality hotel...good value for a great location. Walking distance (5-10 min) even to the harbor, the whale watching tours, and USS Midway aircraft carrier. Balboa Park is a short (5 min) drive away with all you can do there!

You can put the car away on Friday and not think about it again until late Sunday afternoon when you reluctantly leave. There are dozens of delicious and inviting restaurants within a five to six block radius. There is a row of unique boutiques packed with treasures to explore on Fir, right in front of the hotel. There\u2019s an English pub, a craft cocktail spot, one of the oldest dive bars in all of San Diego, the beautiful stretch of waterfront for walks/runs, a firehouse museum, cafes with perfectly brewed espresso, gelato shops\u2026 you get the picture. The creators of Porto Vista know they have a gem of their own and have maximized it with the Glass Door restaurant. That gem is the view. This is my single favorite spot to watch sunset downtown; you are just high enough up to take it all in, feel the breeze, watch the boats, look down on the neighborhood as twilight washes over \u2013 all while sipping your favorite glass of wine or cocktail. Well done PV, the neighbors say \u201cThank You\u201d. Take heed though, this means you\u2019ll have to compete with the neighbors for seats and if you show up at 5:30 on Friday you will probably not get an outdoor seat. However, there is a huge upper balcony that guests can enjoy. I\u2019ve seen pictures of weddings being held up there, so there is almost always room to spread out, even with a group of friends, you\u2019ll just have to hold off on that glass of wine until you can go back to the bar. The hotel itself is cute in that boutique sort of way. They\u2019ve definitely got a sense of style and are economic in the distribution of those touches. We got a room on the north side of the fourth floor, complete with balcony. They are spacious with a desk, wet bar, armoire, king bed and an arm chair. The bath was large enough for two to be in comfortably. The carpet, sheets, towels and sundries were what you would expect in a mid-range hotel (think Holiday Inn\u2026 just with style) \u2013 nothing fancy, but clean and suitable for a weekend get-away. Best of all, this is a pet-friendly property and very dog-friendly neighborhood (play park just a couple blocks away) \u2013 so your pet can have an exciting holiday with you! I was surprised that the hotel put such a focus on the modern design but left small, old-school tube televisions in the rooms. The front desk was abrupt in their guest communication style, but this may have been a one-off for us. There is a price to pay for this concoction of boutique style, reasonable price and neighborhood placement \u2013 that is the party atmosphere and late-night noise that is common with the groups of younger guests that fill the hotel on weekends. It will bother some more than others, but to me it was a small sacrifice for the long list of positives.

The remaining plaster walls are institutional blue.

If you have children, you will be at each other\u2019s throats within hours! The room did not smell fresh (I believe because they are pet friendly). Items placed within this small space include: Queen Bed (pillow top was comfortable), chest of drawers with a small (tube) TV on top, wardrobe with a small safe in the bottom, one night stand, clock radio, a table/desk with chair. Single sink area with mirror, full length mirror on opposite wall, coffee maker, and tub/shower with curtains (curved extended rod), shaving mirror, hair dryer stuffed in a bag hanging on the back of the bathroom door, iron and ironing board, and a few floor and table lamps. The wrinkled sheer curtains under the drapes offer absolutely no privacy, drapes must remain closed giving the room a closed in feel. We had difficulty accessing their internet and gave up. In the morning we walked to the Little Italy Saturday Farmers Market, and explored the area returning around 4:00p.m. to prepare for an evening out. The room had not been cleaned. We called the front desk and staff said that housekeeping cleans rooms until 5:00. We needed to change our clothes and shower so the first day our room was not cleaned. While showering, the showerhead snapped off due to corrosion. (see images) We called for maintenance who came and replaced the head while we were out for the evening. They also replaced a light bulb in one of the lamps that had been sitting with an open socket. If you need more space do not, I repeat, DO NOT accept rooms located in the central corridor of this hotel. Rooms around the perimeter appear larger according to the chart (see images) and probably more comfortable and perhaps nicer. You will have to write that review if you stay in those rooms. I do not plan to book at this hotel again and for my first visit to San Diego, I was very sorry American Express offered this hotel as a suggested place to stay. Even a staff person stated that the central corridor rooms reminded them of a youth hostel. The only positives I can offer is that the valet staff were the best!, the Glass Door Restaurant lovely, and the hotel proximity to Little Italy was perfect! These few pluses allow me to score this place with 2 stars. If you are on a very tight budget, are willing to accept a subpar room in a great location, and need a place for sleeping only then this is the place for you.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFilthy and noisy and WAY over priced!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Domb171", "ReviewID": "UR116386007", "Content": "Tired rooms with filthy carpets inside and mouldy ones on walkway.

A couple of other suggestions to improve things: 1) I would rather have glass and ceramic cups in the rooms the over syrofoam ones, 2) there should be a way to have the room ready upon arrival, rather than having to wait soooo long to be placed, it makes check-in take too long and 3) the elevator is too slow.

Shortly after the girly screams and hasty packing, we bounded to the lobby where the night staff was more than willing to move us to a different room on a different floor. The room we had then was quite nice-- spacious, clean, bed bug-free. When we discussed the issue with the hotel manager, he was more than willing to comp our valet parking (which, by the way, is about $22/day and there's nowhere else to park around the hotel). Unfortunately, his reasonable allowance did not cover the cost of our vigorous laundry-ing, dry cleaning, and the new suitcases that were required to fully eradicate the threat of bed bug infestation.

This hotel is run down and not worth half the price. We came for our anniversary and booked a junior suite. The first problem appeared before we even stepped inside the lobby. There is only room for one car in the driveway, so anyone waiting for valet or trying to get in to the hotel has to wait in the street with traffic backing up behind them. AND, it's $18 per night to park. Once inside, the front desk staff is not professional. Friendly enough, but our desk agent looked like he was on the tail end of a three-day bender. No uniforms, either, and no helpful directions to your room. You're on your own. The trip to the room was rather depressing as the interior rooms overlook a parking lot and the hallway carpet is badly stained. When we arrived at our suite, we just stood in the doorway, dumbfounded. More stained carpet, second-hand furniture, pictures inexplicably hung four inches from the ceiling. The \"whirlpool\" bathtub was sized for a child; I'm 5'6 and had to sit upright in it. Coarse towels that smelled of mold, a couch that looked reclaimed from a back alley in Compton, no bottled water or any kind of amenity in the room save for the small shampoo/lotion bottles and soap in the bathroom. Glasses or mugs were not even provided; if you wanted to avail yourself of the tap water, you had to get it from the sink and use a paper cup. But none of that was the kicker. At three o'clock Saturday morning, there erupted a racket in the hallway that sounded like Mardi Gras gone bad. Several people screaming, shouting, laughing, running up and down the hallways - this went on for nearly an hour before someone (I think it was another poor guest torn from sleep) got the gaggle of screaming twenty-somethings to shut up. Or perhaps they passed out. But in any other hotel, the management would have shut that party down in five minutes. I will say that when we informed the hotel manager the next morning that we were going to stay at the Andaz for the remainder of our trip, he was very apologetic and told me he'd give us a deal if we ever came back.

Again, I want to be clear, as this is a negative for me and my partner, this could again be a feature or positive for you and yours.

On Saturday (my first morning at the hotel), the cleaning lady knocked at my door around 9am and asked if I wanted my room serviced. I said no, as I had just woke up. She then asked me if I needed any shampoo/soap or whatever, I declined, and she left. But I didn't think that was it! My room wasn't cleaned at all for the day, since I guess they didn't bother to come back. Seriously - I don't know about other people, but 9am on a Saturday is pretty darn early to be asking someone if they want their room to be serviced. I assume housekeeping just wanted to finish their stuff early for the day or something, but it's pretty unacceptable the way this was done. Granted, it's really not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but it just irked me that housekeeping would wake someone up early, and then not even bother to show up again. BUT - now that I've vented, there are some great things about this hotel (I swear): +Location: Right in the middle of \"Little Italy\", the location is pretty awesome for San Diego. Close to the waterfront, a 5 minute walk from the trolley (which will get you around town), and of course Little Italy is a pretty neat place in itself +Clean & spacious rooms: Other than the above, the room itself was very clean and well maintained. Clean bedding, very clean washroom and properly dusted/vacuumed. The rooms were very decent sized as well, especially the bathroom which was quite spacious +WiFi/other services: The wireless at the hotel was really strong; it seems like they have a separate network for each floor, which means a stronger signal for guests. In addition, the shuttle service was great as well - the guy who picked me up from the airport was super nice and friendly, and gave some great info/tips on San Diego. Definitely a good way to start off the trip. Unfortunately I didn't get to eat the Porto Vista, but everyone raves about their restaurant, so I think it's definitely worth checking out if you can. +Quiet: Some people mentioned that it was noisy due to the nearby airport. Personally, I didn't hear any excessive noise (and my window was open). A little tip would be to turn on the (very good) fan/AC to get some white noise while you sleep. Some other things to note: -Not a big deal, but the TV sets in the hotel room were really old and fuzzy - it seemed like I was going back in time when I turned on the TV. Granted, I probably only watched 30 minutes during my entire stay, but still something that should be updated ASAP (in my opinion) -The \"motel\" vibe: From the outside, the Porto Vista looks like a \"hotel\". But once you go up the elevator to your floor, you get more of a \"motel\" feel (you can check out my pics to see what I'm talking about). It's not really a big deal, and really had no impact on my stay either way, but just something to keep in mind. -The fifth floor: I stayed on the fifth floor, and it was pretty silent. However, I would point out that they seem to have a pretty large outdoor lounge/sitting area on the 5th floor, so if there's parties or whatever going on there at night, I would imagine it gets pretty loud. I'd suggest getting a room on another floor just in case. Apart from the annoyance with the housekeeping staff, this is a pretty good hotel to pick if you're in San Diego. Great location, nice staff (apart from housekeeping I guess), clean, quiet, and generally a good value (I got an amazing price on bookit.com - $55/night). This isn't a luxury hotel by any means - it's pretty no-frills, with basic amenities. But it does its job and gives you a comfortable place to rest while you're in town. Would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend, but let's just hope housekeeping is a little less \"annoying\" in the future.", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cNice find\u201d", "Author": "calcoast75", "ReviewID": "UR95629555", "Content": "It's very close to the airport and it had a better price than the comparable hotels in the downtown area.

The second room was much cleaner and didn't smell like it was previously occupied by a chain smoker. The comforter looked new and the sheets smelled much cleaner.

I took a desk lamp plugged it into the hallway outlet. and moved it into the bathroom just so I could get some light. Apparently the wiring was messed up.

Plus there was no key swipe in the room at all. Room 502 had bad wiring it wasn't because it was an eco-friendly room...

From the looks of the website and the style of the hotel, I was pretty excited about my stay. It is located in a great part of town called Little Italy and it was very accessible to public transportation. I traveled late from LA to SD on a Monday and arrived at about 1 AM. The gentleman at the front desk was very helpful and directed me to my room. I did not book my own room, my company did, and was very grateful for that, until I entered my new space for the next 4 days. I was given a room on the 1st floor where the view out of my window was a parking lot. The room was tiny, the sitting chair was placed in front of the closet cabinet doors (because there was no where else to put it), and the light in my bathroom did not work. Too tired to complain, I went to sleep. The next morning, I let the front desk know about the light and they had fixed it by the time I returned in the afternoon. I spent 3 more nights in this single Queen room. My friend decided to come down and visit for the weekend, so I wanted to extend my stay in San Diego. I went and asked if there were any available rooms, possibly a King, for Friday night. Luckily, there was one available (even though there were 3 wedding parties arriving), and they kindly set me up. I walked back to my little cave and decided to walk right back out and ask if a King was available right then and how much more it was. I found out it was only $15 to upgrade and began my move up to the 5th floor (the highest level). I took the elevator and, as I exited, I caught the end of a beautiful SD sunset on the ocean. The King was nearly twice the size of the queen and I had a balcony with a partial view of the ocean. The next 2 night were soooo much better (although they do need to do an upgrade on their TVs....the one in the queen didn't even have a remote control!).

So I go back down and ask if the room was cleaned and why the light doesn't work, gave me excuses and then asked if i wanted to change my room. So I said yes please, changed to a room bigger and better, that room was ok, but the bathroom had mildew in the shower on the tiles. gross. Although the complimentary breakfast was pretty good in their restaurant on the 4th floor. weird though because through booking.com we got complimentary breakfast, and the receptionist that night gave us tickets, but as we were checking out early this morning Ryan said we didn't qualify for the breakfast.

About a 20 minute walk to the Gaslamp quarter. Parking was insanely expensive there (and hard to find), so we took a cab instead, which only cost $5.

The website shows nice blue trendy rooms. What we received looked like a updated Super 8. When we checked in, which was after the check in time, the front desk employee made a comment under her breath about our room not being ready. She made some calls and we were handed a key and sent on our way. No explanation of anything or \"Have a nice stay.\" When we found our room after waiting at the elevator for 10 minutes we realized it wasn't the room we reserved. It looked like an upgrade to a suite as it was much larger, but that was the only thing it had going for it. The room was large, but the furniture was mismatched and old looking. The mini fridge under the counter didn't work. All it did was flicker its light and it didn't cool at all. The sink in the \"kitchenette\" wobbled as it wasn't installed properly. The TV was actually a flat screen but it was way too small for the large room. The room was painted a nasty yellow color with gross green carpet. Nothing like the cool blue rooms on the website. There were numbers written on the wall that looked like they tried to scrub off, but didn't care enough to repaint. The bathroom looked like it was remodeled by a child. The tile floor was uneven, the toilet was tightened down so it also wobbled. The sink vanity was crooked on the wall and none of it lined up with the mirror or light. The tilling around the tub was a hack job and the shower was so badly installed that they had to the fill the large cracks between the wall and the surround with caulking. The bed was comfortable but the sheets weren't fitted. They just took one sheet and laid it across the bed. None of the towels matched. Some looked like old used pool towels because they had a blue tint to them. I could have sworn the website mentioned a pool when I reserved but none was found. When we checked in we received tokens for free breakfast during our stay. This was nice since there aren't many breakfast restaurants around. We ate there three days and the food got perpetually better. This isn't much of an accomplishment considering how it started, The first day we ate at 9 and all the food was cold like it had been sitting out all morning. The next day my eggs were at least warm and by the third day it was all warm. The waitress that helped us two of the days was actually very good and friendly. If it hadn't been free I would have complained. The valet prices were a little high but I didn't mind the 14 dollars a day because the parking situation in Little Italy wasn't very good. The valets were some of the best employees at the place so I didn't mind too much. The location is good if you like Italian food. Which we do. The proximity to Little Italy was great. It was just a one block walk to dinner every night and the local cafe. Mimmos and Filippi's were wonderful restaurants. The location close to the harbor, zoo, and Sea World were also pluses as those were the main attractions we wanted to see. The main thing they need to work on is their customer service.

AT BEST\u201d", "Author": "schrisanderson", "ReviewID": "UR76896085", "Content": "The Porto Vista Hotel is located in the 'Little Italy' section of San Diego, a quaint shopping and dining district. From an aerial view, the hotel is shaped like an open, square box with a separation wall down the middle, thus having two 'atriums' separated and surrounded by rooms on all sides. The lobby is attractive and the desk personnel were professional, personable and, to the extent allowed by the hotel's problems, very helpful. Two elevators are available - one extremely slow and noisy (doors needed lubricated), and the other remote and available only after climbing a flight of stairs (odd?). The hotel offered NO swimming pool, NO hottub, NO refrigerator, NO microwave, NOT even a pen or pad of paper. They took out the pool some time ago and replaced it with a meeting room that remained completely empty during our stay (no tables, no chairs, no anything). The hallways were covered with disgustingly stained carpet (except for the 5th floor concrete hallways) and lined with air conditioning units jutting out into the small hallway about 12 inches and many of these were rusting and in need of paint. The two 'atriums' did NOT overlook attractively landscaped courtyards but badly stained concrete parking areas. Parking was by valet only at a cost of $14 a day unless you wished to park on the busy street with various parking limitations. The Porto Vista is about 3 miles from the renowned San Diego Zoo and the primary reason we stayed here. There is a small rooftop viewing area that allows a nice view of the surroundings as well as the incoming and outgoing airport flights which fly overhead nearby. The beds are comfortable but squeaky, awakening sleepers in the room. The hutch and armoire dominate the small room, standing six feet tall and offering very little horizontal space and they dwarf the 21\" TV. The bathroom was adequate but the ceiling was peeling and rusty in places. Upon arrival, there was a large pool of water on the sink, perhaps from a leaking faucet, and the toilet required that the handle be held down until the full flushing process was complete. Lamps had switches on cords hanging behind furniture (difficult to see or use). The rooms were austere, completely lacking decoration other than the tasteless black-and-white whole wall depiction of a movie star. The room air-conditioner was effective and moderately quiet. Every footstep of the tenant above our room was heard. Cars honked their horns in the 'atrium' outside our door and the blasts echoed and reverberated loudly. Other than the small rooftop viewing area, the remainder of the rooftop was adorned with an open area lined with attractive seating, but all of this was behind a large padlocked gate unavailable to guests except at times undetermined and unmarked (no signs explaining when it was open). The 'Glass Door', the hotel bar overlooking \"Little Italy\" appeared to be nice and the happy hour and dinner menus were adequate. There was NO complimentary breakfast of any sort. I was informed that because I had phoned the hotel directly and made my own reservation, I did NOT 'qualify' for any such consideration. Huh? However, this was conveyed very politely and with an apology (what the management puts their staff through amazes me). Again, the staff were always gracious, what what they have to work with is appalling. Imagine in this day and age, a lodging establishment in a major city with NO pool, NO hottub, No refrigerator, NO microwave, NO complimentary breakfast. Other negatives were the seedy-looking hallways and atriums and bland rooms. We have stayed at hundreds of hotels include the Porto Vista as one of the BOTTOM TWO hotels we've experienced. The ONLY reasons this hotel rates even the one-star is because of location and a great staff. We overheard comments of other guests, especially on the elevator, saying that they felt 'trapped in this dump', because if they left, the 24-hour cancellation policy would require the loss of one night's room cost. We inderstood. In final review, other than the excellent staff and good location, this hotel is of VERY POOR quality and we would NEVER stay here again.

Their site made it seem like a great place. The problems started at check-in. It was busy, but one of the three front desk attendees was just going through paperwork and not assisting anyone. She was trained at the front desk job because she helped the guy that checked me in. So it's not like she couldn't have helped check folks in. I observed the other two to be rude to the people that they were checking in. Certainly no \"welcome - can I help you\" - lots of eye rolling. Very odd. So my first opinion wasn't great. When it was my turn, they printed out my info and the price on it was not the price that I'd gotten on their own website. I noted that in writing, showed the print-out email from THEM that I'd received, and spoke with another attendant and she said it was fixed. But the next day when I checked out, it was still wrong and another supervisor had to fix it. 5 hours after checking in, a pre-ordered item (offered on their own website) had not arrived in my room so I mentioned it when leaving for dinner. I had the print-out from the website and an email where I had corresponded with the hotel about the item. After trying to get me to do it, the front desk attendants finally said that they'd take care of it while I was out (my suggestion, not their offer to help). Upon returning to my room, it still wasn't there. Finally someone from the bar arrived with the wrong item, saying that they didn't know what I was talking about, asking me to pay double what I was quoted on their website for the wrong thing, and lots more eye-rolling. I think they must teach this at Porto Vista orientation because it runs rampant. The room was a king suite. It was a good size and the bed was very nice - slept well. But otherwise, it was pretty shabby actually - some new and some old stuff. Carpet was very shabby. The bathroom seemed nice at first glance but the toilet was wobbly, the soap dish spun around, and the shower control panel also was loose. Breakfast - very average. The toast was so hard the first time 'round that we banged it on the table when the waitress came by to show her it's rocklike features. Check out time is 11am. The maid knocked and entered at 10am thinking we were already gone. What??? Also, there was NOTHING in the room about the hotel. No info on the restaurant, what else was there, not even a pen. Communication is not the best apparently at the Porto Vista - between employees, between employees and the website, and between employees and their customers. Basically, just an odd stay. Maybe they'll get better, but for now, go elsewhere. I will say, that even though we had to pay $14 for the valet parking, the Valets WERE the most customer oriented of the bunch. They were friendly, fast, and knowledgeable about the area. We got concierge type info from them and NOT the front desk folks. All in all. It should have been MUCH better for the money. Their website seems to boast a much better place than it is.

We had double-checked with the hotel 3 days earlier when we started out by car and the front desk confirmed our reservation. We arrived road weary the first night and were told that they had only one of the rooms we reserved, the other two being the \u201ccozy queen.\u201d \"Cozy\u201d is an understatement. 2 suitcases and 2 men couldn\u2019t walk around the room. One person would have to stay on the bed to let the other move to and from the bathroom. THERE IS A REASON THE ROOM PICTURE ON THE WEBSITE IS OF THE CORNER OF THE ROOM. We repeatedly asked for a manager and were told none were available in person or by telephone and concessions could not be made with out the approval of a manager. We were concerned that the last arriving couple was not going to be able to fit in such tight conditions as he was 6'4 and 270 and needed a king bed to be comfortable let alone fit his wife. Despite much pleading and complaining about how we had confirmed, we were told they couldn\u2019t accommodate. We went to the car and searched another hotel nearby that had kings and went in to cancel the reservation and magically they had a room the third part of our party could have at no additional charge. If we could just be patient and accept the upgrade to a suite, all would be made good in the morning when a manager was available to discuss concessions. The next morning we were made to feel like we were granted the privilege of having our reservations honored but no apology was forthcoming for the terrible room that we had stayed in and for having to wake up extra early to have time to deal with the hotel management. Mr. Johnson, the front desk manager, told us that we would all be comp'd the parking expenditures for the poor customer service we had received and that the third couple would be \"allowed\" to stay in the suite for the remainder of the stay. During the stay the rooms were not well cleaned and refreshed, one room didn\u2019t get toilet paper restocked and we had to call and get some brought to us. After 3 calls, an extra roll was donated from another room. The extra toilet paper was eventually delivered to the wrong room. The mirrors would fog from the shower and reveal pornographic images left by a previous guest; the refrigerators would not cool anything to below 57 degrees. You could not drink the complimentary coffee in the room because there were no cups in one room and only decaf another. The TV's were a different brand and size in each room, all circa 2000, no flat screens, no digital reception and the color tint function was broken in our room so we watched TV in blue and orange.

This all culminated in a phone call from Mr. Johnson to my cell phone after leaving and 80 miles out of town telling us that it turns out since one of our party got the room they wanted, no one would be compensated for that first night and parking charges were added to two of our credit cards.

When we checked out, my wife was told that there were no pending charges on our credit card and that a receipt was not necessary. Fine. Later that day our friend received a phone call from the same manager stating that he had changed his mind and that since my wife and I had received the room we had reserved, he was going to charge us for parking after all. The charge showed up on my card today. I attempted to call the general manager but his voicemail box is full and not accepting messages. I have to wonder if it is full of complaints. A call later leads us to another manager who said she would look into the problem. We will see what the outcome of that will be. It is not about the money. It is about customer service.

We stayed in one of the bigger suites of the porto vista hotel with a colleague of mine. We were visiting for Comic Con so the location was a good hike from the convention center but the variety of restaurants in Little Italy made up for it I think. The room itself was spacious, it featured a separate living room with a full size pull out and also a large balcony. The layout of the room is kind of weird, the bathroom door when open blocks the door to the bedroom, so it was kind of awkward. Also for the size of the bathroom they could have added an extra door to it so it could be accessed from the living room without having to go through the bedroom for privacy. The bathroom had separate tub and standing shower which was a nice touch on the other hand. The room felt dated and a bit dirty, the TV in the bedroom is one of those old boxy TV's, and the sliding doors that lead to the balcony looked like they hadn't gotten a dose of windex in ages and the sliding screen was beat up. Then there's the noise. The room sits below the hotel's restaurant above it. They must have hardwood floors up there or something, because whatever the case, when any chairs or furniture moves, you definitely hear it throughout the room. This was particularly annoying considering the hotel's breakfast begins very early in the morning and what I imagine is the staff setting the restaurant up so you wake up to rumbles of furniture moving. This was the major complaint. For $260 a night, I feel like you definitely deserve better. Upon check-out, I noticed I was being charged for valet parking every night even though I don't own a car.

I booked through hotelclub.com, and received a pretty good rate for the week. So to begin: The Pros: 1. The hotel is in a great location. Little Italy is the best, the food and environment is great. It's close to the harbor and freeway access. It never took me more than 5 minutes to get anywhere from the freeway. It's close to downtown too, and SeaWorld isn't far either. The location is the best feature of this hotel. 2. The staff is very helpful. I never had a problem asking them for anything. I didn't even know I had breakfast vouchers, but they sure did tell me! The room was cleaned each day, and there was no worry about leaving things in the room. 3. The restaurant. The Glass Door, as it's called, was good. At least the breakfast was (we ate elsewhere during the day, since we were about). It wasn't your typical hotel breakfast of juice/coffee and pastries, it was two eggs, toast, potatoes, and choice of bacon or sausage. Which I thought was nice, since there aren't many places close by for breakfast. I'm sure lunch and dinner were just as good. 4. Did I mention the location? I don't think I'll stay anywhere else but in Little Italy in San Diego. The CONS: 1. The lobby and shared areas are nice. But the actual hallways and rooms have gone through a hasty remodel. If you're really picky, you might not like that. If you're spending a lot of time in your room, you might not like that. I noticed it and we didn't spend much time in the hotel, but I got over it. The room was clean, and that's what's really important. 2. The rooms amenities. We had the basic room (so I can only comment on that) and it didn't have a fridge or microwave. Disappointing considering the amount of food the Italian restaurants nearby like to serve. The tv was pretty old, probably as old as I am(22). The bed was very firm, even for me (i like a firm bed), and the pillows weren't very comfortable. The furniture is good, but the room is small so it can get tight. 3. Valet Parking. $14 a night. It's only a problem because it should be included or at least mentioned when looking for hotels. It's not as expensive as other hotels in downtown, but it is an extra fee that can add up. I didn't mind, because it is convenient, but I think It's a bit excessive since there aren't that many people at the hotel. I strongly believe that it should be included with the fare. Conclusion: I think that for a night, this isn't a bad hotel. If your planning to spend a while hear, I'd suggest not having a car because you really won't need it. You can walk nearly everywhere worth going, and if not the public transportation is very accessible. Would I recommend this hotel? I would if it's your first time in Little Italy and you don't have a car with you. You'd have to be an avid walker. If you want to spend more time here, some people would probably like their upscale rooms, but not me. I'm going to try another hotel in the area, that is just as close and still budget friendly. It's a good hotel, that could use some upgrades and changes that would probably make it a great hotel, i.e. a better tv, better pillows, and a reduced price valet parking.", "Date": "July 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prosser, Washington", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel in a great location.\u201d", "Author": "HR-Dana", "ReviewID": "UR70066794", "Content": "This was a fun hotel with a young energy vibe to it.

The driver was funny, knowledgeable, friendly and I'm sure he told the truth during half his stories even if I don't know which half!

The free wifi is centrally located and could not be picked up at the end of the hall where my room was located. The front desk provided a courtesy cable so I had internet, just not wireless. The hotel is constructed with several outside hallways/breezeways looking out onto interior parking. I would suggest requesting a 2nd floor and above room. If wireless is important, make sure to ask for a room toward the front or center of the hotel. The room was nice. The bed was a bit too firm for my tastes but was fine. There are no real refrigerators in the rooms - they are more like electric coolers. Mine never did work properly and smelled of rotten fish so I only opened that door once! The dinner in the restaurant was very good but the courtesy coupon breakfast left something to be desired. For some reason the cooks could never cook my eggs to order - four days in a row. I would definitely stay again and would not let the negatives detract from booking. The hotel is right in the middle of Little Italy.

If you are a single 30-something or younger, the \"Gaslamp\" and \"Old Town\" party hearty till-you-stagger districts are a short cab ride away, and besides - a cab is much better to avoid the DUI danger, as well as the $20 minimum parking lots over there. If your a bit beyond that age range (as we are) - Little Italy is walking distance charming, friendly, CLEAN, and has plenty of choices for cocktail conversation, Vino Fino exporation, and solidly good restaurants. The neighborhood is spotlessly maintained by the \"Little Italy Association\", whose workers and trucks are out and about every day. Don't miss the every Saturday 9am-1:30pm Farmers/Munchies Market on 3 blocks of Grape Street (2 blocks from the PV). Its delightful! Back to the PV - the rooms are actually larger than most cookie cutter establishments, and there is an artistic flair to the rooms that defies a category, but a welcome relief from the boring norm of most hotels. The rooftop lounge offers wonderful views of San Diego and the North harbor areas - a great place to sip a libation and make new friends. The Glass Door is a boutique Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner restaurant with a very interesting menu that ranges from regular fare to the exotic (and they do exotic well). Treat yourself to the fresh-made crab cakes and the Smoked Salmon Omlette. BTW - some of the package deals for the hotel include breakfast, which means the place gets swamped from around 9:45 - 11 am check out time, so be early or after that for best experience. The hotel does cater to private functions, so although there was boisterous sound from those celebrations on the \"outside\" of our north side guest room, the noise was cancelled as soon as the door closed. Oh - and a great bed too!

Our room was decent. They had recently remodeled and clearly didn't have time to do all the finish work.

Room was quiet, bed was comfortable, and bathroom was awkwardly large yet no counter space to set make-up, blow dryer, etc. PROS: The location of the hotel is excellent. Aside from being minutes from the San Diego International Airport, you can easily stroll 4-5 blocks west to the pier and see the many attractions or go one block west to the main strip of Little Italy where you will find pizza heaven @ Filippi's Pizza Grotto. The hotel offered free yoga classes on the roof deck - a very cool little area they host special events at when they're not using it as a yoga shack. The hotel also has a hip restaurant/bar with unbelievable views from the 5th floor balcony. Sunsets from the balcony are gorgeous. CON: Not quite finished room with cheap furnishings. Poorly designed bathroom with no counter space. Pay to park - albeit considerably less than surrounding hotels. And finally - my biggest issue was the sewer vents that are piped right next to the elevators, so every time you get on/off the elevator, you're greeted with the lovely smell of a sewer plant - YUCK!

After calling the front desk, had to lug everything back down for different room keys, then back up to a hopefully better room. Yes, the new one was made up, but I had serious doubts as to the cleanliness. Too many stains, spots, paint spatters, and overall shoddy construction. And the large floor to ceiling pasted-on graphic of a bikini clad 17-year-old did nothing to help the poorly thought-out decor. Basically, nothing looked quite clean enough to touch, so it was like camping without the tent or sleeping bag. It was quiet while I slept, though I saw plenty of partiers on my way in. In the morning, windows out the front looked over the parking area in the atrium space at the hotel's center, and windows on the other side overlooked the street.

My girlfriend and I decided to get away for one night, it was a last second decision. We booked a two-room suite with a balcony on their website. We were a little hesitant because of some of the negative reviews we read about, but we decided to give it a chance. We arrived on a Saturday morning and the person working valet was very welcoming, couldn't have been a nicer guy. We went to check-in but the person at the front desk had trouble finding my reservation. This was probably the only sour part of my whole experience. But since I travel a lot, I always bring my confirmation number with me. Once I gave him my the number, he was able to locate my reservation. The person at the front desk said that they have a suite ready for me but if I wanted to wait an hour, I could get a suite on a higher floor which means we'd have a better view of the city/harbor. My girlfriend and I were delighted by the option and agreed to wait. They overheard us talking about where to get lunch in the area and they quickly suggested their restaurant on the 4th floor called The Glass Door. We got there in time for brunch and the food was amazing. It was so good that we ended up going back to the restaurant later that evening for dinner!!! You have to check out the restaurant if you're ever staying at the hotel or in the area. It has great food, great staff, nicely poured drinks and a romatic view. The suite was a little smaller than I expected, but it was plenty of room for two people. The bed was comfortable, the room was clean, the lighting was perfect, the balcony view was great, bathroom was neat and everything just seemed great. One of the best things about Porto is it's location. My girlfriend and I never had to use our car while we were there. Everything we needed was within walking distance. Just right down the street is Little Italy where you can find great Italian food and shops. We went downtown and it only cost us an $8 cab ride. The bottom line is this... The Porto Vista Hotel is a great place to getaway with your boyfriend/girlfriend/husband/wife. It's in a quiet part of the city, but seriously close to a lot of great places. I really don't have any complaints with the hotel. The best gesture they made was pushing my check-out time to a later time TWICE. I called once the night before and they gave me a 12:00pm check-out time. I called again the next morning and asked for an even later time and they pushed it back to 1:00pm. That really said a lot about the staff and how much they're aiming to please their guests. Trust me, take it from me, someone who travels a lot. Most hotels will turn you down if you try suggesting a late check-out twice. I've even burned turned down before the first time I've asked at some places. This place is almost perfect. Only thing holding it back was the size of the suite and it did not have room service, but that's not going to prevent me from ever going back.

Also we were supposed to get free parking that I forgot about until our third night of street parking. They said I should have reminded them. Lesson learned on my end. But still frustrating. The room was kinda small - European hotel room small. Not sure comforter was washed. Could have just been the fabric? The tub drain was slow.

I can usually sleep well even with surrounding noise, but I got virtually no sleep here. The worst part of the experience was when we went to check out at 4.10am.

Little Italy has beautiful architecture, very friendly people, and of course great food. There is a small neighborhood park right behind the hotel that is awesome. Very family friendly and priceless for our 2 year old. Every Saturday has a street market one block from the hotel--fresh paninis, bread, fruit, etc. Hotel: Still under construction, but nothing too major. Restaurant and jacuzzi are still not open. Construction noise during the day is not too bad, turn on the AC and you can barely hear it. Though my husband was more bothered by it than I was. Elevator: So slow we never used it in 4 days, though it is brand new. Construction workers utilized it so maybe that is why it was so slow. Lobby: Absolutely gorgeous. One small room with one computer for guest use, though I was told the internet wasn't working on it since there were so many people logged on to their wireless. Manager: Extremeley helpful and sincere. Upon check in we were given a room that didn't have a view of the harbor. I asked if there was something available with a view and was immediately given a suite with balcony and view of harbor and the hotel was completely booked. (We checked in around 3:30 pm) Rooms: Get one on the north or west side of the hotel and on the 3rd, 4th, or 5th floor. The west side might only have the more expensive suites, but our room was on the third floor, north side and had a balcony with a view of the harbor and the price was for a queen, 2 people. Since it faced north it also had a view of all of the airplanes landing--our 2 year old LOVED watching them and they are very frequent during the day and almost non existant during the night. The plane noise never bothered us. We were the first guests to stay in our particular room since it was completed so everything was brand new. Windows open for fresh air, refrigerator, wet bar. There were 2 tv's, one in the bedroom and one in the living room--not very many channels to choose from, but if you are in San Diego then chances are you won't be sitting in your room watching tv. Some noise from neighbors was heard, but nothing out of the ordinary for a hotel. Bath and Body Works soaps are very nice too. Note for families with young children--some windows have a low sill and open with only a screen that could easily be pushed out--very dangerous when you are 3-5 floors up. We kept those windows locked. Maid Service: Terrible. We didn't have any for 2 out of our 4 nights. We had to go to the front desk to get towels, etc. Luckily the front desk employees were always very nice and helpful. One day I was in the room and a few minutes after I put up the do not disturb sign I heard the maid cart pass our room. I opened the door and asked if they could just take the trash and give us towels and he said \"no, you had the card up\"....not the best customer service. Shuttle: Terrible. I read previous reviews saying it was great. Not our experience. There was a large convention while we were visiting so the shuttle was available only for them, not other guests. After the convention was over, we wanted a shuttle to the zoo but we were told that it left the hotel at 9 am---the zoo opens at 9 am and if you are not there early you will be waiting in a very long line. We asked if they could make an exception since the shuttle was just sitting there at 830, but nope--it leaves at 9. Funny, just the day before we saw the shuttle give a ride to 3 people to the zoo after they asked at 830. Parking: FREE. Unheard of in San Diego. Overall: Very helpful, nice employees at the front desk and very good manager. Great location. Very family friendly but don't stay here if you are looking for a \"sit by the pool\" type of vacation. The construction is finishing up and they are still ironing out glitches, but if we go back to San Diego, there is no question that this is where we will stay. Remember, get a room on the west or north side on the 3rd, 4th, or 5th floor--the closer to the west side, the better.", "Date": "June 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Crestline, CA", "Title": "\u201cHad a great stay!\u201d", "Author": "ajyacht", "ReviewID": "UR15680727", "Content": "Stayed there after reading a bad review on the first hotel I had booked.

I had to ask if they were going to have someone bring our bags down since they couldn't let us use a cart, and was put on hold for a few minutes while they scrambled around in the lobby. My room was overlooking them and I could see them all talking to each other. I really don't see why they didn't just do what any other hotel would do and let us use the stupid luggage cart.

Motel 8 currently being renovated and taken over by Porto Vista mangement so half of the reception area works for Motel 8 and the other for the Porto Vista. Since I booked with Porto Vista, I got a new fairly large newly renovated room which was clean and well decorated (Italy theme) with a half fridge and microwave in room, desk, eating table as well as free shuttle service. Although construction of the other half still going on as of Feb. 2007, it starts around 9:00 am weekday so I was already out and about and the noise wasn't an issue for me where the room was located. The outside of hotel says Motel 8 and Porto Vista which may be confusing and the shared reception is on the second floor near the parking area which was hard to find at first. Otherwise, location is very convenient to Little Italy restaurants, the pier (15-20 minutes walk) and airport.

This property is going to be under construction for the next 12 months according to a flyer in the room. The new section that just opened is to the right of Super 8; another new section is now under construction to the left of Super 8 and then Super 8 section will be renovated...and it needs it! If you stay at Super 8, ask for a room on the south side of the building away from the construction. I made reservations directly with the hotel & then changed from Super 8 to Porto Vista--staff was very helpful & gave me a good rate. The room is quite large (I think it's the King Executive Suite) with a small frig & micro as well as free wireless that was very easy to connect to. The bathroom is large & well-appointed although the lighting could be brighter. It would also be nice to have a place in the bathroom to hang clothing on. The decor is underwhelming but I wasn't in the room enough to care. The hotel is very near the airport & not far from the flight path but the Porto Vista seems quite well-insulated from the noise; the train tracks are also 2-3 blocks away. I wasn't awakened by either airplane or train noise. I've been attending a conference at the Marriott next to the Convention Center & it was a safe, pleasant 15-minute walk away. Little Italy is a block away (go to Filippi's Pizza Grotto for great pizza & yummy sausage--get there early or you may have a wait--it's a very popular place). The staff have been very helpful. They called a cab for me today & when I told them about 2 problems in the room they were both fixed before 5 PM. I think some of the kinks associated with a new building are still being worked out. The hotel will eventually have a roof-top lap pool, sundecks & a restaurant. All the more reason why the Porto Vista will be my hotel of choice in San Diego. It's nice finding something affordable near downtown!

The best part of this hotel is its location, you are steps away from Little Italy which has a string of nice restaurants, and you can easily walk anywhere downtown.

It is located in Little Italy with alot of great Italian restaurants nearby. It is also located directly near Interstate 5, basically one exit away from San Diego International Airport, and a nice catholic church is a block away. The location is great. They have free parking, although a tight squeeze I never had a problem parking my rental car. I did not bother trying the continental breakfast, so I am unable to comment. You do feel somewhat safe here because in order to get up to floors 2-4, you have to use your room key. They are currently undergoing a 45 room addition, so it can be noisy from all the construction. I was up and out both days prior to the construction beginning, so no complaints about that. Would I stay here again? Maybe, if I was unable to find more higher end accomodations at a reasonable price. All in all, not a bad place. Oh, and the prior comment is correct.

You're within walking distance of the bay and Little Italy. The Bad: The landing pattern for the airport is almost directly above the hotel. If you're a light sleeper, even the white noise from the old fan in the room won't be enough. The continental breakfast was pitiful compared to others we've had. We ended up walking about six blocks to Denny's for breakfast. The Ugly: When we arrived, our room was poorly cleaned and the quality of housekeeping did not improve over the time we were there. We had two rooms booked; one had problems with the bathroom. Overall, I would not return to this hotel. As stated earlier, it is an OLD Super 8 that really needs some work done.
