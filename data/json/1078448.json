First, the view from the rooftop terrace is unlike any I have seen elsewhere in the world. Due to the height of the building, the terrace offers a completely unobstructed view of Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque that is spectacular. If the weather is not cooperative, the restaurant just below the terrace with floor to ceiling windows offers equally impressive views. Equally important is the location of the hotel. We literally walked everywhere. The tram runs very close to the Adamar but we did not board it once as you can walk to all attractions (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Cisterns, turkish baths, Grand Bazaar, spice market, multiple shopping & restaurant districts) including the Galata district across the Golden Horn. Half the fun of any trip is walking around and experiencing the local culture and the Adamar is perfectly situated to do just that. The hotel itself is a fantastic operation. The rooms were always very clean, the bathrooms are almost palatial compared to standard European bathrooms. The staff at the front desk, namely Bulut, were always incredibly helpful and never lead us astray in terms of restaurants & shopping. My father's camera broke on the trip and Bulut actually brought in his own personal camera and offered it to us to use for the remainder of the trip. The included breakfast buffet is impressive as well. Can't complain about eating eggs & sausage while looking at Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque!

The tram stop is also close by for trips further afield. The hotel is clean, staff friendly and the rooftop restaurant provides some of the best views around, being able to see over to both the Hagia Sofia & Golden Horn sides of Sultanahmet. We only took breakfast in the hotel, which was an acceptable buffet. We booked a family room which was only just large enough for the 4 of us, with our two teenage children sleeping on temporary beds which were jammed closely together.

All of them are the same unless you book a better category. Anyway the room was very comfy, clean and modern! I have read a comment here of some traveller that he couldnt sleep at night bcz of the street noise. Well, you should understand that you gonna visit Istanbul, and all oriental cities as Istanbul are full of noise, car beeping and non-sleeping citizens at night. The breakfast was good. Someone said the food was the same every day. Well, what do you expect? Its a normal turkish buffet full of cheese, pastry, olives, vegetables, fruit salad etc.. Everybody says the toproof restaurant has an amazing view to the city - its a truth, the view is a breathtaking. I do advise this hotel to stay. I really enjoyed it! It has all the necessary conditions for a comfy accomodation.

The Adamar is in a great location and walkable to Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Cistern, Grand Bazaar, and many other spots. It is very close to some good restaurants. The photos on the website don't lie- the rooftop view is amazing! The breakfast is more than adequate with a wide selection of hot and cold items. The service at the front desk was also great. The staff stored our luggage when we traveled to Cappadocia and booked a daytrip to Ephesus and a dance show for us. The rooms were on the small side, but bigger than a lot of European hotel rooms, and clean. They were simple but fine...UNLESS you really value your sleep! (The negatives) The rooms are LOUD. During the first part of our trip we were on the 2nd floor. The call to prayer never bothered us. It was the horrible street noise with buses and honking at all hours. And the plumbing. We could hear showers and toilets several floors above us. On our return after Cappadocia we stayed on the 5th floor and it was just as loud. You can hear every door open and close all night long. And we aren't light sleepers! Also as several other reviewers have mentioned, even when you request a \"family room\", you may get two single beds. We did and the only solution was to push the beds together, which wasn't really an option with the design of the room. Also, oddly, on the 2nd floor our shower had a floor to ceiling window in it. Since we were situated over a busy street, it was really a peep show when we showered.

During our stay, it was reported on BBC News24 that the Chief Executive of Tripadvisor had advised users of this site to focus on \"average\" reviews and to pay rather less attention to horror stories or extremely glowing reports. So, in an attempt to make it clear that this review - though undoubtedly in the \"glowing\" category - is honest and objective, I shall begin with the relatively negative aspects. Four of us travelled together and we stayed in two standard double rooms. As other visitors to this hotel have previously reported, the rooms are really very small, as are the bathrooms. They are, however, immaculately clean and stylishly decorated. They have up-to-date TV sets (with a good selection of channels) and they are well lit. It is fair to state, however, that the Adamar also offers deluxe rooms and suites, which are undoubtedly more spacious, although I did not actually see inside any of them. The only other slightly negative aspect is that drinks at the hotel are rather more expensive than they are at any of the very nearby restaurants and cafes. Everything else about this hotel, however, is simply delightful. It is located in a fairly busy but relatively up-market part of the city. There are tram stops within easy walking distance. All of the major sites of Istanbul are within easy walking distance. The food is very good and varied. All parts of the Adamar are immaculately clean and well-decorated. But the Adamar's major selling point has simply got to be the rooftop terrace and restaurant, with the most stunning views of the city that you can possibly imagine - especially at night, when the Blue Mosque and other major buildings are illuminated...and they are not on the distant horizon, they are incredibly nearby. Just magical! As for the Adamar's staff, I would find it difficult to overstate just how friendly and helpful they were throughout our brief stay. A single example of their attentiveness should be enough, I hope, to make the point. We stayed in Istanbul for 8 days. Not having previously visited the city, we arranged our trip in such a way that we would change hotels midway through in order to familiarise ourselves with two different areas. We made the staff at the Adamar's reception desk aware of our plans and asked them to book a taxi for us to the new venue, which, of course, they did. What they also did, however, was to instruct a member of their staff to accompany us in the taxi to ensure that we we were taken directly to where we wished to go and that we were charged the correct (very cheap) fare. When we arrived, he insisted on carrying our luggage into the new hotel and introduced us (very nicely) at the reception desk. He then - refusing to accept a tip - walked back to the Adamar. Should we decide to pay a return visit to Istanbul we would not even consider staying anywhere but the Adamar.

Being just one floor above street level made it a bit noisy--but not in a way that caused any distress. I slept so well in the comfortable bed--noise was not really a problem. The room was quite gorgeous and clean--and it had the nicest shower with the best water pressure of any place I'd stayed in Europe! So nice after spending my days walking around the city!

Both evenings, there were large groups, so I was a bit worried about poor service since I was solo--but I still received tremendous service! The view from the rooftop was amazing, as was the little cafe/sitting area on the roof. So nice to sit with my tea and my Kindle one afternoon, relaxing after a day of sightseeing. The Adamar is perfectly located close to the major attractions and lots of cute little cafes. I especially enjoyed the House of Medusa cafe.

Given that I had chosen this hotel based on its high ratings from TripAdvisor, I immediately realized that management was doing its bit to manage its image. That said I would probably return to this hotel if I wanted to stay in Istanbul again in the Sultanahmet region, i.e., close to the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia and other primary tourist attractions. A little background on my visit. I and a friend were stopping in Istanbul mid way on an overland rail journey from London to Tehran. This involved our arriving a little after 8:00 a.m. on a Tuesday morning and leaving just before midnight the following night. As a result I had booked one room for three nights in order to insure that we had a place to crash and clean up for our entire day and a half in Istanbul and a second room for one night for my friend to sleep in. Here are my pro's and con's on this property. Pro's The hotel manager, Serkan Dogan, was extremely responsive during the reservations process which was much appreciated. The promised complimentary car and driver were duly waiting for us when our train arrived at the Sirkeci train station some 45 minutes late. The staff were cordial and friendly. The rooms were not as small as I had fear and the bathrooms perfectly acceptable. The restaurant on the roof provided a decent breakfast (which was included) and served a very decent lunch. The view from the restaurant (including an open air dining area on the roof itself) were totally spectacular. At \u00e2\u201a\u00ac89 a night (even considering that I had to book one room for three full nights), the price was fairly reasonably. Con's We had checked into the room that we had reserved for three full days upon arrival. When the time came that afternoon for my friend to check into the second room which we had reserved for one night only, we discovered that the hotel had overbooked and that the second room was no longer available. This happened despite the fact that we had specifically reserved two rooms for the Tuesday night over three months earlier and we had even confirmed our intent to check into the second room later in the day when we checked into our first room on Tuesday morning. While I considered this overbooking unacceptable, my friend was happy to be transferred across the street to a lesser hotel rather than make an issue of this. They offered no concession or discount in exchange for our willingness to help them overcome their own mistake. In addition, we had about four days worth of laundry done by the hotel; the total charge was about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac120 which, in my book, is pretty expensive for wash and fold.", "Date": "April 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201ccannot recommend the Adamar highly enough\u201d", "Author": "chatter2food", "ReviewID": "UR62094806", "Content": "Our first trip to Istanbul - long awaited so we chose the Adamar based on reviews and paid for the sea view.

It had fantastic reviews on both sites and so we were not expecting to have any problems. However, unfortunately, our stay did not get off to a good start as we were informed when we first arrived that the hotel had over-booked itself and so we would have to stay in a different hotel close by for 2 nights (50% of our trip). The hotel had apparently failed to see the fax Expedia sent through with our booking. The hotel did at least accept that it was their mistake rather than try to blame it on Expedia, but it was a very disappointing start to our stay when we had spent so long researching hotels and chosen to stay at the Adamar specifically. We were placed in the Hotel Le Piano for 2 nights which was fine and well managed, but we felt probably a slightly cheaper hotel. When we finally moved across to the Adamar after two nights, we were shown two rooms to choose from. We chose room 501 which was a small room but had great views of the bosphorous. I think the hotel probably did give us the best of their standards rooms but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they gave us a room upgrade to compensate for our inconvenience as we were not offered one of the panoramic circular rooms which are clearly the more expensive rooms. Furthermore, after complaining upon our initial arrival we were offered a free airport transfer for our return flight. However, when it came to the end of our stay and they realised we were flying from the further away airport of Istanbul Sabina gocen rather than Ataturk this offer was withdrawn. The hotel did offer us free dinner at the hotel but we had found the breakfast at the hotel average so did not particularly want to have dinner at the hotel as well. We never met the manager of the hotel, despite having asked to see him upon on our initial arrival. I would have expected a manager to personally apologise for such an error as it is a small hotel, rather than leave his staff to deal with the problem. I am sure you can have a good stay at the Adamar as it has a great location and fantastic views and some good staff such as the waitress at breakfast. However, perhaps as the hotel is not used to dealing with unhappy customers it did not manage to do enough to win us over after making such a big initial mistake of placing us in a different hotel for half of our trip. Having had to complain at the start of our stay and then be dissatisfied when the offer of a complimentary airport transfer was withdrawn created an uncomfortable atmosphere between us and the staff which affected the pleasantness of our stay for the 2 nights we were actually in the Adamar.

This is a small corner Boutique Hotel in Istanbul about 1 block from the Blue Mosque and near everything else you need to see in Istanbul. It is walking distance to the Grand Bazaar, Spice Bazaar, St. Sophia, The T.Palace, and shops and restaurants. We arrived in Istanbul via cruise ship NCL Jade (cruise from Athens to Istanbul - I do not recommend NCL, that's another review) and took a cab from the pier to the hotel at an extremely high rate of 25Euros. Be careful and settle on an amount for any taxi before you board the cab. In general all businesses including taxis want Euros not Turkish Liras. Some take USD. It should not cost more than 40TL from port to this hotel. If you believe you are overcharged, do not pay the driver until you reach your hotel and ask the front desk clerk, Halil - a wonderful man - to restate your fare. Turkish businessmen are extremely pushy and intimidating. Do not fall for it. Upon checking out, Have Halil call a legitimate taxi for you. The hotel is small with approximately 6 rooms on each floor (5floors) but quite cozy and very very friendly. The entire staff is at your service at all times! We arrived before the 3pm check in time but Halil had the bellhop take and secure our bags until the first room would be available for us around 12noon. Excellent service. They offered apple tea, internet useage and a comfortable lobby to wait. (Free WiFi in all rooms - ask for user id and password) We chose to walk the town a bit where Halil directed us. Halil does his best in speaking English and Spanish and any other language that may present itself. Our room was #504 - a King standard room. It was small in size but comfortable for two people. Flat screen TV with good selection of multi-lingual channels, minibar, safe and a nice size bathroom. One and only complaint was the very hard beds. A suggestion to this hotel is that they place featherbeds on the beds to make them more comfortable. Upon our entry to our room, we noticed the lock did not work and was assured it would be corrected immediately - it was within the next hour. The bathroom contained toiletries such as the usual body and hair washes, lotion, sewing kit, two toothpaste and toothbrush kits, caps, soaps, etc. Bathroom is of normal size with hand-held shower option. Very clean. Shoe polish supplies and slippers were also provided in the closet. The elevator is really very small and tight - only two people and a bag fit. Hotel restaurant is on the 6th floor - Panoramic Restaurant. This restaurant has a beautiful view of the entire city - especially of the Blue Mosque. They also have a rooftop area that was closed due to cold weather. We had breakfast daily here ((ask for a latte instead of the regular coffee - this and breakfast included in rate) and dinner twice - by candlelight and star-twinkling ceiling lights. Food and wine are excellent. Menus available in three languages, Turkish, Spanish and English. The servers are great and friendly! A recommendation regarding the Grand Bazaar - it is very hectic to buy there as the vendors start off with a ridiculous high price and then finally end up lowering it to your offering price. Some are very rude and insult you - don't take it personally, just walk away. It appears they will chase you down and accept your offer. Watch out for the stories of the \"inexpensive leather\" accessories. You can buy leather goods cheaper in the states. Negotiate these prices down the the bear bones. Also, I found the Spice Bazzar a better place to purchase anything. They have all that the Grand Bazaar has with the exception of gold shops. The gold is extremely expensive and they ask in Euros. Save some money visit the Grand Bazaar but buy at the Spice Bazaar - you can haggle at the Spice Bazaar too although they are pretty set on their prices.

To try: Inciralti Kebap ve Pide Salonu - a small restaurant around the corner to the right, with excellent lentil soup, bread, meze and dessert, all very affordable. To avoid: the Sultanahmet Hamami - although the actual services were OK, the place had a creepy vibe, someone was smoking near the entrance, and would not recommend going alone.(A friend and I had found this one on our own).

It has a soul.
